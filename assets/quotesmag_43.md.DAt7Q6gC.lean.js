True, at times de la Pena seems to lay it on a bit thick -- but prejudice is the theme of her book, after all, and for those who haven't experienced homophobia and racism first-hand, subtleties may well be lost in any case. What I most admire in de la Pena's work is her willingness to deal in ambiguities; &quot;Latin Satins&quot; doesn't end with a neat resolution, but leaves the reader hoping that the protagonist will overcome the struggles before her. A very interesting, very moving early novel."},{"Title":"Latin Satins (Djuna Books)","review":"This is not a review, but a comment by the author, Terri de la Pena. I just logged on to see if a synopsis existed for my forthcoming novel &quot;Faults,&quot; (Alyson, 1999) and was surprised to see that &quot;Latin Satins&quot; is still evoking comments five years after its publication. No, it was never intended to be a young adult novel. Much to my surprise, the New York Public Library listed the book on its recommended list for young adults, which caused me a certain amount of pride and consternation. I certainly do not relish being the target of readers who think I would direct my fiction to young readers. And I'm not a beginning writer, either. Have been writing since I was 13 and am now 52!

But it is, however, interesting and articulate. Including the foreword (by Colin Robinson of the Institute for Economic Affairs) and the postscript (by Martin Feldstein), the actual text of the whole work is less than thirty pages so it will require only a short investment of time, which is welcome news to anyone reading it as a student or using it for a research project. Certainly, this is a Eurosceptic piece that outlines Portillo's views on why a single currency is not prudent and how it negatively impacts democracy. This is made quite clear. But it's more than that. It also outlines the reasons why people feel frustrated with government, e.g. they feel they are not being heard, they feel their government is detached from them or too far away geographically, they feel they are not accurately represented, etc. The back cover of the book lists ten contentions made by Portillo and these make for an even faster summary of the work if you are in a major rush to absorb its information. I believe this would be very useful to anyone working on economic or political research regarding the Euro, current affairs in the UK, or even the underlying reasons behind political unrest. I felt it was a good value for the time and money spent."},{"Title":"A Boy, a Ship, and a War","review":"I think that perhaps the best place to begin is the part of the story that comes after the story. Paul Harvey used to call this \`the rest of the story'.\\"On the evening of July 7, 2010, my wife Marie and I were traveling in New York State between Sidney and Unadilla on Route 7. We stopped at a small place called Country Motel to spend the night. Both Marie and I went into the office where we were greeted by an older lady.\\"Can I help you?\\"\\"Yes, we would like a room,\\" I said.She looked up at my hat and asked \\"Were you in World War II? My husband was in that war. He was a Marine on a LST in Okinawa. His ship was hit by a Kamikaze and he had to jump into the water. He was in there for hours!\\"\\"Don't tell me the LST was number 884!\\" I exclaimed.She was shocked. She said, \\"How did you know that number?\\"I explained, \\"My ship picked up all the Marines from that ship.\\"(Excerpt taken from The Tidewater Review, November 10, 2010)That is the epilogue to the story, and it took place sixty-five years later.The story begins in December, 1943, when high school drop-out Claud Aldrich, whose availability and age did not go unnoticed by Uncle Sam, was drafted into military service. Claud wanted to be a Marine, but the drafting quota for Marines was full. Given the choice, Claud chose Navy. What follows is a journal of the life of a seasick young man in a tin can called the USS Van Valkenburgh, a brand spanking new Destroyer named for the Captain of the USS Arizona who dent down with his ship in the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor the morning December 7th, 1941. It is the almost daily journal of his life as Torpedo's Mate Third Class in a voyage that began and ended in South Carolina, and records a journey of over 75,000 miles, two oceans, thousands of ships and aircraft, hundreds of thousands of men, and the largest sea battle in history.It is told from the point of view not of a professional journalist, novelist or historian, but rather from the perspective of a brave, if frightened young man who gave over two years of his young life in defense of his country in the cramped quarters of a floating speck on an endless sea.I'm a book critic. It is my job to attack a book, whether novel or non-fiction, and scour it to pick at the nits. Aldrich made my job easy. He is not a polished professional writer. But a funny thing happened on the way to the deadline. I started to see a war waged before my birth through the eyes of a man who survived it. Suddenly, page by page, the nits became less and less an issue as I got caught up in a mind game where my heart was begging for T/M 3c Claud Aldrich to survive, even as my head kept reminding me that of course he survived. He wrote the bloody book, you fool!I found myself finishing the short seventy-nine page read in about an hour, and discovered when I reached the end that my eyes were leaking and I wanted nothing more than to stand up, reach out, take Torpedo's Mate Third Class Claud Aldrich, USNR, American Hero by the hand and thank him.By the way, \`Bob', the marine rescued in the excerpt at the beginning of the review? His rescue is on page thirty-five."},{"Title":"A Boy, a Ship, and a War","review":"Then get this book.It is about WWII, but it is written by an 18 year old boy (at the time) and it is eye-opening to someone who might think war is to be glorified.Claud tells his first-hand account of battles like Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

I am assuming this is a self published book, with little or no editing.

I think I know author from Norfolk Virginia, and was given a copy of his book . This personal account of the war and dangers of the United States and the ever present danger of being another casualty was always a threat yet the author and others fought bravely for the United States of America.

Some other reviewers have been put off (respectfully in their comments) by spelling, format, the telegraphic style. Those characteristics are as the reviewers describe. I do not find them to be flaws but, rather, to have been why I found the book to be riveting. The man who was the boy on the ship in the war has written it as he remembers without any glib phrasings or polish. I have read a number of diaries by Civil War boys/soldiers and this book has the same staccato flow and idiosyncratic spellings.

This books helps to answer these questions.

In the same way, we don't find a notice about the LEWIS &amp; CLARK expedition although not only both leaders but all their men wrote their diary (this means a vast whole of valuable texts about the Missouri regions in the beginning of the 19th-Century). This book is the first one to guide us in Western literature, its writers, its works and its subjects (including searchers like AUDUBON or PARKMAN); but there are very unfortunate blanks. So, it contains a &quot;Timeline of Frontier Literature&quot;, from 1532 to 1996 (a good choise, but no complete list), an alphabetic list of &quot;Major works&quot;, another list by authors (both incomplete in the same way). The final Bibliography is very interesting for its opens on further researches. This Encyclopedia is certainly usefull, but must be followed by a new one more elaborate.

Good for someone who reads a lot and sometimes forgets not to SPEED read. Dickens is too delicious to speed read, anyway."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"All of Dickens' books display elements of humour but often intermixed with drama and tragedy. Pickwick stands alone (I think) as a wholly comic masterpiece. As Mr Pickwick and his friends travel round England to make reports back to The Pickwick Club, Dickens introduces us to a huge cast of characters from the cryptic Mr Jingle to that great philosopher of the people Sam Weller.As we journey along, Dickens satirises almost every aspect of society - class, marriage, politics, the law - all themes which he plays out again in more serious terms in his later works. There are laugh out loud moments aplenty but as always Dickens' observations are insightful and thought provoking too. I particularly enjoy the election campaign - much of the absurdity of it still resonates today.The Nonesuch editions are a joy to possess. Such great writing deserves a quality production and the look and feel of these books is lovely. The large pages mean that the original illustrations can be seen in all their detailed glory, and Nonesuch also include all the introductions written for the various editions. And of course a built-in ribbon bookmark - already I'm halfway back to a more leisurely and cultured time.I've always hankered after a complete set of leather-bound Dickens and when I win the lottery will no doubt acquire one. But in the meantime, Nonesuch are providing a quality experience at an affordable price and, much though I love my Kindle, sometimes reading a well-produced hardback is the only way to go.

It's about a group of five friends led by Samuel Pickwick, who go on a series of adventures to various cities and towns around London.

Dickens is SO funny. People think he's boring and heady and stuffy, but he's downright hysterical.I've seen a lot of other reviews that provide better summaries than I could write, so I won't go into that. I'll be content with finishing up by saying how much I absolutely adore Sam Weller. If he were a real person, I'd make him be my friend forever and always.

Being appreciative, I have looked for other items at Amazon."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I read this novel in the complete Dickens, but am reviewing the novel alone.It's the first novel by Charles Dickens. It's not as mature, accomplished and serious as the later novels which we were assigned to read in some English class.It tells stories about a retired businessman named Pickwick who has a club devoted to him, though we're never told why or what it does, and Dickens abandons the club very early on. Instead, several members, young friends of Pickwick's, go on various travels and adventures with him.He tells the story as the Author as God, making a lot of observations on the foibles, arrogance and hypocrisies of people, which Dickens had a good eye for.The story itself is not strongly plotted. Things just happen one after the other.There's also a lot of satire, especially directed at lawyers. Don't think hating lawyers is anything new! Dickens obviously didn't like them either.Approach this with a light heart, enjoying the look back at people and their problems in the period without expecting great literature."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Charles Dickens wrote The Pickwick Papers in his early 20s, but the writing is first rate and as witty as any seasoned author could have done in his place! Like many of Dickens's works, Pickwick was published in monthly installments, or \\"numbers\\" as they were called then. Although Dickens originally intended to end the story at the twentieth number, the popularity of the series (and the resultant income) convinced Dickens to double the length to forty numbers. The end result is a large offering that'll take you a while to get through (~750 pages in the excellent Penguin edition, which I read).Despite its length, Pickwick never tries your patience. It's delightfully humorous from beginning to end. Samuel Pickwick is the bumbling, middle-aged, wealthy namesake of this novel. He's the leader of a small group of single men that gets into all sorts of mischief, both physical and social. Booze is rampant. Apparently liquor back then was much more a part of daily life than today; everywhere these guys go they party and get drunk. They get into trouble with the law, women, unsavory characters, and more.Characterization is superb. This is one of the few novels I've read for which I can actually say that I got to know the characters. In most books I've read, the characters remain two-dimensional and the plot is what carries the story. In Pickwick, the *characters* are the essence of the story and the novel wouldn't be memorable at all if a lesser author were attempting to breathe life into these people.The Penguin edition includes a decent collection of endnotes to help explain unfamiliar portions of the text. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few words and concepts peculiar to early 19th century England that I didn't grasp. This edition also has maps of southern England and a key to the specific locations that the Pickwickians visit. In addition, two appendices reprint some of the announcements and prefaces that Dickens wrote in relation to the work.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy classic literature! Dickens's later works overshadow this gem due to their maturity, but Pickwick beats them all in enthusiasm, humor, and wit."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This edition (ASIN B002RKSXJQ) is poorly formatted.

Either that, or Dickens is more post-modern than I thought, trailing off (with no punctuation) in the middle of a sentence.Amazon needs to do some quality control on this edition, and remove it from the store. There are plenty of others, why waste our time by listing inferior product?"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can duplicate this feat today.\\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is one of Dickens's earliest works, written when the author was a mere twenty-four years old. You wouldn't know his age by reading the story, though. \\"Pickwick\\" is a work that delivers healthy doses of sophisticated humor, keen observations on pressing social issues, romance, and a mature knowledge of human behavior. It's of course fiction, although Dickens presents the story as a true series of events documented by the \\"Pickwick Club,\\" a social organization founded by retired businessman and all around merry fellow Samuel Pickwick. In the 1820s, Pickwick and several friends embark on a series of journeys through Southern England, a journey that lasts for roughly two years. Ostensibly, the businessman and his fellows take the trips to learn more about their country. Instead, their travels turn into a series of often hilarious events mixed with a few serious scrapes. Pickwick must constantly save individuals from the machinations of one Alfred Jingle, an itinerant scalawag with a penchant for wooing women for their money. In between these adventures, our hero must contend with a lawsuit filed by a former female employee who thought he wanted to marry her, save his friends from numerous imbroglios involving members of the opposite sex, survive a stay in a debtor's prison, and live through a couple hundred other adventures both major and minor.If I had to list one overarching theme I enjoyed most about \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" it's got to be the humor. This book is one of the funniest things I've read in ages. We're talking laugh out loud and laughing later when remembering scenes from the book funny. Much of the humor centers on Pickwick's manservant Sam Weller, a guy prone to uttering some of the most hilarious sayings you'll likely see in any book. Weller's father is even more amusing, and when father and son sit down to write a letter to a lovely young woman who's caught Sam's eye, well, prepare to hold your sides. Also worth a belly laugh or two is the chapter where Pickwick and his friends visit the town of Eatanswill in time to witness the results of a contentious local election. Dickens's observations about party politics and media manipulation are not only highly amusing, but also relevant to our own age. And who can forget the courtroom scenes where the lawyer makes Pickwick, this kindly old gentleman who wouldn't hurt a fly, look like an absolute monster? I could go on and on. If you read this book without cracking up, check your pulse because you're probably dead.Another element of the book I enjoyed concerns Dickens's ability to write scenes that simply overflow with the joy of living. A lengthy chapter describing Pickwick's stay with some country friends over Christmas serves as an excellent example. The sheer bliss of this part of the book is infectious, as Dickens makes us marvel at the simple delight of spending a few days in the company of good friends, good food, and good entertainment. On the other hand, the author isn't above indulging in an activity he's become famous for, namely showing the reader the depths of human suffering. There is far less misery in \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" than there is in \\"Oliver Twist,\\" to cite one example, but it's still here. The debtor's prison in which Pickwick stays for a time provides the author with a perfect forum for attacking England's tradition of imprisoning those unfortunate souls who cannot pay their creditors. I marvel at how Dickens can balance these two extremes in the space of a single novel. In this way, \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" manages to encompass life in both its good and bad aspects.I read the Penguin Classics edition of \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" and I'm glad I did. The supplementary material is copious and helpful more often than not. I didn't care much for the introduction from Robert L. Patten, however, which I thought tried to read too much into the story. I did appreciate the footnotes that help explain the English geography, slang, and popular culture references found throughout the story. Further material provides information on the three illustrators who worked on the story, biographical details of Dickens's life, and even maps tracing Pickwick's myriad travels through the English countryside. Reading \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" makes me realize that I've neglected this author's works for far too long. I can't praise this book enough; it's that entertaining and that good. Give it a go as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"It's free - that's the major plus of this edition.

I agree with the reviewer who said that it was as if Dickens had a million jokes that he wanted to get off of his chest. And such wonderful characters! The last part of the book though is more about Mr. Pickwick himself than about the club. He also becomes less of a doofus and more of a lovealbe and sympathetic character as the novel progresses. If you are ever down and feeling depressed then this is the book to read.Sam Weller is one of Dickens greatest characters, the book really comes into its own when he becomes Mr.Pickwicks servent."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Note: this novel is available for download from several sites because it is out of copyright. The Feedbooks site (a dot com) and the Project Gutenberg site (a dot org) come to mind.The Pickwick Papers is Charles Dickens' first novel (originally serialized like his subsequent works) and one I heartily recommend to those who have never read him before. It is very funny at intervals but as the work progresses, it becomes less disjoint and the last twenty percent of it is magnificent.The premise is that Mr. Pickwick, a slightly buffoonish man of science, sheltered by his wealth from many of the real ways of the world, convinces his eponymous Pickwickian Society to inculcate a new branch, to aid with the Society's endeavour of enriching scientific knowledge and other matters of grave importance (yet what the Society deems of grave importance, the reader probably would see as misguided self-importance and humorous bluster). This branch is to be comprised of Pickwick and his three devoted companions, the lady's man Tupman, the poetic Snodgrass, and the sporting Winkle. Together with Pickwick, they are to travel across England and report back to the Society any matters of scientific or social import via letters; whence the title The Pickwick Papers: a simple premise that sets up the novel for fun and misadventure from chapter two onwards.In reality, the stout companions Pickwick, Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, are rather less the lions of society and enlightenment than they believe, and their prowess in their respective \\"specialities\\" often lands them in the most awkward and humorous situations.Initially, the novel seems disjointed. Each chapter is entertaining enough, but there are ever new characters, and literary devices to introduce mini-stories within the chapter, as when the hale fellows meet some odd stranger who has a creepy story to tell about the ghost of a gravedigger. The story is told from the perspective of the Pickwickians (society members) who receive letters from the companions of their adventures in the country. Part of the humour of the novel is the gullibility of Pickwick and friends: they report the wondrous stories of the crafty locals and conmen to the Society as if they were true, not noticing that often the tellers of tales are getting fat on free dinners and drunk on conviviality, all at the expense of Pickwick himself, of course.Entertaining as the numerous humorous diversions in each chapter are, the story comes to a very solid conclusion after the half-way mark. Characters you thought might never be heard of again, are reintroduced with genius, and the whole lot eventually are entwined under remarkably astute circumstances: how Dickens managed this in a serialized novel is, no doubt, part of his genius.I noticed that the bluster and tomfoolery of Pickwick especially, and friends, resolves by the end of the novel into a more serious tone: the characters have grown up considerably after having rubbed shoulders with the common man, so to speak, and having travelled along with them as the reader, one feels almost proud to have shared their eventual fortunes, wisdoms, and insights from the very beginning, when they were so obviously naive, and sheltered from the harsh realities of their society.Dickens excels in his description of the privations and injustices suffered in debtors prisons in England, and the conditional blindness of Lady Justice in the legal system. At this late stage of the novel I was entirely captivated. This high gear kicks in during the final quarter, and is a somewhat unexpected turn of events from the preceding humorous and light-hearted, almost anecdotal, course of the serialized novel.Dickens paints a fascinating picture of travelling by horse-drawn coaches in England, and the descriptions of the famous pubs (public houses) that served as bed-and-board for weary travellers of what can only be a very early public transport system, are historically accurate and entirely fascinating.Chapter ten is rather important because that is when the singular character of Sam Weller is introduced. Sam becomes a companion man-servant and general odds-body to Pickwick and his companions, partly, one feels, out of pity, because the street-wise Sam realizes what easy targets Pickwick et al are for local conmen and free-loaders.The growing companionship of Pickwick and the ever-loyal Sam is a memorable moment in literature and provides the backbone to the rest of the novel, and a very fine ending to everything. I was very much reminded of Frodo and Sam in Lord Of The Rings, in fact.I cannot recommend this book enough. I only gave it four stars instead of five in the certain hope that Dickens wrote even better novels, which I will have to rate higher. If reading classical literature seems daunting to you, I have this advice: if you can make it past chapter one, then you only have to stick to it until chapter ten, when you will meet Sam Weller. From then on, the next milestone is the debtors prison part, where things get rather more serious, and the seemingly disparate novel draws powerfully and emotionally together. Dickens is a satirical genius, and he takes the mickey out of Victorian society and class bluster with skill that beggars description.This is one for sentimental intellectuals, and lovers of language. An entirely brilliant d&eacute;but novel. I find the fact that it was originally serialized great fun, because each chapter is a far more meaty and satisfying read than most modern novels, where chapters are not that episodic. Reading Dickens is more like watching a television series, than a movie."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Pickwick Papers is a wonderful book, and no doubt much has been written about it in academic and literary circles. But from a layman's perspective, it is simply a fun read. One would almost think it the work of a great master approaching the end of a career, consciously deciding to lay down the heartache of Great Expectations or the martyrdom of A Tale of Two Cities to take a jovial and whimsical jaunt through the English language and the realm of imagination. Yet the bumbling and somehow delightful misadventures of the Pickwickians fall at the beginning of Dickens' career. Comic relief is offered well before Hard Times sets in.Take an independently wealthy, magnanimous old fellow and surround him with a group of close friends. Send them together on a journey of desire to explore the world about them, meet new people, and experience the fullness of life, and you essentially have the plot of Pickwick Papers. The plethora of characters Dickens introduces along the way add considerable color to the narrative, not only because they come from such a vast array of backgrounds, but because they themselves are colorful in their own right:The first and most obvious example might be that of Mr. Alfred Jingle, the loquacious vagabond rapscallion who rescues the Pickwickians from an altercation with a feisty coach driver. One of Mr. Pickwicks cohorts, Mr. Snodgrass, receives a blow to the eye during the incident, after which Mr. Jingle is pleased to suggest the most efficacious remedies: \\"Glasses round-brandy and water, hot and strong, and sweet, and plenty-eye damaged, sir? Waiter! Raw beef-steak for the gentleman's eye-nothing like raw beef-steak for a bruise, sir; cold lamp-post very good, but lamp-post inconvenient-damned odd, standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp-post-eh-very good-ha! ha!\\" While Pickwick reads the legend of Prince Bladud by candlelight, we find this description of King Hudibras: \\"A great many centuries since, there flourished, in great state, the famous and renowned Lud Hudibras, king of Britain. He was a mighty monarch. The earth shook when he walked-he was so very stout. His people basked in the light of his countenance-it was so red and glowing. He was, indeed, every inch a king. And there were a good many inches of him too, for although he was not very tall, he was a remarkable size round, and the inches that he wanted in height he made up in circumference.\\" The young surgeon, Benjamin Allen, is described as \\"a coarse, stout, thick-set young man, with black hair cut rather short and a white face cut rather long [...] He presented altogether, rather a mildewy appearance, and emitted a fragrant odour of full-flavoured Cubas.\\" Dickens notes that the casual visitor to the Insolvent Court \\"might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the Genius of Seediness\\" and whose vapors are \\"like those of a fungus pit.\\" Seated in this luxuriant ambience, we find an attorney, Mr. Solomon Pell, who \\"was a fat, flabby pale man, in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown the next, with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints. His forehead was narrow, his face wide, his head large, and his nose all on one side, as if Nature, indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth, had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered.\\" A final sample from a list of worthy characters too long to mention might be Mr. Smangle, the boisterous whiskered man whom Pickwick encounters in debtors prison: \\"This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places; they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about the stable-yards and public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them [...] There was a rakish vagabond smartness and a kind of boastful rascality about the whole man that was worth a mine of gold.\\"The book itself is a goldmine full of textures, personas, venues, and idiosyncrasies of a bygone age. These are delight to behold, as the reader is thus invited to enjoy experience and descriptive beauty for their own sakes. Plot largely takes a backseat to the development of relationships, which can be seen as a myriad of subplots contributing to a never-ending story. Numerous vignettes which are incidental to the narrative add another level of richness, and it seems clear that Dickens offers them for an enjoyment all their own. There is something of \\"l'art pour l'art\\" throughout the whole work which expresses a love of language and a love of human nature. As Dickens might have summed it up, \\"All this was very snug and pleasant.\\""},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Having never read any Dickens before - and unaware this was his maiden effort - I was hooked from the first few pages. The benevolent Mr. Pickwick, with his faithful sidekicks, experiences Victorian England as a well-to-do citizen. While the bulk of this novel deals with the &quot;softer&quot; side of society, the hard-edged aspects of the era are nonetheless acknowledged.

All the characters are completely two-dimensional, if not one-dimenional: they lack development and in no way resemble real people with real emotions, desires, fears, etc - they are mere caricatures. Worse, the plotline wanders aimlessly. Certain passages do evoke chuckles, but the great majority of the writing is lifeless and indeed boring.This is the work of a very young Dickens, and it shows. At this point in his life, his writing skills had simply not yet evolved very far. The 700+ page novel is simply undistunguised and totally forgettable.

Mr. Pickwick is the English equivalent of Cervantes' Don Quiote and Sam Weller is the worldy sidekick who looks after his Masters best interest with excellent loyalty. The 24 year old Dickens draws on his many earliest experiences working in Parliament and as a reporter in London. He was the forth person asked to write this serial and you get the sense that he is flying by the seat of his pants, writing and thinking the story out as he goes, as opposed to his later practice of the planning or story mapping of some of his greatest works. It isn't until the tenth chapter and the introduction of Sam Weller, as Mr. Jingle's foil, that Dickens realizes the moment when the novel finds its focus and thrust. Weller transforms the novel in a fascining and hilarous manner. I highly recommend reading this book. It's too much fun to pass up."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I think many people miss the whole point of this story. What they're wanting is a movie, when they're watching a television series, if you catch the meaning. This is not a \\"novel,\\" in the strict sense of a definitive plotline. It holds the title loosely, and is more of a collection of short, interconnected stories. It is meant to be, quite literally, a Victorian re-imagining of Don Quixote, which is set up in much the same style. (By the bye, if you enjoy The Pickwick Papers, I highly recommend reading the aforementioned literary masterpiece.)One thing I've heard complained about--even in the good reviews--is that the characters are not \\"real\\" or \\"fully developed.\\" \\"Real\\" seems to imply that the characters will grow and change. I disagree. Take the two most popular characters in the book as prime examples, Samuel Pickwick and Samuel Weller. We see the former in his later years--his development is all but passed him. He does grow as a person somewhat throughout his experiences, but just like most men his age, he is not the mindset for change. In fact, his obstinacy is shown quite vividly throughout. The latter, being Samuel Weller, is in that unflinching stage of youth, when he feels the world is his for the commanding. And just like his master, we see his obstinacy quite often--usually in the same places. These are characters Dickens did not want to change. Indeed, G. K. Chesterton goes so far as to call them eternal. They're better this way. Who didn't feel a pang of remorse when Don Quixote renounced his gallivanting ways?As to the other characters, they are all subsidiary to Pickwick and Weller, just as the entire cast of Don Quixote is to Sancho and the Knight of the Rueful Figure.As to the wandering storyline, that is part and parcel to Charles Dickens. He never could stay in one place. The plot was secondary to his whims, and a definite plot would usually just weigh him down. Dickens created people, not characters or caricatures. Whether they be static or no, they are always interesting and entertaining and full of all the eccentricities of the individual. The stories were just places for the people to live, and the people he created for this story certainly do live."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"A series of sporting prints was about to be published. The artist Robert Seymour had been hired. Now it was needed that an author be hired to add his prose to the series of prints.

The artist Seymour committed suicide; the 20 monthly numbers by Dickens shot him to instant popularity and a career as Victorian England's most successful novelist!Dickens grew up reading \\"Tom Jones\\" by Henry Fielding and other picaresque novels especially \\"Don Quixote\\" by Cervantes. Their influence on him was profound as evinced in Pickwick's many pages.The story tells of the fat, rubicund and funny old gentleman Mr. Pickwick who sets out to explore England. He takes with him three younger men Snodgrass, Tubman and Winkle. Along the way Pickwick hires young Samuel Weller to be his factotum. Weller steals the book with his cockney wit and wisdom. His father Tony also appears commenting on everything from women to jurisprudence. These characters are among the funniest ever created by Dickens.This book is very early Dickens lacking the seriousness, plot development and social realism of later works such as \\"Bleak House\\";\\"Little Dorritt\\" \\" Hard Times\\" and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\". It is instead filled with memorable characters getting themselves involved in one complicated incident after another! Mrs.Bardell the amorous landlady who sues Pickwich for Breach of Promise. Mr. Pickwich's attempts at ice skating; the Wardle Christmas Ball; the variious short stories told by characters interspersed in the text; the wild rides in stagecoaches across the landscape described with insight by the young genius; the trip to Newgate Prison where Pickwick is briefly incarcerated; the greedy lawyers; the hypocrites; the scoundrels and scamps of living.

His travels as a newspaper reporter acquainted Dickens with the coaches, coaching houses, and inns of England which he uses as settings in Pickwick Papers. Gradually he abandons the use of the club format and attempts to create a plot.Dickens's fame and popularity were forever established with the introduction of his greatest comic character, Sam Weller. In addition Pickwick Papers contains some of the author's best characters: Mr Pickwick, Dickens's most interesting title character; the strolling actor Jingle and his friend Job Trotter; Sam's father Tony Weller who battles with the red-nosed Rev Stiggins; and the Fat Boy.Memorable scenes include Christmas in the country, a Parliamentary election, and the famous court trial, which Dickens frequently recited on his reading tours."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"It's not often that I laugh out loud when reading, but Pickwick has many such moments.

It is full of quirky and fun characters such as Mr. Pickwick himself, the constant gentleman and \\"hero\\" of the novel, and his jovial manservant Sam Weller, an amusing definition of a devoted friend. Dickens does an excellent job of keeping the reader entertained with these eccentric characters through their many adventures and escapades.This book is great for anyone who loves Charles Dickens' literature because it shows a more comical side to his writing yet still keeps his classic style. This book is not for those looking for a quick read. Dickens is very verbose and elaborate in his detailing of every single aspect of the book, from the characters to the scenery. This aspect slows the pace a little, so the reader must be at full attention at all times. When that attention is given however, the reader becomes enthralled with clever witticisms to make anyone laugh out loud as well as intricate detailing in both setting and character that can make them feel like an intimate friend of Mr. Pickwick as they are sitting in a perfectly portrayed setting. Dickens' sense of humor shines through Pickwick Papers through many of these situations with his mischievous use of satire. Dickens' takes a playful aim at many subjects such as the antics of politics, the absurdity of law, and the general folly of the human race. These features make the book an interesting and amusing read because Dickens uses his comedy to poke fun and completely entertains the reader simultaneously. Overall, Pickwick Papers is a brilliantly written book that is sure to entertain any who take the time and effort to read it."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I've often wondered that if I had to attend a party or a ball that was made up of every character of a particular author's body of work, whose creations would I wish to meet? You couldn't do much better than Charles Dickens, and surely the host of such a gathering would be Mr. Pickwick of the Pickwick Club. The club, discovered in a collection of \\"posthumous papers,\\" is something of a toast masters society that journeys from London to the English countryside and back again in search of various forms of stimulation. Instead of finding that philosophical, poetic, and scientific wisdom that they are in search of, more often they stumble into situations not of their own making. Nearly always, hilarity ensues. They spirit of the novel is both jolly and tender; never has a book so often made me want to join the action. And while I haven't read every Dickens novel, I doubt that you will find a more wonderful pair of friends that Samuel Weller and Mr. Pickwick. The two are genuine and devoted friends, despite their differences in interests, mannerisms, and stations in life.Regarding the very long novels of the 19th century (this may sound obvious), they take some getting used to, especially to readers of much shorter contemporary novels. One inevitably will forget a character or a detail that appears on p. 35 as they read p. 700. Yet, one should remember that the novel came out in 19 monthly installments, and thus does not call for a quick reading. One can set the book aside for a few days and not worry about losing the plot; there isn't really a plot. Like a television series today, the adventures involve the same principle characters, with many of the supporting characters reappearing throughout the narrative. But the work itself is less a story than a canvas, and there is no central conflict or tension.My first crack at one of Dickens' long novels was David Copperfield, which was also my first review on this site. I gave it 2 stars, despite the fact that I enjoyed so many pieces of it. Trying to race through a Dickens novel will end in frustration and exhaustion. Don't be afraid to read other books simultaneously.Lastly, do yourself a favor and read the Introductions written by GK Chesterton. These essays both elevate one's own reading of the novel, and provide pleasure and insight in their own right. They bypass both the jargon and ostentatious learning that can make contemporary criticism a battle to read."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I was curious about getting something delivered serially, but this has been fun.

He follows the adventures of the \\"remarkable\\" (read: likeable, well-intentioned, generous, rich, naive, and fawned-upon) Mr. Pickwick and several of his companions who go out to observe and write about places and events in other parts of England (for the enlightenment of the rest of the Pickwick club). Their adventures and the stories they collect in the process range from the humorously bumbling to the tragic to the genuinely touching.As usual, Dickens is satirizing away, giving social commentary on useless fops, hypocritical pastors, scummy lawyers, debtors' prisons, etc. The book also has Dickens' trademark rambling style, unlikely coincidences, and silly names, but as always, the characters are so entertaining that it is a pleasure to read. The slightly pompous Pickwick and his bordering-on-sycophantic friends are somehow endearing rather than annoying, the ridiculous side-characters remind you of people you have known, and the downfall of one of the \\"bad guys\\" is pitiable and moving rather than a cause for rejoicing.

Think of it as a sort of prose nineteenth century Decameron or Canterbury Tales. A group of friends, which make up the Pickwick Society, go traveling the English countryside. Along the way, they experience many adventures, and these adventures are punctuated by the telling of tales, sometimes fabulous, by various characters. And of course, seasoning it all is Dickens' unparalleled eye for the idiosyncratic and ear for dialect.This is a charming and magical book. The fact that it was conjured by a man still in his early twenties makes it all the more astonishing."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This actually happens to be my very favourite Dickens, and that's saying a lot since I love all his work so much. The book is a series of sketches that were published in serial form like so much of Dickens work when he first started publishing. These sketches were written by Dickens as an accompaniment to various caricatures done by a popular artist. The main character in the book is Mr. Pickwick and he is a nave, generous, lovable old gentleman who is the self-appointed head of the Pickwick Club. Dickens characters are truly wonderful in this book and that is why I love it so much. The book is funny and charming. These sketches cover the whole gamut of human emotions, and we see the inevitable Dickens' theories behind them, but that doesn't take away from their charm. I can say with no hesitation that this was the book that I read that really turned me onto Dickens, and after reading this, I had to read the rest of his work. Definitely a \\"desert island\\" book for me."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Allright. Maybe it's not a masterpiece. But it sure is close. Dickens' first novel demonstartes that he was capable of creating hilarious comedy as well as tragic drama. If we do not expose ourselves to Dickens' comical side, we are depriving ourselves of a major aspect of Dickens. Characters such as Winkle, Weller, and Pickwick are very memorable. To this day, I have not forgotten the scene where Mr. Pickwick refuses to pay what the court fined him! The touching friendship between Weller and Pickwick is a memorable landmark in Dickens' writing. This novel demonstrates that Dickens was full of magnificent talent even as he wrote his first novel."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Charles Dickens is by far among my most favorite writers. The Pickwick Papers was such wonderful light humor and a rollicking adventure, that I never wanted to put it down. Every page, every chapter, brought these wonderful characters into a whole new unique set of adventures! I highly recommend anyone who enjoys Dickens to not miss this one, as although it is an early work, it shows the wonderful humorous side of the author that you will not quite see in some of his later works. These characters became like good friends by the time I was done with the book. A true joy to read."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The Pickwick Papers, (or rather The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club) although not Dickens' best work, is still a wondeful novel. The writing isn't as consistently good as it is in his later novels, but none of the writing is bad, and there are several flashes of brilliance which seem to herald what Dickens' would become when his genius had time to ripen (one of these can be found at the end of chapter 44, a beautifully written account of the death of a prisoner in a debtor's prison). In the beginning, despite being very funny, the novel, and indeed Mr. Pickwick, may seem rather inane. Keep reading. The story of Mr. Pickwick's trial and eventual imprisonment is one of the most brilliant pieces of comic literature, and Mr. Pickwick grows into a truly monumental character by the end. And Sam Weller, Mr. Pickwick's cockney servant, is one of the best characters in all of Dickens. Clever, witty, and cynical, he seems to light up every page. The book has a very happy ending, in which all loose ends are tied together and every character gets what he or she deserves. It is truly uplifting. I strongly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"book is a little slow and hard to get into. i'm not there yet. bounces back and forth a lot"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Celebrate the day that Naxos decided to delve into audiobooks. Anton Lesser's reading of Charles Dickens' uproarious PICKWICK PAPERS is a triumph. One wonders how so many voices can come out of one man's pipes short of possession by the spirits of Snodgrass, Tuchman, and Pickwick themselves.For those new to this bit of Dickens' scribblings, Pickwick and his Pickwick Club are delicious characters that allow the author to take the mickey (affectionately) out of every aspect of Victorian English pomp. The stories of their adventures are Quijotesque without half the drama. One grows to love them, even to cheer for them, as they totter on their way from one near miss to another accidental triumph to, alas, happiness and retirement in the end.PICKWICK is a great place to start, for readers who want to know Dickens for the first time. It is arguably his lightest and most accessible work.Anton Lesser is something close to immortal. Naxos is to be thanked.Yet Dickens stands at the beginning and end of it all, one of the English language's truly great writers."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"It is interesting that both William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens began their writing careers with a comedy. Charles Dickens is best known for his harsh portrayals of Victorian England (especially in \\"A Christmas Carol\\"). But this 1st book shows that he can draw hilarious comedy as well. We meet the Pickwick Club. (Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Tupman, and Mr. Winkle.) They are a bumbling group, but they are benevolent. Undoubtedly, Mr. Pickwick was based on Charles Dickens's father. The great Charles Dickens's father was a warm hearted and caring man, but he was also unlucky. He did in fact spend time in the debtors's prison. Well, moving on, the Pickwick club meets the comical villain Mr. Jingle. Mr. Jingle gets the Pickwick club into various sorts of trouble. He stops a would be wedding between Mr. Tupman and Rachael Wardle. (Jingle himself wants Rachael's fortune.) Well, Jingle shows himself to be good at double talk and alienates the 2. While his plot fails, he tricks Pickwick into appearing in a girls' school after hours. You'll probably notice that this book (like \\"Moby Dick\\") is full of digressions. We hear unrelated tales from different characters. (To some, this is a welcome technique while others find it annoying. Though the tale of Gabriel Grub does foreshadow the phenomenal \\"Christmas Carol.\\") Moving on, in a well worded passage Mr. Pickwick leads his landlady Widow Bardell into thinking he wants to marry her, when in fact he was just considering hiring a man servant. And of course Mr. Pickwick goes on trial for not keeping a promise of marriage. (Charles Dickens himself actually did many live readings of this chapter.) While we know Mr. Pickwick is not guilty, he ends up being charged 750 pounds which he refuses to pay. And of course, he (like Charles Dickens's father goes to prison). While he can afford the money, he refuses to pay because he is innocent. The scenes of the prison break the comedy. Even Widow Bardell is thrown in prison by Dodson and Fogg. But all is not lost. Pickwick's servant Weller comes to his aid. And Mr. Pickwick realizes that he must leave prison to help Mr. Winkle. (Mr. Winkle has married Arabella, and her brother is not so happy about it.) Mr. Pickwick pays what he must to exit the prison and he of course comes to the aid of his friend Mr. Winkle. The story ends in utter happiness. Mr. Pickwick even forgives Mr. Jingle. Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that it is NOT ONLY hilarious comedy, but it shows how true friends stick by one another, and it even takes it to the next level by showing the wonders of fogiveness. This book drove England Pickwick mad when it came out. (There were Pickwick coats, hats, cigars, candy, and canes.) Need we ask why?"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"If your only experience of Charles Dickens involves never-ending readings of Great Expectations or Oliver Twist in high school literature class, then you may be surprised to find that Dickens was a master of wit as well as woe. In The Pickwick Papers all aspects of the amazing talent of Charles Dickens are on display. Through the adventures and ramblings of Samuel Pickwick, Esq. and his companions Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, we are given an intimate look at 19th Century England, from her small country towns to the dark heart of London's debtor's prison. The characters and places are vibrant, the story alive with humor and pathos. Continual feasting, fun, and holiday parties with friends share the pages of this story with tales of poverty, abuse, and neglect; all set down by the hand of a master story teller and observer of human nature."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Immense in size, this early Dickens novel is just as large in providing pleasurable reading; I didn't want it to end. Dickens published it in 1837 when he was 25 years old; impressive. His range of characters, episodic plot, lively dialogue, humorous situations, never lags. Although not as weighty as that other great laughing satire, Don Quixote, Pickwick is in the same genre and should be read as a thematic companion to that great Spanish novel.Dickens loves the tale, I mean, telling the tale; it is all in the storytelling. Although it never dips into philosophy, science, morality, politics, or other pithy topics, Dicken's vast canvas ranges over the quixotic turns that happen in life. Pickwick, the title character, is completely lovable in his formality, politeness, and cordiality, making him a perrenially memorable character.Read this novel, friends, and give it to your friends who love to read. Or to anyone who loves the rich tapestry of mature storytelling, Dickens-style. This was the first novel to put him into popularity, and I see why."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This hilarious book tells the outrageous adventures of a cast of characters to remember forever. It's a joyous, humane, and faithful portrait of the British society. It is full of acuteness, irony, tenderness and sarcasm about the human condition. As in all of his books, Dickens reflects his experiences (prison for debts, etc.) in this book which tells the love affairs, countless drunken nights and fights in which the Pickwickians get. Apparently a book whose only purpose is to entertain, it is, like all intelligent humor, a bitter but optimist critique of the human being. The cast of characters is wonderful, and you will be just delighted you picked up this volume.&quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; was the first fictional book by Dickens, and it shows how capable of good humor he was. The title's character is a restless good-spirited man, a Don Quixote with a British touch, whose adventures are less noble and a lot more messy that those of the Don. The story of his friendship with the rest of the crew is hilarious and moving at the same time. Come read the story of this excentric lot, as they drink their way in and out of trouble."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The Oxford edition (edited by Kinsely) of Pickwick only reprints a few of the illustrations (Kinsley is turning in his grave!).

Taking into consideration the fact that he was just 24 when he started working on this book, it is clear that in his later works he shows a maturity but not the sense of humour that he put into this book. Mr. Samuel Pickwick and his man-servant Samuel Weller and the other members of the Pickwick Club make this a compelling read. You are simply struck by Mr. Weller's remarks and I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"In college, I took a Dickens class. We read about a book a week. Needless to say I didn't get around to Bleak House. But I read Pickwick Papers, mainly because I was amazed at how funny it was. Dickens rivals Twain in his biting sarcasm and humor aimed late 19th Century society: The usual cast of slimebags appear; the criminal system, petty thieves, and lawyers, just to name a few.This book is a delight, and not all that laborious. It takes on all the political issues of other books, and leaves you with characters that are very real yet utterly fictitious; and since it was written in serial format originally; one can't wait to find out what happens next to these sheltered, naive, silly aristocratic characters who surely must have influenced Monty Python's Twit of the Year competition.

So first and foremost, and with this in mind, I can recommend to any person, worldwide, who wishing to discover an older England, an England furbished with a tongue long dead, and characters most alive speaking this tongue, that they depart henceforth, into the reading of these fine, posthumous, papers, now available in fine print, with original illustrations! Onwards my fine fellows, onwards!"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This book proves that you don't need organization, theme, or even a plot to write one of the great books of English literature when you're one of the greatest novelists the world has ever known. There are many excellent reasons to read this book, chief among them the fact that even if you only read a few chapters you'll get more pleasure, humor, and great writing than if you read hundreds of pages from other authors.The Pickwick Papers starts out as if the story comes from records taken down from the club itself. This allows Dickens as author to comment as a reader of someone else's chronicles, and accounts for much hilarity in the early goings. Since the book was written in monthly installments, originally intended as comic vignettes to accompany humorous sketches, there is little to connect the early chapters in terms of theme or even coherence.This turns out to be irrelevant, because strung together each chapter becomes a crazy quilt of eccentric activities with implausibly funny situations that bring forth the basic 19th Century English difficulty of being respectable while still trying to have fun. Pickwick's problems, and those of his club members, revolve principally around courting women, getting into scrapes, and drinking...constant, incessant, over-the-top drinking. If The Pickwick Papers bears any resemblance at all to the real life of English gentlemen, they were simply never sober.As the story evolves, Dickens chucks the device of relating these stories from the records of the club and gets down to earnest storytelling in a true narrative. One of the great characters of all time, Sam Weller, makes his appearance and literally carries the rest of the book on his humor, loyalty, philosophy, and pugilistics. If anyone is funnier than Sam, it's his father, Tony Weller.The Pickwick Papers is also rife with the best names, names that match exactly the personality of the person. Dodson & Fogg the lawyers, Winkle the wimpy lover, Jingle the con man, Job Trotter his accomplice, Nathaniel Pipkin the parish clerk, Miss Nupkins the spoiled young lady, the Porkenhams, nemeses of the Nupkins, and of course Lady Tollimglower from the previous century. The names alone are a reader's feast.The story takes Mr. Pickwick through a lawsuit for breach of promise to marry, time spent in debtor's prison, time spent helping his young friends get married, and more or less continuous bouts of drinking. By the end Dickens has revealed his warmth, optimism, and love of happy endings. The ending is as heartwarming as the corpus of the book is rollicking and funny."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The book seems great, but the whole reason I ordered it was to refer to the maps and notes - plenty of notes are there, and there is an enormous legend for the map, but no actual map in the Kindle anywhere.

It's not only Pickwick and Sam Weller who will remain with you as hearty companions long after you put this book down, but a host of other characters. As an example, the following excerpt from G. K. Chesterton's review of THE PICKWICK PAPERS will do more than I can ever say to whet your appetite ---From G. K. Chesterton's review of THE PICKWICK PAPERS:&lt;&lt;The sincerity of this study of Sam Weller has produced one particular effect in the book which I wonder that critics of Dickens have never noticed or discussed. Because it has no Dickens \\"pathos,\\" certain parts of it are truly pathetic. Dickens, realising rightly that the whole tone of the book was fun, felt that he ought to keep out of it any great experiments in sadness and keep within limits those that he put in. He used this restraint in order not to spoil the humour; but (if he had known himself better) he might well have used it in order not to spoil the pathos. This is the one book in which Dickens was, as it were, forced to trample down his tender feelings; and for that very reason it is the one book where all the tenderness there is is quite unquestionably true. An admirable example of what I mean may be found in the scene in which Sam Weller goes down to see his bereaved father after the death of his step-mother. The most loyal admirer of Dickens can hardly prevent himself from giving a slight shudder when he thinks of what Dickens might have made of that scene in some of his more expansive and maudlin moments. For all I know old Mrs. Weller might have asked what the wild waves were saying; and for all I know old Mr. Weller might have told her. As it is, Dickens, being forced to keep the tale taut and humorous, gives a picture of humble respect and decency which is manly, dignified, and really sad. There is no attempt made by these simple and honest men, the father and son, to pretend that the dead woman was anything greatly other than she was; their respect is for death, and for the human weakness and mystery which it must finally cover. Old Tony Weller does not tell his shrewish wife that she is already a white-winged angel; he speaks to her with an admirable good nature and good sense:\\"'Susan,' I says, 'you've been a wery good vife to me altogether: keep a good heart, my dear, and you '11 live to see me punch that 'ere Stiggins's 'ead yet.' She smiled at this, Samivel . . . but she died arter all.\\"That is perhaps the first and the last time that Dickens ever touched the extreme dignity of pathos. He is restraining his compassion, and afterwards he let it go. Now laughter is a thing that can be let go; laughter has in it a quality of liberty. But sorrow has in it by its very nature a quality of confinement; pathos by its very nature fights with itself. Humour is expansive; it bursts outwards; the fact is attested by the common expression, \\"holding one's sides.\\" But sorrow is not expansive; and it was afterwards the mistake of Dickens that he tried to make it expansive. It is the one great weakness of Dickens as a great writer, that he did try to make that sudden sadness, that abrupt pity, which we call pathos, a thing quite obvious, infectious, public, as if it were journalism or the measles. It is pleasant to think that in this supreme masterpiece, done in the dawn of his career, there is not even this faint fleck upon the sun of his just splendour. Pickwick will always be remembered as the great example of everything that made Dickens great; of the solemn conviviality of great friendships, of the erratic adventures of old English roads, of the hospitality of old English inns, of the great fundamental kindliness and honour of old English manners. First of all, however, it will always be remembered for its laughter, or, if you will, for its folly. A good joke is the one ultimate and sacred thing which cannot be criticised. Our relations with a good joke are direct and even divine relations. We speak of \\"seeing\\" a joke just as we speak of \\"seeing\\" a ghost or a vision. If we have seen it, it is futile to argue with us; and we have seen the vision of Pickwick. Pickwick may be the top of Dickens's humour; I think upon the whole it is. But the broad humour of Pickwick he broadened over many wonderful kingdoms; the narrow pathos of Pickwick he never found again.>>"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"This is Dickens first work , and one of his most comical. His depiction of what for him is a typically eccentric gathering of English characters is satirically brilliant and warmly comic at once.

This is a wonderful book, notwithstanding a few tedious spots, and some &quot;sidebar&quot; tales that could have been left out. Dickens' true genius lies in his portraits of the two Wellers- Sam and his father- who gradually assume main character status. Rembrandt himself could not have depicted them with more insight.

For what it is worth, The Pickwick Papers are commonly published this way, as a tiny book, so buyer beware if you are looking for a readable edition."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"My favourite of all Dickens's works. He wrote better books, but none of them ever surpassed the sheer energy and joy of life found in Pickwick. It's been a few years since I last read it; I'm SO looking forward to reading it as it was meant to be read, in instalments. Such a great idea, Amazon!"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Although at first I found it difficult to get into this book, mainly due to the old English, once I got past the first few pages, I was captured. This is a very delightful read. Wonderful story telling! Anxiously await receipt of each new episode."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I LOVE Dickens's novels. And this is no exception, BUT it is too verbose. It took me a few months to get through the entire book. Sometimes, I would think I'd just quit reading it, but I wanted resolution. So, I plowed through to the end. I really like Dickens' characters, his writing, his humor. So, while I recommend this book, I do so with cautions. It's long; it tends to bog down. It could have done with about 20 fewer chapters.I try to figure out what it is about Dickens that I like so much. Truthfully, I haven't found a modern author to compare to him. He's so good with words, descriptions, humor and creating memorable characters that just jump off the page.Sam Weller and his father are just delightful in this book. Pickwick, also, is very memorable.So, if you enjoy Dickens and you have a month with nothing else to do, pick Pickwick and the Pickwickians."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I have read all of Dickens' novels and found them all to be wonderful. But if I have to recommend a starter Dickens novel to anyone I would definitely choose The Pickwick Papers. There is nothing more enjoyable and it is no wonder that this, his first novel, was an immediate hit. The diverse characters and stories, the humor, the keen observations of humanity, and how everything comes together towards the end are all incomparable characteristics of a Dickens novel. But don't read Dickens like you would read a spy novel. Take time to savor the brilliant prose and the beauty of the English language."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"I just finished my second reading of it.I really cannot add much to the great reviews already written. I've always loved Dickens' way with words, and this book is a treasure in that department. The English, the Era, the characters, the countryside.... it got to the point where I couldn't wait for the evening to come so I could continue reading.This also seems to me to be an important \\"cornerstone book\\" for other great English literature. The theme (though just a seed) for Scrooge in A Christmas Carol begins here, in a story called The Goblin Who Stole a Sexton, a story related during one of Pickwick's Christmastime visits to a friend in the country. When reading The Wind in the Willows or Tolkien's works, I cannot escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm, the sense of humor (okay, humour), duty to friends, and the simple but most important things in life which Dickens so impressively describes.The only negative thing is that I discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that I was free from the drudgery of daily work, was retired (with ample monetary means, of course, like Pickwick himself), and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings, adventures, and pursuits.An excellent book."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Dickens' first novel, THE PICKWICK PAPERS, is as long and meandering as the Amazon River. But as with a trip up the Amazon, THE PICKWICK PAPERS will most likely leave you simultaneously weary to the bone, unprecedentedly enthused, and certain in some indefinable way that you'll always be richer for the experience.The non-plot involves a strung together series of misadventures and humanistic serio-comic sketches of Mr. Pickwick, an aging but still vital retiree, and the young men who form the Pickwick Club, a sort of informal gentleman's club that wonders around England, getting its members in one improbable fix after another. Everyone should be so lucky as to have a Mr. Pickwick in their lives: an uncomplicatedly giving, decent, larger than life father figure who radiates bands of human warmth like a sun in evening clothes. It's an obvious pleasure for the Pickwickians to orbit around their benefactor and follow him wherever his undiminished sense of adventure leads.THE PICKWICK PAPERS is an extremely satisfying read--in many way despite itself. It doesn't really go anywhere, and it doesn't presume to critique the human condition in a profound manner, but the sheer looseness and easy-goingness of it all proves itself in many places unexpectedly transcendent. Probably the best parts of the PICKWICK PAPERS are those that detail the friendship between the aging Mr. Pickwick and the his protege, Sam Weller, a young world-weary up-start who spits out pithy, telling one-liners like a roomful of Woody Allen imposters trying to prove who's the real deal.Sometimes the most satisfying art is the kind that takes you by the hand and walks you down this way a little ways and over that way some, and doesn't lead on that you're going anywhere or doing much of anything important, and leaves you sort of surprised by the depth of the experience you've just had."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Pickwick papers must rate as one of the greatest literary works in English. The sheer numbers of characters woven into the storyline and how well they mesh together is incredible. Pickwick and Sam Weller must rank among the top literary characters in English literature."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Having collected all of the other Nonesuch Dickens editions (2008 and earlier), I am torn between returning this newer release or keeping it to complete my collection. I am very disappointed by the quality of the binding. The Pickwick Papers (one of my favorites of Dickens' works) is a heavy tome, but the previous Nonesuch editions had superior binding. Not so the case with this edition - on the outside, the binding looks and feels the same as the previous editions, but when I examined the bindings on the inside, I discovered to my horror that the paper had been glued in a careless manner and the top of the binding was clearly separated from the spine! This is simply unacceptable! The price for this book does not match the inferior quality of the binding. I read another review with the same complaint so I am not sure it is going to do me any good if I choose to return it.I discovered (surprise, surprise) that the 2008 Nonesuch Dickens' were printed and bound in Thailand, but this 2011 edition is printed and bound in China! Perhaps this might explain the difference in quality? The paper quality of the 2008 editions is also superior, the paper feeling smooth and thicker. This 2011 edition has pages that feel like cheaper quality paper, and much thinner. The illustrations are also not as clearly defined and appear lighter than the 2008 editions.Overall, I am very disappointed in this 2011 Nonesuch Dickens' edition and am only keeping it so as to complete my collection."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"In the chronology of novels \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is Dickens' first, a debut effort that won him such acclaim and success he was able to devote the rest of his life to writing and literature. Readers of Dickens most likely began their experience with novels like \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" as did I; the majority, I'm sure, never read his novels in sequence. If this is the case, then \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" is sure to surprise the reader, for the novel is quite unlike any of his others.The novel tells the story of Samuel Pickwick, \\"General Chairman\\" of the Pickwick Society and the associate adventures of three selected Pickwickians as they adventure afield in the interests of \\"science.\\" Mr. Pickwick, a portly, middle-aged epicurean and retired gentleman of independent means (\\"...I have more money than I can ever need; far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend...\\"), has been designated by the Vice President of the Pickwick Association to apply his acute powers of observation to the broader scope of English society. Apparently Pickwick's reputation precedes him as the reader is in the dark as to why the head Pickwickian is assigned superlatives like \\"good, great, noble.\\" Only through the Great Pickwick's interactions with his fellow countrymen, regardless of class or situation, as well as the devotion shown him by his fellow Pickwickians, does the reader come to understand how these adjectives apply.Thus is formed the \\"Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club.\\" Pickwick and his two young wards, Mr. Augustus Snodgrass and Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and devotee Mr. Tracy Tupman embark on their assignment the day after their adjunct society is established. What follows is a series of picaresque adventures, none of which are of particular interest, some just plain silly; all intended to reveal certain foibles of English society or society in general. In addition to a variety of merry mix-ups, the Pickwickians are swept into the good graces of the Wardle family and their country estate Manor Farm at Dingley Dell where they are periodically feted and entertained. Pickwick's magananimous nature leads him to befriend the swindler Alfred Jingle who preys on women of means. Jingle absconds with Rachel Wardle, the spinster sister of Old Wardle, and Pickwick is swept along with his host to intercept the two before they tie the knot.The Pickwickians' travels take them to Eatansville to report on village politics, their divisive nature, and the two rival newspapers that each champion its favorite son; they take the waters at Bath where they observe the \\"swells\\" taking the cure; on to Ipswich where the unimpeachable Pickwick, lost in an inn's labyrinth of rooms, mistakes his own for one already housed by a \\"middle-aged woman in yellow curl-papers\\"; then in and out of Fleet debtor's prison; and finally playing a role in the romantic entanglement of Mr. Winkle and one Arabella Allen.As if all this gadding about isn't dizzying enough, each escapade is likely to be interrupted by some character's launching into an exptemporaneous (and extraneous) tale; many of which are dull; many which involve dreams and supernatural intervention. The most noteworthy of these is \\"The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton\\" to which Dickens devotes an entire chapter. Chapter 29 relates the tale of a misanthropic, curmudgeonly sexton who spurns the gaiety of Christmas Eve and goes to the churchyard to dig a grave instead. Any reader of Dickens will immediately note the gleam in the author's eye that will later become \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Pickwick is ensnared by his landlady Mrs. Bardell (who seeks the security of a \\"man of means\\"), sued for \\"breach of promise,\\" faced with a judgment of 750 pounds, and rather than pay a single pence to the designing woman and her rapacious lawyers Dodson and Fogg, the principled gentleman decides on debtors' prison instead. Dickens uses Pickwick as his vehicle for the debtors' prison culture of Fleet Prison, setting the stage for his later novel \\"Little Dorrit,\\" the story of Willaim Dorrit and daughter Amy imprisoned in the Marshalsea debtors' prison.The novel's erratic storyline improves with the appearance of the character Samuel Weller. Weller (\\"that's 'Veller with a 'We\\"), a cockney lad whose job it is to keep track of and clean travelers' boots, makes a favorable impression on Pickwick. A good judge of character (except for the weasling Jingle), Mr. Pickwick notes the young man's potential and makes Sam his personal servant. Young Weller is a clever fellow with a glib--although cockney--tongue and a penchant for speaking in quaint analogies. (\\"It's a great deal more in your way than mine as the gen'lm'n on the right side of the garden vall said to the man on the wrong 'un, ven the mad bull wos comin' up the lane.\\") Weller apparently acquired this trait from Mr. Tony Weller, his father, whose appearance in the story and reunion with son \\"Sammy\\" lend additional humor to the Pickwickian saga. Weller Sr. has a weakness for widows, marries one who joins an evangelical movement. Step-mother tries to sweep her husband into the fold, making Tony's life miserable in the attempt, causing his great aversion to matrimoney in general and widows in particular. Young Weller proves to be a loyal, invaluable servant to Pickwick who because of his master's philanthropy the young man believes to be \\"...a reg'lar thorobred-angel.\\" Sam's devotion is so deep he persuades Weller Sr. to make him a loan on which he purposely defaults so he will be sent to Fleet Prison where he can continue to serve his \\"Angel.\\" Both Wellers add life and color to the story, and their delightful characters do much to enhance a storyline that is at times pedestrian.Dickens' fans will note in this first novel the author's concerns with the foibles and shortcomings of the society and culture of his time which in his later works provide the novelist with ample material for satire and social criticism. The novel concludes when Pickwick dissolves the adjunct society. The author adds an epilogue; all the principals are given their due--all except Rachel Wardle, the hoodwinked and spurned spinster sister of the Honorable Wardle, lord of Manor Farm. She never surfaces again, but when an author juggles 104 characters in the space of 875 pages, a character or two is bound to fall through the cracks. (The Bantam Classic 2006 reissue of \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" includes prefatory material by the author and a most helpful cast of characters in alphabetical order. Unfortunately this edition lacks the wonderful artwork of \\"Phiz.\\")"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club or the The Pickwick Papers - Dickens' first novel - was published in 1837 when the author was just 25 years old and set the pattern for this great author's later work. The novel was initially serialized, published over 20 months, between April 1836 and November 1837 - readers buying each of the 19 monthly installments - Dickens missed a deadline - before it was released in \\"book form\\" - all 800+ pages of it. And right from the start Dickens' work was immensely popular.The book is a loosely connected set of adventures starring Samuel Pickwick - a genial, somewhat bumbling, rotund, middle-aged man and President of his social \\"club\\" - and his three traveling companions - Nathaniel Winkle, Augustus Snodgrass and Tracy Tupman - just the names are pure Dickens and a foreshadow of the characters to come from his imagination. Our four heroes leave the environs of London for the countryside, chronicling their travels to be shared with the club in the hopes of \\"educating\\" its members on life outside the city.Along the way our travelers find friends, enemies, trouble and happiness. They meet a farmer, Mr. Wardle, a gracious host who rescues the four city dwellers on several occasions when they find themselves in over their urban heads. Mr. Pickwick picks up and hires a valet, Sam Weller, who is \\"street-wise\\" and keeps an eye out for his master and his companions. In the not so distant background lurks the nefarious Alfred Jingle, a con-man extraordinaire, who haunts the Pickwickians from one locale to another, as they make their trip. Pickwick also becomes the target of a law-suit - Dickens portraying the legal professionals involved in a typically not so flattering light. And to keep their spirits up our traveling fab four nomads consume a copious amount of cocktails along the way.The Pickwick Papers is a somewhat neglected or forgotten work with folks reading the later and better known Dickens classics - which is unfortunate. For a debut novel it is highly polished and very entertaining - although describing it as \\"mad-cap\\" fun might be pushing it - and the novel features all the character development, story-telling and humor one expects from Charles Dickens. This is a \\"big\\" novel - not something read over a weekend - and I understand that Dickens isn't everyone's cup of literary tea, but if you're looking for a change of pace and little reading excursion - the adventures of the Pickwickian crew is highly entertaining."},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick club, (Great illustrated classics)","review":"Not happy with this edition; no introduction, no foreword, no historical nor biographical notes and no illustrations...'just the facts'.

I don't have much to add that has not been said. One sees the author grow as a writer as the book develops; by the end he is in top form. The plotting is thin, and the chapters episodic, while the details are vivid, and the language rich. By the end, the reader feels at home in early Victorian England.

Not like human administration that is politics-oriented, God's administration is life-oriented, which is to give God's divine life to those who need Him and want Him, through Jesus Christ. Witness Lee used 'economy' of God in stead of 'administration' of God just because the Greek word \`economy' most characterizes God's life-driven administration.Because of human's falling, the salvation has to be involved in God's administration. The very God had to become a man to die for man. Praise the Lord, His administration did not stop by His death. His resurrection and resurrection power have made this life-driven administration continue and even consummate in the New Jerusalem!Now God's administration is exercised in the Church: \\"I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\" (Mat 16:18) God needs His believers to participate in His divine economy on this earth, and to destroy Satan's kingdom and build up God's kingdom, which is the domain of His authority, His administration, and His divine life. \\"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.\\" (Mat 12:28)I have never read any book like Economy of God that unveils God's heart's desire in such a deep and thorough way. The book is a must for those who have a pure heart to love and seek Christ, and want to participate in God's divine economy today on this earth."},{"Title":"Economy of God, The","review":"This is a book composed of messages given in Los Angleles, CA in 1964, covering the matter of God's Plan for man and His intent as revealed in the Bible. The &quot;economy&quot; referred to in the title is from the Greek word for plan or household arrangement. The point of this word, used in 1 Tim. 1:4, is that God wants to distribute or dispense Himself into man. The book covers many aspects of our spiritual life, but one of the most impressive is the Triune (or Three-One) nature of God, and how it relates to the three part man. As this is a book covering spiritual matters, it may not be a &quot;best seller&quot; as some popular Christian teachers have achieved, but it is much more profound and lasting in its impression on the reader. After reading this book, you will have a much different sense of your own life, but also a different sense of what God intends and desires, as revealed in the Bible."},{"Title":"Economy of God, The","review":"This is an excellent book. This can be considered a companion to Watchman Nee's \\"The Spiritual Man\\", but it can be read without having read the former. The pictures in the book are EXTREMELY helpful for understanding the concepts taught. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book.This book will help you explore many Scriptural truths that you may not have thought about before. The main purpose is to walk by the Spirit to fulfill God's purpose in the universe. We do this as individual Christians and corporately as the church.As noted above, this is a sequel of sorts to \\"The Spiritual Man\\". Watchman Nee wrote \\"The Spiritual Man\\" early in his life, and--though it is an excellent book--it falls short in its view on spiritual warfare, basically teaching that spiritual warfare is an individual matter. Mr. Nee gained a deeper understanding later in his life to see that spiritual warfare is a matter of the Body, the church. Witness Lee worked closely with Watchman Nee and gained from his matured insight, so in many ways \\"The Economy of God\\" is better and more Biblical than \\"The Spiritual Man\\". (\\"The Economy of God\\" was written almost 40 years after \\"The Spiritual Man\\".)The only shortcoming of the book is that it often tends to take it for granted that the reader will already agree with the author, and Mr. Lee does not always take the time to adequately explain his position. He gives very general Scriptural support for what he says about the spirit, soul, and body. And he barely explains what he means by the word \\"economy\\". (These omissions are forgivable if the reader will keep in mind that this book is a transcription of spoken messages given to people who were likely familiar with Watchman Nee's writings.)[...]And if you have difficulty understanding what Mr. Lee is saying about the spirit, soul, and body, you might want to read the first half of Watchman Nee's \\"The Spiritual Man\\", which goes much further into the Scriptural basis for the teachings on the tripartite man. Reading these two books together should give you a very comprehensive look at the way God created man and the way He works within the believer.It may take a little work to fully grasp the depths of this book, but it is definitely worth it. The benefits to your relationship with God will be tremendous. And your usefulness to God in accomplishing His purpose on earth will increase sevenfold!"},{"Title":"Economy of God, The","review":"The Economy of God will give you the answers you seek about your purpose in life from God's perspective based on the Bible.

This book should allow them to apply the most classic mathematical tools such as time-domain and spectral-domain techniques to their time series problems (provided they are &quot;relatively non-complex&quot;) and also to gain confidence in the use of the mathematical apparatus when doing their research or writing about the subject of time-series analysis.For more complex situations, however, the methods presented may become weak and other scenarios such as neural, fuzzy or &quot;computational intelligence&quot; in general should be more indicated. This book does not deal with those subjects, but I appreciated the rather clear way it exposes the main mathematical aids for the comprehension and analysis of time series data.Also remarkable are the extense bibliographical references and the CD-ROM containing code routines in C and Pascal for most of the methods explained, along with libraries, a means of doing queries to the bibliography and the .PDF version of the book itself, with a couple Appendixes added."},{"Title":"Handbook of Time Series Analysis, Signal Processing, and Dynamics (Signal Processing and its Applications)","review":"I have been using this book for several months now and its a great reference book for the applied statistician and engineer.

But since it is made up of chunks of info, you can't help but find some that will be informative. I personally prefer books by Mark McCormack, since he built his business up to $700 million. Mackay isn't at that level. I'll take advice from a champion. And Warren Buffet never invests in commodity companies (like envelopes), since they depend almost solely on price competition. Mackay admits that his envelope business depends on &quot;razor-thin&quot; margins. &quot;One company's envelope isn't that different than another's,&quot; he writes. (Buffet likes to invest in brands, like See's Candies, where people aren't going to care about price so much. So, right off, if Mackay is such a smart business man, he'd have stayed away from a commodity business). And, since envelopes IS a commodity business, Mackay really has to know his customers, so as to manipulate them into buying from him. To do this, he has his subordinates find out personal, nosey info on his customers. I'd stay away from Mackay as a customer, because I wouldn't want him trying to find out if I were a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, as he does try to do. (I'm not a member of AA, incidentally!) And another question he asks his employees: &quot;Is this customer a college graduate? If not, is he insecure about not having a college degree?&quot; I mean, buy envelopes from Harvey Mackay, and you've got an FBI file made up on you! No thanks! (But there are other bits worth reading.)"},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"This book is a must for any sales or business person's library. I found McCay's common sense and practical viewpoint very refreshing. I keep this book in my own library of books to refer to often or re-read periodically. When I read this book it really gave me the viewpoint of how to pursue any goal and make it a reality in the business world. McCay's story about buying 15,000 tickets to a Twins game really sets the pace and the lessons he describes throughout the book is what makes it a priceless text. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"One of the great aspects of Mackay's book is his celebration of the unusual and sometimes quirky aspects of the entrepreneurial spirit. For example, he included the following description of a famous man's workspace:\\"Picture to yourself the darkest, most disorderly place imaginable... blotches of moisture covered the ceiling... chairs, mostly cane-seated, were covered with plates bearing the remains of last night's supper, and with wearing apparel, etc.\\"Published in \\"The Lives of the Great Composers,\\" the excerpt was written by Baron de Tremont to describe Beethoven's office.Entrepreneurs might not be the most tidy, orderly people. They might not think linearly. They might have wild, unbridled creativity and daring ideas that others see as risky or even foolish. And Mackay celebrates them all, urging each reader to \\"believe in yourself, even when no one else does.\\"Mackay notes that entrepreneurs often strike out on their own because they hate the boring routine, staff meetings, policy manuals, bureaucracy, and all the red tape often associated with the corporate environment. \\"Entrepreneurs scratch before they itch. They dare to fix things before they break... they set the pace; they dominate the field of play.\\"If you're an entrepreneur, Mackay predicts that you're out there with infectious enthusiasm and a solid sense of self-confidence.

There are plenty of wisdom filled morsels to help you build your businesses and although some of his ideas might be a bit corny, they apparently work.

Harvey Mackey does an excellent job of making this a &quot;I can't put it down book&quot; Non-avid readers will breese through the pages. Must read!"},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Some worthy information about particular business issues are raised and noted, and for the most part this is an off-the-cuff soliloquy talk about how Harvey views business, and the world. There is nothing more amusing than some wealthy person in business who thinks they have the answers and the remedies for the rest of us. Written in the late 1980s, some of the attitudes presented towards hiring potential employees will become evident. All in all, this is an easy and quick-read.I read &quot;Swim With The Sharks&quot; front-to-back, however each chapter concerns a different topic, so one does not have to read this book straight through from page 1 to the end.One thing I found a bit quirky were the consistent references to allegedly &quot;successful&quot; collegiate and professional sports coaches. I don't feel it's an appropriate analogy to commonly equate coaches with the situations outside of the sports world. The sports culture is often not applicable to making a business deal, dealing with corporate culture, and/or avoiding mistakes with people socially. The sports in itself is a microcosm of society, but a separate world within its own. Time and time again I would chuckle to myself as I would read a quote made by Vince Lambardi, some NBA coach, or read a personal anecdote from the now disgraced coach Lou Holtz. Having to read Yogi Berra's lobotomy-like quotes and philosophy was quite dull, and not very informative.Some helpful and practical information is the &quot;66 question customer profile,&quot; as well as the &quot;12P Competitor profile.&quot; I liked his noting (book written 1988) of how people who usually don't have money go out and buy a brand new &quot;prestigious&quot; car that depreciates.Mackay also reminds us (or me atleast) of the importance of writing small yet important things down on paper and/or notepads.One of his tips on how to save time is to drive near the front of a grocery store you plan on shopping in. Then look for how many people are in line. If its too crowded don't go in. Thanks Harvey. You've changed my life with your insights.He also tried to break an attempt by his employees to form a union, which he lost. He openly stated how he conned very employee into thinking they were &quot;special&quot; and &quot;important&quot; with his one-to-one meetings with them. It didn't work. They didn't buy it.He does understand (see &quot;Dig You Well Before Your Thirsty&quot;) the art of the schmooze in talking with celebrities such as O.J. and world figures such as Castro about things that they do, and interest them in their free time and NOT about what they do for work.All in all, useful things can be gleaned from &quot;Swim With The Sharks,&quot; and it's a very quick read."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"This is a great book, whether you're an MBA or just someone trying to get an advantage in everyday life. Harvey Mackay's lessons are to be treasured--he was way ahead of the curve in the mid-1980s. It may be hard to appreciate this today because some of the advice isn't fresh anymore: we all have phones in our cars and we all use answering machines to screen calls and we all take notes on the run on little portable recorders. --Well, many of us do, at any rate. Hardly revolutionary advice anymore, but that's only because we listened to Harvey in the first place.Some of the chapters contain gold that will always be valuable, however. One of my favorites involves the phrase &quot;Dusseldorf passes.&quot; I won't spoil it for the unread, but I will say the lesson from that chapter is one everyone should take with them through life. It will save you a lot of money and regret.And the Mackay hiring process. So thorough it seems to border on the obsurd, but the more I work at various companies the more I wish all businesses were as picky about acquiring workers. Harvey shows you that even &quot;lowly&quot; positions such as the receptionist or secretary are among your company's most critical, for 99% of your customers will get their first impression of your company--and in some cases the *only* impression of your company--through this crucial individual. Yet many companies get some 18-year-old part-timer to answer the phones and file valuable company documents--*and they're proud of this cost-cutting maneuver!* They consider this smart management. Harvey explains why this is actually a very dumb move.He also shows you how to get &quot;impossible&quot; tickets to the big game and how to get a reservation at virtually any hotel, even ones that are &quot;completely booked.&quot; And no, these are not devious ways. They're just common sense, actually.Whether you're an ambitious manager at a Fortune 500 company or an owner of a small businesses on the corner, this book has nuggets. So grab it. And then read the other books Harvey Mackay has written. While they didn't have the freshness or the impact of this first one (is that possible?) they are still well worth your time."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Excellent popular manual for quick rules of thumb to operate in business today.

I highly, highly recommend ALL of Harvey's books."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Wily ol' Harvey MacKay is a prototypical midwestern multimillionare. This means that even at his most Machiavellian, he comes across as a charming, down-to-earth folksy everyman - just the sort of person James Stewart used to play. This is Mr. MacKay's first book and it's well-worth reading for anybody who'd like to know more about why some people succeed in business while most fail. Some may dismiss many of Mr. MacKay's advice as merely 'common sense' but given that so many of us fall short of financial and personal success I doubt that the knowledge in here is all that common.On the positive side, we have a successful business leader who stresses the importance of ethics, personal integrity, and steady hard work. I've rarely encountered a management or business-oriented author who stressed strength of character as much as Mr. MacKay does. He also tells personal anecdotes with a refreshing lack of swagger. This book may have first been written in the 1980s but Harvey MacKay does not reflect the Era of Greed at all. It's little wonder he's in demand as an inspirational public speaker, and that he still publishes a weekly advice/inspiration column.Of course, in any book this old, there are bound to be dated sections and those are the only real negatives. Mr. MacKay's hiring practices (in which employees are visited and interviewed in their own homes so that he can learn more about their family values, yet in which no one calls to verify personal references) would raise a lot of eyebrows today. There's also an over-reliance on sports analogies. Other reviewers have noted this but I would like to add that Mr. MacKay's love of sports anecdotes reflects his age, because sports heroes and coaches of the past were not the money-driven free agents of today.In sum, this would be a good graduation gift, or a welcome present for anyone beginning a job within the corporate world. Unlike many advice books, I left this one not only with good advice but also with a sense of who the author really was. And, I have to say, I enjoy Harvey MacKay a lot."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"...This book, for me, was a guide in how to conduct myself in this difficult environment in an ethical manner, yet still succeed.

They don't teach these types of ethics in MBA school. Anyway, I was dumbfounded when I read this simple rule, but Mackay deftly explains how this will not only help you rationalize your situation, but actually excel in this environment.This is just one example.

This book is simply great. A must read for anyone in business."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"I came across this book a few years ago during a difficult time in my life. I was in the process of failing miserably at yet another professional endeavor, and in the throes of a major personal upheaval. It was shortly after these calamities that I seriously began to read this book. Internalizing just a few of the simple but important lessons in this book has made all the difference for me, and has allowed me to pursue life very much on my own terms.From this book, I learned that in order to satisfy a demand, you first have to create the demand, the very first lesson of the text, and one that I applied to maximum benefit repeatedly shortly after internalizing it. I also learned that while money is nice, good information is priceless; otherwise, you will not have the money for long. Too many people never learn that lesson. Finally, the most important lesson for me came in the first few pages and had to do with salesmanship. As MacKay says, anyone can get the order if they are willing to say anything and do anything to get it. The real question is whether or not they can get the reorder, as that is the mark of the true salesman. I work with people at the moment that should have learned that lesson, but did not, and let me tell you, it is excruciatingly frustrating to interact with such individuals. People who have not learned this crucial and important lesson simply can not be trusted, and lack integrity. They develop reputations that, in a word, are most un-flattering, and can bring out the worst in people. An appropriate analogy for such people are scurrilous and reproachable politicians- all talk and promises, but very much non-action and non-delivery. Most important, once entrenched in a position with a fancy title and of some limited power and authority, they can and do frustrate any and all attempts at progress and forward locomotion. You would do well to cease contact with these people at the first and most convenient opportunity.As an aside, I liked his musings on the old cliche 'Sell Yourself'- truly a meaningless and overworked phrase if there ever was one. As MacKay remarks, we as individuals often make for lousy products. I also concur with others who found Mr. MacKay's admonishment, Don't Get Mad, and DON'T Get Even, to be wise beyond words. I can affirm that stewing over personal and professional slights and plotting revenge wastes precious time and energy which could be directed towards more constructive and fruitful pursuits. However, I must admit that I have yet to internalize this truest of truisms, as some tresspasses are difficult to forgive. Still, as for most of the other lessons the reader probably already knows them or is familiar with them, but having them placed before you by an unrelated and credible third party always makes for good, sound, positive reinforcement. While some may dismiss most of the lessons in the book as common sense, I have to commend Mr. MacKay on his key insights on the human condition and human relationships.Which, in the end is what business, and for that matter, everything else, including my profession, science, is all about. I especially recommend this book to those from non-business or professional backgrounds (especially scientists, as many of us are, perish the thought!, unfortunately severely handicapped in the people skills department, this reviewer included) who nonetheless must interact with people. Obtaining this book solely for the lessons on good, effective salesmanship alone would justify its purchase. I have also found that reading this book, in combination with a handy and powerful little volume, Soft Selling in a Hard World: Plain Talk on the Art of Persuasion, by Jerry Vass, can turn even the most reluctant, shy non-people-person into an effective salesperson. One of these days I am going to read Mr. MacKay's follow-up, Sharkproof!, as there are quite a few of those carnivorous, maneating fish in The Business of Science."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"One of the top five business books I've ever read.

My copy was a gift from Harvey Mackay and I treasure it dearly."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Harvey Mackay's wonderful sales & marketing manifesto is good advice for any business person to heed, even more than 20 years after it was first written. This was a man who was able to accomplish much out of life by working hard, working smart, and engaging others to join him in getting things done. You simply follow his leadership because he's highly competent, dilligent, and refreshingly charming. There was nothing phony about this guy, and he knew how to get results.After digesting all the information in this wonderful book, the reader will come away with that extra edge that will separate the extraordinary business person from the rest of the pack. This is great stuff and is worth reviewing regularly, just to stay sharp. The advice is timeless and the results are guaranteed to be profound."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"This book is filled with fantastic hard-earned wisdom and illustrative examples on how to find success in the business world. A quick and easy read with advice that sticks with you long after you've put it down."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"You might think that a business book where the typical chapter is only one or two pages makes for very light reading. However when it comes to Harvey Mackay's, \\"Swim With The Sharks\\", you would be wrong.The book is a quick read, but you may not catch all of the insights the first go round. Mackay passes the majority of his insights along in the form of stories, anectdotes and tips you can use right away.Some readers may dislike his \\"folksy\\" style (he is from Minnesota, not the coasts), while others may think the book is unlike many other business books somewhat \\"light\\". Mackay is not an academic, consultant or theorists, but the owner of a manufacturing entity (Mackay Envelope) battling it out on the frontlines of Capitalism.That is the true value of the book, he is a business man, running his own business. Something many business authors cannot claim.Read it once. Re-read it. Then read it all over again.Part business wisdom, part motivation, all good business sense.Recommended.Bernie"},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"It is impossible for a first time writer to come up with a business bestseller that gives out no-nonsense advice.

The lessons in this book can teach you how to manage everything from your work to your relationships with direction and purpose. A must read."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Swim with the Sharks without being Eaten Alive by Harvey Mackay is an excellent book filled with both business lessons and life lessons. It is one of those books that once you start reading it you can't put it done. Each lesson is clear, brief, and to the point with a real life example that makes them easy to understand.Harvey Mackay has over 50 years of business experience starting at the bottom to owning and becoming chairman of the $100 million Mackay Envelope Company. There are 69 lessons plus some quickies at the end that he has learned over his long business career. One of the most important lessons is titled Knowing Something About Your Customer is Just as Important as Knowing Everything about Your Product.He gets this information by using the Mackay 66. This is a 66 question customer profile that is done on every customer with the idea being that it is critical to know your customer inside and out. The more you know about your customer the easier your job as a salesperson is. Buyers often have a predisposed notion about your company and product and if you can neutralize those feelings it will make your job easier.This is just one of the lessons on salesmanship. There are also lessons on negotiation and management each with a personal story and advice that you can apply today. That phrase is used often when writing about a book but in this case I believe it to be absolutley true.Harvey Mackay has a wealth of knowledge and anyone looking to improve themselves as a salesperson, a manager, a business owner, or just as person in general should read this book."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"I read this book from the standpoint of someone who is trying to build up the loan and account portfolio at a branch (which I manage) of one of the nation's top 5 banks.That being the perspective of your reviewer, I found a lot of information in Mr. Mackay's book to be effective in helping me build my business.One example: until recently, I emotionally beat myself down each time I didn't land a new customer when going on business calls. In \\"Swim with the Sharks\\" Mackay says it's just fine to position yourself as \\"Number 2\\" in the prospects mind. That is, if you don't get the new account when you first visit the prospect don't worry about it. Use targeted persistence and over time, when that prospect's current service provider stumbles, you will be \\"number 2\\" in line and ready to serve their needs.Mackay then gives you a very detailed and specific framework to use so that you A) know how to persist and be positioned to move from #2 to #1 and B) don't tumble from the #1 spot once you get there.For more seasoned sales people this may be common knowledge. For most others, like me, the reasoning is so logical (yet under practiced) that it seems like it must be common knowledge.Since reading this book in late March, 2010 I have wrenched 2 new business customers from competing banks and I attribute these successes to not only the nuts-and-bolts in \\"Swim with the Sharks\\" but also to the confidence having these kinds of concepts and tools gives you.Mackay also touches on topics that will be of utility to entrepreneurs and business owners - a group I hope to join. In my current position these ideas help me better understand the mind of many of the people I serve while at the same time building my understanding for my own future independent endeavors.I purchased this book for $11.51. It is my opinion that the value is worth more than the price."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Some good nuggets in here. But if he were a great businessman, he wouldn't have gone into a commodity business like envelopes. He himself says, &quot;the margins are razor thin.&quot; And because it's such a commodity business, he needs to really overwhelm his customers, which includes his keeping extensive files on them, including information such as whether a customer is a member of alcoholics anonymous. A supplier keeping personal info about me like that in a file would make me want to cut him off as a supplier."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"I am generally very skeptical about inspirational/ \\"how-to better your life\\" type of books because most of them teach very practical common sense (and many times seem to be taking their target audience to be naive idiots).Mackay's book is however, different. I heard this book on cassette during the drive from/ to work, and found it to give wonderful advise and examples of negotiations, determination, management and salesmanship. I noted that some of his techniques I have used successfully even before reading this book. His ideas have inspired me to finetune my techniques, as well as learn some other important pointers which I was too complacent to note. With an attractive price, this is without question a BEST BUY."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"Starting from the assumption that these books cannot really change nobody's real life, I must say that this is a great book, simple and enjoyable, full of small but useful &quot;tips and tricks&quot;."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"At first I was skeptical of this book as another one of those &quot;here are some stories from my life&quot; books. However, Mackay manages to give relevant examples that can help anyone. In the same tradition as &quot;What they Don't Teach you at Harvard Business School&quot; - this book talks about lessons that you can either learn through other people's examples, or through your own life. Obviously, no book can teach you all the examples or even teach them as effectively as if they were to happen to you, but this book does a good job of being specific enough to be useful while being general enough that it can apply to more than just sales people.The point that Mackay makes is that there are many factors that influence a sale beyond the simple merits of the product/service itself. Many an entrepreneur, including myself, has believed that simply having the best product will make you the automatic leader. This is far from true. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"McKay has written an easy to read book for anyone in sales. Whether a rookie or pro, you WILL glean some hints and creative ways to stand out from your competition. No cheesy phone tricks that sound like they were written for another decade here. McKay shows you how to be professional and always deliver more than the customer expects. The &quot;McKay 66&quot; is worth more than the cost of this book! If you discover half of the &quot;66&quot; about your customers, your retention rate will skyrocket."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"One of the first business books I read. There are a lot of basic business lessons in this book. My business partner and I have quoted him for years because his lessons apply to entrepreneurs, not just sales people.Most companies don't seem to know the first thing about customer service. This book will remind or teach you that the details are important if you want to keep customers coming back."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"This is a great book, whether you're an MBA or just someone trying to get an advantage in everyday life. Harvey Mackay's lessons are to be treasured--he was way ahead of the curve in the mid-1980s. It may be hard to appreciate this today because some of the advice isn't fresh anymore: we all have phones in our cars and we all use answering machines to screen calls and we all take notes on the run on little portable recorders. --Well, many of us do, at any rate. Hardly revolutionary advice anymore, but that's only because we listened to Harvey in the first place.Some of the chapters contain gold that will always be valuable, however. One of my favorites involves the phrase &quot;Dusseldorf passes.&quot; I won't spoil it for the unread, but I will say the lesson from that chapter is one everyone should take with them through life. It will save you a lot of money and regret.And the Mackay hiring process. So thorough it seems to border on the obsurd, but the more I work at various companies the more I wish all businesses were as picky about acquiring workers. Harvey shows you that even &quot;lowly&quot; positions such as the receptionist or secretary are among your company's most critical, for 99% of your customers will get their first impression of your company--and in some cases the *only* impression of your company--through this crucial individual. Yet many companies get some 18-year-old part-timer to answer the phones and file valuable company documents--*and they're proud of this cost-cutting maneuver!* They consider this smart management. Harvey explains why this is actually a very dumb move.He also shows you how to get &quot;impossible&quot; tickets to the big game and how to get a reservation at virtually any hotel, even ones that are &quot;completely booked.&quot; And no, these are not devious ways. They're just common sense, actually.Whether you're an ambitious manager at a Fortune 500 company or an owner of a small businesses on the corner, this book has nuggets. So grab it. And then read the other books Harvey Mackay has written. While they didn't have the freshness or the impact of this first one (is that possible?) they are still well worth your time."},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"If you work for a paycheck or own a business, this book is great.

His book will inspire you to more success.Harvey is also an advocate of keeping informed via reading the major papers (USA Today, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, etc). This is great advice for anyone.

I studied first at the Xerox school of sales where they taught us \\"needs analysis selling\\" and noted that if your product fits your customers' needs, you'll have happy customers, a great reputation, repeat sales and free word of mouth advertising. And if you lie like a dog (they didn't say that exactly) and live like the stereotypical used car salesman, your business will die quickly.I loved this book because he reflected those same values. Work hard to understand your customers' needs, meet them. When you make a mistake, own it immediately and see how you can pay for it. I especially honed in on the part about the secretary being the eyes and ears of the boss. While on recruiting duty, I often went from media outlet to media outlet -- TV stations, radio stations, bill board companies, etc., asking if they would run Public Service Announcements for the Marines. While waiting for the decision maker, I had a lot of time to kill usually sitting in front of the secretary. MacKay told me to talk to the secretary, be cordial, learn about the business, about the business interests of its leadership, learn more about how to better serve the company. Many of these secretary conversations developed into major projects, including one where I took news crews from every major affiliate on a one-week tour of Marine Corps boot camp in San Diego.This book is so very worth the time, energy and money to consume it. Simply fantastic!"},{"Title":"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive (Without Being Eaten Alive)","review":"I feel kind of awkward writing about what I think about a book that, as of 2005, had sold 4 million copies. That would make this one the most successful business books of all time. Do you think that this book might have a tip or two for you if 4 million other people bought it? According to Harvey Mackay's Author's Note, \\"Swim with the Sharks\\" has now made its way to business schools across the country making it no longer a motivational book, but essential reading if you are in business today and hope to still be in business tomorrow.This book is a timeless business classic. When this book was released, I was in the Navy and, although I always had a desire to be in business, the time had not arrived. The first time I came across the book, I was unsuccessfully in car sales in 1991. I read about the Mackay 66 and I immediately asked the other sales reps how many of them were using the Mackay 66. They didn't even know what I was talking about. That was then, this is now. I ignored the book for another 20 years to my own detriment.Now, after having been in sales, business or some other facet of it, I realize that a lot of my past failures might have been avoided had I read this book many years ago. \\"Swim with the Sharks\\" will remain a business classic because, no matter how much technology advances, we will always be dealing with people in business. At the end of a computer, there is someone reading your email or your blog or reading your web site to see if they want to do business with you.Although this book was originally released before the PC revolution, email, Blackberries, iPhones and lots of the other wonderful technological advances we have these days, the information has been updated for this brave new world we live in. Each story has a different idea and a different moral that is vital to success in business. There is a reason that every top business book site or author lists this as one of the best.

In that it is focused on recreating that which was lost, it is a one sided retelling, but unlike another reviewer suggests, in this book, not all Europeans are demonized because of some politically correct guilt on the part of the author inspired by a trite view of the noble savage. Indeed, the actors in the vignettes related (men, women, Indians, Europeans, entire cultures, religions) are full of remarkable moral complexity and depth. Reading Genesis, one is left saddened at the tremendous loss, enriched by the sight of the magical colors Galeano pulls out of the air as he reconstructs lifestyles so thoroughly forgotten by modern culture, and finally embarassed by our darker human nature. In the end, it is the rapacious greed that destroyed so much that is indicted in this book. The writing is never heavy-handed despite the obvious ease with which one could attack the European practices; rather the author allows the stories of injustice to unfold and gives the reader the opportunity to understand how this has shaped the world we live in. This book is recommended reading for anyone who has forgotten what a great story history is."},{"Title":"Genesis (Memory of Fire Trilogy)","review":"Here is a typical complete chapter from surely the strangest book of history I've ever read.\\"1927: San Gabriel de Jalisco: A Child Looks On\\"The mother covers his eyes so he cannot see his grandfather hanging by the feet. And then the mother's hands prevent his seeing his father's body riddled by the bandits' bullets, or his uncle's twisting in the wind over there on the telegraph posts.\\"Now the mother too has died, or perhaps has just tired of defending her child's eyes. Sitting on the stone fence that snakes over the slopes, Juan Rulfo contemplates his harsh land with a naked eye. He sees horsemen -- federal police or Cristeros, it makes no difference -- emerging from smoke, and behind them, in the distance, a fire. He sees bodies hanging in a row, nothing now but ragged clothing emptied by the vultures. He sees a procession of women dressed in black.\\"Juan Rulfo, a child of nine, is surrounded by ghosts who look like him.\\"Here there is nothing alive -- the only voices those of howling coyotes, the only air the black wind that rises in gusts from the plains of Jalisco, where the survivors are only dead people pretending.\\"The Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano's trilogy Memory of Fire contains the books Genesis, Faces and Masks, and Century of the Wind, from the last of which this chapter comes. Taken together, the books make up a compendious and riveting history of the Americas (mostly Central and South America). But this is no academic history. It does follow a chronological timeline through the last five centuries or so. But each chapter tells a small story, like the one above. Hundreds of historical figures wander, curse, pray, converse, make love, die, are transformed or obliterated in these pages. And each story is an anecdotal parable that contributes to a single long history of almost total cruelty.And the history of The Americas is one of cruelty. Starting with the creation myths of several American Indian peoples, Memory of Fire continues through the history of those Indians prior to the invasions of their lands by Europeans, almost the only sanguine section of the entire trilogy. Then, Galeano proceeds to the invasions themselves, which include stories of myriad individual Indian headmen, priests and women warriors, mystic Indian truth tellers, those who would tell of future disasters, and tribal chiefs misled by their own oracles... as well as the thousands of adventurers, holy men fanatics, pirates, crazy dictators, soldiers, mercenaries, prostitutes and treasure seekers that came with the conquerors.The single constant theme in all this is that of the crushing defeat and murder of the defenseless by the powerful. Prior to the nineteenth century, the defenseless were all the Indians from both The Americas, and the Blacks who were brought to the American continents as slaves. Later the defenseless were made up of peons, indentured servants, peasants rendered landless by oligarchs and self-serving governments, Jews, socialists, communists and syndicalists, as well as those poor, ragged few Indians and Blacks still left standing.So... the nine year-old Juan Rulfo is witnessing the horror of an event during the Mexican Civil War of The Cristeros in the 1920s that was fought between conservative Catholic peasants and the leftist government of the president Plutarco Calles. Calles had disenfranchised The Church, taken away Church lands and basically banned the public display of almost every Church activity.I personally think that some version of this was a good idea, given the general treatment of Indians and peasants by the Church in South America for hundreds of years. It's a story of wholesale genocide justified by the prayerful murmurings of self-serving Catholic priests, beginning with those who accompanied Hernan Cortes. Someone like Bartolom&eacute; De Las Casas, a Spaniard who was the first bishop of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who defended the rights of the Indians before the Spanish court, was a distinct rarity. Most other priests victimized the Indians in the same way the secular conquistadores did, though with the direct approval of the Christian God, which made it even more shameful a history.What made The War of The Cristeros so strange was that it was fought by Mexican Catholic peasants in God's name against Calles's government, in order to maintain the ascendancy of established religion in Mexican society. That the majority of Mexican Church fathers stood to the side, caring little for the peasants, seems to have been lost on the peasants themselves. Thousands of them died horribly in this war.The rage of The Cristeros had been enflamed by official Church umbrage at anti-clerical government policies, and a few years later The Cristeros were hung out to dry when that official Church colluded with the government in a very cynical agreement to end the war. The peasants were used, they died in droves and then they were abandoned.Juan Rulfo himself went on to become a major Mexican literary figure, the man who wrote the novel Pedro Paramo, which is frequently cited as central to the South American \\"Boom\\" of such later writers as Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Isabel Allende, Mario Vargas Llosa and so many others. The spectral figures that Galeano writes about in the passage above are very like those that Rulfo himself describes in his story of a man's search through a heat-blasted Mexican countryside for the truth about his father Pedro Paramo.The Memory of Fire trilogy is made up of hundreds of such stories, and each gives a view of history that would almost never be found in the usual kinds of history books. Galeano was trained as a journalist, but it is my belief that he is a kind of inspired novelist/poet who, as it happens, found the vein for his work in the themes of history.You may need a more traditionally written history of South America to make complete sense of all the people of whom Galeano writes. But I think everything you'll need can actually be found in the amazingly encyclopedic bibliography that Galeano provides. Each chapter is punctuated with references to the books that he's read, in which he's found the stories he tells. Taken together, the books in his bibliography form a complete guide to the history of every country in The Americas, or at least of Central and South America.But Galeano's own interpretation of all this is, for me, the most emotionally truthful take on the history of South America that's ever been written.Terence Clarke (www.redroom.com)"},{"Title":"Genesis (Memory of Fire Trilogy)","review":"The author has drawn from many sources to compile this beautifully written history of the Americas, told in a couple of hundred short chapters, each a mini story of a legend or historical event presented in chronological order. Part one of the book, called \\"First Voices\\" recounts ancient legends and creation myths of the first peoples of the Americas, later comes contact with Europeans - the \\"discovery\\" years then conquest. Volume One of the trilogy takes the reader up to 1700 and recounts more stories from South America than the Caribbean or North America, though all parts of the Americas are touched.Wish now I had read this more slowly, rather than reading this straight through like a novel, a few of these chapters a night would have been better, so many horrific stories of cruelty, oppression and genocide one after another were hard to absorb, overwhelming greed is really the theme.

As an American, I am pleased. I'm referring here to the whole of the trilogy, not just its first volume. For those of you who want to learn the non-colonial-view of the Americas - the view of the defeated, of the enslaved, of the murdered - these books are the thing. The books are written, not in the conventional style of a history book, but in very brief chapters, each addressing one particular event. And through the mass of these seemingly isolated events, the history of these countries emerges in all its ruthlessness and grief. These books should make every reader reflect upon both past and present. I would like to remind the United States readers that, even though you call yourselves &quot;Americans&quot; and your country &quot;America&quot;, there's a lot more of it to the south as well!!! And, even though your country and ours share a painful common past, you have surmounted much of the suffering and social injustice that still take place here. In that sense, Galeano's trilogy is a deeply enriching path to social and historical awareness. I have only one criticism to make, and that concerns his treatment of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; and John Donne's &quot;To his Mistress going to Bed&quot;, which he scathingly depicts as samples of the worst colonialistic attitude. This uncharacteristically simplistic view deliberately misinterprets the works' context, and overlooks their great beauty in order to use them to make a political point. This is the only disappointing feature in an otherwise magnificent work."},{"Title":"Genesis (Memory of Fire Trilogy)","review":"I originally purchased the first volume of this Trilogy (Memory of Fire). After reading a few pages of the first volume, \\"Genesis\\", I rushed to get the remaining two volumes.Galeano has an amazing ability to write, even with translation, in a compelling and magnificent historical-fictional style. The narrative flows from year to year over the centuries in these volumes and gives the reader a wealth of knowledge that reshapes many of the \\"historical\\" accounts he or she has been taught. I suspect that is the case whether one is a citizen of the United States or not.Certainly, for the North American reader os Galeano's Triology, whether we are reading about the 1400's or 1900's, each page surprises. His work spans an immense ammount of time and the reader, perhaps not an historian, is amazed at the degree to which he or she has been utterly swept through history.Not an historian, myself, it is perhaps enough to say that the literary quality of these volumes is compelling. I have read the three volumes, given my set away to someone who had not read it, purchased it again and read it yet again.Accusations of \\"bias\\" against the work, which has its foundations in historical evidence, are improper.

With the arrival of Columbus, \\"history\\" proper, in the European sense of the word, begins.

He tells the stories of the New World's conquered and downtrodden in a series of short, sheering vignettes that blaze with depth and poetic fire. But unfortunately, his version of history is extremely one-sided. His book, as well as the entire trilogy, is in short, plagued by a bad case of politically correct guilt. Unfortunately in Mr. Galeano's book, all Spaniard's are corrupt, ruthless, gold-seeking conquerers and all native inhabitants are reduced to victim status. There were a significant amount of Spanish colonial voices who were the first ones in the New World to denounce slavery and mistreatment of the natives. Regretfully, this is a very skewed version of history. History is too complex to be this one-sided. When the historian, as well as the poet,loses this complexity, his retellings lose much of their force and persuasion."},{"Title":"Genesis (Memory of Fire Trilogy)","review":"This book was written 22 years ago, at the peak of a much needed, multiculturalist, revisionist second look at the human species, which we're moving past now. The deconstruction of history has been achieved and it's time to put it back together in all its complexity.But if you missed a peak into that world, in which natives are all good and invaders/immigrants all savage (save one), with Jesus as their Fuehrer, this is the book.(That's what most of history is, by the way, one people invading another. Even the Spanish were once conquered, enslaved and missionized!)I've read some of Galeano's sources in the original, and his fictionalization [he doesn't claim direct translation] puts the worst possible spin on situations taken creatively out of context. Example: Pope Paul III declared in 1537 that, even though they're not mentioned in the Bible or the writings of the ancients, the Americans were human beings. The reader is supposed to be aghast. But that conversation never even took place among Protestants! Good thinking, Paul III! There's a reason Latin America has all the Indians.The Spaniards often behaved atrociously, but where are the 100,000 victims of the Aztec temple of doom? The wailing of all those children can still be heard in the chronicles. Europe did not conquer Paradise; American natives were and are adults, allying their nations with whomever sought to defeat their enemies.When you paint people as good or bad, all the color is washed out of history, all the humor, the accidental delight, the love stories, the tragic misunderstandings and internecine squabbles - all of who we are.

H. Prynne--who, many would argue, is the most important living English poet. (See my review elsewhere on Amazon of the new edition of Prynne's collected poems.) Wilkinson is perhaps the most distinguished poet of the post-Prynne generation: what this volume shows is that the influence of Prynne, and of American poets like John Wieners, has never been an overwhelming one for Wilkinson: even the earliest poems collected here are startlingly assured. (In fact, it's the recent Wilkinson--in volumes like _Sarn Helen_ and _Flung Clear_--that has seemed most directly Prynnean. For instance, much of _Oort's Cloud_ can be read without the help of a dictionary.) The poems seem _wired_: despite their restlessness &amp; disjunctiveness, their confusion gives a good sense of what it must have been to be young &amp; bright &amp; stylish in the 1970s: you can almost hear the punk &amp; reggae soundtrack to some of the poems.The significance of this book is partly that it reconstructs so many projects that never saw print: after the opening selections from published books like _Aquamarine_, _The Central Line_ &amp; _Useful Reforms_, we get samples of quite a lot of projects which remained scattered in periodicals, like _Air Fleet Base_ and _Sweet Balsam Leaves_. It's a pity that the terrific _Tracts of the Country_ is only represented by one (long) section; &amp; that _Swarf: a prophecy_ is omitted (an ominous poem from the first year of Margaret Thatcher's reign: the cover of the original edition shows an assemblage of razorblades).

The motivation behind his hoax, which in the end only ruined himself, his wife, and his best friend, remains a mystery.

In the 1970, Irving was a hack spy novelist and Hughes was a reclusive millionaire who was in hiding. Irving prayed upon the Cloistered Hughes mythos, thinking that he would never come out and state Irving's book was a fake and a fraud. However the literary liar was exposed for what and who he was...And It didn't take Oprah to do it!Irving's biography showcased how he and a few other did a bogus con game on the publishing industry, which amazed many..and still does today. His book is a great tale of how he perpetrated his scam. This book read like a mystery story, but its all true. What amazes me is that it really happened.Narrative talent Joe Barrett is a marvel at creating verbal characters that seem real. I know I have never heard Clifford Irving speak... but in listening to him create Irving on audio, i assume I have.The biography is better on audio. It give this book more diamensions to this literary shell game and will amaze the audio listeners. Barrett tone is fast paced. I do not know who the director of this production was, but I would love to shake his/her hand on a job well done.The Hoax is no lie..it is a true chance to hear a con man spit cider in your ear as he did with the press and the publishing industry in the 1970's.

But that's the book... and this is the audiobook. I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and this might be the most ill-conceived production I've ever heard.

Where were the editors? How did Time/Life get caught under the wheels of this mess? Anyway, watching the Hughes themed movie \\"The Aviator\\" last week I was inspired and searched kindle titles and discovered this book. Great read. This story takes place in the salad days of pure 1970's innocence when celebrity was much harder to attain (Howard Hughes had earned his) and corporations were actually well regarded. Terrific insider story on exactly how the author schemed and the publishers were taken for a ride; exactly how the hoax was born and the aftermath (up till sentencing).The author Cliff Irving went to such great and wildly creative lengths to perpetuate this legendary hoax...it all seems rather innocent and nostalgic today considering the crimes corporations commit against society today. In many ways this is a feel good story as you witness these so called titans of American business (McGraw imprint, Time Inc) and east coast snob establishment types get caught with their profit motives ahead of common sense or ethics.

This book gives the reason for his fetishes in later life and his obsessions with power. I'd heard about his propensity to have the young starlets at his disposal, and I'd thought he must be quite a virile man.I see now how Clifford Irving was able to write the autobiography which proved to be a hoax. And why Hughes denounced it via the phone to the media instead of a personal appearance. He was a demented person by that time, from all reports. But he had led \\"the big life\\" frequenting the Coconut Grove and hobnobbing with Hollywood people. Coming from Houston, TX, and choosing his suits from Penney's, Woolworth's, and Sears (wearing tennis shoes as a standard), it had to be heady stuff. He had no social graces.This was a decadent age (1927) and, thank Goodness, he wasn't another Bugsy Berkley with his sexual orgies and apparitions. Howard had a love affair with the airplane, not women. He made a few movies using a sky-full of vintage airplanes called 'Hell's Angels,' then a controversial western, 'Outlaw,' in which a beautiful sunset was seen along with an overexposed Jane Russell. It was denied the seal of approval by a ten-man censorship board. He made a grand presentation of other stars' cleavage in earlier films, but was denied motion picture approval. It was released anyway.As a Texas industrialist, he turned out to be an innovator by removing the top wing so planes could fly above the weather. He bought TWA airlines from Jack Frye. He declared himself just an aviator, but he was a man before his time with his sheer determination to conquer the skies. Had he been in his prime during the Space Age, he should have had a chance at piloting the Space Shuttle.There were scandals with the women, though he appeared to enjoy touching planes more than women. He \\"interviewed\\" many young starlets under contract to him. He was clear at the end that aviation was the great love of his life. He was dubbed as capricious and eccentric, but mainly he was afraid of people -- paranoid, thinking there were spies in his midst to learn his secrets.The senator accused him of producing a dirty movie and making airplanes which don't fly. At the hearing, it was promoted that the whole world will see what he has become. When he successfully got that plane out of the water, it proved his ability to overcome his tarnished reputation. All his life he'd wanted to fly the fastest planes and be the richest man in the world. For a man who never smoked or drank (only milk), he made his mark for posterity.Clifford Irving became something of a celebrity before and after the telephone interview Hughes gave to refute the book. It is a masterpiece but should perhaps been labeled 'fiction' and been just an ordinary thing no one would want to read. As it was, it became a sensation."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"I was a young person at the time of the world-wide controversy surrounding the publication of the Hughes \\"autobiography,\\" and needless to say it was front-page news.By this time Hughes had not been seen or heard from by the public for more than a decade and many people felt he was dead, perhaps in an accident around the time he \\"disappeared.\\" And in the shroud of mystery emerges a book on his life that Hughes granted the author - Irving - unprecedented access through a series of interviews on his life.Then came the debate on the validity of the book, which was only solved by the eccentric billionaire ending his silence - not in front of a camera, but through a long-distance phone call to a panel of journalists who knew Hughes from years past.I purchased The Hoax as one who was absolutely fascinated in how Irving nearly pulled off the crime. And if it wasn't for the phone call by Hughes to state the book was a fraud it can be argued that the debate would have continued for years, but Irving's deception would have been successful. The reality was Irving believed Hughes was too ill to repudiate the book.The Hoax remains one of the favorite books I ever read."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"This book has the ring of truth to it, and that is unmistakeable. It's the story of a writer who hoodwinked the world by writing the hoax autobiography of billionaire Howard Hughes, and paid the price by going to prison. It reads like a novel, in the sense that it's thrilling, and you understand Clifford Irving to the bone. It's well-paced, filled with memorable characters and incidents, and if there were ever a book to nail down the sin of greed in both individuals and corporations, this is it. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"The drama of this tale makes it a page turner (or in the case of an audiobook a long-listener). Yet it is, at its center, somewhat unsatisfying because the author and main character seems blissfully unaware of how his behavior might affect others. As he flies around the world on his mad adventure, enjoying his extramarital affairs with seemingly little reflection as his wife is committing bank fraud for him at home, he lies to friends and business partners as if the whole matter were out of his control.The amazing coincidences, strokes of luck and close calls are the stuff of great fiction. As the author writes himself into his own movie, his fictional autobiography and the fiction he must create for the people at McGraw Hill become simply two parts of one elaborate writing project. As you see him encounter one close call after another, you want him to get away with it, yet you know that there is only one possible outcome. He's going to be caught.The book becomes much less satisfying as it moves into Irving's downward trajectory as his hoax is unraveled and the consequences loom, as it certainly was for the author. The pain inflicted on his wife through both the legal ramifications of the hoax and the revelation of Irving's affairs are difficult to read. Irving does express remorse for that and for lying to one or two friends, but in general he seems to view his hoax as a victimless joke.McGraw Hill is a corporation done in by greed in his tale, and the people who were duped and whose reputations surely took a beating, most likely would find that compounded by this book. Their crime was believing Irving and standing behind him, and for that the author says at one point that he sometimes thought he should cheer about what he had done-- that he had exposed the limits of corporate greed and stupidity.I was especially bothered by way one of the editors, a woman who he chose as his first patsy because she had been loyal to him throughout his career, was voiced in the audio book edition. While it is difficult for an actor to differentiate between all the character's voices, I found it distracting that this publishing professional spoke like a bubble-headed valley girl. She may not have come across as quite so unintelligent and easily fooled in the Irving text, as she did in the audio version in which she spoke like an unreflective teenager discussing the latest MTV reality show. This seemed particularly unfair to this listener.So why were the McGraw Hill team so easily hoodwinked? I do not believe it was a simple case of greed and corporate stupidity. There was certainly some group-think and excitement over possibly having the coup of their careers might have clouded their judgement. But they were fooled for the same reason the story fascinates the reader-- who would have the audacity to claim to have written the autobiography of a living person and think they could get away with it? Only someone truly crazy would think that the living person and his organization would ignore such a thing. The unlikeliness of such a scenario is bound to make people believe. The lie is more credible than the truth.In the end, I was left with the feeling that the damage his caper caused to other people (with the exceptions of his wife and children) was more fictional to the author than the Howard Hughes he created in his mind.When he is asked if he would do it again, he says he would not. But his remorse is not for others. He says he would not repeat his fraud because \\"I have lost too much.\\"I was taken by the audacity and cleverness of the hoax, and propelled by the drama, I would like to have had a more sympathetic main character. Of course, that is a lot to ask from a book by someone with the personality to pull such a thing in the first place."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"I had avoided reading this book, although several friends recommended it. Finally I read it, because there's a movie coming out soon (Richard Gere plays Irving) based on the events. I discovered that it's an amazing story about a man who defied and bilked the literary establishment and the Howard Hughes hierarchy and at the same time -- this was in 1972 -- enraged Richard Nixon's White House and may indeed have been the prime reason that the Nixon gang broke into the Watergate (to find out if Irving had given the Democrats secret information about Hughes' \\"loans\\" to Nixon).Yes, Irving was a rogue, but what a delightful and literate rogue. Moreover, the book is one of the best written first-person narratives I've ever read; it's wise and witty at the same time as it's a gripping tale. People wonder if Irving told the truth in the book.

I know he's meant to be a rogue, but I also know he's one of our best living writers, who has written some splendid novels (including \\"Trial\\", \\"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa,\\" and the great art forgery tale, \\"Fake.\\") This current book, a first-person account of the Howard Hughes Hoax back in the 70s, is the way memoirs are meant to be written: from the heart, witty, with not a word out of place. You read this and you think, \\"I'd like to know this man.\\" He's wise and droll and he's led an adventurous life that few of us even dream of. You can't go wrong, in my opinion, with a Clifford Irving book, and this is one of his best."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"Love him or hate him, Clifford Irving sure can write. The Hoax is an absolute page turner from start to finish; I am about three quarters of of the way through the book and counting the minutes until I can return home and dive into it again. Clifford Irving lived an incredible life even before turning to forgery: living on a houseboat in Kashmir, living in Mexico, a couple of European wives, an internationally famous mistress, and then fleecing a major US corporation. It is just a great read!"},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"Clifford Irving certainly knows how to spin a yarn. Once you get into this book, it's hard to put it down, even if you know the outcome. In fact, it's even more difficult to stop reading when you know exactly what's going to happen. During the last few chapters, as Irving is plummeting to his doom, the tension is almost unbearable.I originally picked up this book because after I had seen the movie I was left with a lingering question. What motivated Clifford Irving to pull the biggest literary hoax of the century? Lack of success, as implied in the movie, simply didn't seem to be enough reason to concoct such an elaborate far-fetched scheme--one which would require forgery, fraud, larceny, a year of research, false passports, fake Swiss bank accounts, numerous trips to the Caribbean, infidelities, lies, the ruination of long-standing friendships, and the loss of his marriage and family. Irving put everything on the line in order to pull a fast one on McGraw-Hill Publishers, not to mention Time-Life Corporation, the mass media and, of course, Howard Hughes, the multi-billionaire recluse whose autobiography Irving faked.The answer to that question was not, as his friend and co-hoaxter, Richard Suskind put it, to perform an \\"act of anarchy.\\" While a desire to sow chaos may well have inspired Suskind, what motivated Irving was something more profound. Clifford Irving simply could not live the humdrum life of \\"cutting along the dotted line.\\" Towards the end of the book, Irving says, \\"The whole Hughes affair had been a venture into the unknown, a testing of myself, a constant gauntlet of challenge and response.\\" Getting caught was both the danger and the beauty of the hoax; it made Clifford Irving feel alive.In spite of everything, it is hard not to admire the man. In another day and age he would have conquered the world, or stolen it. Perhaps he would have started a revolution or a religion. The fact of the matter is that the modern world has no use for a person who must test himself by challenging the foundations of society. Laws are there to protect us from renegades like Clifford Irving. Nevertheless, deep in our hearts, a lot of us wish we had the chutzpah to pull off a hoax of such \\"reckless and artistic splendour.\\"Toujours l'audace."},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"This is the story of a man's scam to write the biography of Howard Hughes. He was able to scam his New York publishing house (McGraw Hill) by convincing them that Howard Hughes had commissioned him to write his authorized biography. His \`hoax' made global newspaper headlines and was heralded as the biggest media scam of all time.This book will relate how Clifford Irving almost pulled out this stunt by opening fake Swiss accounts, writing forged letters, using false passports, and conducting faked interviews. He almost pulled it off!I liked this book, but I found the beginning a bit slow. The part where the author relates his life story was a bit boring for my taste. However, I did like his narrative on how he almost pulled out this stunt.The goal of writing the authorized biography of Howard Hughes was to make money; in fact, over one million dollars. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us and the estate of Howard Hughes, he got caught. But the irony is that he probably ended up amassing more than the million dollars he had hoped for. The \`Hoax', written by him, became a worldwide sensation, and is now a major motion picture starring Richard Gere.In French there is a saying that says, \\"Rira bien qui rira le dernier\\". Basically, he who laughs first laughs last. Clifford Irving might have conned us after all!Afterthought: For a man who almost conned us, how do we know his story of how he pulled the scam is real? Did all the events he described in the book \`The Hoax' really happen, or is this a hoax within a hoax?"},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"This book is so enjoyable to read! Clifford Irving narrates this story in sequential order and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out what happens! His writing style is very good and I enjoyed every minute of this book. I felt I knew every one of the characters and I felt for them, too! I was amazed at how easily he fooled so many people. It all started out so simple but then got out of control. I wondered and still wonder if it was really Howard Hughes at the press conference. He should have been forced to show himself to prove he was really still living. I can't believe that it took so long to make this great story into a movie. You can't make stuff like this up! I haven't seen the movie. Irving says it is nothing like the book, so I'll probably catch it on free TV some day. If you want to read an entertaining book, read this one! You won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Hoax","review":"Enough good reviews have been written, so I will simply say that this was a fantastic read. It was upsetting in the end to read about what trouble he caused for others and one person in particular, but although I felt upset with Irving, at the same time I could not deny that it added to the emotional impact of the book, making it even more powerful. I read Trial years ago which was also terrific, and I am ready to read more by Irving, who is one of the few great authors on a vast plain of mediocrity."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"The G&amp;D books cover a lot of territory. Each section begins with a short design history followed by an overview of the design, broken down into categories (armament, protection, propulsion plant, etc). When it comes to understanding a ship's armor scheme, there's no substitute for seeing a series of drawings; stats-in-a-vacuum like those in a Conway's are less than useless, and a token cross section gives only a glimpse. G&amp;D provide a fully realized picture. The chapter on the Bismarck class is blemished by a lack of definitive information; only now is the extent of the 80mm weather deck generally becoming known, and G&amp;D label it as 50mm throughout. In fact, plenty of questions remain on Bismarck and Tirpitz and their differences, so it's hard to fault G&amp;D for this.Another weakness is the reference to gun penetration data based on USN calculations; the formula for these calculations was actually intended to predict performance against homogenous armor, and its most common application has been for face-hardened armor. Thus they serve to be indicative only in the most general sense--in other words, why bother?I find it easier to pick out the nits than to try to elaborate on the battery of qualities in the three books. They sit on the shelf within easy reach, and I refer to them regularly."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"FIRST THOUGHTS: THIS VOLUME WAS MY FAVORITE OF THE TRILOGYI have read many books about this subject and this volume adds some fresh perspectives and details to what I have already come to understand. Although no book on the subject can be considered either perfect or all-inclusive this series and this specific volume in particular is comprehensive and organized in a very easy and useful format making it a 'must-have' for those with an intense interest in Battleships.IN A NUTSHELL: CASE STUDIES OF 7 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT CLASSES OF DREADNOUGHTS FROM 4 COUNTRIESCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTIONCHAPTER TWO: THE YAMATO CLASSCHAPTER THREE: THE SCHARNHORST CLASSCHAPTER FOUR: THE BISMARCK CLASSCHAPTER FIVE: GERMANY THE \\"H\\" CLASS BATTLESHIPSCHAPTER SIX: THE \\"O\\" CLASS BATTLECRUISERSCHAPTER SEVEN: THE VITTORIO VENETO CLASSCHAPTER EIGHT: SPAINCHAPTER NINE: CONCLUSIONAPPENDIXESA- STABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BISMARCK CLASSB- INBOARD PROFILE AND DECK PLANS OF THE BISMARCKC- BATTLESHIP AND BATTLECRUISER GUNSWHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: THE ZENITH OF A NATIONS TECHNOLOGY & POWERBOTTOM LINE: THE FINAL VOLUME OF AN AWESOME HISTORIC TRILOGYAfter a complete reading of the entire trilogy, I feel, I now better understand the construction and design considerations that lead to a completed Dreadnought.

After reading this series I feel better able to grasp the technical materials that I will have to deal with as I continue to delve into the fascinating topic of 'Dreadnoughts'."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"The authors of this book complete their trilogy on capital ships of the World War II era with this book. They examine WWI development, the Washington Naval Conference and its effect on pre WWII designs, the escalator clause and wartime developments affecting the battleships and battlecruisers of Japan, Germany, Italy and Spain. Spain is included among the Axis powers due to Franco's right wing regime and aid received from Germany and Italy during the civil war. Step by step details of the design of Yamato and the inherent weakness of her underwater protection are discussed. The gunnery comparisons between Yamato and Iowa are surprising. The chase and sinking of Bismarck and Scharnhorst are detailed and the weaknesses in German designs are pointed out. Finally, the authors compare capital ships in four design areas: 1) battlecruisers 2} 35,000 ton designs 3) 45,000 ton designs 4) 45,000 plus ton designs. There are gunnery tables included at the end for comparison of contemporary naval artillery. This book, along with their books on Allied and US Battleships, belongs on the shelf of any wargamer or warship historian/enthusiast."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"I have had a long time interest as a historian and having had personal connections with the sea, I have built up a library for about 30 years which includes the significant texts on naval construction. I have all three of the Dulin/Garzke books, and of the three books the tome on Axis/Neutral ships is by far the best production. I suspect, though, that the tome on Axis/Neutral ships is better only because the authors have had to learn something about writing in their two prior attempts. The &quot;strengths&quot; of Dulin &amp; Garzke are in assessing engineering, and in condensing text for a supposed &quot;average adult&quot; to follow the history of a ship. Unfortunately, Dulin &amp; Garzke miss the point: the average reader with an interest in naval architecture is most likely to have technical experience with, or possesses graduate-school background, which calls for a greater depth of writing (and dedication to subject) by the author. For example, we get tantalizing hints of strategic considerations in discusing the German &quot;Z&quot; program, but the reader would walk away from the book not understanding that there was a Japanese &quot;super battleship&quot; concept in mind which produced the Yamatos. The discussions about armour and gunnery are acceptable, but again the reader with a greater interest in nautical history walks away unsatisfied. Tabular material is decently presented, and the faults of prior texts (such as an incomprehensible armour key) are avoided. On the other hand, the reader is given pictures which are all-too common in the literature; the most interesting presentations are on the B-65 class and the proposed Italian and Spanish designs. Here again, when one expects Dulin &amp; Garzke to go &quot;deeper&quot; into the material, the trail ends abruptly. At least in this book Dulin &amp; Garke avoid the farce of presenting the same picture 5 times (!) as in the treatment of the Montana class. I have considered this book &quot;acceptable&quot; but I hold forth that Dulin &amp; Garzke would have brought forth a trio of superlative books if the authors had done more digging and possessed greater dedication to the material."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"After a very brief history of political influences on warship construction between the wars (mostly discussion of the disarmament treaties and the compliance or non-compliance of the affected navies) and another very brief discussion of warship design basics, we are given the meat of the book--Very detailed coverage of a few selected ship classes from each of the Axis navies. A brief operational history of each ship class is followed by exhaustive discussion of technical details. The authors assume great familiarity with naval terminology and technology by the reader, and don't slow down to cover anything that might be new to you. But the detailed critiques and comparisons are fascinating. Highly recommended for warship buffs who want to know it all about these particular ships. Note that it is not a \\"complete\\" guide to Axis battleships, and doesn't pretend to be one.Nits include that the paper doesn't give best advantage to allow the reader to examine details of some of the excellent photos, and the size of the photos isn't all we could wish for in some cases where the original photo apparently contains a lot of detail--This is not a picture book, so perhaps judging it by those standards is unfair.Other nits include that the book is now 25 years old, and in some cases new knowledge has come to light that would influence some of the conclusions here.Final nit is that as mentioned, in some cases those who aren't professional marine architects, or at least extremely enthusiastic amateurs will be thumbing through reference books to uncover some of the terminology.An essential book for those with a deep interest in these warships."},{"Title":"Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II","review":"I'm not a full time literary critic, just someone who bought this book and is disappointed. I will not list the positive sides of a book that sets you back 76 $. They should be obvious. The first 10 minutes of going thru the pages without reading much though, held three major disappointments for me. Had I been in a bookstore, I would have put the book down and not bought it, thinking it's not worth the money. Here is what put me off:1.) The line drawings look like twice xeroxed before they were printed. Large parts of thin lines (e.g. antenna lines) are missing. I can live with this in a paperback, but not here.2.) Photos in general are of poor quality. A book of that price should provide glossy paper for photo pages.3.) The photo on page 216 is the wrong way round.4.) The text with the photo on page 269 is totally misleading. It refers to the battleship Tirpitz and shows the snow covered scenery of a Norwegian fjord. In the upper left hand corner you see a mid-sized ship, the bow facing you. It is the only major ship in the picture and it has two support boats moored on either side. The caption says: &quot;... The German battleship is moored to the right, off the island of Aaroy...&quot; What does that mean now? Does it mean the ship depicted is Tirpitz, and there is an island Aaroy to the left outside the frame? Or does it mean the ship that the full page photo refers to (Tirpitz) is not in the picture, but somewhere off to the right, and nobody seems to know (or be willing to mention) who the only big ship in the picture is? The ship shown is either Hipper or Prinz Eugen, both heavy cruisers, both stationed in Norwegian fjords, both operating with and without Tirpitz. It is not the battleship Tirpitz, as Garzke and Dulin make believe. Poor work.I quit reading the book after that."},{"Title":"Sideshow Kissinger, Nixon,and The Destruction of Cambodia","review":"Though the book itself was in alright condition, as advertised, the book which I received bore a distinct visual difference from what was advertised; I purchased from this buyer because the photo depicted the larger edition of Sideshow, complete with red cover and, I had assumed,larger print. I can't say if this assumption is correct because I did not receive a book with a cover even remotely resembling the product photo. The book I received was the small version, with an entirely different cover art. While this may seem like a petty complaint, the underlying problem is that I was not accurately shown what I was buying, made doubly frustrating when I payed more to buy from this vendor specifically because I thought I was getting the larger version which, I have been told, is much less of an eye-strain to read. I would not buy from this vendor again; if possible, I recommend forking out the extra few cents to get something from another vendor. This way, at least, you will likely know exactly what it is that you're buying."},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans","review":"Having read several other books of this series, as an American who has lived abroad, I looked forward to reading this book on Americans. I was disappointed. While other books in the series, despite the \\"xenophobic\\" titles, tend to temper their criticism with kindness, the feeling that I got from this book was the author's condescending contempt for her fellow citizens. I would have hoped that the author would have shown more sympathy for her subject. The overall negativity of the book notwithstanding, she made many good points. However, I find it sad and inaccurate that she did not balance her often accurate jabs with sympathetic understanding and some portrayal of some of the good qualities of the American culture.For those looking for an insightful, often critical, very humorous, and yet sympathetic view of Americans, I would highly recommend either of Bill Bryson's books on America: \\"The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America\\" and \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away\\"."},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans","review":"This series is an entertaining, short read that anybody with a sense of humor can enjoy.

In order to understand how accurately the series would portray the Dutch, I read this one to see how accurately it reflected American culture and values. **Spot on!**Some people commented on it that it is overly negative--maybe that shows how accurate it is! As an American, you will find yourself reading it, possibly being offended by it (which is, after all, very American), and then, realizing how truthful it is, laughing at its witty satire.

This book is at times funny, sometimes informative, but often sarcastic and condescending toward americans. The exaggerations might be considered merely ridiculous if not for the sad impact on an unwary international visitor. Really, for shame. Statements such as \\"most americans aren't fully aware that Canada is a separate sovereign nation\\" ....really? you have got to be kidding, stupid or lying. Or how about that teen pregnancy is due to a lack of sex education. Really? Do you really think that is the case in our sex saturated culture? Sex ed programs were undoubtedly less useful say, back in the 1940's than they are today and yet we have this teen pregnancy problem now. I would suggest there are other societal factors at work rather than blaming suboptimal sex ed. This book contains only a few useful truisms scattered throughout. I wonder if the author tries too hard to demean americans and be sarcastically funny in the hope that she will enjoy some favor from internationals for doing so. The Culture Shock series overall is hands down better than the Xenophobe series. I have not read the Culture Shock USA title, but based on other reads I would wager it is far better."},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans","review":"It is a very useful starting guide to understand the American life !"},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans","review":"This is a great gift to give to someone coming to American or to a foreigner living in the US.

It was a very funny little book, took less than an hour to read. As long as I remained undefensive (I am an American), I enjoyed it. However, I would say that the book is more meant for humor than for actually understanding the culture. Several times the author mentioned atypical examples, or outrageous happenings, to get a point across (e.g. ordering frozen vegetables online). However, some of the examples, despite their absurdity, were dead on! Like I said, it is a very funny book, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.

The author constantly harps on typical, uninteresting stereotypes. Unfortunately, what you get is a glaringly oversimplified view of Americana and a constant taste of her sense of disdain to her subject. While I agree that many American tributes and even stereotypes should be brought up, discussed and lampooned - this work would be infinitely better if they took a chapter from the author's of the Xenophobe's Guide to the Germans (or others) where they manage to simultaneously poke fun at themselves and their fellow countrymen yet one always senses an underlying importantly pride in being German in this humour. I actually agreed with and enjoyed small portions of this book, however, in general the reader mostly walks away with a hollow interpretation of Americans molded by the author's sense of contempt and superiority to her fellow countrymen."},{"Title":"The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans","review":"I initially got this book to use as a judge for all the other books in the Xenophobe Guide series. Final verdict? Not worth the money. While this is a funny book and well worth the hour it takes to read, it is a description of Clinton-era American culture, and ultimately fails at capturing the last 15-20 years of cultural development since publication. The most obvious example would be where they say \\"no American truly believes that anyone can grow up to be president.\\" This is clearly false: take for example the current president. Other examples include the long discussion on America being the biggest driving culture in the world (we actually have fewer cars per capita than any other developed Western country), the failure to include more information on American Hispanic culture, failure to address the culture wars; the list goes on. None of that was a fault of the book; it was a good representation of the country in 1994, when the book was written. It was theoretically updated, but its repeated references to Clinton clearly indicate the author's frame of reference, and the book never really moves on from that perspective.It's an interesting and funny book, but I would not recommend it as a guide to American culture. I would buy another Xenophobe's Guide to try it out, but unfortunately the publication date listed in the Amazon info is the date of \\"updating\\" rather than when the books in the series were actually written.

That's actually not true. The word \\"like\\" in \\"just LIKE you and me\\" is used as a preposition to convey relatedness of one thing to another. Since it's used as a preposition, the pronouns (\\"you\\" and \\"me\\" or \\"I\\") that follow must be objective (as in OBJECT of the preposition) case rather than subjective case. \\"You\\" is both a subjective and objective case pronoun. \\"I\\" is a subjective case pronoun, while \\"me\\" is an objective case pronoun. Therefore, \\"me\\" is the appropriate choice and \\"just like you and me\\" is gramatically correct.Why the grammar lesson? One of the things I love about Eric Carle books is that the grammar is always correct.

All are essential for successful early reading."},{"Title":"Does a Kangaroo Have a Mother, Too?","review":".Some readers (particularly adults) may find this recent book by the venerable Eric Carle a little bit on the repetitive side or even short of plot. However the target audience for this book (2 to 4 YO's) are expert practitioners in the art of the repeated question .... with slight variations of course.This book will appeal to the instinctive nature of young children to want to learn by covering the same ground (with slight variations of course) by going over a topic again and again (and again!)The success of this book, shows the value of well structured rote learning. When done in an appealing way, like Mr Carle does, it is totally natural. The dynamic links between each question, page and animal will draw children along. The reward at the end of the book is the assurance that &quot;animal mothers love their babies just as yours loves you&quot;.If you find yourself saying to your kids &quot;how many times do I have to tell you&quot; then perhaps spending some time with this book may be just as instructive to you as it is to the children.This book compares well with &quot;The Hungry Caterpillar&quot; where we learnt about numbers and time and tummy aches!

Here are some important notes:1) Theonomy does not \\"stand or fall\\" based on Bahnsen's _50 page_ exegesis of St. Matthew 5:17 ff. While it is integral, the reviewer who stated this below, I would wager, did not read the book. Theonomy is a _framework_ that is developed exegetically and logically from the entire Bible, starting in Genesis and ending in Revelation. Bahnsens' _30 page index_ of Bible passages at the end should have been a clue. There is not one passage in the Bible regarding the law that Bahnsen does not use, I am sure. He brilliantly coheres the Torah with Sts. Paul, James, Peter, and John in a manner that is _consistent with Reformed Orthodoxy_. He is firm that there is _nothing new_ in this book. The church has historically believed the thesis contained here, and he frequently goes as far back as Tertullian and Augustine to show this. I cannot emphasize this more: theonomy is developed from the _entire Bible_.2) This book is big. It reads big. It does not read like a concise, epigrammatic literary masterpiece (like many of Rushdoony's shorter books do). Instead it is meticulous, thorough, repetitive, painstaking--big. You feel like you're reading a masterwork when you're reading it. It feels big in your hands; it feels big in your head. Some people like this; some don't.3) Even so, Bahnsen's language is known for its supreme clarity and cogency. His repetition is welcomed (as far as I am concerned), and his laconic summaries are each highly quotable. It is a joy to read.4) What can bog the reader down is the _insane amount_ of Biblical references, which is obviously a good problem to have. Frequently, Bahnsen will assert something and then parenthetically include upwards of 20+ references. In the preface he asks the reader to check him on it, so do it! You won't regret it! My knowledge of how to interpret the Bible greatly augmented by following his references. His immense encyclopedic knowledge of the Bible can be overwhelming at times, but you'll come out for the better.5) Bahnsen's knowledge of Greek is also a bit overwhelming, as seen in both the 50 page exegesis of Matthew 5 and the amazingly insightful appendix 1, an exegesis of Galatians 3. While he throws around a plethora of Greek vocabulary and grammar, he usually explains it all particularly before plugging it in the interpretation; this allows the reader to still check him on his work by referencing Greek dictionaries, &c.; It must be said though that his painstaking approach to Greek grammar, while enlightening to the core, can bog the reader down at moments (I won't lie).6) Bahnsen presents an existential theory here; don't feel that you won't be edified! This book is uplifting, encouraging, and exhortative.Some random points you will learn about: the Holy Spirit (in the context of the Old Covenant as well); a crash course (over 100 pages) on Biblical political theory; a crash course (30 pages) on anti-theonomic philosophy of many types (for more, see his _Van Til's Apologetic_...that's 800 pages); Dispensationalism; Covenant Theology; Bible interpretation; everything you ever wanted to know about the nature and use of Law (duh); the nature and use of Grace, Faith, and Love; &c.;You owe it to your spiritual life and church vows to read this book! Kierkegaard says to \\"realize yourself before the face of Christ.\\" Bahnsen shows how to do this in some of the most neglected and important ways.It'll humble you, instruct you, and exhort you."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Greg Bahnsen in this work offers the world a comprehensive hermeneutical lens by which all of life is to be viewed -- viz. God's Law.Bahnsen begins with a masterful exegesis of Matthew 5:17-20 and the following reproof of the Pharisees which lays the foundation for his thesis. Bahnsen does such a thorough job of refuting the competing views that, I must say, Mr. Cunningham (the reviewer above) has an impossible task before him (i.e., to refute Bahnsen).Bahnsen cogently presents Theonomy as a foundation to Christian thought which one cannot do without if the Christian community is to be faithful to the Word of God.He proposes that not only is the Christian to bow before the Law of God in all of life, but that ALL MEN in every realm are expected to conform to God's Law. This includes even the civil magistrate, which should rule society according to the eternal bar line of the Law's justice.He furthermore recoils at any Church/State union, but shows that Church and State alike have only one standard: God's Law. Thus, there should be a sort of checks and balances between the two administrations -- the Church holding the State accountable to rule according to the Law, and the State protecting the rights of the Church, while making sure the Church does not exceed its rights in society (e.g., by administering capital punishment, etc.).There has been much misunderstanding and controversy especially over Bahnsen's (and Theonomy's) proposal that the Law's penal sanctions should likewise be administered, which would basically amount to capital punishment for adultery, rape, homosexuality, abortion, and other crimes. Many have seen this as an element of an all too harsh OT ethic. However, if that be the case (that the OT penal sanctions are too harsh), then that would be tantamount to saying 2 very astounding things:(1) God's morality changes(2) God's perfect Law (Ps. 19) is not perfect, since it is not truly just.This is unreasonable and impugns the integrity and righteous character of God. To be faithful to God's Law for society, the civil magistrate must rule according to God's Law in every jot and tittle.I could go on and on recommending Bahnsen's book, but suffice it to say that EVERY Christian should read this book to understand how God's Law should apply to his/her life.A MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"First let me say this: This book reads like a thesis (and as it started out as a thesis for a Master of Theology degree, that makes sense). But what a Biblically substantiated, exegetically sound, and theologically insightful thesis it is - by a truly gifted theologian, teacher, and communicator!It is so very rare that one comes across a book in which after finishing it he can say, \\"This book has truly altered the course of my life.\\" If there is any one book - obviously apart from the Bible itself - of which this can be said by me, it is Greg Bahnsen's \\"Theonomy in Christian Ethics.\\"The theonomic principle as stated by Bahnsen is simply this: \\"By 'theonomy' I will mean that verbalized law of God which is imposed from outside man and revealed authoritatively in the words of Scripture\\" (p. 35). Theonomy is God's Law - over against man's self-law - applied in all areas of life, both in the church and in society.While throughout the history of the church it was taken on assumption that the Old Testament had abiding validity unless something in the New Testament was revealed to have cancelled or changed it in some way, in today's evangelical world just the opposite view seems to be the one most widely held: that unless a commandment is repeated in the New Testament, we should assume it no longer has abiding validity (a view with many more problems than one might think).And so Bahnsen lays out cogently, articulately, and (most importantly) Biblically in 563 pages his thesis that the Old Testament Law is just as much applicable today as it was in the days before Christ, even in the area of the civil magistrate.Bahnsen's main passage of exegesis is with Matthew 5:17-20 where he demonstrates very impressive historical research and exegetical skill in showing that in a more accurate translation of the text into English, Jesus said: \\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to establish [or confirm] them\\" (v17) - rather than the traditional translation of \\"fulfill them.\\"We're talking 50 pages of exegesis on one passage of Scripture. So if any criticism can be made about this part of the work it's not that Bahnsen wasn't thorough in his research and analysis. As a matter of fact, it is this particular exegesis that Bahsnen sees as his main theological contribution to the topic of theonomy; for he is certainly not the first to hold a theonomic position. Even so, his argument is probably one of the most articulate and compelling.Even apart from this translation though he shows that the entire law according to Jesus has abiding validity. Not just the moral law; not just the judicial law; but the entire law! And what a work of theological scholarship in demonstrating this!Throughout the book there are an abundant amount of examples Bahnsen gives - too many to cite in a review. But suffice it to say that the people of the New Testament clearly understood that there was an abiding validity of the Old Testament - even if some forms of it had been changed or further clarified.As the book progresses, after Bahnsen firmly establishes Christ's own view of the law and its abiding validity, he then turns his attention to one of the most widely held misconceptions of theonomy:(1) Theonomy is a form of legalism.Of course as soon as Bahnsen says that the New Testament speaks of the Law of God as having abiding validity even in the New Testement era, it will surely call for a resounding rebuttal of \\"we are not under law but under grace.\\"And it is very true that we are not under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). That is surely the case as it pertains to our justification, position in Christ and our ability to keep the law.But as one continues reading this very passage he finds that it is just because Christ offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, died as our substitution, and rose again for our justification that we are no longer enslaved to our own sinful nature but are free and empowered to keep the law of God. \\"For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification\\" (Rom. 6:19).Just as Paul says \\"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law\\" (3:28) in seemingly the very same breath he says \\"Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law\\" (3:31).As Bahnsen demonstrates, the law is not sin, and the opposite of the law is not grace. Where law and grace are contrasted is in our ability to keep the law. The law can tell us what God's moral requirements are - but it cannot in the slightest help us meet those requirements. But grace - grace in Christ meeting those requirements once for all on our behalf, and grace in the Spirit by transforming us and meeting those requirements in us in our daily sanctification - grace gives us the power, the ability to keep the law (though because of our remaining sinful nature we will not keep it perfectly this side of glory).So as a power for enabling believers to keep God's moral standards, grace can be, and should be, pitted against law (Rom. 7-8). But regarding moral standards themselves, regarding \\"law\\" - law's opposite is not grace, but sin, i.e. \\"lawlessness\\" (1 Jn. 3:4).Theonomy understands this distinction and all the more to a better understanding of the gospel and conversely the gospel's distortion in true legalism. In fact it's precisely because theonomic doctrine holds such a high view of God's law that it is all the more drastically against pharisaical legalism. If one ever endeavors to keep God's law (not one's own law, but God's true law) on his own terms, in his own strength, he will ultimately come to terms as Paul did, that he cannot do it (Rom. 7:18-19) - that he has to be delivered by Christ and enabled by Him to live a life that is pleasing to Him (Rom. 7:22-8:11).So it turns out that theonomy is anything but legalistic. The higher regard a system of doctrine has for God's law, the quicker and more severely it will drive the sinner to repentance and to the grace of Christ for salvation and sanctification. So as theonomy by its mere nature holds such a high view of God's law, it theologically leads always to the freeing, wonderful gospel - over against self-made legalism.And so answering that misconception, Bahnsen then takes the next two sections of his book to show the internal integrity of God's law as well as Christ's obedience to the Law - that very particular qualification which secures the believers' atonement. He demonstrates the fact that the Spirit now directs the believer's life by turning his heart to follow God's law. And finally, he shows at what point the New Testament does change a certain aspect of the Old Testament law - and that aspect only - which culminates in his chapter showing that God's law in itself is never opposed to or pitted against but always held in conjunction with grace, faith, and love.And so what has changed from Old Testament to New Testament in regards to the Law? Bahnsen shows that in every instance it is clear that the one aspect of the law that has a new form is the ceremonial, or restorative law of God. In a sense even the restorative validity is still abiding. God still demands sanctification from the world and penal substitutional sacrifice for sins. But the New Testament is so absolutely clear that there has been a significant change in its form. In Galatians and Colossians the ceremonial (or restorative) laws are referred to as elementary principles: \\"You observe days and months and seasons and years!\\" (Gal. 4:10); \\"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath \\" (Col. 2:16). Paul says \\"these are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ\\" (Col. 2:17).Similarly the author of Hebrews speaking specifically of the ceremonial/restorative worship rites in the temple said: \\"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. ... But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises\\" (Heb. 8:5, 6).And what is this better covenant? It's the perpetual forgiveness of sins because of the finality of Christ's sacrifice; and the ability for believers now - in the power of the Spirit - to be able to keep God's law. \\"For this is the covenant that I will make...I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts....and I will remember their sins no more\\" (Heb. 8:10, 12).Certainly a review cannot summarize all that was said in this 563 page work. But the premise is that it is the ceremonial (or restorative) law only that has changed in its form - as it was promised even before the Babylonian captivity (Jer. 31). And that the covenant community of the New Testament clearly saw the rest of the law as having the same form with abiding validity (Eph. 6:1-3; Mk. 7:10-11, 10:19; 1 Tim. 5:18; 2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Pet. 3:8-12).And so now for the most controversial part of theonomy, Bahnsen then turns his attention to how God's law applies to the state.He shows that God has charged the civil magistrate with upholding His justice (this can be seen even in the New Testament - Rom. 13). But how does the civil magistrate know the socio-political demands of God's justice? Well they've been clearly revealed in the Scriptures - in the abiding validity of the Older Testament cannon.Therefore, it is the duty of the magistrate to rule according to Christ's will (Ps. 2). Does that mean there are certain crimes today that according to our society need not be punished at all, but according to God's own Word are so heinous that they're deserving of capital punishment (because not only are they sins against God - a matter for the church to deal with; but they are also crimes against the justice and righteousness of a nation - a matter for the state to deal with)? It surely does. And so it is here that the other most widely held misconception of theonomy arises:(2) Theonomy fails to see a distinction between (or separation of) church and state.Nevermind the fact that Bahnsen has an entire chapter in his section, \\"Application of [Theonomy] to the State\\" arguing for the Biblical standard for the title of the chapter: \\"Separation of Church and State.\\" For some reason it is still thought by many that theonomy fails to see a distinction between the two (see. Wayne Grudem, \\"Politics According to the Bible,\\" 66). But this is completely false.As one reads throughout Bahnsen's work and especially in his chapter on the separation of church and state, it becomes clear that it's precisely because the theonomic principle is rooted in Scripture as the only infallible Word on anything about which it speaks that one can legitimately defend a Biblical reason for the separation of church and state.What one finds in Bahnsen's work is that theonomic doctrine has a very positive (and Biblically defensible) position guarding both a clear distinction in character as well as a clear separation of power between church and state - more so than any other pluralistic system of politics can ever hope to defend. But what differentiates theonomic doctrine is that rather than coming to the text first with a preconceived notion that \\"separation of church and state is supreme\\" and therefore supersedes what we might find in Scripture, theonomy as a system holds a very strong conviction of the separation of church and state because of the fact that it derives this viewpoint from Scripture itself. And that is why the theonomic conviction of separation of church and state is so strong.Yet, as Bahnsen lays the theonomic doctrine out, this does not mean that the church is bound to Christ and the state is bound to some other authority (or even no authority at all). They each have their own boundaries and duties, but they both are accountable to Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Ps 2). As Paul says in Romans \\"Never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, \`Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord,'\\" he then goes right along to say how God does carry out that vengeance and wrath. And it's through the civil magistrate: \\"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God...For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.\\" (Rom. 12:19, 13:1,4).So in theonomic doctrine the church does not have the right to wield the sword, but the state does - and that right has been given to it by God. Similarly the state does not have the authority to administer the sacraments, but the church does. But both church and state, while acting in different roles and having separate responsibilities - both are held accountable to the same authority - Christ who has said with finality: \\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me\\" (Mt. 28:18, cf. Ps. 2). He is not just Head of the Church, but King of kings and Lord of lords. And while He rules in the lives of believers by means of writing His laws in their hearts, He still rules the nations by means of giving the magistrate the sword as the avenging agent in carrying out His wrath against the societal wrongdoer.So if the civil magistrate - even in the New Testament - is charged with being God's agent for civil order, carrying out God's wrath against the wrongdoer and promoting righteousness in the society; if this is the case, how is the civil magistrate to know what measure of the sword to use in avenging the wrongdoer? What standard is the magistrate to use in determining what is a just retribution in judging and what is a righteous law in governing a society? Well, the answer is that God has already clearly revealed his righteous laws and just retributions - they're in the Old Testament cannon:\\"And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?\\" (Deut. 4:8). This very law in which, \\"Every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution\\" (Heb. 2:2)There is so much more to this thesis in showing Biblically how this works out and answering all the anticipated objections that such a superficial review cannot do it justice. But let me simply be clear that Bahnsen, from Scripture, does answer those objections. A review is just not the place to do it.And allow me to be completely honest. It is not easy to reach this conclusion on an emotional or psychological level. Our culture has simply gotten the best of us when it comes to this arena. But in reading this work, in studying the Scriptures to see if these things are so, it is very, very difficult to argue with such compelling arguments that Bahnsen presents in this work.But now allow me to be even clearer so as not to give more misrepresentation to the theonomic outlook. Theonomic doctrine is not concerned with getting Christians into the civil magistrate and then by way of misguided tyranny forcing \\"Christian Law\\" on all of society. That is not the way. Just as in the Old Testament a very strong case can be made for separation of church and state - so also can a democratic form of government (remember David was not only appointed by God to be king, but he was also given consent from the governed to be their King - 2 Sam. 2:7, 5:1-3).In reality, Theonomy is nothing more than a clear mission of the church to obey the Great Commission to \\"make disciples of all nations...teaching them to observe all that [Christ] has commanded [us]\\" (Matt. 28:19-20). The \\"all\\" is inclusive of the entirety of the Old Testament, which Christ taught his disciples to observe - including the societal laws and penal sanctions as far as we can. Those are the disciples that we as the church are commanded to make: disciples who will observe all of God's commandments - not through their own power, but the through the justifying and sanctifying power of Christ and the Holy Spirit - but all of God's commandments nonetheless. \\"If you love me, you will keep my commandments\\" (Jn. 14:15). This very statement is a very powerful promise of what Christ in a believer can do as well as a mark of a true disciple, which He Himself has regenerated unto life.Theonomy is not a militant doctrine. At the end of the day it is revival that is at the heart of theonomy. Just as Jesus promised to be with His church until the very end (Mt. 28:20), and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her (Mt. 16:18) - so the mission is to make disciples (not by way of sword but by way of evangelism) of all nations who will love Christ and observe all that He commands. It is in God working in us to accomplish this mission that we will have just societies who will willingly place in their leadership just leaders who will rule according to God's just laws.If the thesis is correct, if continuity should be assumed and if making disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey all that Christ has commanded is the mission of the church, then how can massive revival in the nations with the aim of Biblical Law for the society not be the conclusion?I wish every Christian pastor and educated layman would put forth the time into reading this work (as tough as it might be) and applying its principles to his life. For what more is theonomic doctrine than theology applied - to all areas of life? As for my assessment, I submit it is just that!"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This book is widely considered among Theonomic scholars to be one of the foundational works of their school of thought, and it is easy to see why. Greg Bahnsen, in this work, manages to skillfully defend the eternal validity of the law of God in a systematic and rigorous way. First, Bahnsen opens with an introduction of the Theonomic thesis that God's standard of righteousness at all times and for all people is His law in its entirety, and then exhaustively giving the exegetical case for this from Matthew 5:17-19. After this, Bahnsen moves on to tackle one form of antinomianism, Pharisaism, showing how the law is unable to justify and empower us, because the purpose of the law is to show how we fall short of the unchanging and eternal standards of God, rather than to justify our actions before our Creator. Then Bahensen takes a bold stance and shows how the Theonomic thesis is integral to true Christianity, showing the integrity of the law (defending it from the attacks of antinomians), shows Jesus Christ's obedience to the law and the necessary continuity of the law because it alone demonstrates our need for atonement, shows how he sanctification of the Holy Spirit allows us to be obedient to God's law, and then shows how the covenants of God are united together, rather than being hostile to others as Dispensationalism assumes. After this, Bahnsen answers three supposed conflicts to the Theonomic view, showing how the Ceremonial law remains valid typologically, pointing to the actions of Jesus Christ, rather than being abrogated, explains the supposed negative passages in the Bible towards the law as condemning the wrong use of the law or the use of human tradition (see the Talmud) as law, and explaining the relationship of Theonomy with grace, faith, and love, showing how true obedience to God's law is not only not contradictory, but is directly and positively related to these three cardinal virtues. Bahnsen then touches on the NT confirmation of Theonomy and gives the functions of God's law, and then shows the antithetical values of autonomy (humanism) and latent antinomianism (where people pick and choose which laws of God they wish to obey), before turning to perhaps the boldest and most extensive part of his thesis, which is showing how God's laws are applicable to the state--in Israel, in the nations around Israel in the OT, and in the NT, as well as showing the Bible's extensive support of the separation of church and state and the implications of God's laws on penology (which is perhaps one of the more controversial elements of Theonomy). To close the book, Bahnsen attacks indifference to obedience to God, shows the blessedness of the law in the Bible, and then closes with some intriguing appendices: an exegetical study of Galatians 3:15-18, showing the roles of the civil government according to the Westminster Confession of Faith, discussing and providing Cotton's \\"Abstract of the Laws of New England,\\" a Thenomic political work from the Puritans of New England in the 1600's, and then a critique of the exegetical methods of one M.G. Kline concerning the covenants of the Bible. The book as a whole is a powerhouse, one of the most powerful works one can find in its scope and thoroughness demolishing all claims one could have on biblical grounds to refuse to obey God's laws in their entirety, and also shows the characteristic Theonomic concern for the implications of God's laws on outside society. For those wishing to read a scholarly and yet passionate defense of God's laws, this book is highly recommended, and will serve an honored place in my collection of these works for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This book coupled with R.J. Rushdoony's \\"Institutes of Biblical Law,\\" will become to the 20th century what Calvin's \\"Institutes\\" became to the 16th. This book will not go away nor will the subject. It is vital to Christian progress."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Bahnsen, who passed away over a decade ago, is a name that draws out the best and worse in people. And, in many ways, it is because of this book. Bahnsen wrote this book in the 70's and it created a firestorm in Reformed circles. Almost immediately debates about \\"theonomy\\" started to run rampant in Reformed and Presbyterian circles. Some started denouncing Bahnsen and Bahnsen's supporters started shouting back. Fortunately, enough time has passed that the issue can be discussed reasonable, although the discussion often produces more heat than love. This is unfortunate, because it is an important issue to discuss, especially given Francis Schaeffer's influence on the American Church during the second half of the 20th century and Christians have begun to \\"engage culture\\". Yet, for many, like me, I am left asking, \\"O.k, we are to engage culture, but with what?\\" Bahnsen, I believe, provides the answer. We are to engage culture with the complete revelation, \\"Old\\" and New Testament, from God.Bahnsen basicaly argues (from Mt 5.17+) that Christians are to observe every jot and tittle of God's word until there is a clear revelation to the contrary. This includes the fact that the civil magistrates should observe the Mosaic judicial laws for civil society. If God has spoken about these issues, should we not seek to apply His Word to these areas? If he has not spoken, then can we really say, \\"We are to engage culture?\\" If we are, then I believe God is responsible to equip us. As is, he has equipped us and Bahnsen has helped that cause.I highly recommend reading this book because it will do several things. One, make you read the Old Testament in a much better light. Two, Bahnsen will shed some light on various passages like Jesus' teaching on divorce. Three, it will give a primer on ethics. Four, it will allow you to understand theonomy from the source. All of these things are good and profitable. Even if you end up disagreeing, at least you will be educated."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Greg L. Bahnsen (1948-1995) was a Calvinist philosopher, apologist, Christian Reconstructionist, and skilled debater. He was an ordained minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and a full time Scholar in Residence for the Southern California Center for Christian Studies. This 1984 book (expanded edition; original version published 1977) and was an expansion of his Master's Thesis at Westminster Theological Seminary.He cautions, \\"Thus theonomists will not necessarily agree with each other's every interpretation and ethical conclusion. For instance, many (like myself) do not affirm R.J. Rushdoony's view of the dietery laws, Gary North's view of home mortgages, James Jordan's stance on automatic infant communion... or David Chilton's attitudes toward bribery and 'ripping off' the unbeliever. Nevertheless, all share the basic perspective reflected in the above ten propositions.\\" (Pg. xix)He admits, \\"Jesus did NOT broach the subject of the Older Testament's punishment for adultery and then express personal disapproval... He repudiated the Pharisees, not the law. Hence it is totally unwarranted to maintain that Christ expressly abrogated the law's penal sanction against adultery.\\" (Pg. 110) He asserts, \\"The fact that adultery is contained in the larger class of crimes, fornication, does not imply even remotely that Christ abrogated the penal sanction against adultery.\\" (Pg. 112)He insists, \\"Theonomy must be CENTRAL in Christian ethics... we do not demand autonomous justification for God's commandments... Theonomy, and theonomy alone, must be the standard for Christian ethics. The sole Law-giver and Judge is God.\\" (Pg. 305) He argues, \\"Those who propose the abolition of the death penalty ... should also carry out the logic of their position: if the gravest punishment (death) is abolished, HOW MUCH MORE the lesser penalties! The result would have to be NO punishments at all. Thus, the magistrate could no more impose a traffic fine upon someone for speeding than he could execute someone for murder!\\" (Pg. 447)He concludes, \\"While many specific questions need to be answered in particular situations, the basic or fundamental principle of social morality and state responsibility has been answered... Our categorical assumption must be that of continuity with Older Testament morality.\\" (Pg. 470-471)Obviously a highly controversial book, it is also a very IMPORTANT one, and is \\"must reading\\" by persons on all sides of this debate."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"If Bahnsen's discussion of the Greek term for &quot;fulfil&quot; in Matthew 5 is really the weakest part of the book, then we have before us an outstanding work of ethics and exegesis. The fact is, an alternative exegesis of Matthew 5 might be correct, and yet Bahnsen's Thesis would still stand. I'm currently preparing a Master's thesis in theology on the topic of the role of biblical law in contemporary government, and I have to say that despite my very best efforts, I have yet to come across a rebuttal to this work that stands up to serious scrutiny, Poythress and Co. included.This work, if allowed to speak, and if read without trying to think up rebuttals before fair examination has been given, will change the way you look at biblical law. For many Christians, Bahnsen has been responsible for a truly overwhelming paradigm shift.Fortunately, this work has been republished by Covenant Media Foundation (I can't include the URL here, but they're easy to find on the web). See for yourself what the fuss is about!"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"If anyone is familiar with Bahnsen's works on Biblical law, they will praise God for the simple truth about the importance of God's law (moral law, The ten commandments)in the family, church, and state. So many people confuse the moral law with cermonial law in the Bible. Bahnsen make it VERY clear for all that he is not referring to the cermonial law. If God's law is not the standard for our life (what is right and wrong), then we are left to imagine for ourselves what is. People please read and then re-read this book. Bahnsen in no way supports the continue use of the cermonial law. As he asserts time and time again that the function of cermonial laws have been fulfilled in the person and work of Christ. However, the Moral law is still valid in our day as the only rule by which we know what is right and wrong. If you are a Christian, then the Holy Spirit works within you to empower you to obey God's commandments. The Holy Spirit NEVER contradicts God's Law. As Christians, we need to Love the Law of God because God's law is a reflection of God's character. If we as Christians ignore God's Law, then we are hoplessly left to ourselves to guess as what is right and wrong. Why imagine, When we have a standard. God's Law"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Dr. Bahnsen was on of this nations most articulate exegetes and ethicists the evangelical church has produced. This book is a wake up call to evangelicals who have surrendered Biblical law to &quot;common grace&quot; or Thomistic natural law. In the wake of this lifting up of the white flag Bahnsen blows a loud horn to wake us up to the cultural disatser this has resulted in."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Dr. Bahnsen demonstrates an ability to convey Scriptural truth in such a way that touches the one heart of all true Christians. He is humble and bold at the same time. The transitions between points of argumentation are so fluid you will be left with no doubt that theonomy could have articulated any better. If you do not agree with this thesis of Dr. Bahnsen's you can rest assured you are not a theonomist."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"(Timmopussycat is the online nic of Tim Cunningham who earned a Diploma in Christian Studies from Regent College, Vancouver, BC. He is currently working on a full exegetical review of Bahnsen's view of Matthew 5:17-20.)Theonomy derives from two Greek words meaning God and law respectively. Greg Bahnsen's version of Christian ethics stands or falls on whether his understanding of Matthew 5:17-20, given in the chapter \\"The Abiding Validity of the Law in Exhaustive Detail\\" is correct. While Bahnsen presents his thesis in a way that at first glance looks highly convincing, it has been demonstrated that he is incorrect at so many points that his thesis cannot stand.Unfortunately Bahnsen's mistakes are not immediately obvious to those of us who are unfamilliar with Greek grammar and word meanings. An additional problem is that many of the folks who do know Greek have made their counterarguments to Bahnsen's position in theological journals or unpublished academic papers such as Masters theses which layfolk do not normally run across. One key work, however, is still available to the general public and those considering buying \\"Theonomy\\" owe it to themselves to buy and read Vern S. Poythress' book \\"The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses\\" before accepting Bahnsen's thesis.To give but one example of what is involved, Bahnsen claims that the Greek word our Bibles normally translate \\"fulfill\\" in Matt. 5:17 should instead be translated \\"confirm\\"-a meaning for the word not found in classical Greek and not generally accepted as valid for New Testament Greek. Poythress in his chapter \\"The meaning of plaroo\\" reviews the evidence for Bahnsen's suggestion and, while not deploying the strongest arguments against it, deploys enough to conclude that Bahnsen's suggested translation must be rejected.(Lest any believe the oft made but incorrect claim that Bahnsen refuted Poythress' arguments on this point in his later book \\"No Other Standard,\\" the truth is that Bahnsen refuted none of the arguments: he didn't even discuss them in any detail. Instead he attempted to dismiss them as \\"quibbles,\\" which, as anyone familliar with Poythress' arguments knows, is simply untrue. Similarly, Bahnsen's counterclaim that the main lexicon for New Testament Greek accepts \\"confirm\\" as a valid translation of the word in question overlooks the fact that the mention of \\"confirm\\" occurs within bracets - a convention which the authors of that lexicon use to reference a meaning about which there is ongoing debate, but which they themselves do not accept as valid.)If Theonomy is Biblical teaching, it will need better Scriptural support than Bahnsen deploys to prove it."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This represents probably the best defense of theonomy in print [sic]. If you desire to understand this position, then somehow find this book."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Bahnsen says &quot;it is the point of slightness that Jesus bring forcefully before us, not even the very least extensive number of the very least significant aspect of the old testament law will become invalid until heaven and earth pass away, it is hard to imagine how Jesus could have more intensely affirmed that every bit of the old law remains binding in the gospel age.&quot; The main verse used by theonomists is Matthew 5:17-18 where Jesus says, &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18&quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.&quot; The problem for Bahnsen and the partial preterist (and futurists) is that the &quot;heaven and earth&quot; of 2 Peter 3 passed away in 70AD (which many partial preterists agree with, see Isaiah 51:15-16). In this book he lists the 5 rules of theonomy.1) The Christian is morally obligated to observed every jot and tittle of the Old Testament law, to disobey any point is to validate the whole law. (He cites James 2:10 which reads &quot;For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.&quot;)2) There's a system or set or ceremonial laws.3) The observation of this system of redemptive ceremonies was intended to be superceded, it was a foreshadow of Christ's saving economy and has become obsolete with His historical work.4) The continued observation of this system of shadows is to miss the true importance; it is opposed to Christian faith and evidences condemning bondage. (which means no more sacrifices are to be made)5) In order to walk righteously before our God, we must identify and distinguish between ceremonial observances from moral observances.Another theonomist writes, &quot;We must observe all the ethical and moral principals of the old testament law.&quot; I agree with that and I know you do too. God has given us a conscience to know that lying, adultery, stealing, etc. is wrong.&quot; But the problem is that the theonomist goes farther then that. Bahnsen says that &quot;every bit of the old law remains binding in the gospel age&quot;, that includes the jots and tittles. Bahnsen writes on page 73 and 74 that &quot;jot and tittle are not broad, vague principals&quot;. He is right. Jots and tittles are every tiny Pharisaical, legalist detail! If theonomy is true then the entire Christian church has been disobeying God's law for almost 2000 years! It means that the Old Testament ceremony laws, dietary laws, etc. are still in effect! This is absurd! The way Bahnsen gets away with this is that he cites but doesn't quote Hebrews 8:13 in this book.Hebrews 8:13 says &quot;In that He says, &quot;A new covenant,&quot; He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.&quot;But Bahnsen writes on page 194 from Theonomy in Christian Ethics &quot;Hebrew 8:13 says that the old age is past but the age of the Son is here to stay (Heb 8:13).&quot;That is a true statement now and anytime after the Old Covenant passed away, which was in 70AD. But this is not what the verse says. The verse says it was passing away. On page 209 Bahnsen writes, &quot;the Old Covenant has disappeared (Heb 8:13)&quot; This is now true after 70AD but when the verse was written, which was before 70AD, it says it was disappearing. It hadn't disappeared yet. I'm sure this whole false view about the law has caused many Christian Reconstructionists to doubt their salvation.God's only current law in the Christian age is the &quot;law of the Spirit of life&quot; and the &quot;ministry of the Spirit&quot;. (Romans 8:2, 2 Cor 3:8)."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth: His Life and Legend","review":"In \\"Babe Ruth\\" Kal Wagenhem introduces the reader to one of the greatest icons of American sport. From his home in Baltimore through the minor leagues, the major leagues and retirement we see the man behind the hero. Wagenhem does an excellent job of interweaving baseball with life.Through the pages we meet the dichotomy that is Babe Ruth. Though America's greatest sports hero, he never learned to take care of himself. Though he could afford any car he wanted, he needed them because he never really learned to drive safely. Despite achieving riches unimaginable for an athlete of his day, he never quite crossed to the right side of the tracks. Despite a life dripping with debauchery, he never left the Church in which he had been raised. A vocal supporter of Al Smith, he did not register to vote until long after the Smith era. After having established himself as an outstanding pitcher, he became the game's greatest hitter.The baseball world of Ruth's day is portrayed as differing greatly from that of today. In the off season players doubled their earnings on barnstorming tours. Players rode trains rather than planes. Some abused booze rather than drugs, but Oh, they played the game and the Babe dominated it as no other player has before or since.Babe's life was a combination of triumph and tragedy, fulfillment and despair. The road from the top was bumpy for he Babe. His dream to manage never fulfilled, Babe resented a world which, though it was his life, he never really understood.This book changed my view of Babe Ruth. He emerges as a figure despiseable and lovable, heroic and irresponsible, admired and pitied. The ability to lead the reader to see a different viewpoint is a test of a good book. By this measurement \\"Babe Ruth\\" hits a homer."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth: His Life and Legend","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a baseball fan (and a NYY fan), I had to read about Ruth. A great person from some aspects, this book took a look at the Babe from every point of view.

This was a very good book."},{"Title":"Cassell's Queer Companion: A Dictionary of Lesbian and Gay Life and Culture (Cassell Lesbian and Gay Studies)","review":"This long-awaited contribution to the alternative sex culture ought to find a place on every corporate executive's bedside table. Hope for more to come."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"Avery Corman, the author of \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" has done it again. In \\"A Perfect Divorce,\\" he has created a recognizable modern family, Karen and Rob Burrows and their son Tommy. Karen and Rob, who are based in New York City, both have fulfilling and satisfying careers, but their jobs leave them little time for one another. When their marriage finally breaks down completely, Karen and Rob have a civilized and amicable divorce, and they pray that their son will not suffer because of their failure to stay together.What makes \\"A Perfect Divorce\\" stand out is Corman's determination not to resort to theatrics and melodrama. Rob is a respected and stable businessman who owns a company called MayPole that manufactures and sells playground equipment. Rob's only vice is that he travels a great deal and spends too much time making contact with clients all over the country. He is community-minded and even donates playground equipment to underprivileged kids. Karen cultivates American craftspeople and she sells their unique wares in her beautiful store. Tommy is a good and reliable kid, who is talented artistically but only average academically. These are all fine and decent people who, mostly for logistical reasons, no longer function together as a unit.Corman encapsulates the dilemma of the modern, well-to-do family--too much time spent on careers, too little time devoted to family. In flashback, Corman shows how Rob and Karen got together and how much they loved one another, and this makes their divorce all the more distressing.Much of the book focuses on Tommy, who does suffer greatly when his mother and father split up. He is shuttled from one parent to the other until he can't take it anymore. Karen and Rob pressure him to raise his SAT scores so that he will get into a good school. Finally, much to his parents' horror, he decides to go his own way, ignoring Karen's and Rob's plans for his future. While Tommy struggles to find himself, Karen and Rob seek new relationships, hoping that they can do better the second time around.The writing in \\"A Perfect Divorce\\" is wonderful. All the characters are beautifully developed, the dialogue is funny, touching, and natural, and the plot is lively and nicely paced. Corman shows how well-meaning people can mess up their lives without realizing how much damage they are causing. It may take a village to raise a child, but it doesn't hurt to have two loving parents, with common goals and a deep commitment to one another. With their determination to \\"have it all,\\" no matter what the price, many modern couples have created obstacles for themselves that may be difficult or even impossible to overcome."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"If you've read any of Avery Corman's books, you know of his strong ability to make you feel that you are right there with his characters feeling their every emotion. Well, Corman once again demonstrates this special skill in A Perfect Divorce, in which he masterfully tells a story of well-intentioned parents of a teenage son attempt to lessen the impact of their failed two-career marriage with an intelligent, successful divorce. It is a very special tale of life, love, child-rearing and divorce. At times it will make you smile with joy, feel like crying (if not actually cry) out of happiness and sadness, and, at times, break your heart due to the disappointment the divorced parents experience as well as the pain felt by the divorced child. Corman is an excellent writer and one you should not miss. All of his books are well worth reading -- the best of which are Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Old Neighborhood, 50, and Prized Possessions. Do yourself a real favor and get a copy of A Perfect Divorce. I'm confident you'll be very glad you did."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"At last! A book that holds my interest!

I plan to read more by this author."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"This book made me feel sad for children with the kind of parents in this book. The parents were very worried about and disappointed in their child. If the child was mine, I would be really proud of him.

Of course everyone's adversely affected. That's stating a non-sequitur. The effect of divorce and custody on kids is a story that definitely needs to be told.

There are no villains in this work ( the characters are more balanced than even kramer vs kramer), only real people dealing with real situations as best they can.Since the movie rights have been sold, a note to Hollywood- This would be an excellent vehicle for a reteaming of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan..."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"The title of this book is a perfect oxymoron. Despite this, Karen and Rob Burrows do their best to create a good atmosphere for their son Tommy, even after their divorce. They start off with shared custody until they see that shuffling Tommy back and forth is causing a strain on him and they revert to having him live with his mother most of the time, with frequent visitation from his father. They work together to help Tommy through the aftermath of the divorce and then again collaborate to counsel their average-student son into the college application process. They keep their cool, do everything right, and are sure that Tommy is doing fine. When he goes off to college and encounters problems, they are in denial and don't want to think that their divorce has anything to do with it. Author Corman writes convincingly and sensitively about an all-too-relevant subject for today's world. A pertinent question seems to be, if these well-educated and well-grounded parents do everything right for their child and he still has problems, what is happening to families where the parents are not as well-equipped to handle trauma? My only objection to the book is a too neatly tied-up ending, but getting there was well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Perfect Divorce","review":"After having heard Avery Corman interviewed about the book on a radio program, I couldn't wait to get my hands on his newest book.

The author did a great job in describing the process of college applications and the tension and stress it brings to parents and children, Having endured this process three times with my daughters, I recognized the familiar feelings. The divorce and the effect it had on young Tommy was written beautifully and with sensitivity.

Also, surprisingly, are two men (Csaba Egri and James Rousseau) demonstrating a rich smoky eye and the startling effect of a few well placed false eyelashes.Chapters include Eyes, Lips, Neutrals, Shimmer, Monochrome and Suntan, Pastels and Color. There are also some important and informative sections on Skin Care, Pre-Prep tips and a fabulous &quot;10 Basic DO NOT Makeup Mistakes.&quot;Designed by the equally imitated Fabien Baron, Makeup Your Mind is disguised as a coffee table book (and is being used as one by me!), but is meant to be more of a functional workbook.

I was forced to go back to Sephora to see the NARS colors that I had read about, to find cheaper similar colors and textures. I feel this book should be free, because all it does is sell NARS makeup.

Before each section on which he focuses on a certain type of look or part of the face, he also has a little insight as to how he thinks about makeup should be done which I throughly agree with.

But Makeup Your Mind goes straight to the point with its \\"focused\\" pictures (no drawings, thanks god!). No enhanced before-and-after pictures. In this book, you will find a completey barenaked face on the right page, and the made-up face on the left. The best part of this book is the fact that each \\"made-up\\" face has a transparent plastic cover sheet on top each. It shows you exactly where the makeup has been applied and in what shape. It gives you the name of the colors used: the exact name from the author's cosmetic line AND a general name that you can use if you are buying from other lines (great!). Another great point that I like about the author is his open-mindedness about makeup. You will find examples of natural makeup as well as excentric ones. There is one thing that I would change about this book as an African-American women, is the lack of representation of... us! On 63 examples, only 3 are examples of Black women. Moreover, they are represented in only 2 of the 5 sections: In Shimmers and Colors. Not even in the Lips' section!!! I will still buy his next book which is suppose to feature \\"non-professional\\" models hoping that he will be more \\"globally\\" representing the women of this world."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"It was a good read on the essays and tips on different parts of the face - skin, eyes, and lips etc... However, I didn't seem to walk away with anything new as far as how to correct problem area or acne blemishes and contouring. Robert Jone's book Beauty Made Simple seems like a better choice for that matter. However, Mr. Nars has some good insight on makeup and that alone may worth the price of the book. As a photographer and want-to-be makeup artist, I want to learn all."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I really must say that I LOVE the format of this book and all of the excerpts written by Franoise Nars. The make-up aficionado and novice admirer both will benefit from his ideas of beauty and the concepts behind makeup. It truly is a must have for those who simply adore make-up and furthermore adore the Nars line.My only complaint about this book is his lack of skin diversity. Most of the models used seem to be pale and freckly, not at all an accurate description of the different women there are in this world. I would have enjoyed to see models with darker skin complexions as well as different skin textures (older models, models with skin problems, etc). Hopefully his next book will play host to more of these different and diverse characteristics, thereby providing a base of enhancing beauty through make-up for people of all ages and all races."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I will agree with the other reviewers that I felt this book could use more ethnic diversity. As for the review that found their facial expressions &quot;horrifying&quot;, my take on it is that he wanted everything to look absolutely the same from the before to the after, except for the makeup, of course. Hence the same lighting, same hairstyle, same expression. I will warn people that some of these looks are not for everyday, but if you feel like having a little fun with makeup, you should enjoy this book. The plastic overlays on each face are a great guide to show you where to place each color."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"this book is for more advanced makeup artists who have grasp basic concepts already. it is more of fashion/glamour makeup, and talks more about contouring and highlighting. it can be used as a face chart or reference when you deal with different faces. the pictures are of very high quality, with all the details exposed. recommended for pros."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I thought this book is a really great way to see NARS products on actual faces. I must say after I purchased it, I really got into the NARS makeup line. It has great pictures and cool trasparent pages that show directions for applying the makeup."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"The acetate overlays in this book are very helpful for make-up placement. They allow you to see the face before make-up application as well as the finished face. There are some great looks in here. They all use NARS products, and each face lists the exact make-up used. This is very beneficial, especially for those who aren't the best at chosing colors and/or textures."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I really must say that I LOVE the format of this book and all of the excerpts written by Franoise Nars.

But I wanted a resource to be able to communicate to models the look that I want for photoshoots. This book provides a great library of looks to choose from, and provides the instructions on how to apply the cosmetics as well as a complete list of the cosmetics needed for that look.The only downside is that they decided to get artsy-fartsy in the text layout and broke just about every rule for typography, making the text awfully hard to read. The text is light grey on a white background, and in most cases there isn't any indentation or spacing to define paragraphs. Who ever approved the typesetting should be fired."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I have bought and read quite a few books on makeup over the years, and this is one of my favorites, one that I would recommend to both newcomers to the world of makeup to OR to experts who just want some inspiration.One of the few downsides of the book is that the text is grey (rather than black,) and justified in the center of the page rather than formatted in normal paragraphs. This makes it harder to read than it needs to be, and makes it tempting to skip over the tips on application techniques and color choice.What makes the book unique is the clear overlays between the pages that show where that makeup was applied, and names the products (from the Nars line, of course) which were used. Also, it's unusual that the photos in the book don't seem to be heavily Photoshopped. You can see the freckles, pores and stray eyebrow hairs on the models. (I own all the books by the late Kevyn Aucoin, and though I admire his artistry, honestly you can tell the pictures in his books have been Photoshopped within an inch of their lives.)As a practical matter, most of the looks in Makeup Your Mind are more for the runway or at least a nightclub, rather than wear on the street or the workplace. That doesn't mean that you couldn't adapt the makeup in some of the pictures for everyday wear. For example, you could take the eye shadow combination from one of the pictures and wear it with a lighter lipstick, or try the wild red lipstick from another page and skip the smokey eyes. Some of the pictures, especially from the \\"Neutrals\\" section are natural looking and ready for everyday wear.In a book about makeup, readers always want to see someone to whom they can relate, someone who looks (at least something) like themselves. The models in the book are all young; but they are ethnically diverse.This book is one of the few books on makeup that I would recommend for someone who was above beginner level. Some of the looks (like the rainbow-hued eyes) are a bit of extreme; but there are plenty of books out there to teach the beginner how to achieve a conservative, unmadeup look. Those tips are here, too. The book can also inspire women to come out of their comfort zone occasionally. I would recommend the book to makeup junkies everywhere."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I enjoyed this artistic, inspiring book. It is descriptive & informative with perfect before- after make-up photos with clear where-to-apply transparent pages+ all the nars products used are shown/referred clearly in case you want to buy any of them. My personal gain was that it urged me to be more experimental in make-up after a long-period of conservatism. Yes, the other reviewers are right, most of the examples are rather dramatic: not including the colors you can use in the office or even at night. But then not all the colors are the same on every face so you can always use the diagrams and play with the colors until you find something that makes you feel more beautiful."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"This book is definitely worth reading for those interested in makeup. However, many complaints stated by others are valid, such as the light, small type, in block paragraphs on white paper, is hard to read. The \\"before\\" photos can be a little disturbing because they are nearly life-size, and despite the statement that they haven't been retouched, there are no blood vessels visible in ANY of the models' eyes, making them look oddly lifeless (this effect is compounded by their flat expressions). No doubt that reminds some readers of \\"The Stepford Wives.\\" Many of the models are extremely freckled - I wonder if that is representative of the human population to the degree you see it in this book. It does appear that the models' skin and facial features haven't been altered; after looking at them for awhile, I came away thinking, \\"THESE people aren't pretty enough to be models!\\" It made me start to think NO ONE is really beautiful - we're just being conned by the \\"beauty industry,\\" Hollywood, advertising, etc. Also, the models' names aren't labeled on their photos. The text does have some useful tips and information, and there are short descriptions for application of the products for each of the looks in the back of each section. The most useful sections to me were the ones on neutrals and pastels. All of the other looks would have to be modified for use in the real world. I found one flaw in the book - one of the plastic overlays was clearly the wrong one for the page. The instructions at the back of the section made it possible to deal with that, so it wasn't a significant problem. Also, the slipcase is very thin and fragile; mine was already cracked when it arrived. No wonder used copies of this never seem to have a slipcase."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"This is a great book for beginners. The photos are dummy proof, and the plastic overlay explains everything without confusion. Fantastic. Good investment."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I really must say that I LOVE the format of this book and all of the excerpts written by Franoise Nars.

I often refer to it again &amp; again. Would make a great &quot;coffee table book&quot; too!My only &quot;complaints&quot;: (1) All Nars products are used &amp; recommended -- though I love Nars cosmetics -- but there are descriptions so you could get a similar look using different products. (2) The print type is very small and light gray and sometimes difficult to read."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"As a professional makeup artist and Instructor, I found this book non-beneficial, although it was beautifully laid out. (The art director did a fabulous job.) All but a few eye techniques were a basic color wash of one color. This book does not challenge the professional with different techniques or looks. What I and the other instructors found horrifying was the lack of brow grooming. Any print artist knows that everything needs to be flawless before they go on film. One models brows were growing in all directions. The other con to this book was the light grey type that was tightly spaced. While creatively appealing, it was very hard to read.What I did like was the acetate overlays with the description of the basic color and then the color in his line. What I thought would have helped the book out even more was to provide pictures of the products he was using or to tell a little more about them because if you aren't familiar with his line, you had no idea what he was using."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"The idea of the overlays is great - it allows you to see the makeup completely finished without the distraction of the writing and then able to add that information of where to place the colors. I like the honesty in using the same light/background/hairstyle in the before and after pictures without any retouching - it is more truthful than many other books (believe me, I have many).I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reason (some I will admit are personal preference):1. Not enough variations in skin tone color - as in not enough olive toned and bronzed toned women. It was concentrated on either extremely pale or very dark with the majority being very pale.2. A large section of the makeup is more suitable for runway - I don't see them being realistic for real life."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"The book definitely has great looks and ideas. As an African American though, only 2 faces look similar to mine. It would have been nice if there were models with all shades of skin, not just mostly caucasian people. The book is very creative and fun to read, it gives you good detail of how to create each look as well. A fun read if you are a makeup fiend."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"First of all, the introduction rubbed me the wrong way and I found it full of contradictions and a way to knock other makeup artists. He mentioned that makeup articles in &quot;these books&quot; are blatently unrealistic because of the retouching, yet I didn't see one blood vessle in the eyes in any of the pictures in this book. He also says you should &quot;notice the woman, not her makeup&quot;, but isn't that hard to do when you look at a face with acid green, orange and gold eyeshadow topped off with bushy eyebrows? All of the models seem to be in the same age range and are obviously professional models. How does this benefit the reader who really needs and wants advise? Why didn't he pick people off the street to really get his point across? The pictures are large and self explanitory, but he was better off choosing a wide variety of women based on age, race etc. so everyone benefits."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I really looked forward to seeing this book after hearing about it. It seemed like the format, with before and after pictures and plastic overlays, would be terrific for showing exactly what to do to create the looks. Unfortunately, I hadn't at all counted on the fact that I would have no interest in the looks themselves. There is a lot that is bizzare here, much that is fairly plain, and nothing that I could or would do for myself. The models are all young and gorgeous; they've no need for makeup. Certainly there are no techinques shown for improving weak features. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the book--but I have to give it three stars because it does what it does well. It's just nothing I need or can use."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I can't imagine what I was doing before getting my hands on this book...the Nars technique has cut about 20 minutes off my makeup time in the morning; not because he takes a simplified approach, but because he discounts all those old adages, like &quot;Wear this color if your eyes are blue&quot;, or &quot;Don't arch your eyebrows if your face is round&quot;, etc. Nars seems to have 3 main ideas for choosing and applying makeup:wear what YOU want to wear,use your intuition about what looks right for you,and don't take the process too seriously. And to my particular delight, his advice for eyebrows is to stick to your natural shape and don't make them up too much (I describe myself as being in &quot;eyebrow rehab&quot; now that I've studied the less-is-more approach that Nars takes with eyebrows). The book is beautifully put together, although I'm not a big fan of the spiral binding. There's a transparent cover sheet over each photograph, showing the Nars Cosmetics colors &amp; products that were used on the models, the area of the face on which it was applied, &amp; the shape of the shading (so the reader can achieve the exact same effect). Some of the looks are outrageous or exotic, but most of them are absolutely lovely and highly realistic for the average woman. I keep the book propped up &amp; open to my favorite page in the bathroom, so I can glance at it while I do my own makeup. I can't recommend this book enough!! I finally feel satified that I've found the best makeup style for myself, thanks to Nars. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I had high hopes for this book since it was said to use models of all colorings. I am asian and find it to be pretty useless; the total number of models was small, so even though the models did have differing colorings, they a) can't cover too many looks anyway b)are mostly caucasians c)are mostly pale and freckled and blondeish.But in addition to being useless, it is hard to read with tiny light prints on white pages, and most of all, the photos are visually...ugly. Every picture looks like an autopsy photo. I'm not kidding. They look like they are lying motionless on a metal gurney. Maybe it's how giant the faces were and how devoid of any human context, maybe it's that the models have the usual snobbish unexpressiveness that models are supposed to convey, but the pictures are horrifyingly distrubing. With very few exceptions, they mostly look (marginally) better before the makeup, and in any case awake in me only fear and repulsion.I purchased the book expecting a pleasant and mindless piece of eyecandy, since I really like Nars makeup. Instead I am thrusted into a philosophical vision that seems to expose or symbolize the ridiculous horror show that is our quest for beauty. Maybe I should, instead of giving it a low rating, five stars instead, because it is more profound than I ever imagined.But Goddammit, I just want to learn how to look better!"},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I knew nothing about applying makeup outside of what I had learned about applying the basics. I stumbled up this book and althought the price is a little high, I was sure this was the make-up book I had been waiting for. There are before and after pictures of all the girls and then a clear sheet to lay over the picture to tell you where/what color to apply to achieve the desired look in the image. Then he explains later at the end of each chapter what techniques to use.The most helpful book I have ever bought about applying make up.Good for the beginner and the advanced."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"If you are looking for a book that shows you how to do makeup to go to work at your office, this probably isn't the book for you.If you are a beginning makeup professional like myself I find this book helpful. It has two full face size pictures, before makeup on the left and after on the right, with an overlay showing where and what product was used.It is all Nars makeup but the variety out there these days isn't bad and I think you can probably find the same colors in other product lines. (You might have to search a bit.)The graphic design of the book is great. It's a spiral bound hard cover so you can use it without it flopping around while you're working. I would say the detailed pages with light grey text on white is a bit annoying but other than that the desing is practical and useful."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"The book is vastly different from what I expected. I most appreciated the before and after shots with overlays showing detailed outlines of the work done in the after photos. These women didn't need much enhancement though and many of the makeup ideas were more practical for the catwalk than for &quot;real&quot; women. The difficulty came in trying to read the pages of text with light gray lettering on white. Uh-oh. Perhaps my age is showing."},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"Nars is a masterpiece at creating the most conservative to the most extreme make-up styles. There's something here to suit everyone.Also of note is how Nars mentions that his next book will feature every day people and not models. Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"Francois Nars gives some great advice in the text of the book. This type of advice is good for someone who is new to wearing makeup or the every day woman who doesn't know much about makeup artistry. For professional artists, this is already common knowledge. I do find some amusing contradictions however. For example, when he stresses the importance of sun health, wearing sunscreen and keeping the skin healthy yet many of the models have prominent sun damage on their faces.I also found 99 percent of the \\"looks\\" to be god awful ugly. These are NOT \\"ready to wear\\" street looks and so many of them were just off-the-wall high fashion runway or editorial looks that do NOT translate to \\"real life\\" or every day women. For example, the model whose mascara is so heavy it looks ridiculously clumpy or the model with nothing on her lids but thick black liquid eyeliner in her crease. Many of the models were also not attractive, had very masculine features, ungroomed brows (one with a full on Frida Kahlo unibrow!), etc. There were so many makeup \\"don'ts\\" in this book I lost count.In his book, Nars makes mention that Makeup Your Mind used models but he was planning on a \\"Makeup Your Mind 2\\" book that used \\"real women\\". That book apparently was never made as I don't find it on Amazon. With the type of makeup looks he did on these models, I can only imagine what sorts of hot messes that book would show (middle aged soccer moms with sagging lids, women with acne scars and hyperpigmentation, pitch black circles under their eyes, etc) Maybe that book was never made because those were makeup challenges Francois could not cut the mustard on.Don't get me wrong, I like NARS cosmetics and have a lot of it in my personal kit. But as far as a makeup book that serves as a real instructional guide, Kevyn Aucoin, Bobbi Brown, etc do a MUCH better job"},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I have already exchanged mine.Very nice quality of paper and pics, but:- it just shows very young models w/ pale pale complexions (that is, where makeup really shows easily);- it carries transparencies with the names of their colors aplied in every pic (what ridiculous propaganda!);- it is based on the fact that one simple item (like just a red lipstick, or just eyeliner or whatever) can change a whole look and that's all they show.(So far, Auckwin's have been the best I've bought, I just love both of them!)"},{"Title":"Makeup Your Mind","review":"I love NARS, their products are amazing and Francois Nars is a great artist. But this book was a complete let down. This isn't your typical makeup tutorial book, it is full of head on photos. One photo is the model bare faced and the next photo is of one with the model wearing makeup. My big gripe about the book is that out of all the photos there are only 4 women of color, big disapointment.There is a thin see through microfilm sheet of paper on top to show you placement of the makeup products and their name.The makeup applications are great, no explainations on how to put it on.

I like that Mr. Nars tells you the Nars color and the general color you can use in place of a Nars product. Some people commented the looks in the book are not street ready. I think many of the looks are. Nars is giving you a guide, and you choose colors that flatter your skin tone. Some of these are looks he created for runways and advertising, but adjust them to fit yourself. I'm not crazy about the plastic cover it comes with. That cover is too flimsy when not on the book. It should have been thicker or harder to match the book.

There are recipes for venison curry, venison meatloaf, rabbit pot roast, wild duck with orange sauce and cornbread stuffed trout. There is also a section on edible wild plants and berries, with recipes. Nutritional information is given for many of the food items listed in the book. Did you know that deer meat is loaded with B vitamins, for instance?To me, one of the best things about the book is that 100% of royalties go to Native charities. In the foreword it says that the royalties have helped to support scholarships, a children's camp and substance abuse programs. So you can give a little back, and you get a great source for Native North American foods."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"The author knew the original developers of UNIX, and it shows in the quality of the information in the book.

If you are having difficulty with this text, then get a beginning text on UNIX, like &quot;UNIX for Dummies&quot;."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is truly exceptional - it covered the UNIX programming environment from beginning to the end very well. Marc Rochkind has done an amazing job updating his classic book.A brief history of UNIX and a history of various UNIX standards such as POSIX, SUS and pretty much all the others plus a 30 minute crash course in the underlying structure of UNIX get the readers going. If you are anything like me that hasn't as much a thought about how process ID's are used and the creation child processes and how permission plays a role in process creation, you will enjoy this section. I learned that its one thing to \\"use\\" UNIX, and another to really understand it deep down. The standards that are out there really throws you off though as there are so many of them. How and which one to choose? It gets rather complicated. Marc spends the first section talking about all the difficulties of \\"choosing a standard\\", and then gives you a header file that you can plug into your code and off you go. I was pleased by that. I have already started using that header file in my code and I find it rather useful.Starting from the basics of files and file access, every one of the function calls are depicted in full and example is given for each one of them. This book is like a big \\"how-to\\" notebook that one can pick and choose what to read where to get valuable information from as one needs it. Another thing that the author does throughout his book, which made me very happy, was the little tables of \\"stats comparisons\\" between the various options and settings that were just discussed. No more guessing games as to what to expect or what to test. It's all right there. I know, for example, that blocked-sized I/O of 512 bytes takes less than a second to complete versus 223 seconds when a character at a time is read. You might think that this information is rather trivial, but do you know the difference in the time that it takes to access data stored in a regular file versus data stored on a raw disk device?Accessing the terminal can get rather complicated with all the options available, and I didn't know was how much more complicated this matter gets due to the relations that terminals have with sessions and process groups. Process group, session leader, process-group leader and the controlling process could make you life as a programmer very difficult if you don't know how they inter-relate. The power of UNIX comes in a box - you have to open it to see inside, but be very prepared before you open up that box.If you have done any network programming if your life, you want to know the details and options that are available to you if you are using \\"select\\" or \\"pselelct\\". What the timeout options are, and how you can use the \\"poll\\" system call to achieve the same task as \\"select\\", but more efficiently at times.Threads, Processes and their inner workings are covered extensively in this book, as one would assume. The difference in this author's explanation of these two topics is the presentation. The author in talking about these topics, and everything else from here on, builds a fairly complete command interpreter! Starts rather small, but by the end of the book, it is a full blown UNIX like CLI with pipelines, background processes, quoted arguments, handling of I/O redirection and accepting of environment variables. Processes and threads start the discussion with \\"fork\\", \\"exec\\" and other similar and related function calls. A great deal of time is spent talking bout these two rather important calls, and how they are used, options, inheritance of those options, and programming hints and examples for each one of them. Threads and synchronization of threads via mutex and conditional variables are the next topic if discussion. Threads could get a bit more complicated, so you should spend a bit more time reading this section. The author starts you of easy though. No mutex or race conditions are considered at first. It then gets rather interesting with the various race conditions that the authors has the reader think thru.Communication between threads processes have always been an interesting topic to cover. Pipes, names pipes, shared memory and sockets. Pipes are rather easy. They have their limitations, which are discussed in full, but they are rather easy. Names pipes (queues) and unidirectional pipes get the reader going, if you have not done any Interprocess Communication before. Even if you have, it's good to revisit something that is not really used these days. Messages, semaphores, sockets and shared memory are covered in a great depth by the author. What I absolutely love about this book comes in these later sections of the book. Marc, in depicting these topics and sections builds, from scratch, what could essentially be called a middleware - Simple Messaging Interface (SMI) he calls it.SMI is probably one of the best book examples I have seen. Besides the fact that it is very useful and practical all into itself, it also promotes good network programming practice. SMI is first implemented with Names Pipes or FIFOs, then using Message Queues, then Semaphores and finally via Shared Memory. Very well done Marc. If that's not enough, all of the implementations are compared with each other, and pros and cons of each one is given to aid a developer or a designer in choosing the right methodology.The Simple Socket Interface is the Socket implementation version of the SMI. Again, very well done and prescribed by the author. Besides being very good teaching tools, they are also very practical and useful; something that we are should have in our toolbox.I highly recommend this book to any developer; designer or an architect as it is very good teaching aid for all."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"(reviewed for the Calgary Linux Users Group Guild)There is a saying which goes, &quot;UNIX is user-friendly; it's just picky about who its friends are.&quot; Upon reading Advanced UNIX Programming, I get the impression that Marc Rochkind may at one time have been a close friend of UNIX, but having become a little disillusioned by what UNIX has become in the 19 years since his first edition, is willing to settle for being a calm, professional acquaintance. His opening chapter provides two main reasons why this has happened: first, the UNIX kernel has grown from providing 70 or so system calls, to over 600 for an implementation that provides Single UNIX Specification and POSIX compliance; and second, there are so many flavours of UNIX out there (including Linux) that none of them implement exactly the same set of system calls. Thus the increasing complexity and diversity of UNIX implementations makes it difficult to know all that can be called UNIX intimately. Rochkind's book presents enough material to make the reader an acquaintance, leaving the building of a friendship as an exercise for the highly committed.Rochkind makes a careful selection of just over 300 of the most important system calls and groups them into a handful of broad topics: I/O (file and terminal), processes and threads, inter-process communication (including sockets), signals, and timers. He takes great care to highlight what is available in Solaris (version 8), Linux (SuSE 8), BSD (FreeBSD 4.6), and Darwin (6.8; MacOS 10.2.8), and how to write something that has a hope of running on all of them. The system calls he describes are the ones anyone writing UNIX applications must know about. That is his target audience, and he meets that target squarely. If you are not already a C programmer and UNIX user, this book will not be useful for you.The book contains exercises and several code samples. Some of the larger chunks of code implement a simple shell, an HTTP client, and a full-screen text-mode menu system. This is not trivial stuff; it is reflective of the title, and demonstrates in a short space how to put the kernel to use. Rochkind also includes some example code that should work, but will not, just to illustrate that things are not as simple as they could be. He then walks the reader through the necessary corrections, bringing enlightenment as he goes. Each chapter contains this mix of tutorial material, useful to those who are starting to explore the UNIX kernel and how it can serve their applications, and reference material, useful to those looking for the bit of wisdom a man page cannot provide, but years of experience can.Rochkind also buries some treasure in the appendices. While his examples are all written in C, since this is the natural language for UNIX programming, he acknowledges that not every program that uses the UNIX kernel is going to be a C program. He describes two downloadable class libraries that map most of the UNIX kernel calls to objects and methods. These allow folk who prefer object-oriented languages to use the kernel without doing violence to their programming paradigm. Ux is a C++ wrapper, and Jtux is a Java wrapper that also works with Jython.As one might expect, Advanced UNIX Programming contains an extensive bibliography and reference list. If you had all of the works and resources he lists on your shelf, the body of his book would be superfluous. He has distilled things well.There are two technical things that I found missing from the book. The significant one is a discussion of how to deal with multiple processors, particularly around semaphores and other kinds of locks. This would be a valuable addition to the chapter on inter-process communications, especially now that these machines are becoming more common. The second, and by no means serious, omission is actually one that arises because of what he does include in an appendix: if he can describe a Java class library, why not make a reference to a set of Perl modules, too?So why do I rate this book as less than outstanding? Well, one reason is a matter of taste. I am not a fan of C preprocessor macro functions, but Rochkind makes heavy use of them in his examples to simplify error trapping and reduce the volume of code that had to be printed. This forced me to read code in a different way than my colleagues and I write it. I found it awkward to pick out the particular system call being used when it was coded as a parameter to a macro. The second is that I found his treatment of signals to be confusing. Admittedly, signal handling is not simple (and the newer signal-handling calls do little to help), but the chapter on signals felt like it was rushed to completion to meet the publication deadline. I read that chapter twice, and am still scratching my head. Add a handful of typographical errors to these irritants, and I wound up with a book that was not a joy to read straight through, but a chore. I will still use the book as an occasional reference, reflecting the comfortable professional relationship, but not intimate friendship, I have with UNIX, and maybe I will learn more on a subsequent reading."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"I found this book an excellent introduction when I first started doing network programming, sockets, signals, and threads in a Unix environment. After a while, though, I needed more detail and bought the excellent Stevens book &quot;Advanced Programming in a Unix Environment&quot;. I would heartily recommend both books, this one to get you into it, and the Stevens book as the hyper detailed reference."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"In 1987, I encountered the first edition of Rochkind's book. Grew to depend on it as an authoritative discourse on serious unix interprocess programming. Now (finally!) he has issued an updated edition. (Has it really been 19 years?)What is different? Much. Indeed, most of the book. In the first chapter, he summarises myriad developments in the unix world and, of course, the rise of linux. He writes for all the current unix variations and linux.Since 1985, there has been a plethora of different interprocess communications methods. So the chapters on these form a prominent part of the book. Then, naturally, in the networking chapter, who can ignore the web? So Rochkind gives a concise detour into http, with example code for a simple browser and web server.One thing unchanged from the first edition is the well deserved use of &quot;Advanced&quot; in the title. The treatment is sophisticated and, frankly, not an easy read for someone new to the subject. Rochkind writes well, but you do have to concentrate. He goes at a pace that at a very minimum assumes you are already facile in C and with using unix at the user level. The source code examples are simple, once you grasp the concepts.The problems he furnishes in each chapter can be extremely useful if you want to deepen your understanding. The questions are nontrivial and usually expand on salient points discussed in the chapters. If you are indeed new to all this, you should make a serious attempt at the problems."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"An excellent book for people who want to understand and program under UNIX operating system. The author has done a wonderful job by building a set of library routines for interprocess communication (IPC) and shown the merits, de-merits and highlighted the usefulness of available system calls.Use it alongwith Stevens' &quot;Advanced UNIX programming&quot; book."},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"This is an exceptional introduction to Unix features that most people won't see in every-day programming. The feature that Rochkind starts with may be the most problematic: portability. There have historically been dozens of Unices (sp?), all slightly different from each other. Even today, there are a number of different implementations in use, with small but maddening incompatibilities between them. Rochkind not only addresses the more common ones, he shows the standards-based ways of dealing with their differences.After that, Rochkind goes over read/write/open/close/ioctl again, dealing with [a]synchronous subtleties that can mean a 100x difference in performance, backed by code samples and timing measurements. The rest of the book deals with multi-process applications, including communication and distributed processing issues. That includes process groups, interprocess communication (with all its system-dependent weirdness), sockets, and signals.This isn't for the beginner or for the kernel developer, but never meant to be for either. It is a good, readable introduction to protentially tricky parts of the Unix API. I recommend it strongly to anyone building their own library of Unix references.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd Edition)","review":"I am a systems administrator professionally, but I have a need to know the inner workings of UNIX that only seems to be covered in programming books.

They only spend one page teaching you how to read tablature, which is completely inadequate for someone who is a complete beginner. There is minimal text in the book - everything is taught through tablature. There is almost no guidance on how to hold the guitar, and no guidance about hand positioning. No way is this a good book for an absolute beginner.I recommend getting a DVD where the show you how to hold the guitar, position your hands, and strum. I assumed that would be on the \\"enhanced\\" CD, but it isn't. The CD is a joke - way too complicated for a beginner and poorly made. The CD would've been impressive 10 years ago, but it is very weak by today's standards. No video, small window size (it fills about 1/4 of my screen), and minimal explanation of what you're looking at. If you're a complete visual learner, this book and CD may be helpful.

The remaining 200 are, in effect, a thoroughly-researched and illuminating monograph offering both a detailed contextualization and a fine-tuned close-reading of Frauenlob's magnum opus, the Marienleich (Lay of Our Lady) or Canticum Canticorum (Song of Songs). In addition, a CD is attached to the back cover, offering the reader a chance to hear a performance of the Lay by the eminent early-music ensemble Sequentia. This tremendous volume has much to offer a rich variety of readers and listeners, and to my mind undoubtedly deserves a correspondingly wide audience.The poem itself is an astonishingly intricate account of a celestial woman, first introduced in the third-person (in the first third of the poem) and later speaking directly to us in the first-person. Although the poem is often called the Marienleich, Newman stresses that this is description of the celestial woman is too narrow by far: \\"although she is the earthly mother of Christ, she is also the eternal partner of the Trinity and the life-giving principle of Nature\\" (xi). The facing-page translation is a bravura accomplishment, demonstrating a keen appreciation of the original and a poetic voice that allows Frauenlob's brilliance and audacity to be appreciated by a contemporary Anglophone readership (she wisely counsels those \\"who desire a keener sense of Frauenlob's metrical virtuosity, his exotic coinages, his wild chiming music, and his fervent baroque piety\\" [xvii] to learn Middle High German or, failing that, read the poetry of nineteenth-century Jesuit Gerard Manley Hopkins).Frauenlob's ecstatic, gloriously hyperbolic praise of the \\"sublime Feminine\\" finds a warm reception in Newman's text. In dealing with the misogynistic tradition and the consequent lack of women among Frauenlob's patrons and poet-peers, she is generous enough to state simply \\"this is not Frauenlob's fault; he did not create the culture in which he sang\\" (62). This strikes me as a refreshingly direct way to dismiss those who would judge the past by contemporary standards, only to find the past inevitably wanting. Newman is also entirely frank about the tremendous amount of sexual and erotic imaginative energy generated by the reception of the Song of Songs (here applied to Mary's conception of Christ -- the Celestial Lady boldly declares \\"I slept with three\\" in elucidating the Trinitarian nature of the event) an approach that moves beyond the stale century-old Freudian schema of sublimation without gingerly ignoring the central role that allegories of intercourse played in shaping many aspects of devotional discourse.This accomplished, learned volume also aims to serve as something of an ambassador: Newman seems -- like me -- to be baffled, even somewhat frustrated, by the relative lack of Anglophone interest in medieval German texts. For a host of reasons, German texts have received far less attention in British and American medieval studies than their French or Italian counterparts. With this book, she makes an impassioned case for the inclusion of Frauenlob's masterpiece in a broader European canon of medieval poetry, Marian devotion, and mysticism. Newman's exuberance and enthusiasm, both in writing and teaching, have inspired many; I earnestly hope this volume will inspire still more."},{"Title":"Baensch Aquarium Atlas (Vol. 1, 6th Edition)","review":"Everything about this book is complete, concise, and colorful.

The section is taking up most of the book and identifies over 600 fish species,with detailed species description. I own over a dozen freshwater aquarium books,but this one is with no doubt the most helpfull. It provides detailed information,and every time before buying a new fish,I read about it in this book. Some times I read twice,as I want to be really sure that I can keep it in my aquariums. All fishes have requirements - and some times they are very high,as with cichlids,so they cannot be kept in small aquariums or with other fishes. I also control that they have the right Ph requirements for my aquariums.If there are any gender differences in a species,or special reproduction behavior,it shows more than one photo of a fish - as with the guppies,there are more than 30 varieties,and all of them are pictured here!What is also helpfull is that the book is treating ALL the synonyms of their scientific names,both the plants &amp; the fishes. For example,I often encounter the common pleco under the name Plecostomus plecostomus,but in this book it is named with it\`s right name Hypostomus plecostomus,and that is also something which no other book does.It has so far proven to be very helpfull on all ways when selecting fishes.The last chapter treats fish diseases,and what to be used when they have Oodinium,for example. Often,this is a section poorly explained in many books,but not here. If you have another book,you might have to call some pet shop for getting advice,but I don\`t have to do such a thing when having this one.I also have to mention that this book has a very large full index. One for subjects,one for the right fish names and one for synonymous names. And that could be extremly helpfull.And for you who think there\`s not enough species covered in this one,don\`t worry!There are 4 books more,and this is the smallest!I also own the photo index,which covers 4000 species. See my separate review of that one for more information.Over all,this is the ULTIMATE AQUARIUM BOOK and a must-have for every aquarist."},{"Title":"Baensch Aquarium Atlas (Vol. 1, 6th Edition)","review":"The Axelrod atlas was the standard for years, but this one makes that book look bad. The reason: Every fish has a detailed description including origin location, maintenance, food, and breeding.

This book covers tank setup, fish, plants, and more.Unlike other photo guides, this one includes a more complete info section for each fish. Not just the pictoral symbols that some other books have.Each fish has a large and colorful picture, although the quality is some times lacking.

For most species covered it is an excellent all around reference book. There is some excellent detail given in some portions to specific breeding, behavioral data, and general husbandry information that will prove very important. Some species however, are not identified correctly. Most of the fishes that I encountered in the book that had been mislabled were mainly rarer fish in the aquarium trade. So, these flaws probably won't affect you, but beware.

Granted they are European, and the book is from a German translation, but the layout is handy, and the photos coloful, with textual information on maintenance and breeding (not just a table). I miss the old tetra hardcovers, though. Get the latest editions, too.This is a book that really helps to spur ones interest further becauase SO MANY species with color photos and information are covered. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT. Period.There are a handful of books every hobbyist needs. \\"Baensch Atlas 1-4\\" are one (some) of them.

It is understandable in all cases, slightly awkward in a few. However, there are certain instances where data is incorrect, or pictures switched or missing.

What set it apart for me is that it's a book about BEING a parent, not how to parent. It doesn't tell you how to raise your kids. It's about how parents feel and how we can feel better. It was one of the few parenting books I've read that is more likely to relieve guilt than create it.This book has no preachy advice; the author is truly respectful of individual differences and, having raised 10 kids herself, she's nothing if not realistic. She talks a lot about &quot;attitude and atmosphere&quot; and how the way we feel as parents affects those things. Along that central theme the book is filled with encouragement and food for thought. She really tries to uplift parents, encourage them to enjoy the ride and offers frequent reminders of the rewards of the job.The text is broken up by anecdotes from the author, her children and others, and quotes borrowed from everything from the Farmer's Almanac to Confucius. I pick the book up often for a shot in the arm of inspiration. The anecdotes alone could be read &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; style.Best of all, perhaps, the book is an easy read. It is written in a light tone. It's short, direct, and formatted for brief reading sessions (which is all most parents really get!)."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The 16 Secrets of Happy Parenting","review":"The author, Kay Willis, has 10 kids (yes, 10). It reads like Erma Bombeck and has wonderful advice in a non-lecturing way, makes you happy that you have kid(s). My husband is now worried that I will want lots more.This is the best parenting book I've ever read, period. I keep it with me and read it in the car during rush hour delays, and I arrive home completely jazzed and not guilty. As a nursing mom, I also read it while expressing milk at work; it's a really uplifting book. It's essential for parents who ever feel stressed, unsure of themselves, worn down by work and kid demands, and short on romantic or even friendly thoughts.Some examples that enticed me to actually finish the book (like most parents, I can't say that about most books these days):* It's not too thick!!* It was so entertaining and well-written I finished it before I knew it, and actually wished it wasn't over!* Kay reminds parents that if they are bored or not having fun, their kids feel the same, and urges parents not to serve leftover versions of themselves. Having fun, protecting your own sense of worth and happiness are essential to a healthy family. &quot;Having fun is an important parenting skill - if you're overcommitted and exhausted you're not much fun to be around&quot;* &quot;Let the chores go and have fun with your kids&quot; I always love to hear that.* Kay became Fisher Price's spokesperson for a new camera toy, by betting the president of Fisher Price that she could sell more toys than their camera &quot;expert.&quot;* She's upbeat and crazy and shares a lot of common sense* She relishes life.* Kay formed a group called &quot;Mothers Matter&quot; to help parents network and learn, because &quot;Motherhood is like a secret society.

She really empowered me as a mother to feel that I'm doing well and that despite my best efforts life will not always be rosey.

Smart, concise, it's a very easy and informative read.After an historical introduction to Indian cinema from the beginnings (just after the invention of cinema) to the glossy new millenium Bollywood of ZeeTV and NRI romances; Ganti procedes to a general presentation of the inner workings of the Hindi Film Industry (name usually prefered by scholars to the term Bollywood): how is a film made in Bombay ? who produces, how? who distributes, where? who has the power? This part along with the long historical introduction are the core material of the book, short but truly essential.NB Ganti focuses on Bollywood (located in Bombay). for beginners who think that Indian cinema is Bollywood, take note: it's not. Therefore the book acknowledges Middle cinema, art cinema, tamil, telugu, bengali cinema but never deals with these topics.After the \\"technical\\" part of the book, the rest is dedicated to an overview of the major films and personnalities of the profession. The major films chapter provides a very useful filmography that gives the neofit a very interesting selection of films to get to know Bollywood thru the ages. Each film has a detailed summary that sometimes includes historical insights or important trivia. Then there is the chapter about who's who in Bollywood, she lists major directors (although for most recent cinema many names are missing, as she herself underlines in the end notes), music and lyrics writers, actors and actresses (here again many recent actors and actresses box office sweethearts are overlooked but it's difficult to keep up with the star system and not all stars deserve such academic attention anyway, so if you're a Bollywood geek get over the absence of Salman Khan or Rani Mukherjee in that section).The end of the book is a series of interviews with directors, actors, producers... and this is where you will eventually find the \\"new comers\\" such as ShahRukh Khan (in a really cute itw for that matter) ...Ganti provides a short bibliography which is also very needed since ressources on Bollywood are not necessarily the easiest to find.Overall a great little guide that can prove essential to any world cinema class or even (in my case) anthropology class.as a complement to that guide I recommand Prasad's book Ideology of the hindi film a historical construction, a very insightful book with detailed analysis of such classics as Deewar for instance."},{"Title":"Bollywood: A Guidebook to Popular Hindi Cinema (Routledge Film Guidebooks)","review":"Book was in great quality.

Its organized alphabetically by the element name and is a handy 8 1/2 x 5 1/4 size. This book has held up well over the years as it's advice was very modern. For instance it advises the writer \\"Technically, every scene should end with a 'CUT TO:' All transitions are assumed to be cuts, so the author does not have to indicate them in the script. Use sparingly and with discretion...\\" This is excellent advice for a spec script. It will read easier and looks more modern. The same goes for their advice on continuations. I can tell you from experience that occasionally this will get you in trouble. I got chewed out by one producer who was appalled that I didn't have (CONTINUED) and CONTINUED: at the end and beginning of each scene that split pages. I explained that most books suggest only using that when dialogue is split and was quickly dismissed as a neophyte. Thankfully most modern screenplay software makes it trivial to find and insert those elements.

O'Connor does a remarkable job in tracing the numerous stuggles the Boston Irish faced, and how it shaped their attitudes today. The book is loaded with anecdotes and tales from of Boston more famous characters: from James Michael Curley to Bill Flynn. The book, by detailing the Irish political machines at the turn of the century, provides us with the mindset that has controlled Boston politics for over a century. Entertaining throughout, it is scary how much about Boston and its politics one can learn."},{"Title":"Special report: Hospital owned and operated skilled nursing and intermediate care beds","review":"I grew up in Boston in the 40's and 50's, Roxbury actually. I left in 1959 when I was 19. I view it as having escaped. The neighborhood was virtually all Irish Catholic.My parents, while not active in party politics were very politically conscious. Their political philosophy was quite simple. Roosevelt's Democrats walked on water; the Republicans were for the rich and against the poor (we, of course, were poor). To this day, over 43 years after leaving their house, I have a bit of trouble pulling the lever for a Republican candidate.As I grew older I realized that their philosophy, which was generally shared by all in the neighborhood, created problems such as complacency and corruption. In our neighborhood the Boston police from Station # 9 made no effort to conceal what they were doing while they picked up their payoffs from the many bookie joints along Dudley Street. Whenever the state investigated a corrupt official or the very corrupt Boston Police Dept. my mother would say that it was just the Republicans taking their revenge on good Irish Catholics. Somehow she always knew that these good Irish Catholics went to mass every morning. The corruption and incompetence in front of her made no difference in her thinking.Professor O'Connor's book helped me understand how my parents came to develop these political attitudes. Much of what he talked about still existed in the Boston Irish neighborhoods while I was growing up. I suspect to some extent it still does. I just finished reading \\"All Souls: A Family Story From Southie\\" by Michael Patrick McDonald. This is a very sad story which shows just how much the Irish Catholic's in South Boston have allowed their communities to degrade and allowed themselves to be snowed by their own Irish Catholic politicians.If you have any interest in Boston political history or Irish American history you will love this book. I'm sure that the history of the Irish in Boston is similar to the Irish in most major US cities."},{"Title":"Special report: Hospital owned and operated skilled nursing and intermediate care beds","review":"My roots, very informative, would recommend.

Yet, the BostonIrish never played the History Card as an agenda.The English actually kicked the Boston Irishout of the Boston Public schools in the 1800's.So, the Boston Irish were forced to bring the Catholic school system to Boston, Massachusetts.Just, a side note the Boston Irish brought thesubway system (T)and public library system (Copley) to Boston, Massachusetts.Also, the Irish had nothing to do with theARAB SLAVE TRADE (African Slave Trade), itgoes back to the 8th century on the continentof Africa.

Great journeys is a BBC production and the seven writers describe their journeys, with differing opinions and viewpoints. The seven journeys are: 1) the Silk Road, 2) the Polynesian Triangle, 3) the Pan American Highway, 4) the Burma Road, 5) the Baltic to the Black Sea, 6) the Salt Road, and 7) the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Terrific writing by all the writers, although I can't say I agree with all their viewpoints. This is especially the case with Philip Jones Griffiths who wrote about the Ho Chi Minh trail.

This very unusual story was hilarious, at times disturbing, and occasionally offensive, but almost entirely enjoyable. A warning to the reader: be prepared to abandon all rationality and to suspend disbelief, because this is a book that breaks all the rules. If you enjoy the work of Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and Monty Python's Flying Circus, this sci-fi comedy/fantasy is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","review":"Robert Rankin has become one of my favorite authors, and I rank this as one of his best. Even better than reading Rankin, in my opinion, is hearing Rankin himself. His characterizations really bring the story to life. I still think FandomThe Fandom of the Operatoris his best work ever, but I haven't read all his works. Anyway, if you're a fan of audio books and strange science fiction, you should really enjoy Rankin's audio works."},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","review":"As other readers have noted, some may have trouble keeping the plot straight. In many ways, the plot is a mess. But loaded with laughs, it is a good mess. As one of the more underrated works of Robert Rankin, it is often overlooked. I would suggest many readers look at it favorably.Our hero, Russell, starts at the local pub, only to discover that Hitler was not quite defeated and is quite alive in the present day 1990's. Hitler's current elaborate plot for world domination is nothing like the first. Time travel, a flying saucer, and the motion picture industry all play key parts in the plan. Loaded with absurd surprises, it is hard to justify giving away much of the plot in a review. Just when the reader imagines Russell defeated, another door seems to open. There are portions of this book that I must admit gave me weird and disturbing dreams. This is did not take away from my enjoyment of the book. When I regained my equilibrium and sorted the plot, I discovered that I must have enjoyed the book.I would recommend that readers not spread the reading of this book over a long period. It tends to allow the plot to become a mess in your mind. Since there is no Cliff Notes version, any help in disciphering this book is helpful."},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","review":"This work enforces the idea that the most important life lessons -- such as doing what is right, good and sacrificial -- is better communicated through the literary genre of fantasy than realism. With a knowledge of human nature and history, Rankin has created a wonderful piece of imaginative literature.Rankin's characters are realistic, and his hero, Russell, is an enlightened Everyman whose integrity is so down to earth, it is unearthly. The plot events are exciting, humourous, and existentially satisfying."},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","review":"I have read most of this author's books but I think this is my favorite. The set scenes and the running gags just have me in stitches. I love the skewed reality and the play on known characters from our own world.

The perfect antidote to the generally depressing economic news."},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","review":"Robert Rankin is not as funny as he makes himself out to be, or so IMHO. This story(?) is so disjointed that it's hard to believe that anyone actually edited this book. (I listened to Rankin read this on tape and it's got so much nudge-nudge wink-wink to be unbearable at times.) So much of the book digresses to show how smart? cute? verbally impressive? etc. that Rankin thinks he is.At one point of the book he is doing an American accent which is so patently NOT and American accent but what an Englishman thinks an American sounds like. What am I trying to say? Pretentious is what comes to mind. This is not Jasper Fforde or someone of that ilk, but a man who knows he's funny and you will too, whether you like it or not.And I think that's the defining point. Rankin writes for himself and if you read it it's because your smart enough to track down something he's written. But I didn't find this to be funny (ha ha) as much as I found it funny (weird) which is hard to sustain (and he doesn't). Well that's my opinion.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"50 Things to do With a Llama","review":"I bought this book thinking it was a serious discussion of llama uses and the details of these uses, it turned out to be a whimsical and sketchy tribute to llamas by someone who clearly loves these animals."},{"Title":"50 Things to do With a Llama","review":"When I bought this, I thought it was for adult readers while the content is more suitable for an 8 - 10 year old llama affectionado.

This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible.For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's actually *GREAT* for enthusiastic beginners. It has a little bit of *everything* depicting anatomy construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an *excellent* reference for all working artists.This is the book that really turned me on to the genius that is Bridgman. At first glance it may not be immediately impressive, but flip to page 167 for a quick look at his cubed-construction of the head. It's Bridgman's brief but effective treatment of cube-construction in this book that really, really impresses me. Many books *mention* cube-construction for heads; many books show a brief picture or two. But not many show it with the precision & detail that Bridgman conveys in just a few short pages. It deals with figure construction mainly in its parts- for full-figure movement, check out Bridgman's Complete Guide, or his less overwhelming Bridgman's Life Drawing. Constructive Anatomy begins with hands, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the book. (Bridgman's 100 Hands is much, much better.) Arms are next and they're easily among Bridgman's best, although not all the drawings are crystal clear. Many of the BEST drawings in Bridgman's Complete Guide are taken from this book, and his depiction of arms here is definitely among them. The shoulder & neck briefly follow, and are above average in their depiction. Then it's time for that excellent section: the cubed-construction of the head. It's only a FEW pages- I don't want to oversell it. But in my opinion at least, it's worth the price of the book. Individual features follow: eyes, nose, ears and mouth are simply & accurately treated. This is a more *in-depth* book than Heads, Features and Faces- which is mainly a simple introduction to the basics. Maybe the BEST section in Constructive Anatomy involves the Torso. He describes more in a few pages than most books ever do- and with a precision & beauty that few seem to match. The pelvis, legs, knees, feet & toes finish this truly excellent work. If anyone's overwhelmed by Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is a simple & effective choice to make- Highly Recommended!In short- Along with Book of a Hundred Hands and Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is currently in my Top 3 by Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"One of the few books that I constantly refer to in figure drawing. Although the content was written way back in 1920, the concepts are still as valid then, as now.The simple pencilled illustrations provide easy guidelines as to where one muscle stops and another begins. This enables one to draw a muscly figure with a few lines and shapes to show bulk and depth, especially with comic book illustration.Finally, the price is perhaps as great a drawing factor as the content. Some comic book artists swear by Geoge Bridgman's books. You might also want to try some publications by Jack Hamm."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out.

Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"In fact, I can safely say that this really is the most important book on artistic anatomy one can learn from. Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.----------1: The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough. Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part. Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.2: The anatomy isn't really exaggerated. Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another. If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click. The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.3: This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\" If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style. Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.4: I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this: \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\" Don't do that. It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click. Once you learn the fundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings. As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"---With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together. It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons. Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at. Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout. I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff. This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this. Like I said, take your time."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.Pros:As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.Cons:Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. For an anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"this book is a tragedy. great book, but publication quality is zero.don't buy a reprint.get the original."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.The other reason I love this book is the price.

None the less, I think this book is a helpful anatomy book, since it explains what the artist needs to know and is good for the basic review of muscles.

If nothing else, having it in your office library will give you credibility."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I was dissappointed in this product..it is not a copy of the original book..just a facsimile with less information..very incomplete..company didn't tell me..it was not worth the $20.00 it cost (including shipping). Also company never sent me notification that they received my order, none that they shipped..and never responded to my e-mails...a negative experience!"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Received book in easy to open packaging 2 days before delivery date, the book is of good quality and provides a wealth of information of the human anatomy. Buy today!"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I think every artist has this book on their shelf. It's one of those classic books that everyone still uses. Bridgman rocks!"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Just when you think you nailed anatomy, this man ability will put you back in line, sucka. these books are small, portable and afforadable. top notch."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I expected more from this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"This book has been very useful as a reference for me personally and for the students that I teach. The subject matter is illustrated in a way that makes it possible to use for all levels without offending anyone"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Although a little too complicated for the real beginner artist, this book has a wealth of information for the intermediate to advanced artist. At times the text seems a little old fashioned and obscure and is difficult to understand what he is getting at but most of the drawings are self explanatory and excellent teaching illustrations. Recommended."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"If your a Bridgeman fan or just want to learn how to draw anatomy this book is worth the price. I have been drawing longer than I can remeber but just recently decided I wanted to improve my art skills mainly my ability to draw the human body. So I started buying art books on human anatomy and this by far is my favorite one and heres why, its at a comfortable size so you can easily take it with you, it has close to 500 illustrations, and his style is helpful to me most when I'm drawing from memory. For its price I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"This book is filled with pictures. George B. Bridgeman did a great job with this book. The reason I gave only 4 starts is beacuse it was kinda hard to understand. I mean I spent 20 min. figuring out the introduction and still dont full understantd it. But farther into the book it was easier to understand but still difficult. I am only 13 and this book may have been written for college students or adults so that may have been one reason I dont unerstand so well but once you start picking it up you learn a lot of stuff about the human anatomy. THIS IS GREAT FOR COMIC BOOK ARTISTS, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ARTIST."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"I'm a Bridgman fan, but his complete guide to drawing from life is available used for $7.50. and sells new for $12.21. This is less than an introduction to the genius that is Bridgman, get the big book."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"&quot;Constructive Anatomy&quot; is unique in that George presents the viewer a 'real world' application of the muscles, by telling you what each muscle does.I'd be wrong in saying this book is a one-stop source for learning to draw people. Let's face it anatomy is tough and artists can use all the help they can get! What this book offers that other's don't is different views and applications of perceiving the limbs, muscles, bones, joints, etc., of the body. For the price it's listed out, ya can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"If you are learning anatomy, this is a great resource. Great explanations, illustrations and easy to follow suggestions for creating your own realistic drawings."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"Its a great beginner drawing book for the aspiring artist that need to work on the human figure and constructive movement"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"This book has already helped me figure out how the body works when drawing, and I have a better understanding of the human anatomy"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy","review":"This book is an incredibly helpful reference book. It totally helps art students to become better at the anatomical study and to understand the differences of each part of the body. I have owned so much many others anatomy books and this is by far the best one. I will always go back to Bridgman."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"I originally purchased this book as a reference for my children for homeschool study. However, as I began to read some sections of it, I found it to be foundationally incorrect.In the introduction the first question is &quot;What is the Bible?&quot; Good question, but I was shocked by the answer, &quot;The Bible is one of the great classics of world literature. It's stories may well have happened long ago in a handful of small countries at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, but today they are still read enthusiastically by millions of people all over the world.&quot; WHAT.... great classics of literature... no where does it say that the Bible is the holy, inspired word of God....My next red flag, as I skimmed, was found in a section of the &quot;Pentateuch&quot;. Here's a quote..&quot; Some parts of the Pentateuch might easily go back to ancient times, but as time passed, life changed - and old laws needed to be updated and new ones produced, and these would have been added by later editors.&quot; WHAT.... the Bible edited....My next red flag was in a section on Jesus the prophet... let me quote the paragraph for it's full effect.... &quot; Jesus did and said things that seemed to be making grand claims for himself. Although he rarely claimed to be the Messiah outright, he did on occasion imply as much. For example, the gospel of Luke records that Jesus read from the Old Testament book of Isaiah and claimed that 'This passage of scripture has come true today, as you heard it being read.' In the gospel of Mark, Jesus offers to forgive sins and is found casting out demons - both of these hinting at a special relationship with God.&quot;WHAT A special relationship with God..... no where does it say he is the son of God.These three examples were enough for me to feel that this book was not one that we would keep in our library. I can not overlook such contradictory foundational statements regarding our faith. If Jesus is not the sinless, son of God and the Bible is not the holy and inspired word of God, I have no basis for my faith. Please be cautious in purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"On the surface, this book has everything you need to guide you through the Bible and the culture of Biblical Times. It is well organized, and has great pictures.Unfortunately, it is written from a totally secular view point. If you are a Christian, you will likely be offended by the tone of the writing. It is as if the author wanted to make sure that you didn't think that he actually believed the Bible to be true. I did not find much that was actually unfactual, but the miraculous and Spiritual aspects are usually watered down or omitted. The author uses quotation marks in nearly every sentence to show that this is what \\"some people\\" thought, instead of saying \\"this is what the Bible says.\\" It is very irritating.If you are looking for a book that treats the Bible as a great literary work, then you will probably like the book; and it does have great information on the Jewish culture. If, on the other hand, you are a Christian lookiing to better understand the Bible, or for your kids to use (my purpose), then you probably do not want to purchase this book. We ended up cutting it up for the pictures, which means that I guess it does have some use!"},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"I bought this book through amazon. What a disappointment!! If are going to buy this I recommend reading straight from the Bible along with it because there is definitely a conflict. Abraham, whom God blessed, is shed in a very bad light in this book. The list of Abraham's weakness' include selling his wife Sarai to be an Egyptian prostitute and almost murdering his son. That's just a start."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"This book is excellent reading and research material for anyone searching for solid answers to questions about how everything fits together in the Bible. It covers the different people, trades, lifestyle, geography with maps, etc. It is tabbed for fast research. My daughter said that just reading the first 20 pages explained more to her than she had ever understood about Biblical times and customs. This book is great to just read from cover to cover and then refer to as you study the Bible, both old and new testament. It enlightens the study to a more understandable text for the common person."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"This book has everything you could want from a bible encyclopedia. It focuses mainly on religion and history. It has a book by book discription of each book in the Bible. It talks about ancient cultures and civilizations. There are color markers on the upper right hand corner to help you to find what you need to find on other pages in the book. It has large lifelike pictures and illustrations. The questions and answers in the book are interesting. It is just a good all around book. I defenately would recommend this book for anybody who want to understand the background of the Bible as much as possible."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"This large full-color reference book is divided into seven sections - Biblical History, Peoples and Empires, The Life and Teaching of Jesus, The Bible Book by Book and a few others. It helps to set order to events in the Bible and dig deeper into everyday life, temples, healing, etc. as well as each book of the Bible in a two-page overview listing key characters and events. I use it for Sunday school and have a difficult time not skimming through other pages to pick up a little more background on another topic."},{"Title":"Nelson's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Bible","review":"My children and I are very happy with this book. It is an amazing learning tool with an abundance of knowledge."},{"Title":"Tome of Horrors II (Sword Sorcery)","review":"Published by Necromancer Games, which promises 3rd edition playability with a 1st edition feel, this book delivers on almost all fronts. Even the art has a cast of the old Fiend Folio to it, though just updated enough to not seem out-of-place or old-fashioned next to it's contemporaries.The monsters all fit cozily into various niches of various kinds of campaigns. Really, there were very few monsters where I thought, &quot;Where the heck would you even meet up with something like that?&quot;, and in most cases where the ecology wasn't clear, the critter was undead or an elemental, both monster types that don't necessarily mesh realistically into a campaign world.The write-ups were clear and concise and, for the most part, accurate. It wasn't perfect, though, and so it doesn't get five stars. It'd get four-and-a-half if I could swing it, but . . .DMs, buy this book. Surprise your players with brand-new monsters that feel like you've met them before. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tome of Horrors II (Sword Sorcery)","review":"I have I & II now. This follows the same format as 1 but has descriptions of each creature. The Art is still B&W.; I have become very spoiled with all the color WOTC puts in to its products. The Art is good for the most part. My other complaint is there are too many water creatures. I have been playing for 30 years now and have only met 1/2 dozen water creatures. I think they can just stop with them already. They are a waste of space.The Big pluses are the Templates, new monster feats and some planar info on where some of these monsters might hail from. All in all the extra info makes up for the wasted space. Some of the Devils and Demons are cool as well as some new undead and some new SU/SA abilities.I want to see more Epic level stuff."},{"Title":"Meta-Cation, Vol. 1: Prescriptions for Some Ailing Educational Processes (v. 1)","review":"The authors make clearly the point that often not the pupils are the main problem - but the teachers since they often are incapable of communicating. This is a great book on the topic of NLP applied to learning problems and sometimes simple solutions to help the children.The authors writes very clearly and quite often very amusing."},{"Title":"Adventures in English Literature","review":"This anthology covers both non-fiction and fiction from the discovery of the American continent through the latter 20th century. Literary excerpts are interwoven with historical and biographical information that establish an excellent foundation for analysis of the works included. The thematic ideas and themes that permeate American culture are traced across the centuries, creating a cohesive record of major American themes and ideas. Each time period concludes with analytical and comprehension questions, as well as an appropriate discussion of relevant literary elements. It's an excellent anthology.The seller of this book (Blue Claw) delivered within 3 days, but the packaging was very thin and slightly ripped when it arrived. When I opened the book, the smell of cigarette smoke permeated the entire book. It took two weeks and some spraying to eradicate the smell. I did not contact the seller or send it back as I needed the book then and didn't know whether I would run into the same issue again. This could be an anomaly for Blue Claw and they have not had the opportunity to respond at this point, but I'm hesitant to order from them again."},{"Title":"Act Natural: How to Speak to Any Audience","review":"This book, written by Ken Howard, a star of stage, screen and television and an experienced teacher at presigious schools, breaks new ground for those of us who dread to face the frightening task of speaking in public.Howard draws on his extensive background to give you effective methods to overcome stage fright (you really don't want to eliminate it.)

Lavergne (Director of Admissions Research, University of Texas - Austin) is the straightforward accounting of a 1984 multiple murder in Texas - when Moroccan national Abdelkrim Belachheb walked into a restaurant and shot seven people, six of whom died. The confessed and convicted defendant could not be sentenced to death due to a quirk in the state law, and could only be given life imprisonment - arguably &quot;worse than death.&quot; House Bill 8, the &quot;multiple murder&quot; statute, was passed directly in response to the case. Worse Than Death examines all sides of this horrific incident, including the legal, political, and cultural debates concerning it. This criminology and judicial case study has direct relevance to present day concerns about violent immigrants and our contemporary legal system nationwide."},{"Title":"Worse Than Death: The Dallas Nightclub Murders and the Texas Multiple Murder Law (North Texas Crime and Criminal Justice Series)","review":"A fascinating book particularly for the Dallas resident that remembers this horrifying event.

The book is not only a valuable resource for the historian, but an easy and interesting read. As a Medal of Honor historian myself, I can certainly appreciate the effort that went into creating this record for future generations, and highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Crime, Shame and Reintegration","review":"As a victim of a violent crime (murder of a loved one), and preparing to take part in a victim/offender conference I felt the need to find out more about this new way of dealing with crime ie Restorative Justice. In this book John Braithwaite discusses the reasons why criminals offend and why the current justice system fails to satisfy the needs of the majority of victims. His theory with regards to reintegretive shaming and its subsequent applications are well thought out and compelling. As a criminologist and academic Mr Braithwaite tends to use many &quot;in-house&quot; phrases and words which makes the book heavy reading, especially for a layman such as I looking for simple answers. However, the content and theory are excellent, well researched and relevant in todays crime ridden society. I believe that Mr Braithwaite has the answer, or the beginning of the answer, in this book and I would make it compulsory reading for all existing and would be Judges in the world today. I highly recommend the book to all concerned citizens looking for an explanation, an answer, and a solution to the upward spiralling crime rate."},{"Title":"Crime, Shame and Reintegration","review":"Braithwaite draws on the essentially anthropological literature to observe that societies which employ communal shame for one who victimizes are also societies which have least 'crime.' Many kinds of crime perpetrated in this culture lack a concern for the perpetrator's insult to the victim, and thence to the social order. Braithwaite mentions white collar crime as particularly missing the point of victim-restitution. Instead of having court procedures which are too narrowly focused on &#34;facts of the case and opinions from law&#34; then deprivation of liberty as sole sanction against the criminal. Braithwaite recommends that a kind of &#34;shaming&#34; ceremony take place conducive to instilling remorse in a criminal. I for one consider this as &#34;good medicine&#34; for anyone who deliberately or inadvertently violates another, as a worthwhile aspect of a perpetrator's &#34;assuming full responsibility for what he/she has done.&#34;"},{"Title":"Doors","review":"This book was a bit of a departure for McBain. It's crime fiction, but not one of his addictive 87th Precinct novels, nor part of the Matthew Hope series. Instead, this one was about a burglar and his buddies; an assortment of thieves, hookers, and even a \\"square\\" or two. The blurb on the back calls this \\"one of the most powerful and gritty novels of his career,\\" but I think that's being overly generous. First published in 1975, this is a good read, but the dialogue is quite dated and overall the novel lacks tension and the usual dollops of humor that lighten up McBain's 87th Precinct books. I also thought the ending to this one was disappointing, lacking any sort of real surprise or exciting climax. Actually, there was a slight twist at the end, but not one that added much to the story. For McBain fans, this is worth picking up, if only to compare it to his other non-87th Precinct novels that he wrote under both the Ed McBain and Evan Hunter names."},{"Title":"Trains of Wisconsin","review":"I am a railroad buff, so after I checked this out from the local library, I had to get a copy for myself. It gives a good and comprehensive (though not exhaustingly detailed) look at the railroads that have helped to shape Wisconsin since they first arrived more than 160 years ago. It takes a look at such lines as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific (Milwaukee Road), the Chicago & North Western, the Green Bay & Western, the Chicago St. Paul Minneapolis & Omaha (the Omaha Road), the Milwaukee Lake Shore and Western, and the Minneapolis St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie (Soo Line), and others.

I recommend it to anyone who has questions about why &quot;the police do the things they do!&quot; Or, why the police can't do things that citizens want them to do.

If you have a negative opinion about those who protect and serve, this book will open your eyes to the way it really is, to be &quot;behind the badge.&quot;"},{"Title":"COP The Truth Behind the Badge","review":"This book should be required reading for all new law enforcement officers.

Its in your face and the author makes no apologies for chapters like \\"Dirty Harry was right, nothing wrong with shooting as long as the right people get shot,\\" \\"Homeland INSECURITY, the price of freedom,\\" and \\"Racial Profiling, the color of a criminal.\\" In \\"Racial profiling\\", if you only read the first part you would think Ric Robinson was in favor of that type of police work. He's not, but you have to move through the chapter to learn he finds the practice abhorrent. He does, however, support 'criminal profiling', while making fun of all the TV experts which got the Serial Snipers wrong! He said they sounded like \\"barkers in a carnival\\". Ric Robinson is a former state police director. I think he's the most straight forward cop I've ever heard about...or read. Cop The Truth Behind The Badge is not \\"PC\\". Can you handle the truth?

The book contains civil war phots and paintings. Each indivisual is given a biography that includes their involvemnt in the civil war. This is a good starting refrence for anyone doing research on the civil war and it is a good companion source to Ken Burns' Civil War."},{"Title":"Who Was Who in the Civil War","review":"This is a great resource. At a glance, it looks like (and maybe it is) a coffee table book, but that appearance shouldn't fool you. Nearly every personality from the Civil War is covered in this book, with photographs or paintings of many of them. The biographies are not limited to birth and death dates, but include the individual's participation in the War, and many entries \\"editorialize\\" a bit to give some perspective on the person's personality, reputation, and overall impact on the War. I've noticed more than a few typographical errors in the text (misspellings, etc.), but these don't detract from the book's value. As with a good book of Civil War maps (see my other reviews), this resource can both make for good browsing, and be an indispensable supplement to your Civil War reading. When reading a War history, I find that it's easier to keep track of the lesser-known generals and soldiers if I have a face and some background. This book helps greatly."},{"Title":"Great Movie Comedians: From Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen.","review":"No one understands and appreciates movie comedy better than Leonard Maltin, and here he has written a book on the subject that is simply perfect. His enthusiasm and love of these comedians and their comedies is infectious, and he gives us a giddy yearning to watch the movies he cites. If one is an aspiring comedian, too, this is an inspirational book, filling one with the wonderful possibilities of making an audience laugh. It is difficult to fully describe the unpretentious, simple manner in which Mr. Maltin nails down the very essence of comedy in these pages. How often those who write about comedy smother their subject with detailed theories on its socialogical and psychological implications. Mr. Maltin understands better than anyone the subtle art of analyzing comedy without killing it, making his book an absolute joy."},{"Title":"Great Movie Comedians: From Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen.","review":"This book holds up today.

Anyone interested in film comedy's history must own this book."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book takes a historical and cultural look at breastfeeding and formula-feeding. Fact-based and well-researched, this book is full of thought-provoking information and information that is not usually made public knowledge due to politics and profit interests.Sections cover: * Breastfeeding customs around the world * Wet nursing, surrogate feeding and healing qualities of breastmilk * Cow's milk is for cows * Artificial feeding * The global search for formula sales * Women and workOf particular interest is the United States' historical/cultural lack of support of global breastfeeding policies and the strength given to formula companies to dictate the health of America's babies."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book explains the WHO Code in detail and how American companies are ignoring it; it also explains the Nestle Boycott (which my family is a part of!).It's not just all emotion....the authors have facts and figures and references. The historical content was so interesting to me.In a perfect world, all mothers would breastfeed their children; this isn't a perfect world by any means. If, however, those who are against breastfeeding (for whatever reason), would read this book, perhaps they would see things differently.And yes, there are mothers who can not breastfeed, no matter how hard they work at it, no matter how much support they have...I'm not against artificial baby milk: I'm against the way it's marketed and the way the companies undermine a new mother's attitude - by supplying her with formula as she leaves the hospital - in a &quot;Breastfeeding Success&quot; diaper bag! Honestly, I received one of these after having my son. What kind of message is that for a new mother - and why are we allowing this to happen in the USA after agreeing to adhere to the code?Everyone ought to educate themselves - especially expectant parents, fathers included!!! The WHO Code is an important agreement and we should all be aware of it. This book is perfect reading - loaded with information."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book should be required reading for all teenagers as part of their economics classes, their sociology classes, and their health classes. The subject matter in this book covers all of this range. Shown is the health implications for babies who are denied their mother's milk. This is especially important for those babies who are artificially fed in undeveloped countries where there is no access to clean water or sanitation. For those babies, artificial feeding is not only a substandard choice, it is a deadly one. Further, this book illustrates why the chioce to artificially feed infants is being made in more often in these countries, dealing especially with the lies the formula companies perpetuate. Readers will understand how a multibillion dollar business has been developed on the backs of babies.Readers will also learn, probably for the first time, that the behaviour of formula companies has become so evil that there are a number of international organizations that have ongoing efforts to save babies from the deadly consequences of the formula manufacturer's lies. Many will be surprised to read of a decades old boycott, and an ethical marketing code developed by the World Health Organization, both of which have been flaunted and ignored by the formula manufacturers.Most readers will be familiar with movies and novels that deal with drug manufacturers making deadly substances and knowingly hiding the information, even at the risk of many deaths, in order to reap the profits. Milk, Money, and Madness will detail such a story. It's all true and much more evil and insidious than anyone will ever suspect until they read the book."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"I read this book before I gave birth to my first child. (I am the mother of six.)It made such an impact on me that I have been a breastfeeding advocate ever since. This book covers cross cultural aspects of breastfeeding. Beware that this book has the possibility to make a mother feel very guilty for not breastfeeding. It gives a mother infinite reasons of why human milk is what every infant is entitled to consume. I have used this book as a reference to many research projects from formula study to mother - infant bonding. Fathers should be encouraged to read this book. No man should question a mother's right to breastfeed after he reads the views put forth in this masterpiece. I agree with other reviewers that all teenagers should read this book. Future generations would benefit from current generations reading this book."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is an intelligent, thought provoking look at the way our culture has methodically turned it's back on one of the most basic acts of nurturing our children.

Thus, this book is certainly a timely essay on breastfeeding practices around the world. But Baumslag and Michels really aimed at setting the record straight for normal infant nutrition; they analyze the cultural practices surrounding natural, and hence normal, feeding in infants and bravely expose the lucrative business of artificial, and hence abnormal, infant nutrition. They also explain in great detail the almost miracle properties of human milk, as opposed to artificial formulae, and how it protects children far beyond infancy in ways no health insurance can. Unfortunately, they avoid discussing practical issues, such as the means to enhance milk production or even breastfeeding techniques. Neither pharmacologic galactogogues, such as metoclopramide, nor the scientific basis for their proper use, are discussed in any detail. Furthermore, the obvious lack of pharmaceutical support and funding for studies in the field of galactogogues (which would be an area of fruitful research, by the way) is not dealt with in this book. The fact remains that, even now, with less than 50% of all new mothers attempting exclusive breast-feeding, and with less than 20% of them maintaining it for four months in a row, there is still a lot to be learned in the fields of psychology, sociology, endocrinology and even economics to explain these disappointing statistics. All things considered, this book is a serious step in the right direction."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"Provocative, infuriating, incredible...a compelling mix of economics, international relations, political maneuvering, and class issues, along with histories of American business, culture and family, public health, obstetrics, and child-rearing trends. Absorbing, memorable, and well-documented. Must read for women, parents, health workers, youth workers, students of international business, and anyone who crafts health policy."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This is very well researched and should inspire anyone to believe that breastmilk is the only way to feed a baby. After reading this book, anyone will become a staunch breastfeeding advocate and will cringe to see a bottle in a baby's mouth, diaper bag, or a formula ad appearing anywhere. I love the information on how respectfully women are treated around the world, expected to nurse and nurture their babies- and then contrast that with how poorly the US society treats women. still! Six weeks isnt' long enough for moms and new babies and Dia points out the wonderful ways that the rest of the industrialised world copes with the reality of nurturing the next generation"},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This definitive history of formula, pharmaceutical companies and infant death is highly readable, despite its depressing topic. While it would be comforting to think that formula fed babies only die at a higher rate than breastfed in places without access to clean water that just ain't so -- never has been, never will be, and the companies which make formula know that. Which is why the code of advertising (which formula -- which is to say, pharmaceutical -- companies continue to violate) adopted in the early years of the boycott applies around the world, including in the U.S.Along the way, Baumslag and Michels include some really amusing sidelights like the invention of the stroller by a New York man, and its adoption by Queen Victoria. One tiny snit: they're anti-swaddling, considering it a barbaric, backward practice that only occurs in backward, barbaric places and should be stamped out."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book should be on every mother-to-be's MUST READ list. It goes into great detail about breastfeeding in other cultures, how the medical establishement derails a mothers efforts before she can even get started, and the overly agressive marketing tactics of the formula manufactures.There are heartbreaking tales of the number of babies who were killed by artifical feeding.I cannot reccomend this book enough!

Not only does it promote breastfeeding in new mothers, and encourage them to continue, but it helps others overcome our societal bias against breastfeeding. Some places ban breastfeeding on grounds that it is indecent exposure! This fear almost prompted me to quit nursing my daughter, but I am now proud to be seen nursing her in public, and I hope that promotes awareness that there is nothing dirty about feeding your baby the best food available. This book goes a long way to prove that point, and to topple the formula industry's 70 years of lies. There is so much more to breastfeeding than &quot;feeding&quot; and I am grateful to this book for helping me overcome my anxieties. Nursing has turned out to be the most wonderful experience of my life, and I have this book in part to thank."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"Baumslag has done an excellent job again to help promote the ways and whys of breastfeeding, to help health professionals, potential breastfeeders, and, most importantly, the little ones who stand to benefit most."},{"Title":"Milk, Money, and Madness: The Culture and Politics of Breastfeeding","review":"This book is very inspiring as well as being very well researched.

It should be required reading for college students in business ethics courses. Students majoring in health education, nutrition, family sciences, and women's issues, all should read this during their coursework.The statistics and studies cited, and information contained, are invaluable in understanding how we came to be a formula-feeding society. And they are the nuggets of how we can reverse that situation. Inform yourself! And you'll begin to be able to inform others, too [given opportunities].

I only thought I knew about breastfeeding when I ordered a copy.I actually disagree with whomever said in their review that this book will make formula feeding mothers feel guilty. I don't think it should make them feel guilty; It should make them feel angry! Angry at Big Pharm in the US, angry at the US government for its total lack of support and education, angry at the AAP for taking contributions from formula manufacturers, angry at their pediatrician and his/her staff for any ignorance and lack of support, and for their use of growth charts that try to compare formula fed babies to breastfed babies! And angry at the complete and utter failure in our country when it comes to new moms and maternity leave from work. It's easy to say every mom should breastfeed. Of course they should!

I received this in great condition with shrink rap and a thick, sturdy, durable case in which to hold the leather bound book in. The thing I love about this edition of the LOTR trilogy is the gold trim on the edge of the pages. If ever quality were to be at its high for a book, this would be it. I have a complaint about the binding of this pristine, elegant set or collection of the LOTR trilogy. Though Houghton Mifflin published a suberb set for the 50th anniversary of the trilogy, they could've spent more time on the durability of how the book's spine would hold, more so the binding felt cheaply put together with crinkles and crackles when opened up for a read. The price is steep for the contents of the book, I would urge LOTR fans to by this if you're loyal to Tolkien lore. For people who just want to read this at a cheaper price, just by the set in paperback. Overall I like this set but wished time would have been spent on the binding and the durability.

She recently started reading The Hobbit, so I figured she would probably want to continue with the rest of the story. Delivery was fast, product came in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is little point in commenting on the text of this monumental, timeless classic; when you go for this version, it's all about the edition. (It is confusing that Amazon throws together all reviews of this book irrespective of editions!). The price has come down quite a bit since it was first issued, but this will still be an expensive buy by most standards, and one that raises expectations of a very well made book. These expectations are only partly met. I was very pleased with the mottled grey appearance of the coverings; the book itself feels somewhat suede like, quite pleasant, though it doesn't look or feel 'leather bound', the covering material is very thin. The book is large, heavy and seems fairly sturdy, even though the covers are maybe just a little thin in proportion to the bulk of the book. The paper is slightly cream-colored, with very little show-through, and the text is set in a clear, crisp type. Title pages have two-colored print, red and black. The gilded edges are a rich or slightly tacky detail, according to taste. Two large foldout maps are at the front and back of the book. They are kept closed by a little dot of glue, which seems unnecessary and carries the risk of damaging them when folding them out.On closer inspection there are some disappointments. The slipcase in particular seems to be put together rather indifferently. I suppose few owners will spend much time staring at the innards of this box, but at this price that is still no reason to leave it the mess that it is. Basically the slipcase is a loosely folded, prefab box with the cover-material wrapped around it. The edges inside are uneven, and outside, in my copy at least, on the front of the box surplus glue has oozed from under them. The illustrations on the back and front are not completely correctly positioned, their edges are not quite parallel to those of the box. As there are no indentations you have to give the slipcase a very firm shake to extract the book from it. The book itself lacks a headband at the bottom, a small but surprising omission that reinforces the feeling that the book was made to impress at first glance rather than from a wish to produce a truly excellent book. There is a whiff of the fake about it.I would urge people interested in a deluxe edition of LOTR to check out the one that Harper Collins published in the UK. Another reviewer has compared both editions in some detail, and I fully agree with his findings. The UK edition is less obviously spectacular, but has an understated chic that makes it more timeless. As a book, it is clearly better made than the US edition, the level of finish is indeed quite amazing. It is slightly more expensive, but definitely worth the extra outlay. And die-hard fans may be pleased to find that, unlike with the US edition, a matching version of The Hobbit is available."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Several reviews cite the fact that there are some serious errors in this Kindle version. For those of you that have bought other books for Kindle 1,2 or 3 I have a question.When they update (fix) the book that you have bought, does your previously paid version update or do you need to re-purchase the newest \\"fixed\\" version?As a life-long fan of Tolkien's work, I would hate to spend my time and money gnashing my teeth on such a seminal work only to find they \\"fixed\\" it two months later. I have a Kindle 3G/Wi-Fi. Please advise."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I too have read The Hobbit/LOTR countless times--at least once a year since first discovering them, in the late 60s; what an awesome feat of creation by Tolkien! In fact, I'd read them so much that by the time the BBC cassette production was released I knew the story so well that, though I appreciated being able to hear rather than read it, I found it disturbing to listen and KNOW when words, sentences, or paragraphs were missing. :)So I was thrilled when the unabridged recordings were made, and immediately bought all four, first on cassette, then on CD. They have since given me endless hours of pleasure, and I now listen to the books at least once a year as well as still physically read the paper versions (sometimes in conjunction, if it's not possible to either listen or read at a particular time, catching up when I return to the other media).The recording was very well done and the CDs have held up wonderfully through the years (the cassettes, of course, didn't fare so well, eventually stretching and warping the sound); a terrific way to have such an exceptional story presented.And what a smart choice, or lucky chance, that resulted in Rob Inglis being the one chosen to read it; every time I listen to other narrators I'm thankful once more that Rob reads my most favorite. His different tones, speed, and styles give the characters life, and I always know who's speaking as he unfolds the tale; and what a voice! What a priceless gift ... to accomplish such a remarkable narration. I believe that Tolkien himself would have picked Rob to tell this tale. And I'm so grateful this marvelous creation of Tolkien's was made available for the ear to hear."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The LOTR trilogy is fantastic. But more on that in a moment, first a note about this three-book hardcover version (with the off-white covers). It was impossible for me to choose which edition I wanted, and I settled on this one. I was very disappointed when--despite Amazon's description--it is not illustrated by Alan Lee. There are no illustrations except Tolkien's from the original text. Otherwise, though, this is a good, durable, convient for reading, individual hardcover set. The hardcovers are a good size for reading.First time reading this since I saw the movie, second time reading.A classic of the genre that started too many clich&eacute;s of that genre. The characters are pretty flat and much of it is simplistic and silly and incredibly tedious and often confusing (hence where the films succeed with loving care). And yet, it's still wonderful. Clever and imaginative, and frankly, just stunningly beautiful in the richness of the language and the (epic) poetry of the descriptions, details, moods, and feelings. The idea of the littlest, humblest creature being in possession of great, tempting evil and his epic journey to carry the burden through a falling world in order to destroy it. Just simply fantastic storytelling with a loving appreciation for the power of words.The books get darker and richer as they move on, reflecting a deep appreciation for the reality under the fantasy--the reality of the burdens within heroism, of the darkness and oppression of evil, the grim emotions of loss and longing, a understanding of the bonds of friendship. Tolkien's epic is filled with beautiful imagery (Faramir's dreams, the dead marshes, the old forests, and most importantly, the weight of the Ring) that bring together simple (and therefore more powerful) magical fantasy with empirical reality.The last book is the best of the trilogy, rich in poetic feelings of bittersweet triumph, the sorrow and ever-lasting suffering of heroism, the renew of beauty and life in a world almost destroyed by ash and shadow, but a world that will never forget the darkness, the sadness of innocence lost and pastoral paradise that can never be returned to, and the deep bonds and devotion of friendship. Ultimately, the theme of these beautifully written epic books is that the smallest, unlikeliest person can be the grandest hero, as long as he does the best he can when fate deals him a difficult hand. And fate will deal us monstrous duties, but we must become the hero. Also, evil is evil, as is power, and it cannot be used for good. It will corrupt and destroy everything. Tolkien's beautiful poetry describes this with simple and stunning power."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Everyone knows this book is one for the ages, and the subject matter need not be rehashed by me. So, this review is regarding this version -- this edition/printing only.For a very large book this is a remarkably good paperback edition. It is a pleasure to hold and read because the cover is beautiful and the binding is strong. The pages are of sturdy paper, not flimsy tissue stuff, and the print is clear and legible. The book is solid enough that it doesn't flop loosely when held, but not too stiff either because it will remain open when laid down. I prefer hardbacks, but this paperback was a wise purchase I don't regret. AMAZING BOOK, UNFORGETTABLE STORY AND A COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED EDITION."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When this edition was printed back in 1991, it was at the top of my Christmas List. The pictures are really something; in those days it seemed almost axiomatic that there was no one fit to illustrate Lord of the Rings except (maybe) Tolkien himself. Lee proved that thesis wrong, which is a great achievement.At the same time, preparing and typesetting a new and definitive edition of Lord of the Rings, especially one with color plates, seemed like an obvious opportunity to include some of the elements that Tolkien had wanted from the beginning: Fire Letters for the Ring, leaves from the Book of Marzabul. Instead this edition doesn't even have a fold-out map. So as an edition of the text, it is a definite let down."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well worth the Amazon price.

When I received the book from Amazon I was delighted with the book cover drawings and its slip case but when I began to glance through it I realised that the print quality was well below average. Then, I said to myself; &iquest;Is this the print quality that a collector's edition deserves? No, not by a long shot. You would think that this is a problem concerning only to my own copy but I've been recently checking the Amazon's excerpts of the book and they all contain the same misprints which my copy has.I really regret having spent more than fifty bucks on this book. I should've been purchased a paperback edition or the big one which contains Alan Lee's illustrations and not this waste of money. What a disappointment. Did Houghton Mifflin run out of ink when the book was being printed or what?Avoid this edition at all costs and don't believe the hype, it is not worthy. I don't know why or how it is so popular among other reviewers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the film. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of the best book of the 20th century are bound to appeal to you and inspire you as you read it. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've been debating on whether I should get this Collector's Edition, or if I should get the movie edition.

I've only flipped through the book to see if it's quality stands up to it's expensive retail price. I first thought, ok it's not that bad. It has a pretty cover and the map on the back isn't glued crooked, as someone mentioned in an earlier review, which is a relief. But as I flip to the \\"NOTE ON THE TEXT\\" then to \\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS\\" title and finally to the \\"PROLOGUE\\", I am quite disappointed.

I borrowed it from a friend because I'd just read the trilogy and was excited to hear it enacted, but I was sorely disappointed. The man reading the part of Frodo is so completely abysmal that I had to stop listening partway through disc two. I was so psyched to hear the story enacted that if Frodo had at least been passable, I would probably have listened to the whole thing. Instead, I bought the BBC version and am quite pleased with it. One caveat is that this version does include some sections that are omitted from the BBC rendition. In my opinion, if you really want to enjoy those sections, read them in the book.

Anyone who has not previously read the Trilogy in book format will be missing a good portion of the history provided by Tolkien. Without the history, there is a lack of understanding about the story and the new reader of the Trilogy will have a lack of understanding about the complete work and how the story \\"fits\\" together.If you are reading the Trilogy for the first time, I would highly recommend reading the book version complete with footnotes that appear every few pages. Without them, you'll be missing probably a fourth of the story and will not have a complete understanding of the tie-in of the the history to the current story.My question is; why are the footnotes missing; especially when they comprise such a large portion of the story?David"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Books can change someone's life! Lord of the Rings changed mine. I completely recommend this book to everyone in the world!READ IT! The number of pages really scares, I know, but for get the pages. The story is awesome. It talks about a totally different world. But, Tolkien describes it so well that you really believe it exists. Everything is so detailed, that you really travel reading the book! The problem is that when you finish reading it, you miss the characters, and you'll want to be reading the book forever!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Regarding the Leatherette edition: overpriced and of mediocre quality. There are many older versions out there that are far superior. Try snatching one of them at an antique bookstore or something. Or just go for the nice Folio edition.This 'leatherette' version is just fat and ugly."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This Millenium Edition Lord of the Rings 7 volume set is amazing. It has black binding with red and gold Eye of Sauron and has JRR Tolkien's signature on the inside front page. It is by far the best version to date and very hard to find. The UK version comes with a CD which has JRR Tolkien reading exerpts from the story. Each volume binding has a letter of Tolkien's name. A must have if you can find it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can I say. This is the wonderful, loved, classic series in full in the palm of your hand (kindle version) to take and enjoy any time, any where!This kindle version works well on my tablet and phone and I am happy to have these great stories with me whenever I may want them.As for the stories themselves... They are timeless classics! They have been loved for generations. Even though the movies are a bit different, I am happy to see that they are getting younger generations interested in these classic tales, which I hope will spark imagination and love of literature in general to the video game age."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If only I could have a dollar for every book reviewed which is compared to the Lord of the Rings (LOTR), I would be financially secure for the rest of my years. For over 50 years, this work has been The Standard for epic fantasy. JRR Tolkien's masterful storytelling, characterization and setting detail have become the benchmark to which all other epic fantasies are compared.LOTR is a classic epic storyline between good and evil. I am a big fan of epic fantasies but this one remains special. While many epic fantasy stories have been written with similar plots, few can draw the reader in so thoroughly with such engaging characters and meticulous plot details. The Fellowship of the Ring characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gimli, Boromir, Strider, Gandalf and Legolas) remain characters which I can recall details with little effort and are truly made to feel lifelike. The villain, Sauron, is known mainly through his deeds and legends but is one of the more menacing villains in epic fantasy. These characters progress through a plot of breathtaking scope and detail as the Fellowship of the Ring must confront Sauron to save Middle Earth.Tolkien's attention, if not obsession, to detail in creating the setting, Middle Earth, is unmatched in other fantasy stories which I have read. Tolkien creates such detail of the history, languages, cultures and arts of Middle Earth that the reader is immersed in Middle Earth instead of merely passing through. This detail includes extensive appendices on the history of Middle Earth which I personally have not more than skimmed but which are nonetheless illustrative of the author's attention to detail. I cannot help but think that much of this is due to his academic career in languages and literature. I cannot also help but think of how few academics could supplement such astounding detail with such entertaining storytelling that the result is the pinnacle of epic fantasy instead of a story more reminiscent of an academic thesis. The only area where Tolkien spared detail, as compared to contemporary epic fantasy, was the rules and limitations of magic. I have no issue with his lack of detail in this one area; in particular, since magic is so rarely used in the Lord of the Rings as compared to contemporary epic fantasy novels.The Hobbitis the prequel story to the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit was written more as a Young Adult Fantasy which can be enjoyed by adult readers. The Hobbit is a simpler, but very entertaining, fantasy quest while the Lord of the Rings is an epic fantasy for adult readers which can be enjoyed equally by younger readers.This is a must read book for fans of epic fantasy stories. The movies are great but not a substitute for reading the novels which inspired the movies. The Lord of the Rings (One Volume) is 27,736 Kindle locations long excluding the extensive appendices. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer novels, such as those in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though the book is decades old. With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many &quot;best book&quot; polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as &quot;Star Wars.&quot;Following up on events in &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins directly after &quot;Fellowship,&quot; after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them; his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised, the Ring's slave Gollum.&quot;Return of the King&quot; brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.Even after all the years, &quot;Lord&quot; still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and no one book has even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Yes, of course the book is marvelous, among the most remarkable ever written.This edition, however, is not as great as it should've been. The leather doesn't feel like real leather, the color should always be red (think red book of westmarch... what were they thinking.) and the thing is just too big to hold comfortably and sit and read.The print is nice, the maps are great, the slipcase thing is nice, but I think the 3-volume edition with the Alan Lee illustrations is superior... the books are red, like they should be, they're bound in VERY durable cloth bindings, the paper and printing is good, the illustrations are nice, and because it's in three volumes, it's comfortable to sit with and read. Plus it's less money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the &quot;Leatherette&quot; editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the &quot;Leatherette&quot; Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I remember that I was 9 when my father encouraged me to read the Lord of the Rings, but it was when i was 17 when i picked it up- and was hooked, day and night, for 2 weeks. This book will forever be remembered by the countless millions who have read it as the book which has led them to believe in hope, and in the belief that good will ultimately triumph over evil. A world which has been so lovingly crafted, that the a little detail, seemingly unimportant in the Hobbit, leads to the events unfolding in this masterpiece. Set in Middle Earth where Elves have dominance, this book sees the Dark Lord, Sauron gaining strength - and sees the Humans and their allies making a last desperate stand against the greatest evil ever written about in a book. Tolkien has woven a world so rich in detail, lovingly crafted with a beautiful history to match - which is unsurpassed until today. Tolkien weaves his story with such seamless power, so realistically, you\`ll be wishing you were there, wielding a sword next to Aragorn or drinking Ent Wash with Treebeard in the shade of Mirkwood.

THIS book BLOWS the red one OUT OF THE WATER! The leather is gorgeous! It's not the cheap, ripable type. By the way, the color of the book is grayish-black-blue, but it still looks beautiful! It's VERY sturdy and tough. It's not terribly heavy. The foil stamping looks wonderful. It adds A LOT to the cover of the book! The gilded pages are so shiny that you can see your own reflection! The pages are thick, and not the cheap blinding, shiny kind used in textbooks as in the red one.

The voice acting is relentlessly undignified. Many characters seem to have inexplicable speech problems as their voices range from Goofie-like to Mickey Mouse-like. If you can bear to listen to the LOTR saga reduced to squeaky weirdness (I believe the smurfs analogy in a previous review was particularly apt--this is the Lord of the Rings as performed by smurfs) then by all means choose this set. However, if you want to hear a dignified work that truly conveys a sense of the grandeur, history, and nobility of the story, then the only option is the aforementioned BBC radio edition, with Ian Holm, Peter Woodthorpe (the ultimate Gollum--he must be heard to be believed), and other top notch actors. Please make yourself happy and get the BBC version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There's not a time when I step into a woods that I don't think of Hobbits. J.R.R. Tolkien's command of the English language was so vivid that his works flash across the mind like a multi-million dollar movie epic. It's unfortunate that the simple prose and even simpler plots and characters of today's fantasy have jaded someone so much that they would write a review such as the &quot;Annoying Drivel&quot; review. The Lord of the Rings is truly literature, not material meant for the video game mentality. Perhaps the author of &quot;Annoying Drivel&quot; should take some advanced college level literature courses and then come back to the books. They have delighted me for more than 30 years, and I judge all other fantasy by its ability to live up to Tolkien's descriptive power, plot, and character development."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"1) Take a year and read The Ring Trilogy to your eight-year-old as a bedtime story. 2) Wait five years and then buy them their own boxed set when they're thirteen.Here's why.

And the most spell binding adventures known to mankind. Highly recommended for the Lord of the Rings Fan."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was an important book that was lauded as the pinnacle of English fantasy fiction and children's literature due to the high level of scholarship that was associated with the author J.R.R. Tolkien. This book displays literary skill and uses the English language in a narrative form and in a candid and colloquial format that shows the way people commonly speak in the countryside of England and the also within the higher end of the social hierarchy.The book does a great effort to bisect the cultural heritage of the English populace. The book does well to encompass the aspects of wealth and poverty and says good things abut both sections of culture and society. Tolkien was an anthropologist and her studies the cultures, and races of the world to create his own unique race that was wholly different from the established cultures on earth in order to make a point about race and culture that is also indirectly influenced by religion in the battle of good against evil.The door will be an enduring contribution to English letters because is was written by an English Oxford professor and also because of Tolkien's strong connections to the Catholic church and the Masonic organizations within the United Kingdom, which allowed the book to become prominent and proliferate the cultural diffusion of English Ango-Saxon traditions through our world culture."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm only reviewing the book itself, not the content.The pages are a crisp, bright white with clear black text.

The plot is even better than The Hobbit, of course, but more importantly, this book brings me joy, sadness, sympathy, excitement, and love. Middle Earth is like a dreaming land which attracts every readers and I think everybody never stops dreaming about it. The ending is so sweet and satisfying that it made me smile after closing the book. Who can resist sir Tolkien after all?With LOTRs, sir J. R. R. Tolkien deserves to be the best author of the fantasy novel group. It must take a very long long time for another one to replace his position. I admit that I'm already a crazy fan of him and each guy in the \\"fellowship of the ring\\"! I have no doubt that LOTRs is the best and a must-read for everyone, young and old, and everyone who's looking for something that they have to read from the beginning to the end!

Before I bought the collection, I wondered how good it could possibly be with only one person doing EVERY VOICE. He does a great job with it all though. His voice while \\"reading\\" is smooth and easy to listen too. When he is voicing a character, there is enough difference between each one that you know exactly who is speaking, but there is no over acting in it. I must say: His voice for Gollum is the best ever.There are many disks, and if you are listening while driving as I did, you will have to pull over to change CDs from time to time, but not too often. The story is separated on the disks into break points that are frequent enough to assist you if you somehow lose your place. Simply back peddle through the \\"parts\\" until you get to where you know you've already heard something, then stop and continue the story there, it won't be too long before you are right at the part you last left off at.The packaging and cover art is very nice. I loaded the books onto my IPOD and leave the CDs on my book shelf for safe keeping.The story itself is well known and more popular than ever, so there is no need for me to comment there.

The size is not too cumbersome, and the book is easily portable despite containing all three books. I had worried that it might be too big to take with me places, and I've seen some versions that contained all three books in one volume that were definitely too big to lug around. This one is not.

While it is generaly sold in three book sets (The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \\"Middle Earth\\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).The story picks up some years after Bilbo Baggins returns from the adventure told in The Hobbit. Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently.

I still love the story, but this edition is terrible. The kaolin paper is shiny which makes any book difficult to read comfortably; in this edition, the ink used varies in color from medium to dark grey--it rarely ever approaches black--and is unevenly applied, so the reduced contrast combines with the shiny paper to make this a most uncomfortable read for extended sessions. This is more of a nitpick possibly than a complaint, but the line spacing is also too wide. Finally, throughout the work there are occasionally smudges or lines of text that have smeared or slipped. On balance, I have rarely encountered any more physically awkward and aesthetically disappointing volumes, and recommend strongly to all comers that you get the separate volume of Alan Lee illustrations and find yourself a hardback edition printed on 'normal' paper for your actual reading copy. What a disappointing way to spend eighty bucks."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This boxed set has a decent box and book cover, but I really like the books without the covers.

The work is singularly complete.Comedy? -- It's there.Tragedy? -- It's there.Adventure? -- It's there.True Love? -- It's there.Heroic Quest? -- It's there.Mystery? -- It's there.Good vs. Evil? -- It's there.Essentially, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is more than fantasy literature (although it is that -- and the standard by which all other fantasy literature of the 20th century is measured). Rather, it is &quot;Fairy Story&quot; in the classic and most complete sense of that term. (See Tolkien's non-fiction essay &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; and you'll see what I mean -- the theological ramifications are remarkable).Please read this book. It will change your life. More than any other work (save the Bible), it has changed mine.Use the book as a guide away from the modern and post-modern philosophies which have so devastated our world -- and return to a time and place where truth and good were constant. Sit back, light a pipe, and read the story aloud to those you love.You will never be the same again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As so many others have said, this is not a \\"Collector's Edition\\".A real collector's edition has: a quality binding that will stand up to multiple readings; readable, consistent print that is correctly aligned on every page; acid-free paper.

The amazon price is very generous.The Paperback and Hardcover editions, do not include these extras.Amazon needs to do a better job when it comes to sorting book reviews, at the top of the page for the Hardcover and Paperback editions is a review for the Leatherbound edition, now underneath the review title it does state that the review concerns the Leatherbound edition, but someone, for whatever reason might gloss over that.The Hardcover reviews should remain on the Hardcover page the Paperback reviews should remain on the Paperback page, and guess what... the Leatherbound edition reviews should remain on said page only.That being said, the Leatherbound edition is beautifully constructed, the finast I have ever seen, I own several editions of the Trilogy dating back to the trippy psychedelic 60's covers The only edition I could compare to the Leatherbound would be the Centennial edition with Alan Lee's exquisite artwork.As far as the Hardcover and Paperback editions are concerned I give them 5 stars simply because, it is the trilogy. If I could, the Leatherbound edition would get 500 stars ; )"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The book is great, no need to discuss that. And the edition is very very fine, one can definitely get superior aesthetic pleasure reading it. It would be five stars.But the cover is too weak. After finishing reading first two parts (\\"first volume\\") of the LOTR, I found that the inside bend of the face cover started tearing apart (some two inches). So, definitely, the book is intended for very careful, not everyday, reading. This is amiss."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful three volume set with illustrations by Alan Lee. My only complaint with the illustrations is that I wish their were even more of them! =) I am reading The Two Towers book now and I count 15 illustrations in it. The three books seem to have roughly the same number in each but I haven't actually counted. Some reviewers have commented that the use of glossy paper throughout the book caused glare or eye strain but I haven't noticed any problems like that and I have read them outside in bright light and at night by dim lighting. My only comment is that my volumes had some mild ink smearing in places which I think the glossy paper might be more prone to do. I guess I would have had a slight preference for matte paper for the text but I haven't been bothered by the glossy paper. I have enjoyed following the travels on the maps drawn on the inside covers. The set comes in a sturdy box covered with Alan Lee illustrations and each book is nicely bound and has gold outside lettering. The dust jackets also sport Alan Lee illustrations. A beautiful set to own that you can enjoy and even pass down like an heirloom."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"LORD OF THE RINGS is everything that you've ever heard. It is an amazing journey. An action packed story with wonderful characters. A story packed with hundreds of pages of history, language, and research beyond any other fictional novel that I have ever encountered (only Frank Herbert's Dune novels come close). And truly The Lord of the Rings Saga is the cornerstone of the Fantasy genre.Forewarning, anyone who wishes to read the Lord of the Rings saga should start with The Hobbit. Hobbit is an easy fun story and it will help ground you to the first 100 pages of LOR.LOR is obviously divided into three main books (and the three upcoming movies that have helped gather even more hype around the saga).Part 1 - Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent intro to the entire saga. We learn of the history behind the Ring and its creator Sauron. We learn of Bilbo Baggins acquiring it from the evil Gollum. And, we learn of the gathering of the Fellowship of the Ring. It's a lot to take in, and there are numerous characters to follow...but stay with it and the pay-off will be rewarding. The highlight being the fellowship's battles in the dungeon mines with an army or orcs and the dreaded balrog.Part 2 - The Two Towers is my personal favorite section of the LOR saga. This section divides the adventures of the fellowship into two areas. The hobbits journey to destory the ring and the fellowships battles with the evil wizard Saruman and the armies of evil. The action in this part is incredible and delivered at a breakneck pace. The highlight being Frodo and Sam traveling with the fiendish Gollum and then encountering the monster Shelob.Part 3 - The Return of the King is the conclusion of the saga. All of the storylines connect and the heroes and villains travel their course. I can't mention anything here because at a combined amount of 1,000+ pages...if you make it this far then you should be allowed to enjoy the ride without any spoilers.For any fan of reading and adventure and fans of any age I can praise nothing more highly than J,R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Saga."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are already a lot of reviews available, so I will just make a few points for you first-time readers. LOTR fans, you don't even need to read this. In fact, please don't. You will probably just feel insulted.For all you first-timers, I have answered several questions from your ilk (love that word) that I felt I should address here. I am assuming that everyone on Earth has seen the movies, you liked them, and now you want to read the book. I read LOTR many years ago, and have read it several times since.1) The title of the book refers to SAURON, not Frodo or anyone else. Sauron is the lord of the rings. This is the most misunderstood thing about this book.2) Don't expect a gripping edge-of-your-seat fast-paced tale. This book was written a LONG time ago, and basically created the fantasy genre. It can't be compared to today's style of writing. It is rather slow, much detail is omitted for you, the reader, to fill in. Its similar to the 'MTV' style of TV production today: It can't be compared to the TV productions of yesteryear. Which one is better is a matter of OPINION, as long as you know what to expect going in, you won't be shocked. In addition, the author was English, so if you have only read stuff from American authors (and shame on you if that is so) the writing style might be unsettling. Just stick with it, you'll get used to it.3) Tolkien wrote the book as ONE novel, it was the publisher that divided it into three separate books. Even so, the first book is very slow and boring IN RELATION to the other two. DO NOT get bored and stop reading! The story gets better and better as you get deep into the first book, just hang in there. You also may notice that the pacing of LOTR is rather screwy. That is basically explained by the fact that Tolkien had no idea where his story was going to go when he started to write it. The first book founders quite a bit, and the story really picks up with the second book. The strange pacing is most noticeable once you have completed the entire story.4) Its almost impossible for ANY book to live up to the fame and legend that surrounds LOTR as a novel. It is a celebrated book most importantly because it created the fantasy genre we know today. No other book before it created a world like Tolkien's. Just don't expect the supreme masterpiece the hype surrounding this book would lead you to believe it is. Its not. Its a very good fantasy book, and a good (not great) read. If you know this going in, you won't be disappointed when this book doesn't change your life after you have read it.5) I'm sure you have heard the Tom Bombadil complaints. Once you have read the book, you will probably realize why Peter Jackson left him out of the movie. He was a red herring in comparison to the rest of the book. Again, Tolkien didn't know where his story was going at the beginning, and it shows.Reading this book is a rewarding experience. For the casual reader, I would recommend it. For new fantasy fans, it is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read these books 10 years ago, long before the movies came out. It was my first fantasy series, aside from Narnia or whatever. I just liked those heroic tales about kings, princes, war, and swordfighting... I never felt comfort with other genres like science fiction, thrillers or horror.So I just stumbled on this book in the library, my first fantasy novel. You can imagine when I was sitting in my little room day and night, that cold winter 10 years ago, reading Tolkien's work. I finished the whole series in just two weeks. That day when I turned the last page of the third and last book \\"The Return of the King\\" I thought I wouldn't read any better series. I promised myself I would read them again another time... Easy cake right? So I thought...Years passed and I eventually became a better reader with tons of fantasy books on my backbone. Today I can tell what books is a great read and what books to stay away from. I tried to read TLOTR several times, and every time I did that I gave up in 24 hours no matter what edition I bought or how much motivated I was.Why was I giving up? Well... There aren't really much of a story in theese books, is it? I almost knew what was going to happen in every next page, except for how many leaves that tree in the next forest had of course. There isn't much happening in TLOTR and because of that I couldn't read it again a second time. Other fantasy series is very enjoyable, such as George RR Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", and you can reread it again and again without getting bored. But to me that's impossible when it comes to TLOTR even when I really wanted to, especially before the release of the excellent movies by Peter Jackson. Some Tolkien fan might mention that I should read the Hobbit or Silmarillion because it makes it easier. That might be true, but that's not my point, I mean that the story is too slow and not engaging enough after a while.In my opinion TLOTR is great if you never have read it before, but after that I don't think most of you'll be able to read it again unless you suffer from sever Alzheimer's and have forgotten everything or are a Real fan that can speak those Elven language and dress as a Hobbit like Peter Jackson :) ( Those Tolkien fans I have met acts more like a cult, if they saw me writing this review I would be found in a dark alley motionless).I know that that many authors \\"copied\\" Tolkien's world. Almost 89 percent of the fantasy books begin with the journy of a boy (Frodo) who will try to save the world from evil with the guidance of a mysterious hero (Gandalf or Aragorn). But most of these writers are at least much more entertaining than he is. If I can't read it twice it doesn't deserve a 4 from me. 3 and 1/5"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a review of the Lord of the Rings. In the half century since its publication, Tolkien's masterwork has been reviewed and analyzed within an inch of its life. I doubt I have anything meaningful to add. This is a brief article on the eBook edition of LOTR, to point out the ways in which the great book fits particularly well onto the Kindle platform.First, the cost. At first glance the price seems steep for a Kindle book. But your $14.99 buys you the entire trilogy, along with all the appendices and various prefatory notes by Tolkien and others. That's a steal.Second, the weight. If you're thinking of rereading LOTR on that hiking trip along the Appalachian trail, the Kindle edition is going to be a whole lot lighter than that ten-pound boxed set gathering dust on your bookshelf.Third, and most important, the Kindle's search facility. For the true Tolkien fan, LOTR isn't a novel to be read once and put aside. It's a reference work to be dipped into over and over again. When do the Black Riders first appear in the Shire? What does Telcontar mean? What did the dwarves call Moria? Who was Ungoliant? The answer to these and other vital questions can be a real pain to dredge up out of a print edition of LOTR. With the Kindle search facility, it'll be a snap.I haven't bought LOTR for Kindle yet, but I soon will. When I do, my own boxed set will sit on the bookshelf, gathering dust. I do plan to visit it occasionally. We've had some good times together."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"All I want to buy is 'the two towers', I all ready have the 1st book on paper back so I have no reason to need the hole set on my kindle.

Yet I have to say, regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly, overrated.The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely) grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.It can't be that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel that I have read).

I, on the other hand have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and do not believe them to be that good. Sure the story portrays a classic theme of good vs. evil, and the plot is a good one. However, these books are slow moving and not very exciting. In fact, the books are pretty boring overall. There isn't enough action and there are usually long, drawn-out conversations. I really don't believe that these books are worth reading, and if you really want to know what they are about, watch the movies. They are excellent and a lot more exciting."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For an Oxbridge Don, Tolkien sure stole a heck of a lot of his technique from Saturday morning matinee movies (Flash Gordon et al). Notice that there is a cliff-hanger at the end of each chapter and that each ensuing chapter jumps to another group of characters to create a sense of \\"drama\\". Try reading alternate chapters in the second book and see how interesting the plot development actually is (not). ...(Here, Tolkien is blatantly plagiarising from his amazed that Mathew, Mark Luke and Ringo have not sued!).Once the world of Middle Earth had been mapped out it could not have been too difficult to fill with an infinite succession of repetitive, different-but-the-same, baddies for our hairy heroes to face as they trudge from chapter to chapter. Why, when the programmers of shoot-em-up games like Quake do exactly the same basic thing (but make it much more fun), are they not lauded as great authors by the literary set? Surely they should be in for honorary degrees from Oxford University?Tolky squeezes this infinite potential for all that it is worth and we trudge through baddie after baddie, for thousands of pages. Bright ten year olds may be excused for mistaking a fat book for a great one - and let's face it this is an elbow-acher of a book. But only a feeble minded adolescent reader could ignore the other glaring problems of this piece. Not only of Tolk's limitations of style but also that the South African born author has laced his children's fantasy with his ugly, ugly views on race. If I were a responsible teacher, I would have this book removed from the school library and burned. If this \\"epic\\" isn't banned in order to save the rainforests (oh yeah, - isn't the internet supposed to reduce book production?), it certainly should be banned for Tolkien's racism.In the edition that I read (some years ago), the species that live in the middle of Middle Earth (Europe) are all elegant, cultured, decent and fair skinned (i.e. white). The \\"swarthy\\", (darkies to you and me), heathen hordes that live to the South and to the East are all featureless, baddies, worshipping evil and with characters never developed to any degree of interest. To deny a character human traits and complexities that we can relate to is the cheapest way of manipulating audience sympathies. There is even some suggestion that they ride strange beasts with big ears (African and Indian elephants). The surviving heroes (well, those who aren't so unfortunate as to have been born lower class), sail off across a great ocean to live in a Valhalla land in the West (America).Is this simple translation from existing facts and myths into thinly disguised fantasy the real source of Tolk's \\"vast imagination\\"? Whatever the answer to that question, exploit the lower class\\". Some lost souls rant about the great struggle between Good and Evil in this plot. \\"GOOD IS WHITE AND EVIL IS BLACK\\" is as sophisticated as it gets. This might have been OK for what is essentially a children's book, but to define Good and Evil by Race is not OK. Intelligent people are marked by their ability to out there, but it's wobbly\\". If you have an evening, read A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin and see how much more intelligently Good and Evil can be approached in fantasy. Whilst other racist works of the era have been deleted, The Tolkiad, it seems, generates too much money to be curbed by race laws. favour, spend six months reading a book on computer programming, or investment management instead and really improve your life. That way you might actually end up FUND RACISM - If you haven't read this book don't bother. Freemasonic content that the author loaded his book with?... guarantee of good character"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Hub of JRRT's &quot;Middle Earth&quot; books. A more serious sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, while still a single coherent narrative, unlike &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and subsequent barrel-scrapings. The LOTR is not explicitly a kids' book like the Hobbit, but neither is it a fully adult piece of Modern Fantasy.If you try to read it too young, you will be scared off by the high-toned heroic writing style that develops after the first few chapters. If you leave it too late, the Gate to this Particular Otherworld will be locked for you. 'Too Late&quot; may be as young as 12 or somewhere in early adulthood. The story is a simple quest. The good guys (not many gals here!) are whiter-than-white, and the bad guys are horrid. Given the depressing result of JRRT's experiments with moral ambiguity in 'The Silmarillion', this may be as well. The major achievement of LOTR is the creation of a self-consistent world with a long and detailed history, linguistically plausible languages, and a believable mix of low-key magic with everyday physics. This was a major innovation in the first half of the 20th century when JRRT was evolving the framework for the Middle Earth books. However, it should be noted that other writers have achieved this since, with appreciably more realistic characters and storylines, and less explicit lifting from Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology. Vastly overrated, but undeniably influential, this trilogy is a flawed masterpiece. I am amazed that I have weaned off it enough to become critical. N.B - the most pernicious example of LOTR influence: the belief among certain publishers and writers that all good fantasy stories MUST be quests and MUST be &quot;trilogies&quot; (in however many parts..)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a confusion regarding which edition we are evaluating. The book advertised is a paperback, and you are talking about the rich leather binding -- on a paperback?As to the content, the only reason I read it is that everyone I knew had read LOTR. I was curious, and ordered the book, only to see that in order to understand the book (I like to read first things first) you had to read The Hobbit. In my opinion this is like a fairy tale, and I think adults are too old for fairy tales. I care much more for realist literature, or books that write about someone strange, like The Stranger, by Camus; or Sartre's Les Mots. Also, LOTR is too long. Even Anna Karenina (and that is great literature) is shorter. The only reason I read LOTR is that I'd heard about Bored of the Rings, and wanted to read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The books have super detailed descriptions of the geography of the places, which made the reading way too tedious.

Nice poems, cool chase through Mordor and Saruman, Gollum and the Ents were pretty nifty.Look, all you writers out there: All fantasy books don't have to be set in some pseudo-medieval European setting where everyone is remarkably clean, healthy and odor-free despite a distinct lack of basic sanitation devices.I acknowledge that this book was revolutionary forty years ago, but the world has changed since then and our writing could stand to reflect that.Not that Lord of the Rings is a bad book-- it's not-- but not everything about it is so unquestionably wonderful.First off: The ending sucks. I still haven't figured out what Haven is meant to be, (Heaven?) and why Frodo and the elves had to go there. What? Is it that they were too good for our world. If so then that is really lame.Second: The unquestioning faith Tolkien places in the superiority of high birth and the unfailing belief in a rigid class system, (something which I am surprised to see most modern readers simply don't notice) was old fashioned and retrograde even in his own time. I mean why should Strider/Aragorn be automatically made king? How come no one questions this? The idea that without the true blue-blood king the land would falter is ridiculous. Whatever happened to democracy? This odd yearning for the old class system can be seen in Sam's servile obedience to Frodo and Frodo's servility to Aragorn, the Elves and other high born humans.4. How did Gandalf get out of the pit in the mines? No explanation in either the books or the movies.5. Pure good vs. Pure Evil: There are reasons why Saruman and Gollum are the best characters in the books. They're the most like real people, with multiple facets and real motivations for their deeds. I mean what's Sauron's deal? He's a big flaming eye of pure evil. Not much characterization there. And the Orcs-- probably the worst scene in the book is when Gimli and Legolas brag to each other about how many Orcs they each have killed and this goes on without the disapproval of any character. Yeah, lets see all our enemies at war as subhumans agents of pure evil, right. This is a complete cheat. If ever we needed to hear the message that those we fight on the battlefield are people just like us, with families, desires and loved ones-- now is the time. How convient that Orcs are created out of mud and have no little Orc children to mourn them when they fall to serve as another notch on Gimili's belt.5. In the same line of thinking the character development is lacking-- characters like STrider, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir and others seem remote and unhuman.While I understand that Tolkien sought to copy the episodic style, characterization and epic tone common to such early Northern European myths as Beouwulf, for modern readers not to see the faults inherit in these forms is to be ignorant."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I believe this book is the best seller book of all England (behind The Bible).

Basically, altough this sounds absurd, Tolkien should have given his ideas to another writer to write it! Since this was not possible, of course, I think he should have had a better editor.The book has a good plot, but simply no sense of rhythm and pace.It's boring, really boring, mainly when he describes the nature and climate around the characters, OVER AND OVER AGAIN for more than one thousand pages. Also, the dialogues. They all seem totally unnatural, force, raw, even when theya re supposed to be gently and warm.. The characters, another big flaw... At one point, we simply do not care about them, because, other than being presented to the public of a repreentant of some race or king of some place, they simply are left undeveloped!In short, this is the obligatory book to read, even if you're not a fantasy fan like myself.

From one beautiful golden edged page to the last, it was pure joy. I will treasure it always."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is a huge, and hugely enjoyable, adventure story.At the opening of the book, we learn that a villain, Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, plans to expand his tyranny over all of Middle Earth. All he lacks is the One Ring, a ring that gives great power, which has fallen into the hands of Frodo Baggins. Frodo is a hobbit, short in stature and overawed by the forces that strive with one another to control the ring. \\"Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?\\" he asks. \\"Such questions cannot be answered,\\" says Gandalf, a far-seeing wizard. \\"You may be sure that it was not for merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.\\" So Frodo undertakes to carry the ring to Mordor, Sauron's stronghold and the only place where the ring can be destroyed.He is helped along the way by eight companions (the Fellowship of the Ring) and many fantastic creatures, knights, and kings they encounter on the road. As the Fellowship make their way toward Mordor, the kingdoms of Middle Earth are on the march. Alliances are made and broken and great cities are besieged, as a final confrontation with Sauron approaches.Frodo's journey is a long and dangerous one, and Tolkien's accounts of combat and bravery are stirring. But Frodo and his companions make many stops along the road for eating, drinking, storytelling, and other simple pleasures. The interior scenes, with the friends at a table or in front of a fire, were one of the major attractions of the book for me. There is good humor as well. One of the running jokes in the book is based on the contrast between what the hobbits appear to be and what they actually are: \\"They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces.\\" By the end of the story, they have accomplished such feats of heroism that men suppose them to be princes in their own land, when in fact they are ordinary hobbits.The Houghton Mifflin one-volume paperback edition is an attractive volume with a comfortable, pliable feel in the reader's hands. It includes an exceptional index, maps, and many other resources in over 100 pages of end material."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I picked this edition up for my husband - he collects editions of LotR.

The paper does not glare as some have commented about, and print is decent.It definitely is a heavy book, but looks great on the shelf. If you want something fancy and willing to shell out the bucks, go for the special edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This, right here, is the basis of modern fantasy. Tolkien took a bit (okay, a lot) of Norse mythology, and added his ardent hatred of fascism, war, and industrialization, and shaped it into one of the greatest books of all time. I say \\"one\\" because, while the Lord of the Rings is technically split into three parts, the truth is it was intended to be a single-volume epic spanning, not including appendices, just over 1,000 pages. I assume most people know of the plot and characters, but for those who don't, protagonist Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit, which is a race of short people with furry feet) comes across a ring given to him by his uncle Bilbo (star of The Hobbit, Tolkien's second most famous project). The Ring turns out to have been previously possessed by Sauron, an ancient evil figure. Frodo, with help of fellow Hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Samwise; Gandalf the Wizard; Borimir and Aragorn, both men of royal blood; Legolas the elf; and Gimli the dwarf, set off to destroy the Ring.The thing that really makes this such an enduring series is the vast world Tolkien has woven. You know all those maps found at the end of each book? Those weren't just sketched idly. Rather, they're just a small part of Middle-Earth, a fictional world of massive scope. Tolkien even created individual languages for Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Ents (the famous tree-beings) and humans of different races. He also has created history, mythology, and customs for these characters, and manages to weave them into the stories - the lengthy songs found in Fellowship of the Ring, while off-putting to some, actually add plenty of depth.Secondly, the numerous themes Tolkien works into this book are enough for some writers' entire lives. I'm especially intrigued by the concept of duality here. Most characters have parallels here - the most obvious being the nine Fellowship members (the book's heroes) vs. the nine Nazgul (Sauron's servants). There are countless other examples, but I find that the most interesting of them is one found in an individual character: Gollum (yeah, the \\"My preeeecious...\\" guy). Thanks to years of owning the ring, he has been driven insane, and now exists in two minds: the benevolent (to a degree) Smeagol, and the murderous Gollum.And then there are all the classic characters: Sam, Gandalf, the evil wizard Sauruman, Gollum, nature lord Tom Bombadil (who wasn't in the movie, unfortunately), kingly heir Aragorn, steward Denethor, princess Eowyn (the unofficial tenth Fellowship member), Borimir (the most intriguing character in the bunch), and so on. I actually like the versions of Borimir, King Theoden, and Denethor more here than in the books.My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that there's a bit of a lull in Return of the King, a couple transitional chapters that don't really offer much. But that's just one or two chapters out of around sixty, so there you go. A must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The masterpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien begins with a young hobbit's journey to save Middle-Earth. Young Frodo Baggins is the one who inherited the powerful and evil One Ring. The ring could destroy Middle-Earth. Frodo is forced by friend Gandalf the Gray to destroy it. Lord of the Rings tells of all the obstacles Frodo faces, all of the people he meets on his way and the people that offer the help him.Although Tolkien creates many fictional languages and races you will be able to understand Middle-Earth and its people more and will be able to picture the beautiful land and elves, dirty dwarves, hairy little hobbits and intelligent wizards.Peter Jackson's movie version of The Lord of the Rings is also a true masterpiece. It gives you an amazing overview of Tolkien's world. But Jackson does not even come close. So many things and important parts where removed due to time. You cannot truely embrace Tolkien's world with Jackson's movies, you must read the books to truly understand the land of Middle-Earth.The tale of Frodo and the Fellowship of the Rings will pull you into the Tolkien's world. The journey of a young hobbit will have you turning the page threw all three books and even the appendixes to find out what the Fellowship's next move, what will become of the nine members and the One Ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\\"What does this mean? What Ring is it talking about? As said by Gandalf, \`\\"This is but two lines of a verse long known in Elvish-lore.\\"' Even though to us this it is just a catchy little rhyme, it brings the everyday life of Frodo Baggins, as well as countless others, crashing down. Now not only must Frodo face his ever-changing destiny, but realize that \\"even the smallest person can change the entire course of the future.\\"We all know how it feels to be told \\"you're too little,\\" when we were younger we were constantly being told that by our parents. It always makes us feel like we're not wanted or we'll always be \\"to little\\" to do anything or amount to nothing in the eyes of others, and it really hurts. That's not that bad in the long run seeing as how we grow out of it, but try being one of the shortest people in the world your whole life and never getting any taller. That's what Frodo as well as his cousins, Merry and Pippin, and his best friend Sam face every day of their lives. But they find their own ways to over come their size and become larger than life in order to save the people they love.When the four are separated from each other and the rest of their group they must rely on themselves, their hopes, dreams, and beliefs, and what they have to get by, and they discover that they are all brave and can do all the same things other \\"big people\\" can do in their own way.Aside from Frodo there is also the story of Aragorn being told. He is the Heir of Isuldur, destined to become King of Gondor, but he fears his responsibility, thinking he is weak like Isuldur and will be corrupted by the Ring. He must now overcome his fear and face his destiny of defeating the enemy, the creator of the Ring, Souron, and become King of Gondor the protect those he loves the most as well as the entire Middle-Earth.The four Hobbits and Aragorn are joined by Gandalf the Wizard, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and Boromir a Lord of Gondor (who meets a tragic fate) to become \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Together they face dark perils, new foes, deadly fights, certain death, and gaining new friends and allies along the way to save their world, each finding their own destiny and making the most unlikely, life-long friends in the process.This book is a thrilling, heart-warming tale you'll ever read, it really tugs on your heartstrings from one chapter to another. In my opinion this is a timeless tale that will stay with you your whole life, it's just that great a book.

Tolkien describes the journey of men that are on a quest to destroy \\"The Ring\\". Throughout this book, Tolkien shows us how partners could have a great or horrible relationship. He casts shadows on all of his characters and has many surprises during this time. Though the characters have different views they all relate to today's common person. No one yet has created such a world where adventures like this happen.J.R.R. Tolkien showcases the fact that anyone could be the person to help the world. As readers are pulled into the text, they realize many important themes that can be put into life and many different situations. I recommend this revolutionary piece of art to all dedicated readers who are looking for a book that will grasp them and pull them into a fictional world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old. Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'd hate to give away the story -- this review is specifically on the single volume, movie art cover, hardcover edition of LOTR.- 1008 pages of text, not including Appendices- There are INDICES!

Very, very useful.- Appendix A: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, 45 pages- Appendix B: The Tale of Years, Chronology of the Westlands, 15 pages- Appendix C: Hobbit Family Trees- Appendix D: Shire Calendar (for hardcore fans, I guess)- Appendix E: Pronunciation guide for Elvish, etc. and some characters called Tengwar?

I will focus on the beauty of the edition illustrated by Alan Lee.Plainly: If you have the money, buy it. If you are wondering if you want to buy a boxed set or the illustrated edition, buy the illustrated edition. The pages are heavy and will last generations. I have read this edition once through and have found the binding and pages to be in excellent condition. The book is large and opening the book incorrectly may cause some damage. What do I mean by opening the book incorrectly? A man who restores ancient books for Spain's National Library in Madrid taught me to always open hardbound books at the middle first and turn to the desired page (as opposed to opening directly to the first page. This helps maintain a healthy binding for generations to come.The illustrations are beautiful and do not detract from the pictures and story that are created by the writing.The book and the story get five stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I originally read The Hobbit and The Lord Of the Rings in an old paperback edition. I immediately fell in love with Tolkien's Middle Earth, its characters and the incredible plot he created.I am now on my third reading of the cycle. I came back to it after leaving it on the bookshelf for many years (I like to forget many of the details so the book has a certain freshness when reread). To my amazment the book still has much more freshness than I expected. This time through I am seeing so much of Tolkien's genius in the genre of fantasy: he created a whole world with geography and history and complexity, and he makes it really &quot;work&quot;. Much other fantasy is weak in this area: the created worlds just don't work all that well. Tolkien's regions and cultures have a depth that puts them a quantam leap above those of standard fantasy.Also, many of Tolkien's characters are round and deep. I actually thought them rather cardboard on my first reading, but this time through I begin to see that though Tolkien uses certain stereotypical character types, he fleshes them with an interesting life all their own. On my first read I thought the hobbits were the most intriguing of Tolkiens' characters. I find them even more intriguing this time through. I also found MUCH more depth in the elves and dwarves, who seemed VERY stereotypical on the first read. I think I was so engrossed by the plot on my first time through I did not pay much attention to the characters.This book is one everyone should read at least twice. It is a modern classic. Those who shun fantasy because of it being &quot;unrealistic&quot; need to read this book so they can learn about a different kind of realism.The specific things I enjoy about this hardcover edition are the maps and the artwork. It includes Tolkien's original maps, which are better than the ones in my old paperback edition.And as for the illustrations: Alan Lee's works are masterful. He pays great heed to Tolkien's details so that his pictures don't contradict the text; though I found a few minor discrepancies (which could be errors in my own imagination). His detailed and beautiful watercolors gave more substance and shape to my own images of Middle Earth and its inhabitants. My only criticism is that I find Tolkien's world to be more solid than Alan Lee's. Mr. Lee's version of Middle Earth is more etherial and less earthy than Tolkien's.Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is his magnum opus and it is a great book for ALL TIME. This edition with the original maps and the masterful artwork of Alan Lee will be a treasure I hope to pass on to a future generation."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The story of the Lord of the Rings is a classic that I do not need to praise as countless others already have done that.The audio CD of the story (by Mind's Eye) brings the story to life in a new and exciting way. All major characters have their own actor speaking the parts and the voices fit the characters extremely well! I have heard other books on CD, but this is the best I have ever heard, and I cannot think of a story more deserving of this quality.If you love the Lord of the Rings, then do yourself a favor and get the Lord of the Rings Audio CDs. You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First of all, no, although the book has a leather feel, I would find it very difficult to believe that real leather was used to make it. That being said, I personally wouldn't care either way, except to say that the cover is the least attractive part of the book. Although it has a leather feel, it actually looks like very tearable, slightly thicker than normal, paper. Regular hard back books have stronger looking covers, and the red, Collector's Edition, is much better in that respect.Back in the mid-eighties, I came across a deluxe version that was smaller than most paperback versions, in fact it was about the size of a video cassette.This version came in a box, rather than a slip case, and obviously as I didn't have the money to buy it I've never seen a better version since.Critisms aside, this is still a very nice edition, the paper quality is good, and it has a book mark ribbon (missing from the Collector's Edition, and essential if you actually read the book and want to keep it in good condition).Weight wise, if you didn't like the red one, then you won't like this one either, in fact I'd say it was even heavier.Maps - well the two main maps are present, both have the same gold/gilt edging as the pages, but the enlarged map of the Shire is not.Colour - it isn't blue, it's black - does this matter? Not to me, but I thought people might want to know.Interestingly (or not) the UK version is pictured as having a burgundy spine, with white front and back. They also have a standard 50th edition that is black. As the UK (deluxe) version costs about half as much again as ours, I would be hard pressed to see where the extra value is, unless it has a superior cover.Which is my only gripe with the book. It is a very nice version, the print is fine, the paper is excellent quality wise (the spine is stiched, as it should be on a book costing this much), the pictures of the Ori's record book (found in Moria) are great, and the maps are as good as they ever have been (just missing an enlarged version of the Shire - which can be downloaded from many websites or purchased in various box sets).Totally unrelated, a new matching version of The Hobbit will soon be out in the UK - and includes many of the updates done in the annotated version. There's no reference to an American version on the Houghton Mifflin website, so if you want a matching copy of The Hobbit this may be an oversees order. It can be found on the UK Harper Collins website, but with no picture, and the link to the amazon.co.uk comes back with nothing found.Finally, aside from the UK deluxe version of the Silmarillion, no one has ever done a really nice version of this (except for that Eastern press 5 book set that costs nearly $300). Even that deluxe version was not all that great, and although it matched the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and the Histories of Middle Earth, it's paper quality was the same as a standard hardback.So if anyone knows of a really decent version of the Silmarillion I would love to know where it can be found.."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"for the longest time, i didn't know whether ot buy the red leather edition or this illustrated edition--both are one-book, hardcover, hefty, and pricey. however, i have finally decided to choose this one because i discovered, while exploring lordoftherings.net, that alan lee (the guy who illustrated all fifty paintings in this book) is the conceptual artist for the LOTR movies. he does all the initial sketches and paintings for each movie set, so the illustrations in the book are very similar, if not identical, to the real-life scenery in the movie. isn't that great? that means the places and backgrounds you visualized in your head while reading the book will be the same as what you see in the movies! for me, that's something i consider very important in movie adaptations. i hate it when i read a book and develop all these preconceived notions about how everything should look, and then i watch a movie adaptation that has completely different interpretations. it bothers the heck out of me because the images in my head are oftentimes much nicer than the ones on the screen. so, if you're a new reader that hasn't yet read the trilogy but has watched the movie, this is a good edition for you to buy. the illustrations will match what you saw onscreen. and if you're a LOTR veteran, like me, it's still a great choice because the illustrations are the best interpretations i've seen in any LOTR book--as opposed to the red leather edition, which has no illustrations whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't read much fiction, but I really enjoyed my jaunt through most of this trilogy over the past year. The Lord of the Rings has been loved for decades and is now enjoying even more acclaim with the making of the the motion pictures. They are good books, more like literary fiction than the cheap paperback novels that clutter so many shelves. Tolkien's attention to detail in describing the various cultures, peoples, locales, and languages of Middle-Earth is amazing. The multitude of encyclopedias and histories written on this fictional world attest to the genius and creativity of Tolkien and the magnitude of his creative achievement. But the story is interesting, too, with a complex plot, lovable characters, and high adventure. The protagonists are real heroes (especially Frodo and Sam) demonstrating loyalty, courage, integrity, and purity of heart. The line between good and evil is clearly drawn and the magic and violence is not graphic. Parents need not fear allowing their children to pore through these books. Add to that (with this edition) the breath-taking art of Alan Lee, and this set becomes an attractive addition to the family library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the radio version of the the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is not the unabridged reading of the three books: Fellowship, Two Towers, &amp; Return. It is a 12 cassette dramatization. I was very disappointed when I realized what I'd bought as I was looking for an unabridged reading of the three books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well, I guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews of the quality of this book. First, though, a word about shipping. It seems to be a crap shoot when you order a large heavy book from Amazon whether it will arrive undamaged or not. My copy escaped from it's shrinkwrapped moorings and ended up with a bruised corner. Heavy books like this really need a double cardboard base and double shrinkwrapping to survive. I wish Amazon would get the word out to their workers. I guess I can live with the small bruise to the back corner of the slipcase box (the book itself is undamaged), but it is annoying.On to the book itself... 1. As others have said, the color is not blue at all, but dark green/gray. Amazon shows a picture of a clearly blue book - maybe there were two versions? In any event, not that big a deal. 2. I'm not sure the binding is real leather at all. It sort of feels like it (though more sued-like than leather), and sort of smells like it, but it's so darn thin I can't believe it is real leather. I'll have to check with HMC... 3. The gilt edges seem cheap to me. All the pages were stuck together as well, though they came apart after a little riffling. And the gold does come off - in dust form - though hopefully that was just the gold sticking the pages together. 4. The body of the text is not centered on the page: it is up too high by a 3/8 inch, and not exactly square with the page either. The problem with this is that it _constantly_ annoying while reading. 5. I wish the maps were in pockets instead of being bound into the book. You can't possibly look at them and read the book at the same time without damaging them.All in all, perhaps the only reason to buy this book is that the text is supposed to have many corrections and be more true to Tolkien's intent. If so, great, but I can't vouch for that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The red leather one may look fancier on the shelf, but that's not what this book (or any other book) is about. I'd rather enjoy classic illustrations while reading this book than a fancy cover when it's just sitting there. The illustrations do really add a lot to this. Sometimes, they don't always agree with what's in your mind, but they always do a lot to set the mood. The pix are also great for children; it really gets their imagination going at an early age. The first time I read this book, I knew it woudl be one that I would read over and over again. This was one book (along with the Hobbit) that it worth owning in hardcover and keeping for a lifetime.Late Addition: Be sure to check out 'The Hobbit' also illustrated by Allan Lee.

If you loved the movies, then you will love the \\"Trilogy\\".The Kindle version includes all \\"three\\" books with footnotes and appendices. It is a very convenient and \\"all-inclusive\\" version of the story loved by many people around the world.

When I came to this site to purchase a fine and durable copy of LOTR for my small but precious fantasy collection, I went through most of the reviews in hope of finding more info about this (the illustrated boxed hardcover set by Alan Lee with ISBN-13: 978-0618260584, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Trade; 1 edition (November 2002)) edition of the books which caught my attention at first glance.I found some reviews which shed some light about the paper quality, binding and spine. Without much repeating with the others, I will add that this edition met and exceeded all my expectation of what I consider to be a high quality and durable books. The illustrations by Alan Lee enhance the whole story and are very well done. The books are very easy to read since the font is big enough and it doesn't tire your eyes if you are reading for an extended period of time. They can be open very naturally in your lap, on your desk or whatever reading habit you might have - you could open them flat if you want without twisting and damaging the spine (they are very well bound). Under the beautiful illustrated dust jackets the books are red with the titles written in gold letters on the spine, and the Tolkien's logo on the front cover also written in gold. All three books have maps on the start and in the end of the book. The first book starts with foreword to second edition and some notes and the third book have a very detailed Appendix (for those who want to learn more) in the end that shows the family trees, ruling lines, elvish letters, hobbit's calendar and other fun and interesting stuff that will enhance your story.Bottom line. Unless you want leather bound copy of Easton Press or similar limited editions (which are hard to find and cost lots), this boxed set is a perfect treat for you. It looks good on your shelves, easy to hold and read and it will last you for ages and repeated readings."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a review about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I think the book is a classic at the point that no review is needed about the content (for me,it is obviously a 5 star). This is a review about the edition I bought on Amazon, after having destroyed my first English edition (a 1990 paperback from Grafton) because of too much reading. I hope this could be of help for people searching for a durable edition of the book.The 2002 hardcover edition from Houghton Mifflin (ISBN-10: 0618260587; ISBN-13: 978-0618260584) is almost perfect. The three books are resistant and the quality of the printed font makes the reading a great pleasure. The illustrations from Alan Lee are marvelous, too. I think it will be a purchase you will not regret.I could have a small issue about the slipcase, which was a little bit damaged, but this was probably due to the Italian post & custom office opening my package (BTW, if you are buying from or selling to Italy, use a courier, no matter if it is more expensive - you'll avoid a lot of trouble).The only thing I could regret is that, while I like Alan Lee a lot, I consider John Howe the best Middle Earth illustrator, and I would have liked to have his \\"Gandalf Stormcrow\\" illustration for the cover of this ultimate edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When removing the glue from the map I recommend using a sharp knife so you avoid tearing. The map is attached to the book bounding for some reason and if you want to avoid tearing in the lower map area better use scissors to cut the little overlapping flap off.---Excellent book. The hardcover is NOT made of paper. It's a thin, leathery layer which gives the book its leather appearance. I was worried it was just some cheap leather optic, but I'm satisfied with the book. The gold glided site edges are a nice touch and the reason why I prefer this version to the UK one.

I purchased this kindle version of LOTR ( all 3 books ) and I absolutley love them. This is definitley the best three fantasy books ever written and if you are an avid reader like me, LOTR isnt just a must, its an absolutle mandatory to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have no intention of debating the merits of The Lord of the Rings. The work speaks for itself; if you are one of its few detractors, your silly comments are not worth a reply, and you should go read some Philip Pullman. Here, I will simply address the quality of this edition.I recently picked up this set because I needed new reading copies (the pages were falling out of my old ones), and I am quite happy with them. I was very surprised to read some of the other reviews that complained that this edition was of low quality. As far as the pages being a little off-white, my question is this: Is that bad? And if so, why? I can't really understand why that would be a minus, the pages just look older, and the color goes nicely with the brown cloth binding. The second complaint was the font. If you have ever had the pleasure of examining first editions of The Lord of the Rings books (and I have), its the same font that was used on the first printing. Thirdly, there were complaints about the fold out maps being hard to get out. The maps are FOLD OUT and ARE NOT meant to be taken out! If you tried to do it, its your own fault that your book is torn up, so don't complain about it and blame the publisher.The point of all this is that the books look vintage, and the design is very subtle and classy. If you want some garish looking movie cover set, then there are plenty of those for you. But if you want something that looks good on a nice bookcase, then get these."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've just started to read The Lord of the Rings in English (I'm Spanish) and all I can say is that this is the best edition of LOTR in the world!!! It's totally awesome, a great buy for Tolkien's fans. Absolutely recommended"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I kid you not. This is, hands-down, the most encompassing, riveting, imaginative, breath-taking, awe-inspiring, wonderful masterpiece to be written and published in the last hundred years, perhaps longer.The Lord of the Rings is not simply the greatest fantasy novel of all time because of Tolkien's gift with prose, love of poetry, or passion for matters of war and conflict. Here, in these amazing 1000+ pages, we get an entire world. Tolkien was working on creating the lands and history of Middle-earth even as he sat in the trenches of World War I, and it shows. Each race, country, language, all feel real enough to once have existed in our own world, even as fantastic as they may seem. That's why these books are not only priceless, but timeless as well.What can I say about these? I love them, obviously. The story is my favorite ever told, beginning with a simple task undertaken by Frodo Baggins, adopted nephew to the renowned Bilbo Baggins, in The Fellowship of the Ring. From seemingly small beginnings springs an epic in ever sense of the word, as Frodo learns the true nature of The Ring of Power, and the Dark Lord that will stop at nothing to reclaim it. Along the way, he is helped by a fellowship of men, dwarves, elves, fellow hobbits, and even a wizard in his mission to destroy The Ring and end the dominion of the evil Sauron.The story and action continue in The Two Towers, as the fellowship is broken and its members are close to despair. Frodo and his loyal retainer Sam continue to Morder, meeting the creature Gollum, and murderous wretch driven mad by The Ring's power, but their only guide to the fires of Mount. Doom. The other members of the fellowship travel to the besieged land of Rohan, hoping to stop its destruction in a last stand in a mighty fotress.The Return of the King brings the saga to a fantastic close, as Frodo and Sam's journey takes them deep into the lands of Morder, where they are hunted from all sides. Aragorn, lost heir to the throne of Gondor, must defend the city of Minas Tirith against the hordes of Sauron, only to once again enter battle before the Black Gates of Mordor themselves, hopelessly outnumbered, a lost cause to buy enough time for Frodo's quest to succeed.Through the story, readers are treated to some of the most incredible and bizarre creations, humanoid and otherwise, ever to appear upon a page. Likewise, the depictions of the battles waged to save Middle-earth are second to none in modern literature, as is the heart-wrenching ordeal that Frodo goes through during his quest.To top it off, this is one of the best editions of the fantasy trilogy, with leatherette cover, box, maps, and the full appendacies. It is, in fact, the same version that my father read to me nearly fourteen years ago, and it still holds its own against the reissues and movie tie-ins that have come since. If you have never before read J. R. R. Tolkien's literary accomplishment, then this is quite possiby the best way to do it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"bought this book by mistake nothing wrong with it but already have the book learning to use my new toy"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Read Lord of the Rings many years ago.

I've read Steinbeck, Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner, Heller, Orwell, and none have given me the pleasure of Lord of the Rings. It is as influential as any book that has ever been written, has superlative writing, outstanding pace, etc. It can work on multiple levels: great character development, gripping plot, deep symbolism; while most books (Ulysses, 1984) have just one or two of those three elements, Lord of the Rings have all. You can plop down on the couch and read them for fun, or you can conduct extensive studies dealing with mythological symbols and religious meanings. A 9-10 year old can read The Hobbit and love it, and a 50 year-old college PhD. can analyze it to no end. These books have the univeral appeal necissary to stand the test of time. Will people still read The Great Gatsby in a hundred years? Who knows. They WILL be reading Lord of the Rings. I can't recommend these books enough. Please, buy them, borrow them, check them out, or use any other means possible. Just read them. You'll never regret it.

The Lord of the Rings is a novel written on more levels than a skyscraper, which makes it enjoyable for a large range of readers. On the most basic and understandable level, it is a story about a Hobbit who is unexpectedly thrust into the ownership of a magic ring. But this isn't just any magic ring, but rather the one ring created by Sauron, the lord of darkness, to control all of Middle earth. Frodo is left wth no choice except to take the ring directly into te heart of Mordor, the land of darkness, to throw the ring into Mount Doom, where the ring was created, and the only place it can be destroyed. Many people who are not well read may assume this to be the only level the story is written on, but I would STRONGLY suggest this book to anyone who is interested in reading the most ingenius piece of work ever written."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I highly reccomend this edition to anyone who considers themself a fan of the Lord of the Rings. If you are reading this, you probably already know you like the story. This edition is great for a few reasons. It puts all three books together they way they are meant to be read. I also like it because it is very sturdy and quite good looking on the shelf. This book is meant to be read again and again and still look good. As a nice added bonus, there is a big fold out map in the back that can be helpful if you have trouble visualizing where everything is.This edition may be a bit more expensive than others, but it is well worth it. I have no doubt that I will still be enjoying this book 20 or more years from now."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is an amazing page-turning fantasy action/adventure novel that is set in the magical world of Middle-Earth. Written by J.R.R. Tolkein in 1954, this story has stood the test of time as people have read and re-read it and still do even today, thrilling generations before and many more to come.The three books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King have been conveniently compiled into a single book in this edition. And for die-hard Tolkein fans who want a better understanding of the story and background, and who are ever-thirsting for more, attached to the end of the novel are Appendices, which include: Chronologies, Family Trees, Calendars, and even a little bit on the unique languages that Tolkein created, along with Indexes of all songs, people, beasts, monsters, places, and things, and best of all, Maps...The descriptive language used in the novel and also Tolkein's attention to detail immerses you in the epic journey, making you feel as if you are there with them as you recreate the setting exactly as Tolkein intended in your imagination. Tolkein, obsessed with linguistics, even creates languages so that it feels so authentic, you will come to think of the story not so much as a dream, but more like a memory.This novel is a sequel to The Hobbit, also by Tolkein, which tells the story of Bilbo Baggins' journey through Middle-Earth and how he came into possession of the Ring. Many years have passed since his return to his home in the Shire and one day, he mysteriously vanishes, leaving the Ring to his nephew, Frodo.The Lord of the Rings documents the journey of Frodo Baggins as he, along with his companions, travel deep into the heart of Mordor, the domain of the malevolent Sauron, to destroy the One Ring in Mt. Doom, where it was forged. On the way, they encounter creatures and evils that they never have imagined could even exist! Some are helpful and become their friends, while others are more than what they seem...This good versus evil struggle unites the seemingly timid Hobbits, a powerful Wizard, a tough Dwarf, a mysterious Elf, and Men into an unbreakable friendship to make a legendary journey together through Middle-Earth to battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord in a spellbinding tale that you will never forget!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a great and epic journey of fear, power, and greed. It is an extraordinary peace of work and one of the best of classics. A must have. J.R.R Tolkien combines action, adventure, betrayal, suspense, love, and imaginary creatures of distant lands to create a literary masterpiece. Be ready to be pulled into the land of Middle-Earth and explore its beauty. Surprises will come at you at every turn and will keep you on your feet. The story will make you laugh, feel sad, and even scared. The distinct characters of the Company are exciting, with distinct personalities and their own roles in the plot. Environments flow with description and set the moods for the story. The use of old English in dialogue will make you feel like you're living in the age of kings and knights. I cannot fully put my experience with reading the book without giving away much of the story. You have to read it for yourself to truly appreciate its nature. If you loved the movie, then this book is a must have.

Other authors have tried to recreate the scale and emotional depth that this story holds yet few to none have acomplished so well what Tolkien did. All I can say is give it a try and see where it takes you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Ok I'll start out by saying that I've never been much of a Fantasy genre fan, LOTR and D&amp;D and all that stuff never really appealed to me. Last month I was stuck at the airport for 12 hours so I decided to buy a book to pass the time. I saw LOTR and since it was really long and I had a lot of time to kill, plus I knew there was a movie due out I figured I'd buy it.Normally I'm a fast reader but for some reason it took me a long time to get through the whole book. Some parts are really slow and boring, but they all build up to something, even if it something which seems irrelevant such as the origins of pipe-weed. Finally I finished the book and I wasn't too sure if I actually liked or not until a couple of days later when for some reason I kept going back to the Index, and Appendixes and rereading certain parts which would raise my curiosity which would in turn take me back to read other parts and discover events and subplots I had totally missed. Now I'm seriously pondering rereading the book or maybe buying the hobbit or the one that goes after LOTR which I don't even know what its called. The fact is I'm hooked and I wish I would've read it when I was younger so I could enjoy it even more now.By the way since in many of these reviews people mention their favorite character I'll mention mine too. It's Bill yes Bill. All book long I kept wondering when they would mention Bill again or they would find him or whatever, towards the end I had almost forgotten about poor old Bill."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkiens books are incredible.

J.R.R. Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS takes everyone to a land beyond imagination, on a high risk adventure and incredible beings. It's a book every reader of great epics must have. Read it once, twice, three or more times: you'll enjoy it every time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Studying abroad in France, I was kind of yearning for some English reading material to keep me connected to my native-language roots. So when I saw &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; on the bookshelf in a local bookstore, I figured why not give it a try, a well-known book I'd not yet read. And I was completely surprised: Tolkein's epic exceeded my every expectation.The story of how Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit from the backwoods Shire, stumbles upon the One Ring, which harnesses the power of world domination, is truly gripping - and I know that word gets used a lot to describe books, but in this case it's quite appropriate. I spent an entire day reading it, and could not put it down; it lured me back every time I tried to go do something else, like eating.A whole slew of memorable characters intersect with Frodo as he ventures across Middle-Earth, some of whom were introduced in The Hobbit, some new: Gandalf, Smeagol, the Lady Galadriel, Sam Gamgee, et al. Each one has a distinct personality all his own, although I must confess I had trouble distinguishing between all the Kings and Lords and such. If the characters weren't sufficiently distinct, the plot line was quite complex and I found myself guessing time and again at what would happen next - wrongly.The book, in short, is a masterpiece. Tolkien disavowed the apparent symbolism relating to the social conditions of the Post-WWII world, so I leave it to the reader to decide what to make of the book. Whether you see it as an allegory or simply an epic tale, it's clear that this is a brilliant novel."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book ever, on many levels. I first read it 5 years ago and have read 10 times since. It is one of those books that gets better with each read. The first time your read it, it may be boring in the beginning, although I thoroughly enjoyed characters like Bombadil and Butterbur. But whne you reach the last sentence, you will want to turn back tot eh first page and start all over again.After the first read, LOTR begins to take on many forms. It can be read for the story, for the writing style, for the characters, for the languages, for the love of Middle-earth and for Tolkien's genius in showing all these things to us.For me, most amazing thing about this book was the way in which Tolkien has made Middle-earth real to us. Although he was not the first to try and presnt fantasy as reality, no one has done it better. The appendixes wiht full dates and family trees are very impreswsive. The languages are definately real. In fact, I have found elements of Hebrew and Persian in the Dwarf-speech, with different spellings(Baruch has become Baruk). I have been entirely captivated by the reality of middle-earth, to the point of having LOTR dreams at night after reading it.To end this review I wish to present a quotation from Peter S, Beagle's review of this book:&quot;For in the end it is middle-earth and its dwellers we love, not Tolkien's considerable gifts in showing it to us. I said once that the world he charts was there long before him, and I still beleive it. He is a great enough magician to tap our most common nightmares, daydreams and twilight fancies, but he never invented them either: he found them a place to live, a green alternative to each day's madness here in a poisoned world. We are raised to honor all the worng explorers and discoverers-thieves planting flags,murderers carrying crosses. Let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"...you'll love this set of books. LotR is what introduced myself and many others into the wonderful and imaginative (and at times clich&eacute;d) world of fantasy. But this is where it all began.LotR is somewhat of a followup to the children's book, the Hobbit. It talks of what happens after Bilbo finds his ring and returns to Bag End. Without going into too much detail to avoid spoiling something, Bilbo entrusts the ring to his heir, Frodo, who has to set out and destroy it. Of course, the actual story is much more descriptive, with elegant speech, realistic and vivid backdrops as well as surprises around every corner.Whether you don't like fantasy, have never tried it, or, and especially, if you're a huge fan of the genre, read this book. I guarantee, it will give you a new perspective of how you see literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was introduced to the world of Tolkien b a friend, after we were talking about our favorite books by the time. He did mention of Tolkien, and how his Triology had changed his life. (in a sense) I decided to give it a try.I was done with &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in four days, finished &quot;The Two Towers&quot; in two and completed &quot;The Return of the King&quot; in five. No wonder I did terrible in school back then, and gave a radical twist to my already intense medievalist ramblings.This is the Holy Book of modern fantasy, from Robert Jordan and Star Wars, to even Squaresoft's Final Fantasy Series, it is all based upon this.Please, read it, you really won't regret doing so.On a side note: I really hate it when some people make fun, either of the book or the people that read it. Now don't take me wrong, I have nothing against the people who have read the story and didn't like it, (you can't please everybody) after all, each head is a universe, and we all have different points of view. Who I don't like, are the ones who go making fun, and have not even read the books, either because they are childish or stupid, or both.Don't fall into that abyss, read them, and make your own unbiased opinion."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Fellowship of The Ring sereies is an incredible tale of hardships and courage. It also tells us something; too much power can easily corrupt you. As we see the evil Sauron has had use of the Ring for many many years, and the more times that goes by without him having it he becomes more brutal and wants the ring more and more, for he can invoke the magical powers that are imbued upon it. While he is seperated from the ring he becomes more evil, gains more power, and eventually he has become so evil that he cannot help himself but to destroy everything he sees. I hope you buy this series and read it a few times, because it is an incredible tale. (Who wouldda though I'm an 11 year old kid??? Because I am)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was very disappointed with the acting and production of the 9 CD boxed set. It seems to have been produced for children. The voices of the actors are more suited for Disney fairy tales than for Tolkien's Mastepiece. The actors use goofy Cokney English accents - Elves sound like Munchkins - terrible. Do not waste your money on this. I listened to the first CD and boxed the whole thing back up for a refund."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Each of the books that make up this trilogy is a masterpiece. This can be lost somewhat in the hype of the movies based on these fantasy tales. As good as the movies all were, the three books should be read in their entirety as well in order to form an appreciation for the absolutely wonderful world that Tolkien created. Even if you are not a fan of the fantasy genre, there is something so captivating in each of these books. This group of books would definitely be included in my list of \\"desert-island\\" books. It's probably a good idea for people to read the book \\"The Hobbit\\" before beginning this trilogy. This little book introduces the reader to the wonderful world of Hobbits. This trilogy has everything - adventure, romance, war, deception, and a whole world of wonderful creatures! I could go on and on about this, but you need to read this for yourself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm a long time fan of the Lord of the Rings having first read the Hobbit 35 years ago! I've since read the trilogy through perhaps 10 times. Many people here have described the plot so I won't bother. Instead I want to talk about the way that Tolkien creates a 'believeable' world out of totally fantastic material -- and why Peter Jackson's movies are bound to have such mixed results.Throughout LOTR, Tolkien employs an interesting strategy for dealing with the most fantastical events that occur -- he only lets us see them secondhand through the recollection of the characters. This happens in many places: Gandalf's imprisonment by Saruman is told to us after the fact by Gandalf himself at the Council of Elrond; the battle with the Balrog on Zirak-Zigil is again Gandalf's recollection. I could go on: the destruction of Isengard by the Ents is not directly narrated but comes to us as Merry and Pippin tell the story to their companions, Aragorn's battle with Sauron to wrest control of the Palantir is told from Aragorn's memory, we experience the harrowing Paths of the Dead in the form of Gimli's painful confessional.There are a few places where fantastic events are directly described but most of the time Tolkien lets his characters tell us about 'magical' happenings after the fact. He does this, I think, because it allows the reader to accept them more easily. Tolkien painstakingly creates human-like characters that we trust (even when they're dwarves or hobbits!) and the lets them tell us what happens. So when Merry and Pippin describe the fall of Isengard I believe them. More unconditionally than if I had been shown it 'directly'.Movies, however, can't work this way. I do like many parts of the Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship' -- Hobbiton, Bag-End, Frodo, Legolas and Boromir are all nearly perfect visions from the books. But when really magical things begin to happen the movie falls into caricature in ways that the books avoid. One only needs to compare Gandalf's economical telling of his contest with Saruman at Orthanc to the 'Kung-Fu Wizards' scene in 'Fellowship' to get the idea.The books are an entirely different experience for this reason and more. I could write another review that just talks about the poems and songs for which the movies have no time. If you've become familiar with LOTR through the movies by all means enjoy them! But then do yourself a favor and *run* to get the real thing and read them over and over."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a fantastic CD set. I was unsure about buying it because of the cost--but I am very glad I did. It has made long interstate trips a joy on more than one occasion. I still have not finished the series, but I wanted to write you a review to encourage anyone anywhere to buy this set. I am already looking forward to when I can begin the series again!! The author brings the characters to life.There is still time to buy the set, and know the real story before The Two Towers comes out in December!!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien set the background of Heroic Fantasy (and unfortunately contributed to the swarming of mediocre &quot;epigones&quot;).This trilogy is about the eternal fight on good and evil...in the human heart.All the strange creatures of the book are a symbol of a particular kind of human being. Hobbits are innocent,bold,yet vulnerable to temptation.They can be noble like Frodo,faithful and loving like Sam,amiable amd cheerful like Merry or Pippin..or pettily greedy like Lobelia,or miserably loathsome like Gollum.In fact,hobbits are the average man. Wizards like Gandalf and Saruman are the men of power,who must also fight the tempation of evil.Gandalf has fought and conquered it, Saruman has been overwhwlmed by power lust, falseness and deception. Then you have Elves: disillusioned idealists who've chosen to fly,to evade.And so we have the psychopaths Orcs,spiteful of all that's human (they remind me of some...), the Ents,representing the Earth (Wizard are Fire, Eagles are Air, Elves are Water)as well as the industrious Dwarves. And the Evil itself,Sauron,is not personified,because it is an abstract principle,and the battle between good and evil takes place (as I've said)in the human heart. So much for the symbolic. I've also loved Bilbo,Sam,Merry,Pippin,Gandalf,Aragorn,and pityied wretched Smeagollum,and admired the proto-feminist (of sorts) Eowyn,and saw in Elbereth Gilthoniel a long lost love of mine! Whit time, Frodo and Sam have grown and become Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, Elric,Kirith Kirin, and the Elves have finally become Lynn Flewellyng faye (Alec and Seregil) and the Grigori and Wraeththu of Storm Constantine. But Tolkien was the pionieer who reinvented the myth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In an age where a 2 hour movie has replaced the art of the story, its always nice to sit back and read a book. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, as much today as when they first came out, presents itself as top notch story telling. The Lord of the Rings isn't just about plot, and unfortunately that may lose some people who don't have the patience to sit down and actually read a book from front to back (let alone three books). People today would much rather go for the Star Wars style trilogy that takes only 6 hours to enjoy and understand. Whereas the Lord of the Rings might take 6 weeks (or 6 days if you really have the time). But the people who can't keep their attention long enought to read a mere 1500 pages, should go and watch Wrestling. The Lord of the Rings deftly combines several very linked but very seperate plots together. That is why the books are divided into seperate parts dealing with the various characters. To skip any of it, is to miss part of the whole story. But the story is only one part of the books that matter. Tolkien is also an exceptional writer. Sit back and open up the Lord of the Rings, step out of the &quot;Kingdom of Blah&quot; and engulf yourself in the tale of the master story teller! This book is a must read if you ever want to get anywhere in life. It is the War and Peace of Fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's the only complete reading of LotR out there, so it will have to do. Rob Inglis does a wonderful job performing the lighter roles. His hobbits in Hobbiton are outstanding. He also does a good Gollum (which isn't a light role). He's probably a good character actor. However, the dramatic renderings are frequently given in a frustratingly sing-song, randomly-inflected tone. It's like he gets bored or something and resorts to reading rather than performing. Tolkien, who wasn't a professional performer, per se, did a much more stirring job in his informal sample recordings, presented in The J.R.R. Tolkien Audio Collection. I wish someone could do for LotR what Jim Dale does for Harry Potter. Granted it's a long, complex slog, requiring a vast number of voices, however this story deserves more than it gets here."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've been running across a fairly unfortunate state of affairs lately, in that apparently very few fantasy fans are actually reading this book (yes, it's \\"book\\", not \\"trilogy\\": non-fans, Tolkien buffs are kind of rabid on that distinction, so if you're talking with a fan anytime soon, just remember that One Vol. is a gooooood thing for this novel). Oh, they'll talk you a blue streak about how great it is, possibly out of the interest of fantasy solidarity but more likely just because a generation of critics regard LotR as the next best thing to the Second Coming, so they're obligated to like it as well. So laudatory statements are in no short supply, but people aren't actually reading the book, and when you dig a little deeper under the kneejerk reaction of \\"aha! Yes! Great book!\\" you find that there's often a deep-seated animosity toward a cultural phenomenon they're not on the inside of, and in a lot of the younger readers today, that comes out as \\"OMG, it's so BAD!\\"So I'd like to take this opportunity to say...no. It's not bad. You just couldn't read it. There's a difference. This is not necessarily an attack on you personally. The idea that each of us has to be some kind of Renaissance Man or Woman who can appreciate fine literature even while slaving away as a med student with no actual time to read or being fairly uninterested in books anyway makes it sound like one, but it's not. What I'm saying is that there is a generation of people provided with alternate means of entertainment than the reading of novels. Television, movies, and video games are far more the go-to cultural touchstones than is literature (seriously, I'm an English major, and when we get together, we do not talk about the latest literary magazines. We talk about Mad Men and Dexter). And yet there is this inherent and evident presumption in modern society that despite the fact that the majority of today's youth does not read more than a dozen good-sized novels a year of their own free will, they should somehow still be good at reading and appreciating what they read by recognition of highly advanced literary tropes.The fact of the matter is, most people are simply not all that good at reading anymore. Hell, a stunning number of people can't even spell correctly. Yet we expect that if someone can understand the basic mechanics of reading, that individual should be dumped off in the savage eddies of literature as a whole and advised to sink or swim. Most people sink, unless they're met halfway by J.K. Rowling or Brandon Sanderson or James Patterson or Stephen King or another writer who tends to put palatability of prose ahead of complexity of style. Not that any of these people is a bad writer, per se (except Patterson, who in a just world would be arrested for crimes against art on the merit of Alex Cross alone), but they have the trick of being compulsively readable, of providing information in a flashy, dramatic way that keeps the television generation stuck to the page. They're the direction most of literature is going today, or at least the literature that wants to attract an audience rather than sit in the Snobby Corner making toasts to elitism.The thing is that Tolkien (yes, finally we're getting back to Tolkien) was not the product of an era in which constant competition for readership with a glowing box was much of a concern. Imagine, if you will, a world BEFORE Legend of Zelda. Yes. Yes, it's earth-shattering, I know, but there it was. Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings over the span of about a decade in the thirties and forties, before most of the world even had a television, and movies with sound were still the big new thing. In Tolkien's day, this form of entertainment simply had not had time to become preeminent in the minds of the population, and (you guessed it!) the majority of people were still big readers.So when Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, his concern was not whether or not his readers could get through it. That was taken as a given. People were still reading freaking Middlemarch for fun back then. Of course they could last through Lord of the Rings. So Tolkien was free to play with the elements he actually wanted in his book, independent of commercialism. In his mind, he was not writing a cultural phenomenon: when LotR first hit bookstores, it was only a modest success, and Tolkien was perfectly satisfied with and probably expected this outcome. I'm sure he was pleased when the hippies got hold of it and people started wearing Gandalf for President t-shirts, but that was emphatically not something he foresaw. Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings primarily for himself. His publishers asked for a book \\"like the Hobbit\\", and so his only real job was to pump out another children's faery story starring furry-footed little gnomes bouncing across a cheerful fantasy world. Instead, he gave us Lord of the Rings, tossing in the Gothic Bildungsroman style with language adapted from the heroic literature of the Middle Ages he studied as a professor, and an expression of a personal philosophy in \\"nature and childlike attitude\\" versus \\"modernism and selfishness\\", all based on what is possibly the richest fantasy universe ever created.Is Tolkien's novel good? Hell yes it is. It's a triumph of literary ingenuity, a melting pot of styles and influences guided by a master's hand to incredible profundity and depth of emotion. It's a fully realized and idealized world representative of Tolkien's dreams and wishes. On top of that, it's an adventure and a tale of the power of friendship and it's the inspiration for over two generations of fantasy authors. What Tolkien did had never been seen before. The closest we had was freaking Thomas Hardy with his Wessex.Sadly, we are living in a generation of people who are not readily going to understand these things. That is not actively their fault. It becomes their fault, however, when they start claiming that if it doesn't entertain them at every moment, it's somehow failing as a novel, and try to justify this attitude with some sort of half-assed argument along the lines of \\"Seriously, Tolkien's not all that great. It's all good guys and bad guys, right? The real world isn't like that. That's too simplistic.\\"So let me say, now and for all time: Tolkien DID NOT WRITE THIS NOVEL FOR YOU. He wrote for a readership that could (by and large) better appreciate what he had done and were not going to be off-put by a bit of imagery and alternate cultural additions alongside the main plot arc. He was also writing long, looong before the Mighty and Awful Gods of Pop Culture had declared that gritty realism must somehow be present even in escapist fantasy (bizarre as that might sound). Is Tolkien writing an idealized world? Yes. But there is nothing wrong with that. It's a stylistic choice more or less carried over from the Heroic lit he was basing a lot of this stuff on, and it also gave him the chance to portray a world he would like to live in. Yeah. Remember when authors used to do that? No, really. It used to be fashionable to portray larger-than-life heroes and villains as representations as icons for the reading public. It's a tradition carried all the way from Shakespeare. Is it a \\"comfortable\\" read? Probably. Ultimate good and ultimate evil do provide a framework of moral certainty a lot of us would secretly like in a more complex world, but gritty realism isn't really any more edgy or less of a crowd-pleaser. It's just appealing to a different impulse. Instead of presenting noble heroes we aren't like but wish we were, new fantasy presents people pretty much exactly equivalent to modern society, thus reassuring us that even in Westeros or the Malazan Empire or what-have-you, everyone is the same crowd of selfish twits we see around us, and thus there's nothing wrong with society (or at least realistically changeable) as it currently stands. Neither approach is ultimately the better one, in my view. Both are perfectly legitimate.So consider the fact, the next time you get irritated that someone is asking you about that boring Fellowship of the Ring, that maybe the problem isn't with the books so much as the fact that you're just a little too removed from them. If you genuinely want to appreciate LotR, start reading other older novels. Believe it or not, people used to like Portrait of a Lady and Wuthering Heights.If you haven't read and appreciated Lord of the Rings, if you're tempted to pass it off as an overly lionized bit of Mary Sue fantasy, try to recall that this is the novel that kicked off modern fantasy, and a novel that many regard as one of the best of all time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth. The game's creators made no effort to hide the fact that the game based on a varied band of roving adventurers was inspired by the exploits of the nine characters who formed \`The Fellowship of the Ring', especially as the primary adventurer types were Wizard, Warrior, Dwarf, Elf, Ranger, and Halfling. Sound familiar? And don't forget the dragons!Just as Lewis Carroll's works are imbued with logical twists and turns, befitting his training as a mathematician and logician, so Tolkien's works are filled with invented words and languages and histories loosely based on Celtic, Norse, and Teutonic mythology and folklore. In fact, lots of Tolkien's most familiar names are taken straight from old English, German, and Scandinavian works. And, it is the perception of great depth to the history of Middle Earth which magically draws one in and bewitches one with questions about the origins of this, that, and the other character or race. There is some sense of this depth in the Hobbit, but in this work, most of the background was borrowed from Grimm and other fairy tale sources. In fact, Tolkien could not begin writing \`The Lord of the Rings' until he wrote out for himself the mythology and history of the demiurges and races laying their fingerprints on Middle Earth. Most of this became the posthumously published \`The Silmarillion' plus the thirteen volumes of notes and stories published with the editing of son Christopher Tolkien.For the three of you who are not aware of the movies and books, let me be clear that \`The Lord of the Rings' is NOT a trilogy. It is not three separate stories connected by common characters, venue, or history. It is a single long novel in six parts which happened to be published in three volumes over the course of two and a half years, in much the same way that the three movies were released, one a year. And, as long as I am mentioning the movies, let me say that Peter Jackson totally outdid all expectations I had for how much of Tolkien's story could be squeezed into 10 hours of film. Some may say that a lot was left out. I agree that some events and even a story line or two was left out, but nothing of major consequence.Oddly, the single most interesting character of the novel, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the \`deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was \`the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. \`The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes.While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more \`human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films, along with my surely most scary moment, which I recall reading on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. All the following scenes, including the dreadful encounter with the Balrog and the King of the Nazgul were tame in comparison to that moment.The only place where the movies are weak is where they compress the events from the distruction of the ring to the departure of Bilbo, Frodo, and the elves from the Gray Havens. The whole end of Saruman by the scouring of the Shire is left out due to time constraints, so we get about 30 minutes on winding down through three different ending scenes.If you enjoyed the movie, you really must read the books to appreciate how good a job was done with the films."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just completed reading the Kindle version of Lord of the Rings and it was fantastic. I read the books years ago and wanted to read them again so I bought them for my Kindle. Not having to carry around the books was great and one of the reasons I really enjoy my Kindle. I really enjoyed the Kindle version as all three books come at one time. As I recall, it was cheaper to buy the set and not each individual title. Having them come as a set enabled me to move from book to book and not worry about having to carry the books.There are times I still want the book, especially when reading about the Civil War, but having a Kindle is great for those times when you want to read a great book, but don't want to lug one around. If you don't own a Kindle, I would highly recommend you get one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Generally I am not a big fantasy fan, but I can't believe I waited all these years to read the complete Lord of the Rings. I finished The Hobbit immediately prior and it definitely is a must-read before starting LOTR. The Hobbit serves as a prologue and eases you into the world of Middle Earth, leaving you wanting more.It seemed as if almost everyone I knew said they had read The Lord of the Rings. Finally reading it myself, however, I began to wonder how many people had ever actually read the entire work. Tolkien's world of Middle Earth is so rich with such complex history and meaning that it takes a good bit of time and thinking to absorb it all. I finally came to wonder if many \\"readers\\" had actually taken shortcuts by skimming the text, or had simply watched the films and said they had read it. I did not watch the films until I completed the entirety of The Lord of the Rings, and I enjoyed the extended version of each film when I was done. They are terrific adaptations, but the material here is so deep and rich that no film, no matter how well done, can possibly do it full justice.The Lord of the Rings was always treated by Tolkien as being one book and not a trilogy. Having everything in one volume to me was the best way to go. Do not be put off by the size of the volume. A good writer (and Tolkien is one of the very best) will draw you into the story and will keep you engaged throughout. I began by reading 10-20 pages a night, gradually letting Tolkien build his world around me piece by piece until I was entirely consumed with the world of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the evil Sauron, who secretly created \\"one ring to rule them all\\" to control all of the other rings of power in Middle Earth. The One Ring contains such absolute power that it corrupts and changes all those who come in contact with it, and must be destroyed for the good of all in Middle Earth.One of my big problems with fantasy writing in the past has been that of omnipotence. Since fantasy usually involves a new world with new rules and the catch-all of magic, an author literally can do anything in the story and get away with it. This absolute creative power, the author's own One Ring if you will, never corrupts Tolkien. Everything in LOTR makes sense and everything in the story \\"works\\" because Tolkien himself never succumbs to the power of this figurative \\"ring\\" by cheating the way some other authors seem to do. What's more, he ties everything in to a vast historical background so we as readers can see the logical changes and flow of history throughout the ages and the vast saga that is the world of Middle Earth.Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is an amazing work of the imagination and a triumph of the human mind. In writing it Tolkien did not cheat as an author, and neither should you as a reader. If you only skimmed Lord of the Rings in the past or have only watched the films, you owe it to yourself to make the time to go back and read it cover-to-cover. Take your time, read slowly, and fully realize the lush, vibrant, and unequaled world of J.R.R. Tolkien. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Within 2 weeks of receiving this set the pages literally started to fall out of the book and the binding completely came apart.

From it we get so many references in society. It is much better written than almost all the books written today. The story is very good just on the surface, but once you have read the background like the Silmarillion, you notice how many references that there are to the historic happenings in Middle Earth. The characters are all great, especially Sam and Frodo. Unlike his movie counterpart, this Frodo isn't as whiny and annoying. The beginning part in the Fellowship is considered 'boring' by most, but that is often my favorite part to read. The amazing amount of detail put into it just makes it come to life. The council in Rivendell also is good. Really, there is hardly a part of it that I don't like.

My best buy"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' by J.R. R. Tolkien on Audio CDs from Recorded Books. Complete and Unabridged, performed by Bob Ingles. 10 compact discs in \`The Hobbit' and 46 in LOTR; more than 60 hours.I've read \`The Hobbit' and LOTR several times over the years and I've seen all the movies several times (Good News! Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro are filming \`The Hobbit' and a \`prequel' to LOTR to be released in 2010 and 2011). So when I saw this was available from Recorded Books I bought it. Overall I was not disappointed; there is enough here to satisfy any LOTR geek (not do disparage geekatude, in fact I admire most geeks) but the main thing I got out of it was an increased admiration for Peter Jackson's film adaptation. Jackson was a genius at cutting out the parts that added little to the overall story and in changing places and characters to make it flow better.I could review and compare the books, the movies, and the audio CDs, however I'll just refer to the whole thing as LOTR here.The recording at times gets very heavy and hard to follow. Just like in the books, there are long passages you'd like to skip. Unlike the books, you have a hard time doing that here. Having said that I still have to give this all 5 stars as it is worth having if you are a LOTR fan like me. Bob Ingles does a masterful job of performing all the parts, not merely reading them. At times it is confusing, but then LOTR is confusing at times; all those names that are so close always got mixed up in my mind. Also Ingles at least even tries to make those doggerel \`songs' of Tolkien sufferable. Thank gawd that Jackson cut them from the movies. I did think that Ingles was channeling Dwight Frye at times when he was doing the voice of Sm&eacute;agol/Gollum. But overall I was very impressed and rarely confused, or at least no more than normal.I will say in listening to LOTR I noticed things which I never picked up on in the books or movies. For one thing Tolkien's rather snobbish acceptance of the \`Divine Right of Kings' and aristocracy worship in general is much more evident when you are listening. Also I came to detect a more than small amount of racism on Tolkien's part; for example Sm&eacute;agol/Gollum is referred to as \`black' and the humans who join forces with Sauron are described with racial stereotypes. I suppose Tolkien can be excused as this was probably merely a reflection of his background and era, but it did get on my nerves at times. Also Tolkien seems to me to be even rather dismissive of the Hobbits as \`little people' and in the end Gandalf abandons them to fight Saruman on their own; he is \`too busy' off smoking his pipe and talking to Tom Bombadil (a character thankfully left out of Jackson's movies)to be bothered to help them.But, all things being equal which they never are, if you are a fan of LOTR you'll want to spend the US$150.00 or so for this collection and listen to it all in preparation for the Jackson movies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The stories make a great novel, I'm a huge LoTR fan.

Tolkien is fiction at its finest. Through enriching detail and vivid imagery, Tolkien tells one of the greatest tales Good versus Evil. The story follows the path of the Fellowship of the Ring as some members must take the evil Ring to the Land of Mordor to have it destroyed, while others in the Fellowship fight in battles of an epic struggle against evil. Tolkien beautifully tells this imaginative story through a simple language that flows much more easily than many modern works of fiction. His connotation gives the reader a sense of old and majestic experiences while keeping the reader involved through its simple flow. Tolkien's imagination shows well in this story as he clearly follows the \\"Know What You're Talking About\\" rule of fiction. The detail in this novel truly keeps the reader interested as he or she can clearly see the environments the characters are in.

I've read it five times through, and am currently savoring a sixth reading and I find myself appreciating it more and more each time I read it.I especially enjoy opening the book to particular section and re-reading a few lines of Tolkien's beautiful and calm prose; or to reflect on the careful linguistic contruction that Tolkien put in to create his multitude of languages.This is simply a wonderful book, and once you've read it, it is a joy to go back to the Silmarillion and learn of the ancient tales that are only hinted at in this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is indeed an excellent read. A very entertaining story that will appeal to the &quot;child&quot; that, hopefully, still lives inside us.The tale that Tolkien tells us is rich in content and background. You can feel while you read that there is more to the story than what you are just reading. It is almost as if, while telling you Frodo's ordeals, Tolkien brings you closer to a rich and imaginative world, full of legends, myths, its own history, and above all, full of characters. All the implicit and explicit references to other heroes, evils, adventures and misadventures add a great deal to the story and to the entertainment it provides.Not only the book is imaginative, but is also well written. So well written that it will compel the curiosity of your &quot;inner child&quot; to keep reading. And if you look at it in a more subtle way, you may even glimpse a sense of humor in Tolkien's imagination (think, for instance, of the differences between the characters and how these differences affect their actions, words, ways of thinking and dealing with their problems).It was a good friend who, while we were all on a holiday trip, shared for a few minutes the book he was eagerly reading. After that my mind was set: I had to, I wanted to read more...And there is indeed more to the story than what you just read. If you've read other books of Tolkien, then you know there is more. But if this is your first Tolkien, then don't be disappointed when you finish because there is more. Yet, in my opinion, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is Tolkien's best."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What else can be said about Tolkien's epic fantasy that has not already been said by critics more worthy than myself?Lord of the Rings, for a point of fact is three books, the title referring to the trilogy as a whole. It is also one of the most exciting stories that will ever grip teenager and adult alike. Who needs Harry Potter and friends when we have Frodo Baggins and the fellowship of the ring? The storyline is simple enough. Frodo and his cousins, plus the dim but loveable Sam Gamgee leave the safety of shire to head for adventures and lands unknown. Lead by the mysterious wizard Gandalf, their first task is to find out the origins of the &quot;one ring&quot;, a ring with a history as bloody and magnificent as Middle Earth itself. Frodo Baggins is an unlikely hero in every sense of the word, just as his Uncle Bilbo was in the prequel to Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit where the &quot;one ring&quot; makes it first appearance. It is on Frodo's small shoulders that the fate of Middle Earth rests, and when Gandalf is lost along the way, all seems doomed.I won't say anything more about the plot less I give too much away and annoy potential readers to this wonderful epic of magic, war, music and tragedy.On a more practical level I just love this chunky one book edition but I will warn you it is VERY heavy to hold so it might be worth investing in the individual books of the triology for ease of read.

Could not put it down until I had finished the last word!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Amazing stories. Anyone who likes adventure and drama should read these novels. Tolkien brings me back to my childhood in a way that no other author can. Perhaps it is because that is when I first read him- but I do no believe that is it.

Aside from establishing a genere, Tolkien has created a masterpiece of literature that has been and is continuing to enchant readers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Fantasy is such a sprawling genre, filled with lots of average, but entertaining books. Tolkien, ever since the publication of LOTR stands out. He didn't really write a story - he made a world. A fantastic world, rich in history, magic, myths, and life.

While I wont go so far as to say &quot;the greatest book ever written&quot; (having not yet read every book.) LOTR remains one of my favorites. Few writers have ever been able to totaly immerse the reader as Tolkien has. Were it not for the length of the book, I would predict it to be taught in the English Literature classes of the future alongside Beowulf, Shakespear and Swift. While still in the realm of pop-literature, it also transcends it. The author has a natural ability to develop the fictional world to the point that it seems less like fiction and more like actual history. The characters are most highly developed as well. The dialog is oftentimes melodramatic but in the context of the story it might seem odd if it were not so. I hope all who read this book enjoy as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What is Rome without Caesar, oceans without water, Fantasy without LOTR? I've heard critisim directed at Tolkien's work that has stung my ears. The way Tolkien pulled off this masterpiece is absolutly dazzling. The subtle, belivable diversity of races and characters that seems, to the simpleton reader merely a story, then this idiot calls it to slow and to hard(awww) and tells us we're just exagerating. While other people call it escapist, and wishfull thinking. I'll ask you this, would you like to slave at a cubicle to no ends and then drive home through smog stuffed tree-sripped lands to your clone home and postage stamp garden, or travel in company with the companions of the ring, all the while witnessing the creation of legend in a world as convincing as our own. I first read LOTR in 3rd and 4th grade, but did'nt wholly understand the plot, so now i've come back to it at 12 and the full extension of the genius poured into it now hits me like a dwarven forge hammer. The cliff hangers are well placed and leave you rushing through the next chapter to find out what happens where the plot on that side of the story commences. If you hav'nt read LOTR then you havn't lived. I have to admire Tolkien for all the effort that he put into creating his legend, receiving endless critisism from his fellow scholers, the years of writing, some in WWII listening to the moans of wounded soldiers at Oxford.

It's most certainly too short. Tolkien spent so much time creating a world so vivid and so amazing, and yet I felt at the end of the novel (before i read the appendices) that I was at a loss for understanding on quite a few points. The appendices are a great help and cleared up most if not all of my confusion, but i wish that in place of the appendices, the stuff pertaining to before the War of the Ring was placed before the novel and the stuff happening afterward placed after the novel, with certain useful information (such as what the 3 elven rings are and how they got to where they are at the end of the novel), placed at the points where they would have been most useful. The way it is written, I think, detracts from the story because you have to go back and refer to things that you've already read to come to a better understanding of them early on instead of the last couple of pages all of a sudden these thigns turn up and, unfortunately, while they resolve the question of where the 3 elven rings were, no one has a clue how they got there, whether the people had them all along, whether they received them before the story took place, while it took place, or after it was over and now they're taking them out of the world. I'm sorry to be hanging on the negatives. The book was simply amazing, and I certainly reccomend it to anyone who is interested in reading it. I just wish that it had been written differently so as to provide for what I think would be the maximum understanding of the book from beginning to end without the need for &quot;extra&quot; stuff to clear things up."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Valiant you be, will no fear ever hinders.Water is Gold spring, feast always for the day.High foiled the sky, then from legend backs the king."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book will live long in the memory for me as the most engrossing story of its kind.This is an epic tale about a Hobbit who has come to own one of the three rings of power.

I think it is the best all-in-one edition of Tolkien's classic fantasy novel."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"Lord of the Rings\\" IS the best book of the twentieth century, despite some people's attempt to take it off of the \\"best books of the 20th century\\" list.Despite the fact that I consider Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy to be superior in many ways, the fact remains that if was completed in the 21st century. Tolkien's stories are full of loss and wonder, and sprinkled throughout with humor(in moderation, of course. These works, in general, are hardly humorous.)Drawing on mythology and using actual old english as the official hobbit language, this IS THE definitive fantasy epic.But a word of caution: It is not for those who want action on every page. It is a poetic epic, delicately crafted, and meant for those with minds for words, not bloodshed and special photographic effects.The movies were nice, but like all adaptations, could not match up to the book.The heroes are exceptional, and although heroes of a similar nature have been created ever since this book, Frodo is a great hero, who is a lot like a real person, and will appeal to the sort of people who the media stereotypes as fans of this tale.Frodo is, in many ways, the quintessential \\"nerd\\".In his own home, he is well-respected because of his wealth, though his neighbors are suspicious of him, because he his the nephew of the ill-reputed Bilbo Baggins (My all-time favorite character in ANY story!) and because he does not look or act like any of his neighbors, for his parents are from across the river, and he, like those on the other side of the river Brandybuck, does not act or look like other hobbits, and is forced to bear the burden of the magic ring of power, but is aided by his kindly gardener Samwise, and the wise and friendly advice of the grey wizard Gandalf and Aragorn, a warrior and naturalist who is heir to the ancient kings of Numenore.It has an ending which is tragic, yet not depressing. Read \\"Return of the King\\" before you see the film. In the film it will lose the punch in the stomach feeling you get when the ring is destroyed, the heroes journey back and the third age ends.Why, you ask, do I give this four and a half stars, not five, if I think it's so great?There are long descriptions of meals and baths, and Tolkien spends WAY too much time describing the shire and its customs, and it takes the hobbits A WEEK to leave home and go on their quest. Those are the only cons.Read it, I say, read it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am a huge fan of Tolkien's writing and I have always loved the trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I am a person who doesn't like to follow the crowd and when a fair amount of boys in my grade started reading the trilogy, I noticed that no girls were interested in this story. So I went out and bought the books. At first it was just to show that I am not a follower I am a leader. I started to read it and immediately fell in love with Tokien's masterful writing. In this breathtaking tale of good versus evil one hobbit shows that no matter how small you are you can make a big difference in the world. If you think about it this relates with real life too because no matter how small your input in a cause is it can go a long way. Tolkien was indeed a genius. He created his own languages, made a whaole world of fantastical creatures, and thought up amazing landscapes. He is one of the most renowned writers of our age. You are sure to fall in love with the hobbits, elves, dwarves, and men in this story. And the villains are very impressive. From the white wizard Saruman to the most feared being in middle Earth, Sauron, you are sure to find these books enjoyable. Read one of the greatest works of the 20th century and live the excitement."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I do not even need to review this book.

I highly recommend this to all LOTR fans as well as any one who just enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've listened to both version at this point the BBC and this version (Mind's Eye or American) and think that this version is overall the better version. One of my main complaints about the BBC version when I bought it after my tape version of the Mind's Eye wore out was the audio quality which can make it hard to hear.When I recently found and bought this new packaged version I was very pleased the story while short appeared to follow the story as J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it much more faithfully than the BBC version. The voices are clear and reasonably distinct enough that after listening for awhile you have no problem knowing who is saying what. And most importantly the audio does not randomly go up and down in the in this version which it did in the BBC version which at least for me made the BBC version hard (and sometimes painful to follow).Better version overall"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The content of The Lord of The Rings has always been an engrossing, controversial debate. Although I do love every page of it, I will not review the literature here; there are numerous websites devoted solely to that topic. Therefore, I will focus on the copy itself. The copy I received was not the one pictured. It has a different cover illustrated by Alan Lee. The book is not too heavy or large, though it is a sturdy copy for anyone who would like a regular reading copy. I personally like to keep a paperback version of my favorite books that I can take on the train, to the beach etc. without worrying about it being damaged from the air and sunlight. This version was perfect. This version also includes an additional note on the text which explains some of the errors with respect to the publishing of different editions. The appendices included are also a wonderful companion to the text.

In my teens I would read it over and over. Upon finishing the last page I'd go back and start re-reading it again. It spoiled me for other books.If you're new to LOTR, I'd recommend reading the Hobbit first. Be aware that it's a much different book - The Hobbit is a fast, easy read, and it's not as richly textured as LOTR. But it gives some good background context for LOTR. And when you get to LOTR, you will meet characters that will stay with you the rest of your life.Enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When my copy of Lord of the Rings started to fall apart from reading and age (they were circa 1975) I took up the task of finding a replacement copy. This is the first one i saw and it struck me on a level I couldn't describe. I kept looking at other copies but this edition grabbed me. However the reviews worried me: not real leather but cheap cardboard, bad case for the book, etc. However after seeing a very recent review that those problems were with an earlier printing I bit the bullet and bought it. When it arrived I realized that it was NOT cheap material but rather very supple, wonderful to the touch and actually changes from a blue tint to a slight marbled green when shifted in the light. The gild on the pages is a nice touch and the maps inside are wonderfully detailed. Two things I can't get over, and something that many true book lovers will appreciate. One, it smells wonderful. Not old book amazing, but still very good. Two, the pages are smooth like the cover but not onion page brittle: it feels like its meant to be read.One important thing to remember is to be VERY VERY SLOW in unfolding the maps, they can tear due to the way they are folded in the book. They also used a kind of adhesive to hold the map pages together so again, be VERY VERY SLOW and you'll be fine.Unlike most I won't even dare to summarize the story or plot as this space would hardly do it justice. Just trust me that if you like fantasy stories, get ready for (quite literally) the grand daddy of all of them. You don't really get a much more epic story then this that don't feel stretched, already done, or convoluted.All in all it's a delight to have on my shelf as well as to read. The construction is wonderful, the thought to editing the text is careful and well done, and it is visually captivating but at the same time toned down.

Tolkien's wit and intelligence comes through brilliantly and he paints a vivid picture of heroism and adventure that no one has yet topped. While the first 100 or so pages are a bit to drudge through and the plot just stews, once you get past those pages, the rest of the read is worth the time. I would say that this work could easily rank among the few books that I have read that could be considered good literature. Tolkien's expertise of languages and education really shine in this trilogy and he manages to delve into characters and situations that were alluded to in The Hobbit. The adventure of Frodo and Samwise is long and arduous and readers will be greatly rewarded for sticking through the book when they reach Mt. Doom.

Even those not interested in the fantasy genre should read this work, if only for its eloquent prose. In the realm of fantastic fiction Tolkien is undisputed master. His setting, rich and colorful; his characters, poignant and lifelike; his story, masterful. In his great labour, which took Tolkien the greater part of twenty years, the reader enters Endor the Middle Earth during the twilight of its Third Age (of Men and Elves), a time when the fantastic races are dwindling (elves, ents, dwarves etc.), magic is sparse and an unbelievably powerful malevolent force seeks to conquer the land. This creature, a twisted and fallen Maia (an angel-like helper of the Valar) called Sauron seeks a Ring of Power lost by him ages ago at the final battle of Barad-Dur, where the great King Isildur of the high-mannish race of Numenor, cut it from his hand. Possession of the ring would grant unrivaled power to Sauron over Middle-Earth. The ring however is lost in the great river Anduin after Isildur is ambushed by orcs crossing the river. Ages pass and the ring is found by a hobbit fisherman, Smeagol, who kills his brother Deagol for possession of it. The evil power innate in the ring turns Smeagol to thievery and he is eventually warped into a pathetically malicious creature called Gollum, who driven from his people resides with in the depths of the great Misty Mountains. Some time later another hobbit, the indomitable Bilbo Baggins, lost in the tunnels under the mountains, pursued by goblins and separated from his party of dwarves (if you haven't read &quot;the Hobbit&quot;, read it) happens upon the ring near Gollum's lair. Bilbo, growing old, eventually gives the ring to his nephew and ward Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit just coming of age. Soon after that Frodo is visited by Gandalf the Grey, a powerful wizard and an old friend of Bilbo's. Gandalf reveals to Frodo the horrible nature of the Ring and identity of its dread creator in the land of Mordor. This sets Frodo on a journey to reach the elvish haven of Rivendell, where he might seek counsel from the great half-elven sage Elrond on what must be done about the Ring. With his servant Samwise Gamgee and close friends Meriadoc Brandybuck and Pippin Took, Frodo embarks on a harrowing journey from his pleasant and stable Shire, all the while being harried by the wraith minions of Sauron, the Nazgul. During a brief respite in the village of Bree, the companions happen upon Strider (Aragorn), a surly-looking ranger, who not only turns out to be a friend of Gandalf's but also heir to the throne of the Dunedain (Isildur's forgotten line). Aragorn protects the hobbits on their journey to Rivendell, although Frodo is wounded by the Morgul-blade of the Nazgul king, Angmar. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by Elrond and is reunited with both Gandalf and Bilbo. At a great counsel, a decision is reached that the ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom (the Mordoran volcano where it was forged). If the ring is destroyed, Sauron, whose power is entirely linked to it, would also be vanquished. Frodo reluctantly accepts the unenviable position of Ring-Bearer in this seemingly hopeless quest. A fellowship is created to guide and protect Frodo from Sauron and his creatures with Gandalf the Grey as its leader. With him are: Aragorn, the great Dunedain prince, Boromir, a Gondorian prince and descendant of the Dunedain, whose land is already in danger of being conquered by Sauron, Legolas, a fair elven prince from Mirkwood the Great Forest, Gimli son of Gloin, a dwarf-lord from Erebor the Lonely Mountain and Frodo's three faithful companions from the Shire, Merry, Sam and Pippin.

The outside of the book has gold trees and blue stars embossed on it--it looks very elvish. There is a large fold-out map in the back, which is wonderful since I can never seem to make everything out on the maps in my paperbacks. If you're a big Lord of the Rings fan but are hesitating due to the cost, don't. It is money well spent, an absolutely beautiful book, and a must for fans. After all, don't forget, the Red Book of Westmarch (which is what the Lord of the Rings story was taken from) was supposed to be three volumes bound together in red leather, in a single red case.

A compelling story with moving characters and a scenery, which has for its closest, yet distant comparison, Frank Herbert's planet of Dune or Arrikis, from his Dune series. Yet this book does not stand alone, for it is only part of the ultimate creation of Tolkien, Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit serve as both the pinnacle and the entry point of Tolkien's world. For myself, after having read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, I was drawn into Tolkien's mystic and enchanting world, moving next to the Silmarillion, and the History of Middle Earth. It is the basis behind this wonderful book which bestowes its intracite and excillerating plot. To be able to read of the rebellion of Feanor against the Valar in the first age, of the true Dark Lord who turned Sauron of the second age, of Isildur the ancestor of Aragorn son of Arothorn of the third age, and to be able to relate every happening in the history of the poeple and of the land of Middle Earth to this final masterpiece, lets us truly appreciate the genuis and the unparalled creation of Tolkien: the ultimate literary creation of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not a very experienced fantasy reader (read - Dragonlance + Tolkien) - but LOTR is definitely the all-time masterpiece.

And, surprisingly, the CD-Audio version actually IMPROVES the experience! I have to say that's a first for me when it comes to an audio version of a book. The voices of the characters are believable; Gollum is as annoyingly stubborn and half-evil as you expected him to be when you read the book, Gandalf sounds like the ol' wizard he should be, and Frodo sounds just as indecisive and unsure in the beginning - and improving to be more and more brave towards the end.Great! Just Great! If you've read the book, get the audio version and listen to it in a dark room late at night - if you haven't read the book - READ IT! NOW!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to say, possibly the greatst book ever written. Its not just a book but an epic history and if you have read the mahabharata( an Indian epic), you'll know what i mean. The book's great in itself but the history Tolkien creates behind it is what is brilliant. I haven't read any other fantasy books unless you count these religious books like the bible, koran and the gita as fantasy but if this is how fantasy is written, just tell me the list of books to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you like fantasy then the Lord of the Rings trilogy is for you! Tolkien does a brilliant job and you will find yourself captivated for hours on end! But to get the best effect and a better understanding of this trilogy, I highly recommend reading his other works concerning middle-earth. These include &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and having the atlas to middle earth helps to see where the story takes place. It's almost as if this story really happened. It's just that well documented. Incredible! A must buy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"An absoulte must read series. Great for young and old alike. Amazing and awe inspiring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Even though I am a young reader, I have read titles from almost every big (and small) name fantasy author. In each one I have seen the impact Tolkien has had on them. J.R.R. Tolkien is truely the father of the fantasy world we know today. His books are well written, with interesting story lines and unforgetable characters. They appeal to the part of a person that still believes in magic, elves, dwarves, and heros who fought with steel hard wills and equally strong swords. If you call yourself a fantasy fan . . . you had better read these books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read this book when I was nine, and, now at 13, I have never seen better! J.R.R.Tolkien's books are MAGICAL! with his descriptions of characters and places, you enter into his world and see everything as clearly as he did. I read this every year, and each time, I love it just the same, even better! Read this book slowly, and savour evey precious word! I am writing a book, but I don't believe that any book could live up to this one!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings should be required reading for every High School Graduate in the United States (and world?). This epic can be read on countless levels and can be read over and over again. I have read the series (along with the Hobbit) over a dozen times and will be starting it again later this spring.The story is a timeless one of a journey and a struggle against evil and the dark forces in our natures. Along the way the protagonists encounter an incredible array of challenges, diversions, and unexpected visits with creatures you will hardly believe.Read the series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK.... and that's no understatement.

It is as much a requirement as reading Proust, Joyce or Kafka. A joy from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The single volume edition is both a blessing and a pain in the neck. The epic, one of the best ever written, is such a gripping story that once I begin reading the story (over and over) even from the middle I just can't put it down until I've read it through to the end.This means, however, lugging the heavy and large volume around, whereever I go. Separate volumes make this process easier. However, the joy of having everything in one place, the entire story as one book (as it was meant to be) is great.I spent too much time reading the forwards and notes concerning the various editions and corrections made to the story from print to print. I would recommend putting that off until you finish the main story (perhaps a few times). The appendix and notes following the story adds much to the experience.Once you finish the story, do read the Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you love Tolkien's writing you have to read this book. If you haven't read The Hobbit I would highly reccomend it since it is the first book before The Lord Of The Rings. Tolkien gives great vivid description and great detail.

Read this book if you are stuck on a deserted island."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this CD version of TLOTR in order to introduce the story to my wife as we went on a road trip from Texas to Colorado a few years ago.Although both this and The Hobbit were true to the original story, the dramatization (apparently done by the BBC) was poor and lacked emotion. The audio value is bad, with volume problems. The music was at best loud, at worse bothersome.Still, we listened to it, and my wife was introduced to two classics of literature.(this review is for the boxed, CD recording of the books)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This whole series of JRR is a must for everyone.

Also for people who actually do not often read books because they do not find the right ones, it has elements that can be enjoyed by everyone."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a young halfing and nephew of Bilbo Baggins (The Hobbit), and his journey with many friends to dispose of the last ring of three to forever doom the hopes of the &quot;Dark One&quot; to rule the world. It is an amazing tale of wizards, trolls, goblins, orcs, ents, dwarves, elves, and many other creatures, most of which originated in the mind of Tolkien himself.Almost every adventure novel to date has some idea, usually in the storyline itself, that has derived from Tolkien's classic. The impact of this story on the fiction world of literature is incomprehensable. Critics and authors alike constantly find themselves comparing the best works of the past century to The Lord of the Rings.When I first sat down to read The Lord of the Rings, I couldn't imagine that it would become a book that I would never want to give up. I would usually read for hours upon end, as the thought of the next part of the adventure nagged at my imagination. One cannot help but feel a great sense of adventure when reading about Gandalf's wizardy, Frodo's magical ring, or a war involving ents (friendly tree-like monsters) and orcs.If you want to be able to judge books carefully, you MUST read this book first. It will give anyone great insight as to exactly what is a &quot;good&quot; novel. I also suggest you buy the &quot;One Volume Edition&quot; as opposed to the individual novels in the trilogy. Tolkien himself meant the story to be read in one novel!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These are some of the greatest books that I have ever read. Not only does Tolkien demonstrate one of the greatest fantasy, action-adventure stories ever told, but he has created a whole new world filled with interesting characters and creatures. He has opened the doors for tons of new ideas and stories to form. This book is awesome and just about anyone can enjoy it. Even if you look down on current day fantasies, thinking them lame and repetitive. It keeps you reading all the way through. Even though the beginning starts out slow, don't put the book down because it gets a whole lot better once the journey starts. Few books ever really get to me but this one's ending made me cry because I was so happy and sad at the same time. If you have read the hobbit you have to read this! I feel that it is a lot better than the hobbit so if you liked that you'll love this. I just regret that Tolkien wasn't able to write more about his fantastic world. I can't wait until the movies come out!!!!(also, if you have seen those cartoon adaptations, don't let them stop you from reading the book. Those are kind of corny.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Hallo dilligent readers,I am a girl from a Eastern Europe, Latvia, and not quite aware of what Tolkien is. I mean, I have read Hobbit, that's the only of his books that has been translated in my language, but English books are unfortunately hardly available here. I could, of course, have them through Internet but there's a problem that my student's scholarship does not quite coincide with the normal Western prices. ( If somebody's interested, the scholarship for excellent marks is around 15 dollars a month - is it not ridiculous?). That's why I am writing this review hoping to find a friendly readerly heart. Is there anybody out there who has has got a spare copy of Tolkien' s works that he/she could share? It can be old and suffered, of course. I only want to read The Lord of the Rings desperately. If there's a kind soul that thinks of a possibility to help me, my email address isbrr81@hotmail.comI would really be most thankful, indeed, for any kind of interest in my plea.

This book was a delightful read which is masterfully woven and told. So Many great events and emotions, LOVE, HATE, DESIRE, ENVY, DESPAIR. this tale brings the reader in and makes him a companion of the companions. The lord of the rings allows you, the reader, to experience the emotions and dreams of the charachters and forbids any one person from putting it down. I read this book without interuption (other books) and am so moved, that i would like to read again from the beginning. this is a classic of its genre and definitely a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of The Rings is by far the most extensive, complex, and rewarding book I have ever read. It has all the qualities which make it a great story: characters, plot, dialogue...It is also prophetic, poetic, romantic...I started reading it a little over a year ago and I'm abou to finish it. To say that I liked it wouldn't do justice to the work. It has been such an envolving ride, I mean I felt captivated by the world of Middle-Earth and everything in it. There are not enough words to describe the feeling that one gets while reading this book. I hope everyone that reads it enjoys it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have just listened to part of this in my friend's car and I am disgusted. Not only is it the worst written abridged book I have ever heard, they have terrible sound effects in the background. It is also very irresponsible of them to let the actors pronounce at least 80 percent of the names wrong, they said Sauron as if it were spelled Suron. They said Gimli son of Glo-in instead of Gloin and the list goes on forever. Annoying voices were given to all of the hobbits, especially Sam. I recommend the BBC version or the unabridged version to listen to...Reading the books works too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Very disappointed with the print quality of this book. My copy at least, looks like a poor photo copy. The book is readable but not of the quality one might reasonably expect from a major publisher."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These books can be somewhat difficult to read... there are many names for the same people and places (elvish name, hobbit name, dwarf name, you get the idea) and the names are sometimes not easily pronounced. BUT, if you push through, it is COMPLETELY worth it. You can get used to flying by names (without missing anything because most of the time he writes &quot;and the elvish name is&quot;...).The world Tolkien creates is absolutely amazing. You absolutely get a feel for this world and can put yourself there. If you have not seen the movies (unlikely but possible right?!), I would HIGHLY suggest reading these first. There are so many things you miss in the movie. A quick example is when Gollum/Smeagol is writhing around because of the rope that has him restrained. That is because it is an Elvish rope and it burns his skin (there was a lot of good dialog left out there).As we know, the book is 99.9% of the time better than the movie and these books are no exception (this should say a great deal given how awesome the movies are!). I found that it was a ton of fun to see the story come to life on the screen and it enhanced the already exciting story I had read.If you have already seen the first two movies, you don't have to wait to find out what happens! Although, in the second movie they left out some of the action that happens in the second book. In the movie, Gollum (Smeagol) says something like &quot;she will take care of them&quot;. In the book, you aren't told this but, in any case, what he is referring to happens in book two. I would suggest starting with when Frodo and Sam leave Faramir (I believe that would have you starting with the last three chapters of book two)...that is, of course, only if you don't want to read the entire thing!Last thing...it took me a while to push through the first 100 to 150 pages. I was told that I really should have read The Hobbit first and it would have been faster and I would have already known and liked the characters. I never went back but it was suggested to me by several people...ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First, this comment is about the edition not \\"the book\\" which I am a fateful fan.The edition as a cover and as a set is ok but When you open the books you see that paper isn't quite white and the letter are not very clear. I'd have liked a different fonts'choice. I am not saying that the edition is bad, not at all, It's just not good enough for a book you pretend to have in your personal library for many years.I hope this warning can help you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Rather than reviewing Lord of the Rings, which has been done many times by many people with a finer grasp of describing the wonder of the best book of the twentieth century than I, I shall remain content to say that this boxed set is neatly presented with Alan Lee's fine artwork on the outside. Many readers will find copies of Tolkien get rapidly dog-eared from frequent use so to have a box set that can be kept in a prominent place on the shelf is nice. It is also well-priced for its new design."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Please do NOT buy this version! It is horrible. For example, listening to Gandalf and Sauruman speak to each other in this version is like listening to two old geezers exchange pointless barbs in a nursing home for demented patients. Part of the reason it is so bad is also that the BBC version with Ian Holm is FANTASTIC. I still remember listening to the BBC version as a child and how it transported me to another realm. It took me years to find the BBC version to buy -- I finally bought it in England years ago. Now that you can buy the BBC production at Amazon instead of the Mind's Eye version, do yourself a favor and buy it instead of spending money on Mind's Eye. You will appreciate the difference. Trust me."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These books are an (aging) classic. Regarding the hardcover boxed edition: A very pleasing form. By splitting each text into a couple of small, identical hardcovers, totalling 6 volumes (plus 1 appendix), the series is presented in an easy to read and aesthetically pleasing manner. No goofy fantasy art, each text a manageable 200 pages or so, and very strong cover art. I'd not read the books in many years, but found this edition irrisistible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read this book at least 4 times. I really like books with magic and mystery. This book also has friendship and shows what people can do when they come together. In this story there is a lot of jumping around from one place and time to what's happing some were else at the same time. There are also a lot of strange words, and for all of you who have read the hobbit this story is much more organized. The hobbit seems all most childish compared to this. I think this is a really GOOD BOOK and you should read the whole series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I gave this book 3 stars because I am undecided on its quality. The story is undeniably fantastic, but Scott Truesdell's review of the October 1988 edition worries me. I have seen this set in my school library, and I was quite satisfied with it. The binding did not strike me as faulty, and the artistry on the cover was quite satisfying. True, the map is awkward to unfold, but anyone with enough patience and reverence will manage just fine. I have experience with just this situation, for the map in my collector's edition has the same problem, and though it did rip a little, I can open the map as often as I need. About the ink splattered throughout, I can only hope that Mr. Truesdell was unlucky in his particular case. I plan to buy this particular edition, and I thank Mr. Truesdell for his warning, but I hope that it will not deter everyone from buying what I expect to be a good purchase. I, for one, am heading back to the library to check the points that he despised, possibly saving myself the disappointment he experienced. I will write again when I form a conclusion.**Update: I bought 'em and like 'em. Especially since they're more portable than the collecter's edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These books captured my imagination like no other books ever have. Tolkien's vision is astounding. His ability to use words to paint such an enormous and vivid picture is without equal. I cannot get enough of Middle Earth. Although these are fantasy novels, everything is so real. There is no way I can do justice to Tolkien's masterpeice with these few words. Middle Earth is a place where childhood dreams, nightmares, and fantasies all come true in bright, vivid colors."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien experienced the effects of war and the people (soldiers) involved with war firsthand. He took what he observed and combined it with a fantasy, if you will, to create a truly exceptional piece of literature. It's a story of a peoplelacking the knowledge of war, death, and mistrust(like you and I) and of whom, with forces and events beyond their control, instantly become the center of war and all of its atrocities. These people learn to adapt to harsh, unkown perils, to overcome fear, and to find trust and loyalty among new friends/creatures. But most of all, these people learn to carry on and fulfill their mission regardless of the costs to oneself or the obvious doom that awaits. And that is why you should read it. P.S. If an unanimated motion picture is to be made of this epic, then I would be glad to share some ideas of its making."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is simply the best piece of fantasy literature ever written.

Notice, there are no &quot;grey&quot; cats in the reviews. Love it or leave it. Tolkien's works cannot be skimmed. They require concentration and, if you will,participation! Get with it, get into it! Fear and fight! It will take you and teach you and entertain and absorb you! You'll dread it's end because there are no more! If getting absorbed to the point of distraction is a problem, read something else!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are 300 some-odd other reviews detaling the plot of the story already, so I'll keep this short.If I had the choice of staying here on the Earth of today or venturing into Tolkien's Middle-earth, I'd take Tolkien's vision in a heartbeat. Call it escapism at it's finest. If you want to share a story and perhaps some pipeweed with the hobbits, sing and run through the forests with the elves, delve underneath mountains with the dwarves, and, of course, tag along with the greatest wizard of them all, Gandalf, this is the world waiting for you when you open the cover.Walk through the green grass of the Shire, stare up at a starry sky at Elrond's, climb over the Misty Mountains(don't forget to bring a coat), ride down the River Anduin and visit the lady Galadriel in Lothlorien. Marvel at the horse's ridden by the people of Rohan, visit the grand city of Minas Tirith..ah well, yes..getting a tad carried away here, but you get the idea I'm sure..so..Come on in and live the adventure of a lifetime, you won't be sorry you did...."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just finished reading The Lord of the Rings again. Simply wonderful. This is an amazing piece of literature that I would hope everyone who can read, will read. The prose and structure of this work are absolutely solid. Professor Tolkien was a very skilled author technically. Yet there is so much more here than technical perfection. There is the amazing world that he builds for us with his words. The attention which is payed to the landscape is awe inspiring. He truly envisions for us a real three dimensional continent through his writing. The characters he introduces us to are just as solid and true. From the quiet and philosophical Frodo and the faithful and down to earth Samwise to the twisted and pitiful Gollum these characters ring true. The story is epic and it never falters once as it winds it's way along the paths of middle earth. What impressed me the most during this reading was the incredible depth that Tolkien instilled in all of his creations. Whether it was a wandering king biding his time to claim his throne, a lush forest of gold and light, or song that told of a beautiful and bitter romance, it was solidly constructed and set into place in the story. There is never a time in the tale that we are asked to simply accept anything suddenly that is thrust on us, there are no plot loopholes. At the core of this epic tale is a very tough and important message. Don't become enslaved by your comforts and your power this story says. Don't hold so tightly to a thing that gives you joy that you kill the object, the joy and yourself. Most cling to the past and the memory of a pleasure that once was, but lives no more, out of fear of stepping into the next moment where that joy may or may not exist. &quot;The road goes ever on,&quot; sing Bilbo and Frodo. And so must we all if we are truly to live. Please take the time to read this book. It will enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I LOVE this book! The recording is great... I've borrowed it from the local library more times than I can count, and I listen to it while on my paper route.

Unlike most books which are read by one person, Brian Sibley has gathered a large cast of players to bring this story to life.

At the time I found it to be a grand, inspiring tale of fantasy. Ten years and five reads later my opinion has not changed, but become perhaps just a little more sophistocated.About every other summer I pick up the four battered paperbacks and allow myself the luxury of escape for a few hours a night. I don't worry about the stock market, race relations or nuclear holocost. I don't search the pages of Tolkien for answers to today's pressing social problems. I find nothing wrong with shelving my individual political agenda when enjoying this masterpiece, and I pitty those of you who can't. I simply indulge myself in the art of storytelling at its best. But when I wake up in the morning I find that I am better able to face the &quot;real-world&quot; than had I spent the time attentively absorbing the latest on CNN. If you think fantasy is just for kids, then I say &quot;Grow Up!&quot;And for those people who tire of the book's length, I suppose you wish Ahab would just catch the damn whale, and Tolstoy's Napleon would just leave the Russians alone. Do you think that there would be so many glowing 5 star ratings here had Tolkien written a 200 page Cliff Notes version of The Lord of the Rings?I just wanted to stand up and say something for all of the people who never wanted a book to end."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's really nice having all The Lord of Ring novels all in one place.

Over all the tale itself is a delight to follow along with, but as expected, the sound effects are less than amiable with it being recorded in the 90s. When Gandolf uses his staff, or shows himself as Gandolf the White, I thought my ears were going to start gushing red, for I had to have it louder in volume because of the voices being at different ranges all the time. Other than not really knowing who is talking, I am able to follow along, but only because I have watched it's Epic sister, a Peter Jackson creation of TLOTR.

But I have to admit, too much of Tolkien can be a bad thing. If you have a map of the shire or the leniage of Islidur hung up on your wall, get a life. If you're looking for a classic, read this book. Unlike most fantasy writers, tolkien has real characters. He has made an epic. Where you can tell between good and evil. Where the good are few, and Evil is numerous, but somehow the good wins and you get a hell of a story along the way. You don't have to enjoy fantasy to like this book.

Various booik formats are even listed below the title of the item on its page. I never understood why this was so, as the item is clearly shown to be the Trilogy Gift set of the LOTR and an audio cassette narrated by Rob Inglis.When I did find someone who reviewed this item itself and not these other things, and when I found someone who commented upon Mr. Inglis' narration, I decided to check it out with the seller to make sure I was getting tapes and Inglis. I did. And the box set was NEW and still in shrink wrap! And the cost was nominal. That's because I am using an old technology. Tape cassettes are OLD! It's all CDs now or whatever other thing they've come up with. So being OLD it was cheap. What a deal!Anyway, I am now happily listening to my cassettes in my car where I play all my books on tape. It sure makes driving more bearable. And Rob Inglis is indeed good. Excellent production values as you would expect from Recorded Books LLC. You ought to hear Mr. Inglis read Galadriel's song, which is written in Quenya!Ai! laurie lantar lassi surinen,Yeni unotime ve rdmar aldaron!Yeni ve linte yuldar avdniermi oromardi lisse-miruvoreva...Wow! He also sings when there are songs by others (Sam, Bilbo et al).So, I am pleased with this item.

There are a great deal of reviews so I'll add just two things.First of all, the ending of the trilogy. Even nowadays, I hardly ever find a fantasy work that describes what happened to the heros AFTER the tale was over, after the heroics and saving the earth, etc. Lord of the Rings shows what happens when the Hobbits return to the Shire and have to fight to free it.The single thing I didn't like was the trip through Mordor, not because it was a dark section but because precious (notice the pun ...) little happened.All in all, a true classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I would have to say that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best story (besides the Bible) that's ever been written.

Its fantasy speaks of a bolder realm of the world, with people high and noble, small but courageous Hobbits, and others misshapen and enslaved by ill will - the Orcs of Mordor. Some may disavow its characters or its escapism, but for me this work really is definitive of the best in fantasy, and has made a lasting contribution to the literary and mythic understanding of ourselves. There is only one Tolkien to rule them all, so to speak, and many petty imitators. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" certainly will remain a benchmark achievement, inspiring readers of all ages, and challenging writers of all kinds to match this great labor of life."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a reread.

One Hobbit in particular, Frodo Baggins, is faced with a dangerous task.

The genius who wrote these books was so thorough that he even made a whole alphabet and language with vividly descriptive maps to describe all the creatures and areas of Middle Earth. This trilogy is so great in description that it will change how you judge other epic series such as the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". If you think that you might not be ready to read a long trilogy such as this, I would recommend another one of J.R.R Tolkien's books - The Hobbit, another book about a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is Frodo's uncle.This story starts out in the Shire, a small part of Middle Earth where lazy, fat hobbits live and love to eat work and sleep. They also love parties. Hobbits' regularly eat 2 breakfasts, one brunch, three lunches, dinner, and finally, supper. Two of the main characters are Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee who are both Hobbits from the Shire.In early Middle Earth, Saroun the Dark Lord made 19 rings. Three for the elves, six for the dwarves, nine for men, and one to bind them together. Saroun gave away all of the rings except for the final one. When the creatures of Middle Earth saw the power that Saroun had, they came together to destroy him, but when they finally defeated Saroun the greedy men kept the Ring instead of destroying the Ring by throwing it into Mordor. The temptation of the ring was too much and they never fully destroyed Saroun. On the way home however, the men with the Ring were ambushed by the remaining orcs and the man holding the Ring jumped into a nearby lake and put on the ring, which gives you the power to become invisible. As he was swimming, the ring fell off and he was visible again and the orcs shot him with arrows and killed him and the ring was lost in the water.A few generations later the Ring was found by two Hobbits, one known by the name of Golom or Smeagol. Smeagol and his friend fought over the Ring until Smeagol finally strangled his friend and takes the ring for himself. Then Smeagol has the Ring taken away from him in a dark troll cave by a clever Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is on an journey (which is very unlike Hobbits) with the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo brings the Ring back to the Shire and passes it down to Frodo.When the great wizard Gandalf sees that Frodo Baggins has the Ring of power he gives him a mission to travel with a small band of heroes, including himself, to Mt.Mordor so they can destroy the Ring (and Saroun) once and for all. These heroes go through the forests of the fine elves, the mines of the hard working dwarves, and the great palaces of men to get to Mordor before Saroun destroys them all. In the many battles that follow, it is back and forth with good vs. evil. While the good warriors fight Saroun and his army, Frodo and his helper, Sam Gamgee, travel with their guide Smeagol to Mt.Mordor. During the journey to Mordor, Smeagol is planning to reclaim his ring by killing the Hobbits.The problem is that the ring Frodo carries is very powerful and tempting to anyone that gets near it. This was a big problem because the creatures that are most tempted by the ring are the ones that have power but still want more . The problem is only solved at the end when Frodo finally throws the ring into the flames of Mount Mordor and both the ring and Saroun are destroyed.Another problem before the ring was destroy was Saroun's army. To overcome this difficulty all the good creatures of Middle Earth came together and fight in many battles until the final one when the men, elves, dwarves, eagles, and ents destroyed all of the orcs.I would give these books a 10 out of 10 ratting especially for the 3rd book, The Return of the King, my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Purchased for Hubby for gift.

To me, making that connection between the story and the physical book makes the experience all the more real in your mind. Plus the binding in this Leather edition seems much more durable than the Leatherette Collectors edition; the binding dose not want to bend when opened in the middle and the book will lay flat.

It is a perfect gift fo any Lord of the Rings fan."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was a gift; but I was told it was in good condition. It arrived in a timely manner. No complaints, good service."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This collection contains the most famous work of J.R.R. Tolkien -- The Lord of the Rings. When we read through the pages of these books, we discover a living world of wonder. We follow the fate of the Ring of Power, filled with evil, and one which could lead to the rule of darkness if it ever returns to its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. Now some few people who really think they are so 'intellectually superior', or 'have more demanding taste', or whatever title of arrogance they try to give themselves, often dismiss this fascinating myth as 'children's stories', and that if one was to read a real novel, they would never return to such 'rubbish'. Well, I pity them, for they (like the Cynic in Hawthorne's 'The Great Carbuncle')must look at everything through dark spectacles, not allowing themselves to experience the beauty of this tale. Their preferences are theirs, and I am glad there is variety in this world. But when they mock those of different taste, it often displays their own ignorance. The Lord of the Rings is not just a story of magic and imaginary creatures. It is a tale of good and evil, and not just a 'Guy in White vs. Guy in Black' kind of story. It shows the subtlety of evil, how it can worm its way into even the hearts of the most honest person. It shows how good can strengthen a person, and how love can allow one to bear a multitude of burdens. I have read many novels (A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Lord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition),The Scarlet Letter, andOn His Ownbeing some of the finer examples), and although good ones are compelling, none that I have read would make me turn away from Middle-Earth. It is not just a 'children's story' (though most children enjoy it), but an enthralling study in the nature of mankind, and the forces that shape him.Now, on to this particular presentation of these books! This boxed set by Houghton Mifflin is very nice. The design (with its beautiful cover illustrations by Alan Lee) and the layout of the books is fitting, and the size is convenient, and yet conveys a sense of expansiveness. This all adds to the experience of the legend, and I am grateful that such a fine edition has been released.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The first time I read LOR I marvelled at the wonderful creations of all the characters in the story. How is it possible to create flocks of characters and every single one has an individual personality and no two are alike. The landscapes come alive in the readers mind as he journeys along with the travellers. But mostly I fell inlove with the way Tolkien awakes feelings of joy and sorrow as the long trip gets further on. I have no words to describe this to anyone. All I can say is: You won't know what I'm talking about until you read these books, and remember to read the Hobbit before you start on LOR, if possible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This may well be one of the best books ever written. Some people may like to think that Gone with the Wind(GwtW) is on par with this, but I would have to differ, GwtW may be an increible love story but in my mind it doesn't compare. Medival fantasy is not drivel as some people would like you to believe. It is the more opened mind people out there. You don't have to like Dungeons &amp; Dragons to like this book.

If you've already read this book many times and want to own an edition that does justice to your love of Middle Earth, get this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"_The Lord of the Rings_ is the most popular work of fiction of the 20th century with millions of devoted fans the world over. The book was inspired by Tolkien's personal ultra-conservative Catholic faith and his study of Nordic myths and languages. One of Tolkien's favorites was of course Beowulf. There is little modernity in LOTR, and the Hobbits who live simply off the land in their small pastoral countryside are given the center stage. The great wizards, wise elves, and warriors don't accomplish the task of destroying the Ring of Doom, they instead play a supporting role--the ultimate cause of victory remains an unknown force that plays its hand in the courses of the world, aiding individual effort. Tolkien borrowed something from the ancient Atlantis and Golden Age myths in the plot of his story. The men of \\"Numenor\\" were a semi-divine race that came from the West across the sea and set up kingdoms where they ruled over men of lesser stock. Eventually they declined after their will to life had been sapped from internal decay, stagnation, and violent conquests from outside demonic forces. _Lord of the Rings_ is the story of their recovery and regaining of the their lost king, who reunites their kindoms and establishes his rule on Middle Earth after the Dark Lord is vanquished. The political outlook of the book is similar to the feudalistic Middle Ages and Sparta rather from modern day liberalism, democracy, fascism, communism or other forms of rule \\"by the masses.\\" The rulers have a higher-than-human origin, but at the same time they are not despots or pillagers. Evil is portrayed as the total corruption of what is natural and free-flowing, such as the destruction of forests, industrialized machinery, agricultural decline, and mindless bloodthirsty soldiers who fight among themselves but obey their demonic masters' every whim. The book concludes, not with the destrution of the Ring, but with the Hobbits' fight to liberate their homeland, which had run itself well independently until one Hobbit began trading with the evil wizard Saruman and the Shire was taken over by gangs of thugs. The book is almost an unconscious indictment of what government control, greedy capitalism and communism alike has done to the planet over the past 200 years: cultural decline, rootlessness, and environmental degradation. Possibly the reason this book has been so popular is because LOTR portrays an idealistic world with settings and characters so radically different in their lives and worldviews from our own. The protagonists are not self-serving hedonists rebelling for no reason, but rather individuals who are concerned with maintaining their traditions, old ways of life, and are in touch with a transcendant mission above and beyond themselves."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you love this epic story and love the smell and feel of leather bound books this is perfect for your personal library"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, the script and map and paper are just astounding, to say nothing of the binding.

I was one of those people and I am eating my words.I work in a bookstore and it seemed everyone had read LOTR but me. Finally, I gave in and read it, admittedly after seeing the first movie. I can say that I have never been more drawn in or got more enjoyment from anything I have ever read. Tolkien has created an entire world, complete with landscapes, maps, languages and races all from his imagination. But the morality and heart of this book is the true gift. The characters are so believable and trust me, you will find yourself cheering for the fellowship every step of the way. As far as the \\"bad guys\\" go, you will be afraid.No matter what I say, I can never do this book justice. I will be reading it again and again.

Sure it 1137 pages long, slightly heavier than most paperbacks and requires its own specialized set of appendices to fully understand what is going on, but that's what makes it great! Actually, as paperbacks go this edition is well thought out. The best feature is, of course, that all the six books plus appendices are present under one cover. Many readers have been led to believe that The Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, when in actuality it is not. The type chosen for this edition is easy on the eyes, which is good considering the size of the volume. Another great feature is the appendices, which include family trees, calendars, pronunciation guides, plus indexes to songs and verses, persons, beasts and monsters, places and things.

He was the first writer to make me want to go back and read his previous work, and then read it over and over again. I will read every published book with his name on it and will forever be humbled by This writers greatness. He made me want to write. After these books, you will never look at any Sci-Fi again without thinking, &quot;Is it worth reading it, after THAT?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love one volume editions of series, and this did not dissapoint. Very well made and I love the type setting and font chosen for this particular book. The appendices maps, charts, etc have super clear printing, and honestly I like not having the old fold out maps.

This should be required reading for every student. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the Kindle version of the novel. It uses the page number location as well as the locator number (less useful). It has the usual table of contents to go to when you've either lost your place or want to skip chapters you're not interested in.The novel itself is very well written and is worth reading again, especially if the last time you read it was in high school, or you've seen the movies and need to review some of the passages you feel the movie(s) missed or glossed over.

They are right up there with the best books ever written, and contain every element of good and evil struggle we all have to face, and teaches you that &#34;good&#34;doesn't always win. However it also contains details of friendships forged, and what one friend will do for another in their hour of need. Tolkien draws you into a fantasy world, and soon you forget the fantasy part, and find yourself so immersed it, it is as if Middle Earth was a real place, and all it's subjects become like real people in your mind.

It does have it's flaws though.1. It does not offer maps or any drawings. I have searched online for some, but only find blurry copies. Considering the maps and drawings are held so highly in admiration... it kinda sucks not to have them2. the acting of the narrator is not the greatest. There were parts when the book notes \\"he yells\\" and the narrator speaks in a calm and clear character voice. It's kind of funny sometimes.3. many of the narrator's \\"attempted\\" character voices sound alike. All the elf kind sound the same, even the women sound like males. All the hobbits pretty much sound the same, except Sam who has this manly deep voice, which often sounds like Aragon. Often the narrator accidentally mergers one character voice into another by accident. So a hobbit will be speaking then all the sudden he sounds like Aragon or Gandolf.But outside of that the audio book is great. These \\"problems\\" are small. Since the un-abridged reading offers the names of who is talking and their emotions that go along with it, you can make out the story just fine. It just takes a little more imagination and you can alter their voices in your head to sound like what you want to hear. I would highly reccomend it, that is until someone figures out they can get a better actor or has the mind to hire multiple actors to fulfill the part.There is nothing funnier than hearing a deep manly voice trying to immitate a woman singing"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"i love the LOTR trilogy, it stands as one of my favorite books. even the movies are great capturing every single detail of Mr. Tolkeins books. the story is about Frodo Baggins who sets out o a quest to destroy the evil and hated one ring forged by the dark lord Sauron. along the way people join him on his quest and form the fellowship of the ring. then in the second book the fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam continue on to Mt.

The books are very different from the movie, which I do not appreciate. Very early on there are some glaring re-wrties that have taken place. While this Tolkien is an exceptional writer, I don't know where he gets off taking liberties with the Jackson Trilogy. It would have been just fine to add more detail to the already amazing story.

The storyline was fantastic, but Tolkien is just not my style of writer. Raymond E Feist, I beleive, has accomplished much more in his books of the riftwar saga. He might not be as highly credited as Tolkien, but i believe that his writing style is more mature. Tolkien seems to write as if addressing people that wont understand real fantastical writing.

(Some chapters intend to make reader feel dreadful, but in my opinion, they failed to do that)However, these are problems: It's not and adventure with much events, tricky problem, hate, fear, love, this is only about the scene and some abnormal behave of characters (the elves, wizards, etc.). Beside, it's hardly to feel any war during reading the book, where the battles are only described in some chapter, 4-5 chaps or so, during that, just long talk, scenery (again), and long-term events (it take months or years for a main event in the book) so in the end of reading this book, I though: \\"Well, the world seemed not to be in dangerous issue, right?\\".Finishing reading the book, I feel I like the movies more, far more than the book, with more modern event, sentences and the way they solve problems.

It is a timeless tale, not bound by genre's and labels, set in a world as vast and rich and real as any created in literature - ever. Modern fantasy writers such as Brooks and Eddings and Jordan seem to think that all they need to do is draw a map, populate it with some innocent soon-to-be &quot;heroes,&quot; and make up an evil &quot;dark lord&quot; and the rest will follow suit. 'Tis not the case, and the passing of the years will tell the tale of what was the great and what was not.The Lord of the Rings is recomended for *anybody* who adores an epic tale as timeless as the very act of storytelling.

Then, again, when I was in eighth grade, I read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; because I was told we had to read a novel for reading class. This time I liked it even beter. No, let me rephrase that, I loved it. Then, I read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the first time. I loved this book even more. It is the epic story of a world facing damnation, when, everyone comes together and rises up against their opposing force. Tolkien paints pictures and creates emotions that make the book feel real.

When it came my turn, however, I didn't progress beyond the first few paragraphs, finding it incredibly boring in comparison to what else I was reading.Many years later, and via books by C J Cherryh, and Fritz Leiber, I again took up The Lord of the Rings, (after reading The Hobbit of course) finding it to be a great read after all. For a book of this type, finished in 1949, it was remarkably consistent in content and style to any of the more recent fantasy offerings - not at all stuffy in its language, or dated in its ideas, which due to their quantity and scope seem to appear time and time again in others' work. With the advantage of hindsight, and readers' correspondence, J. R. R. Tolkien, comments - in the book's foreword - \`it is too short.' And to some extent this is true; the last section in comparison to what went before being somewhat rushed. It seems to me that if less time had been given to Tom Bombadil, some of the Rivendell sections, and the songs and poems had been pruned a little, there would have been ample space within the current number of pages to allow a more elaborated end- section. As it stands, there is zip regarding Sauron, and the Dark Tower in anything like the detail given to everyone and everywhere else. Maybe I missed it. Anyway, a great book, well worth reading. Those who have read The Lord of the Rings should find C J Cherryh's: Fortress..., and Fritz Leiber's: Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, books of great interest."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R.Tolkien, king of all fatasies thank you for this awesome book.

For those reasons, LORD OF THE RINGS is awarded 3 stars.But...There are two things about this trilogy which drive me insane, and I am wondering if I am the only one. First, Tolkein is so long-winded, spending pages (literally!) describing scenery, which is interesting to a point, quickly bores me as being unnecessary. Teachers in every writing class have told me to cut to the chase, not to be too long-winded; so why is Tolkein never criticized for his lack of an editor?Secondly, and far more importantly, is the underlying racism that pervades this trilogy. I hate to say this about a book so venerated to my favorite genre, but the racism of Tolkein set the tone for the next 50+ years in terms of the racism that was (and still is) so prevalent in the fantasy genre. His descriptions of orcs resembles 13th-century descriptions of Mongols, giving them no redeeming factors at all. I realize that the 1950s weren't the most politically correct times, but Tolkein was an academic, and I feel he has a responsibility to fight this sort of mindless drivel. He was a professor at Oxford, so he likely understood what he was writing, and that makes what he wrote all the more galling. This racism in my eyes almost negates all the positives of this trilogy, but I am a fair person and give it some credit.Reccommended, but understand what you are reading."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just thought that this trilogy overly comsumed by words. it was a novel that could have been about three-hundred pages shorter in mimd.

I guess that fanasy isn't my thing, although I do get into it, I just like more the ainti- hero Novels more.

Very happy with item."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was first exposed to the wonderful world of Middle_Earth largely at the insistance of my fourth-grade teacher. She had both the American radiodramas of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings available for anyone to check out. Perhaps because I was only ten at the time, I enjoyed the acting and sound effects, which I must say were done better in the Hobbit than in the Lord of the Rings. This program was released a year or so before I was born, in 1979 if I remember right, and so it's understandable that they wouldn't be able to do as much with the story as they probably could nowadays.First I'll start with the things I liked about it. The soundtrack for this paticular dramatization is composed of classical pieces that, though not specifically written for the program, fit in quite well, at least as far as I'm concerned. For peaceful moments inth estory you get pieceful music, then for the battles the music becomes more tense.The cast is something of a mixed bag. I like them, but I've always felt that each actor had too many parts to work with, so several characters ended up sounding the same. I didn't know Gimley and Gloin were exactly the same person. Voiced by the same actor (Gail Chugg, the narrator), it would be easy to confuse them if Gloin had featured more prominently in Lord of the Rings. Also, the same actor who portrays Frodo also portrays Saruman.One thing I didn't like nearly as much about this adaptation are the sound effects. While most of them are extremely realistic, horses' hooves, crackling fires, rushing streams and the like, the sword fight sounds weren't quite as good. And, as another reviewer mentions, the bizarre laser effects when Gandalf uses his magic tend to put one more in mind of a Sci-Fi drama like War of the Worlds than a fantasy.Despite its flaws however, I'll always have a soft spot for both these Mind's Eye dramas, probably because they were my first real exposure to Tolkien's world. In fact if I hadn't misplaced them I would probably still dig them out and listen to them fairly often. The two stars are mainly subtracted for the rather scarce cast and some of the SFX. One thing I did really like were the wooden boxes that both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings came in. Even a blind person like myself could feel the cool designs, probably writing, that were engraved into the wood. So while i'll admit that neither this program nor The Hobbit are as high quality as they could have been, I still enjoyed them enough to own them. I may have to reorder them at some point. Maybe when I have children and I decide to introduce them to the world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love it.

So I pushed on through it, because even though I wasn't quite used to the wordy style of Tolkien, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I couldn't have made a better choice.The Fellowship of the Ring took me about two weeks, which makes me blush with shame to think about now that I can read it in about two days (if I am left relatively uninterrupted). Of course, I had foolishly not thought to grab copies of The Two Towers and The Return of the King at the same time, so I found myself making another trip to the library as soon as I could. A little put off by the cover illustration of Shelob - a giant spider - on the cover of The Two Towers, I was nevertheless determined to conquer my arachnophobia in the interest of the story. That one only took me one week or so, and then I promptly continued to The Return of the King. The last installment of the trilogy has always been my favorite, ever since that first read, and it was after I finished it that I fell in love with the story. Then I saw the Extended Editions of the films with the same friend who'd recommended the book to me and fell even more deeply in love, if that was possible. Now I, who had to ask my fellow Tolkienite what \\"FOTR\\" stood for, probably know more about the world of Middle-earth than she does.

I was in doubt to whether buy three books seperately or go for one volume edition. But as Tolkien had originally thought of a one volume book I cudn't astray the feeling.I recommend every tolkien fan to save a little for this prize possession."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"LOTR [Lord of the Rings] has been rated for decades, by readers of the English language, as one of the best classic works of all time -- especially as a fantasy saga written in the early twentieth century. Readers in other languages seem to much appreciate this central master-work of J. R. R. Tolkien as well. To this reader it seems fun, rich, vivid, and very deep.LOTR has most of the basic elements of a classic fantasy saga -- glorious characters, plots, dramas, settings, imagery, prose, poetry, and mystery. The LOTR saga seems to be a finely inter-woven tapestry of core Western cultural themes. Some of these are the interplay of Celto-Nordic, Greco-Roman, and Judeo-Christian aspects -- inspired, as well, by the Kalevala of the Finns and its language. However, LOTR seems to transcend even these sources to become a world classic.LOTR, and associated works, such as the Silmarillion, has greatly inspired the the creators and creation of various fantasy sagas, games, and movies. The recent movie rendition of LOTR, by Peter Jackson and many helpers, is a wonderful example of Tolkien deeply inspiring creativity. The Medieval aspects, such as armor, arms, and action, are well done -- which may honor Tolkien very well.Tolkien had wished for a quality edition of his \\"trilogy\\" as one saga in one book. This specific edition of the LOTR \\"trilogy\\" seems to go far in meeting this desire. My particular copy is a fine one indeed -- sturdy lovely leather-skinned book-case and book-cover, good semi-classic binding, semi-matte gilded pagination, sharp and clear font, classic place-marker ribbon, and a good choice of maps, pictures, and appendices +++"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book and the ones after it take the reader where he has never been before. The plot is relentless; if only it were endless. The characterization is expertly developed throughout the trilogy. Primarily, though, the way Tolkien illustrates what True power, wisdom, and bravery are - in light of the characters' weaknesses - give the reader a new understanding of the struggles that man faces every day as he strives to serve God while facing his own inadequacies and limitations."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Frodo tries to destroy Sauron's magical ring to destroy him"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Seldom does a extraordinary work of such magnatude come along, perhaps once or twice in a century. Filled with wonderous marvils and a keen insight that, at times, will alternately make you weep with tears of sorrow and joy, Tolkien has created something special. Long after you have turned the last page and read &quot;The End.&quot;, The Lord Of The Rings will remain with you. This is a book no one ever reads just once! If this is your first time reading The Lord Of The Rings, I greatly envy you, for you are doing what I will never be able to do again.

When I finished reading it I told myself : &quot; Oh no! &quot;It prooves one thing, the book is excellent. Beleive my words: you will never find a book as perfect as this one. The world J.R.R.

When you start reading, you just can't quit this fantastic world of Swords and Sorcery.That's simply the best purchase you can do!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am surprised that there are no unabridged CD versions of Lord of the Rings. Nevertheless, the content of this version is pretty good! None of the Actors that were used, seemed to be well versed on the parts they were playing. Elrond sounds sort of like a department store Santa Claus, not too impressive. Still, I have been having lots o' fun listening to the CDs while following along with 'The Atlas of Middle Earth- Karen Wynn Fonstad'. All-in-all I give it a thumbs up, but there NEEDS to be a WELL DONE version of Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"this book is really a treasure , i just finished reading it a second time and i will read it again . it is by far the best book i ever got my hands on !"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Best book I have ever read. J.R.R. Tolkien makes you feel like you are in a whole nother world. The way he talks about the characters makes you feel like you know them already. I have read lots of horror, fiction, non-fiction, adventure, action, and fantasy books, but this is still on the top of my list by far. You have not really read until you read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. You could not imagine how much sleep I lost reading it. My favorite character was Gandalf."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Personal ReflectionsThis book review pertains to the kindle edition: this edition includes \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" in one combined volume.Technically there are six books (two in each volume). Of course Peter Jackson followed each of the three books (listed above) for his film adaptation of this story.This was my second time reading this story. Actually the word \\"story\\" doesn't really do justice to it. It really deserves the title of \\"epic\\". It could be described as a modern day Homeric quest adventure story. I'm not sure I could say that it surpasses the Odyssey, but nevertheless, this work is a masterpiece of literature. It is not simply the writing style that is superb. It is also the fictional historical background of this work. Tolkien created a world from whole cloth. This is why it is such genius. While Tolkien may have used themes from other works of literature, he made this world from his imagination from scratch.What more can I really say about it? It is gritty, real, scary at times, full of hope at other times. The conclusion is exhilarating. The characters become real to us, the readers. They leap off the page in stark reality. From Frodo, Sam and Gollum to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, these characters reveal themselves to us as the story progresses. It is a delight to read about the insights of a particular character or the struggles they have. The decisions that they face require real courage. And of course they have real consequences. In their struggles, we see our own struggles, except on a much smaller scale. We are made to feel as if we ourselves would be brave enough to take the one ring and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom.The frailty of the characters makes us reflect of our own humanness. We too fail at times. We too are faced with daunting decisions that are life altering. Just as the world they live in is threatened by Sauron and Saruman, we too face our own threats. The one that most deeply affects us is our own sin. Our hearts deceive us. They make us believe that we are OK, when really we are not. Frodo knew his own frailty. Yet he also was driven by a higher sense of purpose, something transcendent. This is where the Christianity of Tolkien really shines through. God may not have a ring for us to destroy, but if we follow in the footsteps of Jesus, we will have evil that needs driving out. There will be enemies that need conquering (things like envy or greed).It is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is true. Tolkien drives this point home with the metaphor of the one ring. The ring holds a great amount of power. The story is driven by the ring. It plays on our understanding of our own human nature. The ring in the story must be kept at a distance and eventually destroyed. It always corrupts the possessor.Ultimately it was not the determination of the hero's heart that accomplished the destruction of the ring, but the providential role of Gollum. It was his greed that bit the finger off of Frodo's hand. It was providence that made his foot slip and caused him to fall to his doom. His time had come. There was a reason that Gollum was spared until the very end. I believe this providence reflects the providence of God.ConclusionMy conclusion is of course for you to read it. If you have only seen the movies, and liked them, you really owe it to yourself to read these books (or the one volume version). At least listen to them via audio book. You will find the richness of Tolkien's writing to seriously enhance your appreciation of the movies. The extended edition of the movie follows right along with every scene in the books.I would also recommend to you the background material in the appendix to the book. This will help to fill in even further the historical background to the story. Tolkien's preparation for this book really shines through here. It is the story behind the story. Before he wrote the Lord of the rings, Tolkien had to create this fantasy world from scratch. The amount of detail and realistic history belies the genius of Tolkien. You want to read good fantasy literature? This one is the standard by which others are judged. I don't imagine that it will be surpassed any time soon."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read the Hobbit and the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings 30 years ago. Thought I might enjoy it once again!! And I have!! I can get lost in the adventure. I love these books. Excellent read, very enjoyable easy reading."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This series was one of the greatest classics I've ever read, and served as a great example of how fantasy can be done right.Ever since this series was published, authors have tried to match the drama and elegance that Tolkein mastered, but few have managed to reach such heights.The first part, The Fellowship of the Ring takes us through the hobbits journey to see Elrond and how the fellowship was formed. It also introduces us to the one ring, a remnant of the past that turns out to be a powerful artifact that could allow Sauron, an ancient dark lord, to take over Middle Earth. This part was filled with excitement and had some of the best scenes I've read in any Fantasy.The second part, The Two Towers, slows the pace down and was actually the hardest of the three parts to get through. This tells us the story of the Rohan and the epic battle at Helms deep, and also the journey to Minas Tirith to help the land of Gondor defend against attack. There was a lot of information in this book, and a large amount of history, and while it was slow paced at times, I found it informative. It helped me get deeper into Tolkein's world, which really set up the third and final part.The Return of the king is a breathtaking plunge into the epic battle between Gondor and The Dark Lord, and also the end of the Journey of Frodo and the one ring. The story is wrapped up nicely, and my only real complaint was that the end material (back to the shire, the parting of frodo and gandalf, etc) felt a little bit drawn out. Still, I wasn't disappointed by it at all.Overall, I feel this is a classic tale that every fantasy lover out there should pick up and read. This is the beginning of a great many fantasy books out there, and there aren't many books that can say that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm going to make this short and sweet. It's brilliant! Do yourself a favour and read it. The movies were done well, but it didn't do the book justice. I don't think that's the fault of anyone, but the fact that the book is just so fantastically written, and the story so detailed and colourful, that a movie could never come close to portraying what Tolkien so masterfully constructed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read this book at least three other times and still love it today. Really recommend as one of the best novels of all time. I even found myself quoting Celeborn on facebook and wishing I had been around during the Bilbo for president time. My favorite character is Aragorn besides Frodo and Gandalf. I have to say I liked this better before there was a movie. I hate seeing what Hollywood thinks the characters look like. When I bought my kindle I knew the Lord of the Rings had to be on it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I purchased this edition of 'Lord of the Rings', years ago at COSTCO. I re-recorded them as mp3 files on one of my computers. I now carry them arround with me on all of my computers and on my pocket mp3 Players. I've listened to them, in their entirety, more times than I care to count. I've also fallen to sleep listing to them on my earbuds even more countless times. Often-times, I just start listening to them at any random point. They have given me many, many hours of listening pleasure. I also have the, Rob Inglis, unabridged recording of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and 'The Hobbit', but for short listening pleasure I still enjoy these abridged, full cast, recordings. Worth every penny (Dollar) that I paid for them. I've given away the originals, and I've recommended them to many of my friends. If you don't want to spend 52 hours listening to the unabridged recordings, this one is a really good substitute."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In true Amazon style, I got the book on the exact date they said it would be delivered and it was delivered in excellent condition. Kudos! The book is beautifully bound and makes turning pages as easy as it was a paperback, which was my only concern prior to purchasing. Have a special satchel to carry the book though - it's literally heavy reading :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is my second read of the trilogy, but first after the release of the movies. The book is simply brilliant, there is no other way to describe it. It is fast-paced, challengingly complex and completely rivetting. It is difficult to put down. Sets the mark for fantasy novels."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'll not comment on what is inside the book as we all know the book itself. I will only comment on the the way the book is published. Paper quality is top notch in fact one of the top quality publishing I have ever seen. Cover design and the picture is well choosen and it looks good. Everything is perfect about this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought the audio trilogy, which Amazon decribes as the complete work. Unfortunately, it is in fact an abridged dramatization about half the length of the original. As a dramatization, this American version is fair -- it uses actors to read the actual but abridged text. Even so, as far as dramatizations go, I much preferred the BBC dramatization, which does not follow the text as well but has more the feel of the later film. Moreover, you can probably find the BBC verion for free or at lower cost than this version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am a new Lord of the Rings fan, and now with the movie hoopla, im glad it is turning so many more people to these books, in this case, book. THe entire series is fabulous and I would recommend it to anyone. Especially with the movies out now, these books truly shine, but if possible read them before seeing them.I was bummed the only available edition was leather, though, but i guess theres no way around that. I suggest maybe buying a cheaper split up book, because the all in one edition may be a bit over whemlming if youve never read them before."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not a fan of science fiction. Nor am I a fan of things that are very popular with lots and lots of people. But I kept hearing The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien mentioned and I have only read one book of fiction since January 2011, so I decided to read this novel.The story is pretty good. An unimpressive and unskilled person is tasked with a difficult task in a new and original setting. The setting of Middle Earth is interesting and unique. Many parts of the setting and characters races have inspired lots of other creative works. Even creative works as recently as this year have been inspired by this book.This book is said to be one of the great classics of science fiction. And the few characters against the world makes for a good story.But there are problems with it. The unique characters and setting seem incomplete.For example: a large group of villains in the book are called &#34;orcs.&#34; Why are they villainous? What do they look like? Where do they come from? Do they have a society of some kind? I don't know the answers to any of these questions.Another example: the group of protagonists get chased by a &#34;balrog.&#34; Apparently it is a monster that they fear. What does it look like? How big is it? What color is it? How many arms/ legs/ eyes does it have? Where did it come from? I don't know the answers to any of these questions. All the characters fear this monster and I have no idea about what it is.One more example: The main character spends the first quarter of the book getting introduced and making his way to the city of &#34;Rivendell.&#34; Apparently it is the home of some elves. And one elf in particular lives there. I don't know anything more about it. What do the buildings look like? How many are there? Are the citizens mostly elves? Is it located in a valley or mountains or a plain? I don't have the slightest idea.LOTR is a sequel to another book, &#34;The Hobbit.&#34; Perhaps all of these points are covered in it? Perhaps not?For the first time ever after reading a book, I say, &#34;watch the movies instead.&#34; I've seen most of the three movies that were based on this book and I constantly was thinking about it so that I could get some idea of what was going on in the book.In other books you can read and imagine that you are in the book. That is not the case in LOTR.When other books are made into movies many parts are cut from the story. That does not seem to be the case with LOTR.For the first time ever I say, &#34;watch the movies instead.&#34; Other books translate very badly to the screen. Other stories lose lots of characters, back stories, or scenes. But despite watching and reading this story I've only noticed very minor differences and only very minor characters removed.The Lord of the Rings should be praised for introducing a new world, a new setting, and a new section of fantasy. But the missing setting and missing character descriptions leave it lacking.Its a good story but it seems to be lacking in depth. It uses just enough words to move the story along. I miss knowing what the settings are.What does the world look like?How tall are the dwarves?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Actually, the book should have 10 out of 5 stars!!!The lord of the rings is easily the greatest story of all time. It is written by the master of fantasy JRR TOLKEIN, and no one can come close to him. Any other fantasy story cant compare to LOTR because tolkein took all of the good ideas! For instance, if you read the Wheel of time series sounds just like a ... spinoff of LOTR. Also, Tolkein's books are better because he wanted to tell a GOOD story, not sell books.If you havent read the LOTR series, then you had better read it before the ne movie comes out, so it doesnt give you any misconceptions.If you liked the LOTR series, then i also suggest reading the SWORD OF TRUTH series."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I started reading Lord Of The Rings in primary 6 and I finished at the beginning of primary 7. It tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. It starts by telling you that it is his birthday when some of his dwarf friends tell him their going on an adventure and they want him to come with him. They will meet many strange and wonderful cretures and people on their way. This book has to be one of the most famous ones in the world as is the author, J.R.R Tolkien actually died in the middle of writing it so his son, and he did his father proud as the ending is one of the worlds bast. I'm a harsh man so getting 4 out of 5 is pretty good, I would never give anything 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings stories many times since my first reading at around 12. I was captured by it at that age and still remain in its thrall to this day. Tolkien was, to say the least, a master of the English language. His uses of the sound of speech to communicate or emphasize emotion are beyond compare. To top it off, he just wrote an amazing adventure story, filled with all of the grand imagery most storytellers only hint at.In every regard this story captures the imagination. It is the mother, the template for all epic fantasy today. So, if you went to see the movies (and I own and love all three), do yourself a favor, and find out what really happened to the Fellowship, to Sarumon, to Frodo and the rest of the hobbits. Hear about it first hand from Tolkien himself.But now I'm going to do something most people don't have the courage to do. I'm going to criticize this great work.First, and only shortly, the love story in this saga lacks depth. His treatment of the relationships between Aragorn and Arwen and Aragorn and Eowyn are brief and extremely niave, as well as overly sentimental. While the the love between Aragorn and Arwen gets short shrift, Eowyn seems to fall in love with Aragorn on first sight, something not entirely in character with this seemingly strong willed woman. Perhaps its only that this aspect of the sotry has not withstood the tests of time.Second, and a far more egregious flaw is the blatant classism that exists between Frodo and the tirelessly servile Samwise. Okay, Sam is the gardener, but just once when Frodo is whining do you think Sam could kick him in the rear instead of saying \\"Oh, Mister Frodo...\\" ARGH!The idea of the manservant is something only the British could spin into something so rediculously sentimental and silly. The idea that any human being could love his master is beyond my comprehension, but maybe thats just me. Sam is on more than one occasion Frodo's only salvation, but his character and the relationship he has with Frodo seem so sadly niave it makes me wince."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I got this massive thing for christmas and I must say I was a bit daunted. I've read a lot of books in the 600 to 700 page realm but very few this long. So I figure it can't be to difficult, so I dove right in and what did I find?What I found was a great concept delivered in a pretty dull fashion. The Lord of the Rings is a 1000 page epic adventure, which if you narrowed it down could have probably been a lot shorter, a lot more concise and a lot easier to read. I don't know about anyone else, but I found the endless pages of descriptions of then walking around and where the hills were in comparison to their location a bit tiresome. After a while I began to just skim over those parts and hope for some action to come.And when the action came, it was horribly underwhelming. It was hard to realize when it should be exciting.For example, in the climatic scene with Gollum, Frodo, and Sam in Mordor, when the climax finally happened(I don't want to go into the details and spoil it for anyone wanting to read it) I didn't really feel anything about it. Nothing at all. It sort of just went through me. Was I susposed to feel excited or something?Anyway, I still think this book was worth reading, if not for the fact that it's one of those cultural standards that everyone has read. I give it three stars because the story is well thoughtout and Mr. Tolkien was definatly not lazy, hell he created a whole language and all those family trees. It was just more than a little dull for my liking.By the way, i'm reading The Hobbit as we speak and finding it a much better read. Theirs no endless stream of names that I have no idea about, or endless descriptions of things I don't care about, and (gasp), I actually feel suspense in certain parts, eh gad."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book a great book if you like action fantasy books. Also if you like elves and dwarves then this is defenitly a book you should read. It's an action packed book with even some scary parts in it. The story is kind of confusing to follow. Also in some of the parts there are some boring parts where there are lots of diffrent conversations, which are very long and boring. I think this is more of an adult book than a child book because it's kind of confusing. Anyway it's a great book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Sorry, I think I'm unable to understand what is so great with this book. I began to read this book with very large expections and was so dissapointed. It tells nothing it doesn't wakes any sort of feelings in the reader. It is something you can read, but nothing more.I admit that Tolkien was the first author to write this, the fight of good against evil, but sometimes this is not enough.Anybody out there saying Tolkien can write? Me not. His charakters are plain, they are never facing any kind of decicion. There is either good or evil, light or darkness, but nothing in between.AND he missed the end. After the coronation of Aragorn the book is over, but Tolkien keeps telling something.The Lord of the Rings is something like a legend and its creation was &quot;good&quot; but its fame is larger than the truth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Everyone knows at least some of the plot, so I won't go into that.I found Fellowship of the Ring to be rather dull, except for a few scenes.I found Two Towers to be little better, and by the beginning of the Return of the King I was sick of the whole thing. The biggest problem had to be their change of speech.Did anyone else notice that in the beginning they talked just about the same as one might hear walking down the street, and that by the end of The Return of the King the characters sounded like they were quoting Shakespeare?Also, some times Tolkien had his characters say very strange things, for example:Sam says \\"Ninnyhammer! Noodles! My beautiful rope!\\" something like that, but.. honestly, NINNYHAMMER??And then, before that, when discussing the elven rope, Sam also says \\"the rope is as soft as milk\\" or the like.Anyways, overall, a great book, Tolkien really started off the entire Fantasy genre, but just because he was the first, doesn't mean he's the best. I prefer Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, but then again, several of Jordan's stuff came from The Lord of the Rings, so.. I just don't know..By the way, I liked the movie better, which almost NEVER happens."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Dialogues have been lifted from the book, without enuf story in between. Story moves too fast. Hard to tell difference between voices of different characters."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book has become the standard by which others fantasy novels are measured, and with good reason. Tolkien has created a world with depth, emotion, and a sense of magesty that (after 20 more years of fantasy reading) I still haven't found elsewhere. The story is engrossing, the characters diverse, real, and likable, and the scenes beautifully written. At its roots this is a simple story of good versus evil, but it's so memorable that it's no surprise it spawned a genre. Youngsters may find parts a bit slow (unlike the child-friendly &quot;The Hobbit&quot;). First-time Tolkien readers should definitely read The Hobbit first, as Lord of the Rings follows directly from that story, and doesn't take much time to re-introduce the reader to Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien has got to be the most imaginative and gifted writers of all time! I just finished reading this trilogy for the second time now, and plan to read it again in a few years (by the way, I'm 14)! The story in itself is absolutely incredible, but Alan Lee's paintings add a lot, being very beautifully detailed. This book is a must for all imaginative people who seek the enthrallment of fantasy - engrossing for adults, teens, and children (although the reading can be rather challenging for kids under 12 or so). Tolkien was a genius!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I suppose there are two kinds of people who read these reviews: those ten or fifteen people who have never read Lord of the Rings, and want to know whether they should or not, and people who have visited this land many times and, feeling nostalgia, want to hear other reports of it. All I can say to the first group is, if you like to stay at home, safe behind VCR and keyboard, never read a book twice, and want managable cliches to do the work of imagining for you when you do read a story, give this one a wide berth. If, on the other hand, you feel that this world is not quite your home, beware of Middle Earth, it may enchant you. It may not be heaven, but for those who can feel its incantation, it may awaken a longing that nothing on earth can quite satisfy.Maybe that sounds overblown to you. Let me just tell you, then, it's a great story, and for some, it will be hard to find a better. Tolkien has taken the raw material of the human psyche and fashioned a world with it, and then put a story in that world that will fill your imagination with unforgetable images. I don't think I even noticed, the first several times through, the genius he displays for character and motivation or for linguistic invention, the story swept me off my feet so completely. After years of reading it, even the things I don't much care for -- some of the poetry, Sam's overly servile attitude, a bit of a slow beginning in Fellowship of the Ring, some rather clumsy map-making -- have worked into the whole and become a part of its charm. Best not pick this book up for the first time without a very long block of free time ahead of you, in case it strikes you in the same way."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I read this book as was a young teenager, my whole view of this world changed.

Last fall I read the entire trilogy starting with The Fellowship of the Ring (my favorite) and it is difficult to describe how satisfying the experience was. It is interesting how reading The Fellowship of the Ring at age 38 differs from my first reading twenty years ago. Frodo leaves his comfortable life to go on an adventure. He does not know where it will take him, what he will encounter while on the journey, nor exactly what his mission will be. I'm no professor so I can't give a slick review of the work, but after you have read The Lord of the Rings you will have a difficult time selecting a book which will grab you and take hold of your imagination like the trilogy.

When I was a lad, we had to read some dreary British novel, in high school, Silas Marner, or something like that. They stretched reading it out to a very boring entire school term. It was torture, and I like to read. I slogged through this book joyfully in high school, on my own time. Why don't they have books like this in high school? There is of course far more detail than there is in the movie. This is a book assembled by a craftsman, a Kahuna- an expert- in Hawaiian terms. One can enjoy the book at a few pages per day. He has great, archetypal characters. This book set the standard. The only complaint I might make, and that is small, is that it is long- many people don't want to read something quite this long- however that is not a problem for me, I like it just as it is. This is a classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The book was in excellent condition, the edition restored some errors that were in previous editions.

I read it once a year and as I change the book changes too, as I understand more and more of the text. As a student studying literature at Uni at the moment, the message that can be found in it is timeless and enduring; but that message is for the reader alone to find."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Since reviewing the content of the book would be superfluous, there are a million others that did that, I will concentrate on the quality of the hardcover 50th Anniversary One Vol. Edition(The normal book, not the collector's edition with gilded pages).The paper is treated (doesn't get yellow in time), and slightly glossy, great quality. It is, however, a bit thin, it gives the impression that it might rip easily. Another problem is the spine, which is glued and also a bit thin, making it bend slightly during the handling of the book due to the large weight. But these are really nitpicks, as I'm a bit paranoid about durability. It will most likely last a long time without any real damage. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to have one book for LOTR, to read it as it was originally intended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Is there anything left to say about LOTR? Even if you've never read Tolkien before, and even if you don't like him: like it or not, LOTR has already defined how you view the world. You can reject him, but he still wrote the terms of the debate.Tolkien dealt in archetypes, and it's now too boring, too unimaginative to accuse him of unrealistic or insufficiently developed characters. He wouldn't have cared, anyway -- he was developing a vast world. And he could be brilliantly atmospheric. Two things make LOTR endlessly seductive, to the point where generations of readers continue to feel closer to Middle-earth than to reality. First, Tolkien evokes the dizzying feeling of uncovering unknowable, terrifying ancient mysteries. My favourite part was always the passage through Moria in the first volume. This is, of course, the ghost city of the Dwarves, abandoned and looted centuries ago, a pitch-dark maze of ruined corridors, stairwells, and bridges. Yet somewhere underground, there are legendary architectural works of limitless beauty and elegance (reverently described by Gimli the dwarf), and the ruins retain an air of ancient majesty and grandeur. One ruined chamber holds a lonely tomb and a book containing the sorrowful account of an earlier attempt to reconquer the city. The book itself is ruined and stained everywhere with blood, such that only ominous incoherent fragments remain. Confronting one's ancient, unrecognizable, violent past is the ultimate out-of-body experience.Second, and related to the first, Tolkien flawlessly creates and maintains a sorrowful, elegiac tone. The past was always great and stately, but even those parts that don't lie in ruins are inevitably slipping from our grasp. The Elves are fantastically powerful warriors and sorcerers, also incomparably elegant and wise, but their culture is irreversibly declining. There's no real explanation for this (they all seem invincible), but they feel it every day, and they're doomed to eventually depart from the world, leaving no trace of their great culture. Of course this has a strong element of wish-fulfillment -- what literate young person wouldn't want to be beautiful and tragic? that desire has given The Cure a career! -- but this device wouldn't be effective if it wasn't deeply resonant. Everything is going well and there's no clear reason why you can't go on living the way you always have...and yet, you feel it slipping from your fingers.Supporting all of this is Tolkien's minutely detailed mythos. His invented names and languages are based in his studies of ancient European languages and culture. LOTR induces unconscious associations with medieval history and knights in armour even when it's not trying. Tolkien became our gateway to the Dark Ages. His magical fantasy was so successful because these echoes of reality made it seem more real. His imitators never understood that.Yet, deep down, the worldview of LOTR radically departs from the ancient epics, in a singularly modern way. Those old stories were told in terms of conflict between heroic individuals, whose valour was more important than their cause. The Greeks sackTroy, but Homer praises Hector and Priam just as much as Achilles or Odysseus. By the same token, he shows Agamemnon's weaknesses, although that's not really the right word -- they're more like inevitable facets of a larger-than-life persona. InDas Nibelungenlied, the great hero Ruediger is actually working for Attila the Hun, which does nothing to diminish his honour in the poet's eyes (on the contrary, he is praised for his loyalty). InVolsungsaga, that same Attila is almost sympathetic, while Gunnar is tragically flawed, but capable of self-reflection and penance. If anyone is evil, it reflects a conscious, individual choice on their part.But in Tolkien, good and evil is defined strictly along racial lines. All Elves and hobbits are good by definition. The mighty Europeans of Rohan and Gondor may err, but in a grandiosely tragic way, out of hubris (Isildur) or nihilism (Denethor). Dwarves are greedy, but brave and honest. But orcs and trolls are not only always evil, they're always debased and contemptible, deserving scorn as much as hatred. If they win a battle, that's not a sign of bravery or heroism on their part, it only means that they got lucky, or they had superior numbers, or they fought dirty. The Elves in Lorien won't open fire on Gollum, because he hasn't attacked them, but that rule doesn't apply to the evil races. Nor are orcs allowed to feel any camaraderie for each other or any loyalty to their cause and leaders. There is only one example in the entire book in which orcs express fatigue and a desire to escape the war (Shagrat and Gorbag), but Tolkien makes sure to follow up with them slaughtering each other on a whim. Gimli and Legolas engage in a competition to see who can kill more orcs in a battle, and pedantically tally up their scores (42-41). This is supposed to be comic relief. Even the most bloodthirsty ancient poets weren't quite that forthright.Some critics have interpreted this to mean some kind of crypto-racism on Tolkien's part. Maybe you could argue that -- for example, evil men (\\"Easterlings\\") are \\"dark\\" and \\"slant-eyed\\" -- but it's too simplistic, too easy to blame everything on one poor, neurotic British scholar. Europe saw in him only what it wanted: a self-contained way to remythologize itself, cast off all doubt, and never feel any accountability for anything again. LOTR reaches into contemporary discourse. Political and international conflict, no matter how insignificant, is always Gondor vs. Mordor, not just good vs. evil, but good vs. the orcs, the latter being irreparably debased, soulless, cursed, inherently incapable of compassion or negotiation and therefore automatically deserving none. Tolkien's opus absorbed and began supplanting actual history. Its influence is wondrous, but disquieting."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth encompassed in The Silmarillion, The Children of Hurin, the Hobbit, and the Lord of the Rings can only be described as one of the greatest legends in history.

I am so glad that I did. I loved the movies, but I love the book even more. I yearned for more details and found them within the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. Even though the 1000+ pages are daunting, if you love fantasy/romance/excitement this book is a must read. I couldn't stand to put it down! The artistry of Tolkien's writing made me fall in love with Middle-Earth and each and every character involved (although Frodo and Sam are my favorites). I can't wait to read it again, and to share it with my children when they get older. I highly recommend reading this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There have been few series that have been held in such high international regard than the Lord of the Rings books. Even before the LotR movies, Tolkien was synonymous with THE original classic fantasy works and now they're absolutely huge. With this set, you'll get to see what the fuss is all about.LotR is not a trilogy but a series in six books, with appendices. It is a monumental work detailing the struggle of the Fellowship of the Ring against the dark forces of Sauron and the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. This is clear to those who've either seen the movies (95% of people I think) or heard of them (99.9999%). This is what the content of the books is. Except obviously there's much more detail and it's much more epic in the sheer number of obstacles that are placed in the path of Frodo and friends.The thing that would probably be useful is the differences between the books and the movies. The books are very rich in extraneous material. It is said that one of Tolkien's main purposes of writing the series was to create a world with his own invented languages and populate it - the stories are just a background to the languages! The book contains a lot of mythology. There are a lot of poems relating to times gone by and current events (which I personally didn't find very readable). Overall, there are many profound and emotional parts in the book that aren't given much credence in the movie - a great feeling of melancholy and nostalgia over a world in deterioration. This is only touched on in the films with the atmoshere of the elves.The book contains a lot of journeying and this will also be a new feature. Rather than just getting to places like in the film, the characters spend a lot of time in the day-to-day marches. It is here that you begin to learn and appreciate the natural landscape of Middle-Earth, from the plains of Rohan to the little ecosystem of the Shire.The appendices will only be read by LotR fanatics. There are backstories of the kingdoms and lineages of noble families and notes on the languages. One thing that is recommended to browse through is the timeline, especially what happened to the fellowship after the events of the book.Overall, this is still the great book about timeless issues pertaining to good, evil, courage and hope. But it also has the extra emotional and descriptive elements. There is something that is missing, although I'm not sure what, that stops it from being 5 stars in my opinion.A great piece of literary history. Contains a whole universe that's as deep and rich as our one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the best book i have ever read!(and that's saying something) Tolkien creates such a detailed and believable world that you forget you live in the present and get totally absorbed into the books. (I start thinking in elvish...)You can feel the things the characters are feeling, you can imagine the places Tolkien creates, and most of all, you can relate to the books. Most people would think me too young to understand the meaning and depth of the Lord of the Rings. But I do. the Lord of the Rings is about friendship, trust, honor, and most importantly, hope. If you haven't read the lord of the rings, you should- now. Like order it now or run off to the nearest bookstore and buy it. In my opinion(any many others opinions)it is one of the best literary works of all time. Anyone who doesn't get to experience the brilliance of Tolkien's work has been truely deprived. The Lord of the RIngs deserves more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read the Hobbit first in fifth grade, and i didn't understand it. it seemed like a lot of nonsense to me at the time, and when i reread it in sixth grade it wasn't much different. But i had learned to appreciate the story as 'cute' and recommended it when i thought to. I had seen the Lord of the Rings several times, and had easy access to it, but never gave it any thought. I'm not very fond of any series. Last year, my freshmand year in high school, i decided to pick up the Fellowship of the Ring, being bored with nothing else to read (does anyone describe themselves as 'busy' in october?), i thought that i would at least be entertained by familiar characters.WOW!I was thrown back into the world of Middle Earth, which i had apparently undervalued before...okay, so the beginning was a bit slow due to the somewhat lengthy (but totally necessary) introduction, but hold on!--at least for the sake of the characters you learned to love in the Hobbit. You won't regret it! Some argue that it's too long, but i say, 'all the more time to get to know and love the characters'. Trust me, by the end, you'll wish it were longer. Now, it may not be for you--all the people i know who've read it have either loved it or hated it--i know of no lukewarm liking (maybe i'm off, but all the people i know who love Gone with the Wind hated LOTR...just so you know).Read them.

My little brother had copped my paperback copies, which were starting to fall apart anyway. Thus, I had to choose among the many incarnations of the Trilogy. I loved the idea of having the whole story of LOTR in one volume, as Tolkien originally intended.This edition has illustrations, which Tolkien did not intend, but might have approved, as Tolkien himself did illustrate &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; I, for one, am extremely grateful for these tastefully done portrayals.As for the story, it's everything I remember and more! If you haven't read it yet, there is an encounter with a creature called a Balrog that will get your heart rate up to about 300. I had no recollection of this chapter and was completely floored.

READ THE HOBBIT FIRST!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Whenever a new fantasy novel is published and appears in the nearest bookstore, one can find - after having been lured to the work by a quite pleasing, wonderful artwork on the cover - some of the following reviews on the blurb: &quot;Reminds one about Tolkien&quot; or &quot;This is definitely our new Tolkien&quot; or even &quot;Better than Tolkien&quot;. The comparison with the Oxford Professor of Anglo-Saxon seems to be a quite common and prefered way to give the reader an impression of how the work that he is going to buy would be. And yet... All of these reviews, how poor they will prove after the dazzled customer opens and starts the novel! No other work of fantasy literature that has appeared or still will appear after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; deserves it at the least to be compared with Tolkien's epic.What Tolkien has created with his opus on a literary basis, exceeds with no trouble all other works of fantasy, lets authors like Feist, Jordan or even Williams look like right fools. Tolkien has not only written an outstanding novel or shaped a wonderful world, but he has managed to give readers all over the world one thing back, which they were likely to lose in a world as fast living as ours: Their own fantasy, their own imagination. In doing this, Tolkien is not pleased to simply tell a compelling and entertaining story, but he presents a world with its own mythology, an existence of its own in the truest sense of the word.Even though some critics may dispute Tolkien's literacy in comparison to Feist or Jordan (let me just laugh a little!), I won't be blinded by your comments! Now, for the second time, I started reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - this time in its original language, after having read the German translation in no more than three days without sleep - and it seems, as if I have never left Middle-Earth and its fabulous flora and fauna. But now I truly understand the profundity of this masterpiece. Perhaps Jordan and Co. might have the talent to arrange some of the scenes in a more exciting way, yet their works lack one of the most elementary features of faerie (as Tolkien calls it) and fantasy: the language, and I don't mean the creation of new languages like the Sindarin or Quenya, but the language of the novel!Tolkien shows remarkably that it is the language of the protagonists (let me remind you of the wizard Gandalf!), the language of the scenery, the language of the history that helps the reader to imagine an independent albeit foreign world that is not so different from his own. And remember the fight of Gandalf against the Balrog in Moria! Whoever did not devour each word, each syllable in this scene as if spellbound, I think noone can ever help these people...In my honest opinion, all those new &quot;bestsellers&quot; do not deserve to stand in line with Tolkien's work. Even though &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sometimes reads sluggishly due to its preference for distinctive and eloquent description of landscape, this novel is nevertheless the ultimative in fantasy literature. Many works of fantasy, if not all, are far, far away from such gloria perpetua. Giving 5 stars for this milestone of literature in each genre, is simply not enough, but not even 10, 100 or thousands of stars could fathom what treasure one of the most wonderful authors has laid in our laps.I thank Tolkien for this legacy, and I will carry it within me - until Morgoth will rise again..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is indeed an excellent read. A very entertaining story that will appeal to the &quot;child&quot; that, hopefully, still lives inside us.The tale that Tolkien tells us is rich in content and background. You can feel while you read that there is more to the story than what you are just reading. It is almost as if, while telling you Frodo's ordeals, Tolkien brings you closer to a rich and imaginative world, full of legends, myths, its own history, and above all, full of characters. All the implicit and explicit references to other heroes, evils, adventures and misadventures add a great deal to the story and to the entertainment it provides.Not only the book is imaginative, but is also well written. So well written that it will compel the curiosity of your &quot;inner child&quot; to keep reading. And if you look at it in a more subtle way, you may even glimpse a sense of humor in Tolkien's imagination (think, for instance, of the differences between the characters and how these differences affect their actions, words, ways of thinking and dealing with their problems).It was a good friend who, while we were all on a holiday trip, shared for a few minutes the book he was eagerly reading. After that my mind was set: I had to, I wanted to read more...And there is indeed more to the story than what you just read. If you've read other books of Tolkien, then you know there is more.

I've had many copies of the paperbacks over the years but this is beautiful.I read LotR for the first time when I was 14 and from then on I was hooked. I read it once a year until I was in my 20's then put it aside until I began to read it aloud to my own kids. They weren't quite the enthusiasts I was until the movies arrived. Now they are almost as big of LotR junkies as their mom. (I took one daughter to see it 9 times during the day when the theater was empty, center balcony seats, HUGE screen, wow, what an experience, but that's the movie and I digress...)I've heard that LotR and the Bible were the two most influential books of the 20th century. I believe it. So many things I did in my life may have gotten a seed planted by something I read that Tolkien wrote. I even bought our wedding rings, (the \\"Comfort Band\\" style) because they look just like the One Ring. THAT impressed my kids. Especially when I put it on top of a creme brulee and it looked just like the scene in the movie when the ring is destroyed in the mountain of fire.The book is so beautifully written, such rich, beautiful images, such a real country to visit, how can anyone not read LotR and not be affected profoundly? It is a credit to Tolkien's pure writing that Peter Jackson was able to recreate scenes that were just as I had pictured them in my mind long before Jackson ever had the idea to make the movie. Perhaps Tolkien was guiding him from that far green country....Buy this book for life.

In addition to reading the book, I have often listened to the excellent 13-hour BBC radio production (also highly recommended) but wanted the full text as Professor Tolkien wrote it. My rating for the book content is, of course, fully five stars. It is unique and wonderful. For reader Rob Inglis, also very good marks: he is a very clear, warm dramatic reader who does well at creating the various voices, without overdoing it. I've listened to hundreds of audio books, and would rate him in the top 15 percent. (He's not a great singer but renders the many songs pleasantly, as a hobbit might.) The audio quality of this tape set, recorded in 1991, is good. Let me be clear: I have no complaint. It's very good, clear, not distracting. Just not as aurally pristine as the highest modern standards make possible. Separate and apart from that, the very first tape in the set had infrequent but annoying sound drop outs of about 1-2 seconds, every few minutes. The other tapes did not have the problem. The problem may not be on other copies or on the CD edition, but it's worth noting, especially since it was the first tape. However, with those minor quibbles, I highly recommend this wonderful addition to the ways to enjoy the book. For those who have only seen the magnificent movie, there are many surprises and additions (and some changes) here. Don't miss it.

I couldn't imagine reading or listening to a digest of the book so this edition - unabridged - is worth the extra investment.

It's same 50th ann version and it's hard cover(\\"HC\\") at 50% price compared to collection version.More importantly, it has far better 'paper quality' than any other hardcover/collection/paper versions. I compared it with about 6 or 7 versions, but mainly with 'allen lee illustrated HC', '1974 HC' (inside & outside), and 2004 50th ann. collection ed.

I followed several pages in different versions, counting words and lines among the versions, and I found it's easiest to read. I'm not that old(middle of 30s), but I prefer to have 'easy to read' fonts/margins. It's the best of all the versions (The next one I like is 1974 HC version(3 volumes), but I like 2005 HC version more in format. in 1974 HC, it's like 'insti-tution' style if the line is changed, while this 2005 HC version has managed to arrange it beautifully due to word program).Note : It (2005 HC) has its own paper version(2005 PB), but this HC verson's paper quality is 'far' better than that of its paper version. I'm really satisfied with this edition.If you are looking for 'hard', 'strong', 'collctible' but 'easy to read' and 'carry', it's absolutely the version. Even if the price of the 2004 collection version and this 2005 HC had been same, I would have chosen this 2005 HC version. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I purchased the whole LOTR on CD for a cross country drive. The quality of this reading really surprised me. The fact that one man could perform all of the characters this way was wonderful. The changes in his voice are subtle, but allow the listener to follow along with the story with no confusion, even in scenes with multiple speakers. The experience of listening to this book on tape was better than actually reading the book myself. This was a first for me. My intention was to resell the CD set upon arrival, but I am keeping it. I have listened to portions time and again and consider it a valuable part of my library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Inglis' delivery was very nearly flawless. He also has an excellent singing voice; I was astonished to find there were so many songs written down in the books. The only major problem I had with this set is that it was finite.I had never heard of Mr. Inglis before listening to this set. He actually made me look forward to an hour-long commute. If someone were to publish his reading of the Zip code directory, I would purchase it immediately. He's that good."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are more than enough reviews on this site already, and in any case \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not a book that can be usefully reviewed. You will either find Tolkien's world a wonderfully transporting experience or a waste of time. Nothing I could say would change your opinion and it is better to judge for yourself.Instead what I am going to do is review this particular edition, which is the one I own and the one in which I first encountered Middle-Earth. The book is a remarkable aide to the imagination. Everything about it, from the slightly off-white color of the pages to the wonderful though likely artificial smell of age and the almost indestructable imitation leather binding, was designed to give the impression that it was an artifact from some lost and ancient library, not something bought at discount price ... Indeed, with its Elvish-style lettering and crimson cover it does recall the Red Book of Westmarch, the ancient tome in which Tolkien claimed his story was first transcribed. Tolkien always intended \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" to be read as a single novel, not as a trilogy, and here we get the book in its true form, with none of the showy illustrations he so detested. The book is heavy enough and large enough to feel appropriately medieval, yet light and portable enough to be read on a beach. The pages do not tear, but the spine does come loose, requiring the occasional dab of paper glue. I have owned this book for 12 years now and have skimmed it countless times, yet somehow it has survived. Ponderous and awkward though it might first appear, it is remarkably versitile and durable. Forget its \\"collectors' value;\\" there are countless numbers of this edition out there, but it is by far the best edition of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you could buy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"One cannot describe the amazing story that is the Lord of the Rings(LotR) in merely a few paragraphs. J.R.R. Tolkien has definitely created one of the greatest stories ever told. After I was informed that The Lord of the Rings was voted Book of the Century I decided that I should give it a chance. I can now say that I was rewarded quite well.The Lord of the Rings is an epic fantasy masterpiece. Combining elements of a medieval world including kings, queens, knights on horseback, castles, dungeons, and large scale ground warfare with fantasy elements such as wizards, trolls, elves, sorcery, and enchanted places, the story becomes very believable and extremely intriguing. Without revealing too much, the story is an epic quest of a small group to save the known world from the dark forces of Sauron.Although the prequel to the Lord of the Rings is the Hobbit which was written more for older children, it is still a must read before the adult epic LotR is undertaken as it familiarizes the reader with the beautiful style and wonderful world of Tolkien. The Hobbit is a great novel in itself but the reader must realize that LotR is much darker and deals with a great deal more conflict and character development which creates for a grand, entertaining experience.Readers will fall in love with the characters throughout the entire LotR Trilogy as each is so much different from the other making a very diverse group during the journey.Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest stories ever written and should be read by all as it has elements that can be enjoyed by everyone. I now only wish that the story was not over so quickly even though it lasts for more than 1000 pages. Be forwarned, however, as all other stories read afterwards will pale in comparison to Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Everything positive about this novel has long since been said; suffice it to say it is brilliant. This review, however, refers specifically to the version illustrated by Alan Lee. His paintings are masterful and capture the true essence of Tolkien's imagination. Furthermore, the book itself is printed on outstanding glossy paper, and the binding has proved remarkably durable.Whether you are reading this novel for the first time, or the fiftieth, this is the version you want. While it is a bit pricey, it truly captures the romance of the novel in a way no other edition could possibly equal."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've just finished reading the Lord Of The Rings for the second time. My first reading of it was about three years ago. Amazingly, (and I think this says something of the quality of the story itself) I would say I enjoyed it even more this second time around. It is so sweeping and wide that it still thrills, never losing any of its unpredictablity even if one is already familiar with the ending. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so immense, such an entire &quot;sub-creation&quot; (as the author himself referred to it)... complete with its own creatures, history, languages, and breathtaking landscapes... I believe it is without parallel in fantasy literature of any era. This book is myth, rather than allegory. By that I mean that there is not really meant to be any strict one-to-one correspondence to specifically theological, political, or psychological aspects of our own &quot;real&quot; world. No-one in Middle-Earth is named Mr. Worldly-Wiseman or Mr. Evangelist or Mr. Charity. No, here we meet people and things like Tom Bombadil, Gollum or Treebeard... hobbits, elves, dwarves, ents, orcs and yes, even Men. And yet, as with great allegorical works all of these characters gravitate to one of two poles or extremes that can be seen as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. The Lord of The Rings is truly about a grandiose struggle between the FORCES of good and evil. In Chapter 2 of Book 2 we read that &quot;Good and ill have not changed... nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves and another among Men.&quot; An interesting thing about the book is how Tolkien's brand of &quot;dualism&quot; very subtly points to the reality that ultimate Good or Evil is something yet greater (or beyond) any of the characters that try to perpetrate either of them. This is most clear in a statement by Gandalf in Book 3 during &quot;The Last Debate&quot; where he says &quot;Other evils there are that may come; for Sauron is himself but a servant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.&quot; If Sauron (who throughout the book appears as the evil to be reckoned with) is &quot;but a servant or emissary&quot;... then we must consider the question... an emissary of what? Or whom? And similarly, if all of the &quot;good&quot; that the Fellowship of The Ring strives to achieve will yet not &quot;master all of the tides of the world&quot;... then where is this locus of ULTIMATE good? Gandalf makes it clear that their own &quot;goodness&quot; is limited to the years wherein they are set. At the end of The Lord of The Rings, the future yet belongs to the good AND the evil that lie beyond the powers of any of the characters that have played a part in the present conflict. Maybe we are supposed to wonder... who IS the Lord of the rings? Almost 50 years ago C.S. Lewis, a friend of Tolkien's, said of The Lord of The Rings: &quot;Such a book has of course its predestined readers, even now more numerous and more critical than is always realised. To them a reviewer need say little, except that here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart.&quot; And I too, could go on forever about it, but my best suggestion is for you to quit reading this, and just read the book. Or re-read it! The best review would be terribly inadequate. Tolkien's Middle-Earth is as impossible to imagine before you go there as it is to forget about once you've been."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkiens work at best, lets us travel to a time and place that we all wish existed. At worst, it brings to the surface feelings that you may not have felt since childhood. I am currently reading the series for about the sixth time. This time however there is a difference. I'm reading it to my two sons - ages 7 and 9 - and they can hardly wait 'til I get home so they can hear the next chapter(s) each evening. That's pretty powerful stuff when you consider that they prefer to hear me tell the tales of Middle Earth over watching their favorite t.v. shows, playing video games or doing any of the other things that 90's kids love to do! (I do edit some that I know is beyond their understanding) I've heard every argument against Tolkien's work in the last 20 years or so and to them I say - Your Loss! If you like to curl up to a good book on geometry or physics, this is not for you! As for the Tolkien critics, amateur and professional, it has always amazed me to no end what some find offensive in his writing. One example that keeps rearing its ugly head is that there are racial over tones in the books. Bah! says I! White symbolized as good and black symbolized as evil is as old as time itself. It has nothing to do with race, it just is. It can be summed up as simply as this: Day = Good, Night = Evil. Tolkien emphasizes this again and again in his work. Another argument is that it is a work only for children and the immature. Lord, I hope not. If I weren't reading it to my kids I'd be reading it again for myself. (And oh, by the way, I'm as level headed as they come) The best writing of the century? Maybe not. I only know that there are no other series of books I've read 6 times over. (And oh, by the way, I've read alot)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful set. It is way larger than I thought and very heavy.

It consists of all the different races in Middle Earth like the Wise and Majestic Elves; The sturdy dwaves ; the proud and tall men of Gondor; the &quot;not-so-hasty-Ents&quot; and so on.If you have seen the movies then don't think that you don't need to read the books cause the movies shows only a fraction of what takes place in the books.

Tolkien's flagship work. Tolkien's characterizations and descriptions are excellent, and his story stays tight and razor sharp to the very end. It is a lot to handle, its page count being close to 1,000, but it never loses its suspense and action. So much did I enjoy this book I read it twice, and many times have browsed its pages just for fun.Of the three superb books, my favorite would have to be the third, The Return of the King. This is the place where all the unfolding action finally comes to a head. (I insist, however, that readers do not jump to this book before reading the other two.) Do NOT pass by this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings was great. It is action packed and filled with adventure. I find that the character would act like I do at times. The characters were not believable at all. Elves and dwarfs, wizards, and hobbits could never exist.The book really holds you to the story.

Even if you have seen the films, you should still read the books. They can't match the skill and art put into the written form.

Well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"and that is an extremely difficult decision for me to come by, but I can come to no other.The best word that I can come up with to describe The Lord of the Rings is that of perfect. It is perfectly constucted, perfectly executed. The characters are perfect in that they are characters with downfalls and fears, and only through the progression of this tale, through new experiences and trials, are they able to bring themselves to new and stonger levels of understanding and the strength that comes with understanding.It is also exceptionally fun to read. We may appreciate Ulysses because of its intellectual brilliance, but The Lord of the Rings is an enjoyable adventure while intellectually stimulating.For those who have passed this book over as being something full of common fantasy cliches, consider that this is where those cliches began. Tolkien's popularity has had such an effect on popular fantasy, that few authors have not appropriated one Tolkien idea or another.In other words, read this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First of all, I love this book among with the vast majority of those who have read it, so there's no misunderstanding about that.My review is more a reflection on those who criticize the book for such obvious faults as racial and gender bias.Isn't it a bit ridiculous to choose the &quot;enlightened&quot; late 20-century politically aware perspective to review this book? Some of the really great classical books (greek, roman, medieval, i.e Shakespeare and so on) could so easily be laid to blame for the same faults if one chooses that approach.I find that Tolkiens way of creating &quot;deep lore&quot;, in his own terms, out of the intricate mechanics of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, however inappropriate these terms may be, are astounding and make for fantastic reading on any level.To anyone who likes to read - do yourself a favour and read Tolkien. For the older readers it might be interesting to start with The Silmarillion which puts not only The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings in perspective but actually Tolkiens whole perception of life and love.I hardly think that anyone could be &quot;hurt&quot; or become a racist or sexist by reading Tolkiens books, a claim almost too ridiculous to contest.I do, on the other hand, believe (and there are many millions who would agree) that there's a very great chance that reading any work of Tolkien is the start of a lifelong relationship to Tolkien and Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book did not make The Modern Library's recently published list of the 100 best novels of the 20th Century, though &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; did. What a crime. What does a guy have to do? With the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien created not only the finest example of fantasy yet written, he gave us one of the greatest works of fiction ever. This book is literature of the highest and most profound order. Its scope and scale of creativity and its impact on generations of readers cannot be matched by any writer, even by Shakespeare. In high school, this book sparked my interest in words and writing and guided me to pursue a college degree based on language. It opened my mind to ethics, the beauty of nature, the politics of nations, and the importance and reward of honor, service, courage and friendship. The things I did not see around me in real life, in society, I found in this book at a critical point, even a crossroads, in my development as an adult. And that ! discovery changed my life for the better, opening up uncharted worlds. I still carry its truths inside me to this day, 20 years later, and can still recall the tranquil feeling I had reading the book for the first time. I know there are thousands of people who have enjoyed a similar experience. This is what great works of art do. When we look at a Monet landscape or Michelangelo's David, we do not seek to categorize them by type. They just are, and we appreciate them for their beauty and the talent of the artist. The Lord of the Rings is more than fantasy. It is great literature. It is great art from an imensely talented artist. And it cannot be rivalled."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Houghton Mifflin illustrated edition is in every way phenomenal! Not sure what Robert S. Truesdall received, but mine was exactly what I hoped for. The binding is real stitched binding (not glued like so many books nowadays, expensive or not, to the shame of the publishing companies). The illustrations are beautiful, the paper is a quality semi-gloss with beautiful type set, a fine cloth cover, and the book lays flat as finely bound books ought to. Maps in the front and back are helpful reference points as the reader follows the story as it meanders through Middle Earth. The story itself is of course in its own category. I gave away my previous copy when I purchased this edition and began reading immediately! Worth the price in every way!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is for this edition only. This is a beautiful set with great artwork (I wish it had more). I love hardbacks and the print is centered nicely on the page for easy reading from that perspective. The size of the books, though larger than most, is not a problem for me as it was for some, but in my house, sitting on the couch, there was reflection coming off the glossy pages that caused me to have to hold the books in certain positions to see the words clearly. I believe my eyes got tired faster than if it had been on matte paper. I bought this set to last and read to my children and maybe, one day, my grandchildren. I will finish this set with my children, but may buy another set with matte paper to read to my grandchildren. On second thought, being only 70% through with the first book, I may buy that other set before I'm done."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Bought this edition for my wife.

Illustrations are not very colorful.That said she still likes it very much and will do so for years to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's book makes a very hard act to follow for modern fantasy-writers. Compared to it, The Wizard of Oz is a harmless political farce, Star Wars is a plotless mass of electronics (and I love Star Wars...), Eregon is a confusing, useless diversion, and Harry Potter is child's play.Not only does Tolkien maintain his intricate sense of history, not only does he flawlessly keep track of hundreds of characters, not only does he weave a compelling and unpredictable plot, not only does he have a working knowledge of FOURTEEN (count 'em, 14!) languages which he developed himself, BUT he also manages to keep his work free from the immorality and offensive elements so prevalent in modern fiction. No parent need fear for their child who picks up the Hobbit, or their young teen who decides to tackle the Lord of the Rings.This book is my favorite after the Bible--and it's almost as big a best-seller. If you think you got the whole story from New Line Cinema, THINK AGAIN. You missed scores of beautiful characters and delightful plot twists from dwarf arguments to hobbit antics. The characters have so much more depth--they seem much more like real people with real lives. If you like epic battles, romance, fantasy, action, adventure, humor, tragedy, mystery, animals, languages, history...if you like practically ANYTHING...there is something for you in the Lord of the Rings. If you didn't like the movies, you may yet like the books!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This edition of Lord of the Rings is an excellent addition to any collection.

This is not a review of the literature, but a review of the Houghton Mifflin hardcover boxed edition. Having read The Lord of the Rings five times previously, and having lost my dog-eared paperbacks, I decided to splurge on an expensive edition for my sixth tour of Middle Earth.

The whole epic is present with very little erros in the text, and the runes that are presented in the text can clearly be seen on the Kindle. It is true that this version of the Lord of the Rings (all 3 books together) doesn't include the majority of the maps, but I don't think that degrades this edition too much; the story is masterfully presented, and I know the maps by heart. Anyone who really needed the maps could just find them on Google. So, in summary, this is a great edition of a great story at a great price. This is a sure buy for any fantasy fan with a Kindle!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Having been an unwaveringly regular reader and re-reader of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" since I first encountered it way back in 1965, seeing the work of the greatest story-teller of the 20th century makes my (hairless) toes curl up in joy at its availability in Kindle format.

To them 's as have never read either, plunge in, enjoy, and like all the rest of Tolkien's readers, be sorry when you reach the end! (By way of a postscript.

At $51 and free shipping, this book is a must have for any fan of The Lord of the Rings, or books in general.The only \\"complaint\\" I have is with the \\"glue\\" or rubber cement that they used to keep the maps closed during shipping. As careful as I tried to be, I too experienced slight rips in the paper trying to remove the glue. The entire book ships in a leather-bound cardboard case, which is also wrapped in plastic.

I've read it multiple times, I've studied it, I've written a paper about it, and I've read books about it. For some, this can be one of those life-changing books. The first time I read it, I was astounded, not simply at the story, but the incredible beauty of it. Tolkien started his long writing career by trying to create a mythology for his beloved adopted country of England. He created two languages, Sindarin and Quenya, and made up stories about the people who spoke them. The Lord of the Rings is the result of over 15 years of work and a demand for a sequel to his classic, The Hobbit. When you read the story, you can not only see the landscape and recognize it, but you believe that it's real. You feel like you've discovered some long-forgotten manuscript, written by a vanished race, something that must have existed.Many people ask me how they should go about reading The Lord of the Rings. My answer is simple. If you've read The Hobbit, great, if not, read that first. Then you can move on to the more difficult The Lord of the Rings. If, after that, you find that you want to know more, then you can read the true work of Tolkien's heart, The Silmarillion. Some people object to The Lord of the Rings, saying that it's too long, it's too dense, there are too many characters and songs, or that it's too religious. I say that these people are too closed-minded. Remove any expectations from your mind, and take it for what it is: a work of heroic fantasy, inspired by the legends of the ancient Norse and Anglo-Saxons. Accept the songs and poems as relics of a forgotten age. Allow yourself to become absorbed into the story, and it's an experience you can never forget."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I highly recommend this edition of the beloved Lord of the Rings saga.

Like few other reviewers mentioned, the folded map is glued together and you need to take little care while viewing it for the first time without damage. That is not an issue or a reason to give this excellent edition a poor rating. Most of the deluxe editions won't be friendly to read due to unusual size and weight. People buy them because they adore the content and feel proud to have them in their bookshelves. I find this book very comfortable to read also. The paper quality is awesome, very smooth and silky and gives a very nice feeling when you read.The UK edition of this book from Harper Collins appears to be of superior quality but the price is 150% more then this US edition. I personally like the US edition more due to the more flexible paper used which enables a better reading.

It's a steal for just over $50. Bit I'm not here to review this edition, I'm here to review Tolkien's masterpiece. Here it goes:The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien is in my opinion one of the single greatest books ever written. Tolkien spent nearly ten years writing and compiling the book, and every word of it is so incredibly descriptive and perfect, that the ten years was time well spent. Every sentence of Tolkien's masterpiece is precisely written and full of life. The book comes closer to the saying \\"a picture's worth a thousand words\\" than any other book I've ever read, describing every picture he wants you to see as vibrantly as humanly possible. For these reasons, this book is quite faultless, and it never fails to leave out any details.It's easy to tell that this is a book of a higher order, written completely out of pure devotion to describing this immaculately-composed world of Middle-Earth. Many writers try to envision their fictional worlds, but Tolkien does much more than that: for him, his world is real, and every aspect of Middle Earth is as fully explored and depicted as the real world. Tolkien created a full world all his own, complete with many new languages and alphabets that he invented, family trees, a complete history, and absolutely every other detail you could imagine.After reading The Lord of the Rings, in addition to complete astonishment, I also feel a bit sad, but not for the reasons you may expect. I feel unhappy because I know I will probably never read Harry Potter or Eragon again, because the extensiveness, descriptiveness and overall perfection of Tolkien's works doesn't only Harry Potter or Eragon to shame in my mind, it downright smites them (in a good way). Every piece of modern (and overly praised) fantasy that I've ever read is like a string with several, or sometimes many other strings hanging off of it. However, Tolkien's Middle Earth is like a complete net, extending in all directions- fully explored, rich and resonant in every way.In every other fictional novel I have ever read, names appear to be created and applied because they sound either good in the context of which they are given. In Middle Earth, names are conceived based on race, language and tradition. For example, many names of those who live in Rohan have the prefix &eacute;o, because &eacute;o belongs to part of the old word for \`horse' in the now-unused language of the inhabitants of Rohan. Horses are the most predominant way of life in Rohan. Nothing in Middle Earth is random or without a history. Every alphabet, language, name, family tree and everything else has a story.There is, however, one main aspects that a reader may not enjoy. As I said earlier, Middle Earth is like a net, going out in every direction. For this reason, and the fact that nearly everything from language to history is unique and new, it is an exceptionally difficult book to dive right into and start reading. Take a look at these sentences from the Appendices (page 1035) \\"After Ardamin the Kings took the sceptre in names of the Nmenrian (or Adnaic) tongue: Ar-Adnakhr, Ar-Zimrathn, Ar-Sakalthr, Ar-Gimilzr, Ar-Inziladn. Inziladn repented the ways of the Kings and changed his name to Tar Palantir \`The Farsighted'. His daughter should have been the fourth Queen, Tar M&iacute;riel, but the King's nephew usurped the scepter and became Ar-Parazn the Golden, last King of the Nmenrians.\\" This definitely goes to show how incredibly complex the book can be at times. To read the book, it takes a lot of concentration and willpower to effectively read and comprehend.Other than the occasional extremely complex segments in the book, and the amount of work and concentration it takes to read the book, I believe everyone that is interested in any form of fantasy should pick up this book and give it a try. However, I think if everyone did so, JK Rowling would be broke, and so would every other modern fantasy writer. It is incredibly deep and utterly flawless, and its beautiful and vivid descriptions never cease to amaze. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to give it enough time, patience and respect to comprehend all 1031 pages of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This piece is magnificently presented, a true collectors edition, true there are some issues with the maps at the front and back which seem to be glued together and are hard to pull apart (Personally we haven't tried to open them nor will we as we are not too worried about not being able to see the maps) the rest of the book is greatly presented - the way I always imagined the book to be.Delivery was a little slow but then again we are in Melbourne, Australia so we understand the delay as we selected the basic freight level.Anyway - highly recommend this version of the book to any true fan out there"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Rather, this is a book that proves timeless in its themes, prose, and power. Indeed, the universally recognized construct of good vs. evil has been the crown jewel of all stories since Genesis. Humanity itself is reflected in this dynamic, and the drama unfolds in Tolkien's pages with a grace and fury uncommon to the genre. His tale of the diminutive, peaceful Hobbits placed against a frightening array of evil forces and corruption is one that reaches deep, clenching your heart. It is compelling because of its verisimilitude. We all wish for our heroes to be brave but to find valor in such an unexpected place is lyrically pure beyond means. Call it &quot;Fairy Tale&quot; or what you will-- LOTR is a literary masterpiece, easily qualified by its keen portrayal of endurance against adversity.But it has many other strengths. Consider that the civilizations, cultures, and history as devised by Tolkien are the product of decades of careful research into Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic myth. They seem real because they are drawn from a felicitous past. Painstaking effort provided the invention of real languages and alphabets for his Elves and Dwarfs. His erudition inspires awe. By great leaps of his imagination, he gave Middle-Earth an authentic backdrop of mythical deities, battles, natural wonders, and poetry. &quot;I've always preferred history to fiction,&quot; Tolkien is quoted as saying. Indeed, he has provided such a rich explication of this past that the narrative takes on a substance unmatched in modern fantasy.This masterful portrait of high romance and adventure stands apart. The Lord of the Rings has been voted &quot;Book of the Century&quot; by Britain's largest reader survey (not once but TWICE). In the early 70's here in the United States it defined a generation. As C.S. Lewis once said of his friend's work: &quot;Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I will not elaborate on the contents of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece, others have done that much better, just read some the remaining reviews. Instead I would like to give my two cents to this specific edition: while it is dubbed as &quot;Collector's Edition&quot;, I had to find out the hard way, that it is not really set in new type but only photo-offset from another edition which leads to an irregular print with lots of flaws in the appearance of the different letters. If you know the book, just compare pages 6 (photo-offset) and 7 (conventionally set) for excellent examples of blurred acharacters vs. clarity and excellent readability. In my personal view, this is not the standard I would expect from a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; let alone from the price of this book. - I am extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Tolkien for 45 years and have numerous editions of the trilogy. When I bought the Kindle it was the first book I bought. Sorry, the Kindle version is very poor. Ebooks often are in want of good proofreading but this has a staggering number of typos (proper nouns without capitalization, misspellings etc.) The maps are also missing from this version. For the price they could have done a much better job and honored Professor Tolkien's work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Probably my fault, but I thought it was unabridged - hard to tell in the ad that it's abridged. You can't effectively abridge three books that are 13-15 hours each to 3.5 hours each. I donated it to the local library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien is my hero, and the reason I began writing in the first place. I don't feel like I can write a review that will do him justice, nor do I think I need to - far wiser people than I have written reviews of the books themselves. This is just a note for people who are thinking of buying this particular boxed set.The cover art is beautiful. Fellowship is a panorama of Hobbiton. The Two Towers is a picture of Gandalf and Saruman silhouetted in Orthanc. The Return of the King is a group of riders, probably the Rohirrim. Incidentally, in the back of RotK you get a sneak peek of Eowyn! I was sorry when I first opened one that the map of Middle Earth wasn't in the front of the book...then I saw the huge fold-out map inside the back cover!This is the fourth LOTR boxed set my parents and I own between us (the 1968 version is falling apart, and the one I got for graduation got borrowed &amp; never returned) and I don't regret the money I spent on it.Indeed, my one regret about this set is that they didn't do The Hobbit to include. They could easily have used a picture of Bilbo or the Lonely Mountain on the cover and issued a full set. Still, there are some beautiful editions of The Hobbit out there and I'll pick one eventually to go with this lovely set."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In 1970 I read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the first time. It was like nothing I'd ever read, and it kind of spoiled fantasy for me ever since, because I started with the best and nothing else measures up (well, maybe Narnia). I've read it pretty much every year since, including once out loud to my children. In 1978 my husband gave me the red-leather volume as a wedding present, and it's one of my prized possessions. I have other copies to sling around, but I keep that one at home to read carefully and reverently. I don't know if it's real leather or not, but it's certainly beautiful. Ringers call it the &quot;Red Book&quot;, after Bilbo's Red Book of Westmarch. If I close my eyes I can call up the evocative smell of its pages, and see the beautful elven calligraphy in the margins. My husband also gave me the companion volume of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in green leather. If you get this book, you should get that as well."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings deserves a beautiful edition, and this is NOT it! The &quot;Millennium Edition,&quot; which looks so nice in photographs, is in fact small (each volume is about the size of a trade paperback), badly printed on poor paper, and exceedingly shoddily made (the first time I opened a volume in a bookstore, the binding split right through). The volumes are not even real hardcovers, just paperbacks stuck in thin, skimpy covers of shiny board.I REPEAT: this is a lousy edition, grossly overpriced! Beware of it! You'd be much better off with a set of paperbacks you could replace for $15."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Among the myriad editions of the Lord of the Rings available from Houghton Miflin, the edition featuring Alan Lee's illustrations is the best. Other editions suffer by looking dated, being printed cheaply, and the text offers little surprise by being tiny and unpleasant to the eye. The text in the Blue edition with the illustrations by Lee, however, is much larger, is set better and features a more beautiful, readable typeface. The edition itself is beautfifully bound and wonderfully illustrated. Highly recommended as the one edition to own of this epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is NOT a review of LOTR: It is, rather, specifically about the &quot;Hardcover boxed, Millennium edition (October 1999)&quot; from Houghton Mifflin. First off, LOTR is divided here into six volumes (plus a volume of appendix material) -- not the three volumes one usually sees. The titles of the three usual volumes have therefore changed; but it's not stated where the new titles came from. Are they from Tolkien himself? From his son? Or from some lesser source? (Yes, I know, the original LOTR has Book I, Book II, etc.-- but not different titles for each of these). Second, on the whole these &quot;hardcovers&quot; look a little cheesy to me. The bindings certainly aren't leather: They look kinda like nothing more than cardboard with a glossy lamination. The books' spines have no &quot;give,&quot; either: They, too, are of stiff, unbending cardboard. And finally, it doesn't appear that the paper on which this &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; is printed is acid-free (which lasts longer and doesn't yellow with age). Like the covers, the paper also appears, to my eye, a little cheap. (If a book's paper is acid-free, that fact is usually stated on the copyright page.) So all in all the PHYSICAL aspects of this edition (epecially at a list price of $70!) seem suspiciously second-rate. On the positive side, this edition claims to be free of a large number of typographical errors, misprints, and other textual mistakes that marred earlier editions. Also a plus: The maps of Middle Earth here are clearer and easier to read than those in earlier editions. Yet even this has a down side, however: These nice maps appear ONLY in the 7th and final volume of the boxed set, i.e., in the appendices! Why, oh, WHY weren't the maps run in EACH of the six volumes of the story, so that a reader could easily glance at a map as the tale progresses from volume to volume? Some of the volumes in this edition have several *blank* pages at the end, and therefore they could EASILY have accommodated the maps! Wasn't anybody thinking of the READER when this edition was put together?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Like so many others, I won't review the novel here. It's the best. Read it.This edition, however, puts all the others to shame. It's beautifully printed on extremely high-quality paper, and designed to last. the illustrations are beautiful, and there are just enough of them. Not so many to make it a picture book, if you know what I mean. It doesn't have fold-out maps, but I already have them with my old 2nd editon and the book of the maps of middle earth. The actual back and cover and binding are real cloth-bound and heavy duty. Plus they are red as they should be. (think red book of Westmarch...) This book will last.Also, I HIGHLY recommend this over any of the one-volume editions for one big reason.Weight.It's just too much to hold that big huge 50th anniversary edition in your lap and read. I've had some of the smaller one-volume editions of this book, too, and I gave 'em away, because when I read it, I want to be comfortable."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Despite Tolkien's (reportedly) having intended his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy to be published as one volume, I think you're going to regret it if you but this one-volume paperback edition.It's unwieldy. If you're seriously planning on reading this -- rather than just displaying this on your bookcase -- you're not going to be happy. It's too large to curl up with, too big to hold in your hands comfortably, and you can't open the pages completely without cracking the binding. Having said that, I'll say that the binding on this is possibly the best I've ever seen on a book: you'll have to work it back and forth until it's concave to the text, so that the spine is curved; the pages will never fall out. The problem is that, although I'm an ordinary-sized guy, the thing is so big that my hands get tired holding the thing open.Boy, do I regret giving my 3 Ballantine paperbacks away when I bought this thing. This is one of the only books I own that is pretty much unreadable for physical reasons.Note: the edition this review applies to is ISBN-13: 978-0261103252.

It looks like someone got to it with a box cutter."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy before the movies came out. I definitely disagree with those who say it's not important to read the book since there are spectacular movies on them that follow the book well. First of all, they dont follow the book well. So much is left out. Second of all, if you dont read the books then you miss out on so much detail and depth of the story. You just wouldnt receive the story entirely, and that's pretty sad because of how wonderful the whole thing is. Third of all, the book has so much quality and if you read it you would gain something from it every time you read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's Lord of the Rings works are the unparalleled mantra of the fantasy genre, absolute must-read material. Persons desiring to just read and enjoy these volumes may get along fine with a paperback edition. However, those fans who desire a beautifully presented, quality hardcover version of the works can do no better than to acquire this particular edition.The Lord of The Rings is a work that defined the genre and set the stage for many, many other fantasy writers that followed. Dr. Tolkien's intent was to present the work not as an isolated telling of tales but rather as a historical recounting of events as they occurred within the context of his extensive mythological universe. Although such a statement may make one disposed to thinking the mateiral will be bland, it is in fact one of the most complex, colorful, engrossing fantasy journeys one can hope to find. Characters of diverse fantastical races with immense depth and personal motivations strive against an all-encompassing, ancient, and singular evil. Their efforts are painted against a world so resplendent in its detail and authenticity that readers cannot be blamed for becoming lost in its descriptions. No greater work of fantasy fiction can be found.The added appeal of this particular edition is the inclusion of fifty watercolor paintings from reknowned Tolkien artist Alan Lee. Though Tolkien's written words are more than enough to germinate the seed of imagination in any readers mind, it is interesting to see his world through Mr. Lee's brushstrokes particularly considering Alan's painintings and talents were used to great effect is bringing The Lord of The Rings to life in Peter Jackson's recent films. In one particular example, Alan's rendition of the valley of Rivendell is recreated in the film almost detail-for-detail, breathing three-dimensional life into his painted work, and it's very satisfying, certainly for fans of both artist and author.Again, for the discriminating fan, this is an exceptional volume to add to your Tolkien library, one that should bring a new element of enjoyment to your next reading of Dr. Tolkien's classic work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return Of The King are wonderful books written by a great author named J.R.R.

I have only read these three remarkable books once , but I will one day read them all over again. The Hobbit is another wonderful book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. But , if I were you , I would read The Hobbit before The Lord Of The Rings because all three of The Lord Of The Rings books are one big sequal of The Hobbit. You would be sort of lost if you read The Lord Of The Rings books before The Hobbit , so read The Hobbit first like I did.

The Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece, acclaimed time and again, what with its silver-screen debut. Aside from being nearly the textbook of fantasy, it truly has a history in the world of Tolkien that is as long and intricate as even our own. Throughout the Lord of the Rings there are references to this larger history which give it such an enormous feeling of depth. I know many, including myself, who have read and reread the Lord of the Rings; although you really either love or hate it, there is no in between.I encourage you to read through this diverse work, and find out for yourself the magic of the most infamous work of Professor Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No matter what edition you have of Lord of the Rings, what's important is thast you have it. Not three books, but in reality one whole book in three volumes, Lord of the Rings is, IMO, the greatest novel ever written. Filled with awe and majesty that pervades the O so real world of Middle Earth, this is a tale about power, heroism, coming of age, and much more, telling the magical story of the young hobbit, Frodo, sacrificing all to do what he knows is right. I will not reveal any more, for it is an experience that one must face alone. I'll just say that it comes to the most climactic ending I've ever read. Don't take the story literally of course: everyone should know that good and evil do not exist in people the way they do here. It is however, a picture of what goes on within us all as we try to find our inner goodness. Lord of the Rings is essentially a god as a fairy tale is a human; an immensely enhanced form of the fairy tale for all to read and enjoy. Don't take my word for it: read it yourself. It will change your life.(note: for best effect, read the book first, THEN see the movies)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Despite all the hype and hoopla, the fanatical adoration, and silliness attached to it, this book is (or these books are--however you care to look at it or them) pretty good. The incessant questing is tedious, the hero-making gratuitous, and the monsters annoying, but I liked hiking about on foot in the open. I liked the absence of automobiles, trains, planes, and busses. I liked immersing myself in this other world for a considerable stretch of time.The author is very accomplished at manipulating the English language: he's got chops; but this is hardly a literary masterpiece.

However, if I may, let me put forth my own opinion of Tolkien. I started with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when I was an 11 year old lad and it really inspired me to make reading a serious hobby. Thousands of books later (many of the fantasy genre), this series still holds up as the most original, beautifully written piece of literature ever created by one man. Even the Bible (for those Christians in the reviewing audience) was written by many men and many parts of the Old Testament were blatant copies of stories included in the mythology of more ancient religions. Any Tolkien fan should have a fine, hardbound edition on his bookshelves to read and to pass on to future generations."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is THE standard set by J.R.R. Tolkien against which all fantasy novels and stories are measured!There simply is no other way to put it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I recently purchased the single volume illustrated version of the Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien,The Lord of the Rings (Illustrated Edition). This is probably only for the (at least) semi-fanatical Tolkien fan.I had owned a set of soft cover individual books (all four: Hobbit, Fellowship, Two Towers, Return) that were published in 1964 (before I was born), and they had, unfortunately, deteriorated, both from age and rough use (read in the bathtub, at the park just before a rain shower, jammed in a briefcase to be read at lunch, etc.) I thought about simply buying the new individual paperbacks, but researched and found this illustrated version, published in 1991, on the 100th anniversary of Tolkien's birth.The bad news: this thing is massive! Holding one giant volume and actually reading it presents some problems.That being said, this is THE version of the story, presented as Tolkien intended it: \\"One book to rule them all\\" to paraphrase the master. The size of the book emphasizes that this is the definitive work of twentieth-century fantasy. The red sash bookmark is classy. The illustrations are nice, and add an excellent counter-point to the words. To again paraphrase Tolkien's critique of his own work, \\"I only wish there were more [illustrations].\\" (Of course, there are plenty of books out there with a great deal of artwork, enough to satisfy just about everyone.)In the end, this is like buying your mixed drinks in a bar, and insisting on top shelf alcohol. A real devotee can appreciate the difference, but to the average person is it really worth the extra money? As a bit of a Tolkien fanatic (I have read the story about fifteen times in the last thirty years), the $40+ bucks was worth it, even though I could have purchased a whole new set of the four in paperback for at least $10 less.For each potential buyer, take the advice of Galadriel and look inside yourself. If you don't get that reference, this is probably not for you. If you do, and are nodding your head as you read this, call now and have your credit card ready!Chuck Hinton"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Finally, 50 years later, Houghton Mifflin is able to assemble the Masterpiece that Tolkien dreamed of so many years ago. This leather bound edition is complete with all 6 books, gilded pages, it's own cloth bookmark, as well as appendices full of additional information. It allows for Tolkien's story to become a tale, his dream a reality. Such a work of art is a must have for Tolkien enthusiasts and book collectors alike. At $53 dollars, it was money well spent.The only con i see is that it is so beautiful, you don't even want to open it! More seriously, be careful with the fold-out maps. They take a little coaxing to unfold as they are glued at the corners. The cover of the book does seem a little thin considering the weight and amount of pages, but it has held up fine for me. Despite these small \\"problems\\", this IS a five star book in every way possible. Thank you for your time-Matt"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is by far the best edition in terms of looks, durability, quality, and definitely the ease of reading. Most versions of this book are split into 3, and most are paperbacks, with small font squeezed into the pages so that if you hold it in your lap you cover half the text. But with this version, the pages are tall and the margins are big which make it a much easier lap read, not to mention the text stands out so well its like your reading an entirely different book, i had a much more pleasurable time reading this version then any of the others, thanks Amazon!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Little can be said of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" except that it is a masterpiece of not only the fantasy genre, but literature as a whole. The languages, history, characters, places, adventures, and pure imagination that can be found in this work have not since been matched by any author.Fortunately, this collector's edition does Tolkien justice. The overall product quality is excellent. Durability is always an issue with every book, and is especially important when the text is of such high caliber. The pages are thin but quite strong and resistant to accidental tears. The cover is of a similar quality. The font is larger than some paperback editions, making it easier to read.Finally, it is important to note that without a map of not only Middle Earth in its entirety, but also of the Shire, it is difficult for the readers to picture the geography of the world, and thus hinders their understanding of the work. This edition includes not only a fold-out map of Middle Earth, but a detailed map of the Shire before the beginning of Book One.This edition fufills all of my requirements for what is needed in every copy of Tolkien's text, and is an overall beautiful addition to any library. My edition of preference for both newcomers and those already familiar with this incredible piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As you read through the reviews of this book you will notice that many readers acknowledge the fact that they re-read this book over and over. I too have read LOTR many times through and prior to owning this version, I had a paper back collection that was ratted and torn and dog earred from many hours of use. This 50th Anniversary Edition is simply beautiful with a rich leather binding, gold foil imprints on the cover, and gold leaf gilded edge pages. This is a book that is not only beautiful, but will certainly stand up to the test of time for many readings.I received this as a Christmas gift as I had already given away my paperbacks to a friend so he could read them. I won't be asking for them back now. The quality of the paper, the printing, and a sewn in book mark all contribute to the exquisite quality of this edition. This book is made for the Tolkien fan and all who re-read this amazing epic on a regular basis. Not much more can be said than what all the other reviews already say, except that this book will become a classic addition to any library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Unlike most, I should imagine, I read the books after I saw the film. At first I found it a little hard going, as I had a pre-engraved picture of everything that happened in the LOTR from the movie. It was a little hard casting that aside and accepting that the movie was in fact a portrayal of these wonderful books. So if you're struggling to get into the first installment - The Fellowship of the Ring - have no fear, you're not alone, but once you accept that things in the movie weren't exactly how the book was written, you discover a whole world in which you never knew existed in the movies.Don't get me wrong, the movies were amazing (the Oscars show that) but these books are in a league of their own. Everything you thought you knew from the movies is explained, and indeed extended, in this paper form. Tolkien was a magnificent man with one hell of an ability to create a world and make you believe in it.I think the movie some what miss-portrayed some characters, especially Faramir; in the book I got the impression he was a wise heir to the stewardship of Gondor with knowledge beyond his years which I don't think the movie did justice.I never anticipated these books being as good as the films......boy was I wrong! Tolkein is a genius, a thoroughly enjoyable read, so much so that I was disappointed to rejoin the 21st Century from the depths of middle earth when I had to put down the book and go to Uni! 100/10!!!PS - this has to be mentioned, the Appendix is really worth a read as it explains things that were perhaps only touched upon in the books and it gives you a brief account of the rest of the third age until all members of the fellowship have passed on!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just recieved this edition of the Lord of the Rings as a holiday gift, and am delighted with it.

Now here it is in one great volume, just its author would have wished!I wish I knew how to express my joy at being able to read the saga whole in one book. For those of us whose reading experience consists of jumping back many pages to refresh our memory, or jumping forward to the appendix to remind ourselves of the vast scope of this fantasy world, the ability to do this without keeping track of three separate books is a God-send. For the first time, the story flowed seamlessly from volume to volume, without the artificial boundaries presented by three sets of front and back covers.If you read and reread the LOTR (as many of us do,) I suggest you treat yourself to the single volume experience. It's an even greater read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I orded this book because I wanted a worthy bound edition of The Lord of the Rings that would be a great part of my collection.First off Id like to comment on the delivery. I ordered quite a few books, so to conserve a few bucks I went with the Free Super-Savers Option. I ordered them on the 14th and it estimated that they would arrive between the 24th and the 26th. I recieved my books on the 19th, a full 5 days before the estimate, so as far as shipping goes, Amazon did an amazing job.As far reviewing the story, Im going to omit that part as I believe that most of the people who order this book have already read The Lord of the Rings, and believes it to be a wonderful work of art. (otherwise why would they order a 63 dollar copy of the book?)Now for the most important part, the Review of the actual book itself. The book is simply stunning. It has a great smooth leather cover, with wonderful gilded pages and great foil stamping on the cover. You'll be a little weirded out at first with the pages because of the gilding they are slightly stuck together, however, after thumbing through it a few times it improves. Also, the map at the begining of the book is delightful as are the color images of the Dwarf Book inside.I believe that any Lord of the Rings fan would be stunned with book and will cherise it as a wonderful addition to their collection."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A beautiful & comprehensive edition, which incorporates all the final textual changes (\\"omentielmo/omentielvo\\") that have been brought to light. According to the Note on the 50th Anniv. Edition (Hammond & Scull, pg. xviii) \\"between three and four hundred emendations\\". The type has been reset and the edges gilded, adding to the luster of the work. Finally the inclusion of the Leaves from the Book of Marzabul are a welcome feature for Prof. Tolkien had wished them included in the earlier publications, yet they were only available in the Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien. As with the Red Book leather bound edition, the single volume is both useful and an heirloom, and this edition takes strides over the Red Book.I must make one objection, however, to the finished project. The box cover has a rejected sketch of Minas Tirith that will give first time readers an incorrect image when they read the story. Far better would have been one of the pictures of Rivendell, Helm's Deep and the Deeping Coomb, or even a Pauline Barnes illustration.All that in account I found this to be the most striking edition (to date) of all the publications I have seen, and wonder what is left to add to all future editions.Lamhfada"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As an owner of numerous editions, I welcome this latest revision in honour of the 50th anniversary. The soft leather cover is quite nice to the touch and the printing quality is superlative. The numerous revisions to the text are welcome and the two-coloured printing in spots is similar to the deluxe editions from 30 years ago.If you desire an excellent edition at a very affordable price, this is the one to get. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you are a 'LOTR' fan then this is the edition to have. I have had all of the edition's so far & this is the best. It has a leather cover which is dark gray & the pages are stitched not just guled & restored text it is well worth the price Amazon has for it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is not possible to add anything to the review of the story of the &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; rather then to say that this is a spectacular epic story of the mythological proportions. Tolkien was motivated by a variety of linguistic, antropological and mythtological factors to bring us the Universe of the Middle Earth. As such this achievement is without a precedence in world literature.To the point of this particular edition. It contains original illustrations by Tolkien himself, with the typesettings simular to the original edition. Although the book is quite large (1000+ pages) it opens and holds well and the paper quality is oustanding for the price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well i'm 16 now, and ever since I was 4, I knew the lord of the rings as Ian Holm, John le Measurer, William neigh, and Michael Hordon interpreted it. Don't get me wrong, the new film is good, but in my opinion no one can match William Neigh as Sam! as I was watching the film I kept hearing their voices over the actors. I think that the reason that I love this version adapted by Brian Sibly, is because it was how I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings, and if I'd grown up with Sir Ian McKellen, and Elijah Wood then I'd perfer that. I don't think that any one, ANY ONE, can beat William Neigh as Sam, Peter Woodthorp as Gollum and Michael Hordon as Gandalf. I really do believe that this cannot be bettered. It's chock full of stunning performances by Englands finest actors. When I listen to them I travel back to the family car trips through Scotland or England or Wales. I only wish now that they had adapted The Hobbit with the same amazing actors as this. If you do decide to buy this version, I can tell you now that you won't regret it!, it's definatly worth the money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First off, I am not about to attempt to review the content of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy - this has been done hundreds of times by professional book reviewers and thousands of times over by readers and fans.Instead, I will report what makes THIS PARTICULAR edition different than the several dozen other editions available.In truth, not much. It has a nice leather-ish (NOT leather, mind you, just leather-ish) cover, and a nice leather-ish slipcase. It has some graphics from the story badly misplaced (the runes from the enterance to Moria badly mangled to look like cover hinges) on the cover in silver leaf. It's red (those familiar with the Hobbit stories would know that any IMPORTANT book is bound in red). The paper is higher quality than a paperback but is far from top grade rag paper. In has a map glued in the back which is bigger and nicer than any of the maps in any of the paperback editions I've seen.It contains the exact same text, including all appendices as the low cost paperbacks, no more, no less. If you want a nice red leather-ish book for the bookcase, this is as good as any."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I recently bought this book and i was very nervous that the quality would have been as bad as some had said. I am very very relieved to tell you that i can hardly notice the uneveness in the text. The &quot;broken letters&quot; can't even be seen (by me), and the overall quality of the book is amazing. So, if you are surfing the reviews wondering if this is the book for you, dont worry, you wont regret it. I was very worried and most people seem to talk about the book material rather than the edition, which is all well and good. Dont be fooled, you will not regret this purchase. If you are wondering if it is the copy for you or not, then this book should do it. The only other nice edition is the one with illustrations. Some people like illustrations, i do not. It seems to take away from the story, but each to his own i suppose. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just received the boxed hard cover edition. I had read some other reviews about how terrible the quality would be, but this edition has a wonderful 'Old-timey' feel. Cloth covers with attractive dust covers. The print is the older style serif font like fine old literature. Each volume feels like a real book. The appendices and maps are wonderful. My only wish would be for acid free paper, so I don't have to get a new copy every 20-25 years.As for the story...I read this trilogy many times several years ago. My sisters and I have named pets after characters, bought Hidebrandt calendars to see what the characters look like, and spent many an evening discussing various aspects of the plot. It is a wonderful story full of great heros and truly sinister villains, wizards and monsters, good and evil. It has become a part of my life. I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When author J.R.R. Tolkien released the last installment of the Lord of the Rings in 1955, it was as though he had tilled a seismic line in the sands of fantasy and fiction literature: Before Tolkien and After Tolkien. With his extraordinary depth of characters and storyline, scrutiny of detail, and flowing, serial writing style, the author - in one swift stroke - redefined a genre of modern literature in much the same way that the great bards in Shakespeare's time recast the foundations of drama and the spoken word. The story begins in the fictional land of Middle-Earth, a place not unlike our own in days gone by. Turquoise streams and chill valleys cut across the scenery; intimate villages and great stone cities dot the landscape; and an endless array of interesting characters, both kindly good and plotting evil, wait to be met. The reader first meets Frodo Baggins, the book's protagonist, in a town called Hobbiton - a mythical Pleasantville, USA where the grass is mowed and one's neighbors are just down the road. Frodo is a Hobbit, a kind, soft-footed creature of small stature. He could be any one of us, an Everyday Joe going about their tasks of today. But a mission soon thrust in his hands by Middle-Earth's powers-that-be? To destroy the One Ring, a fulcrum symbol of absolute power, creation and authority... and the one device that may end the world. In short, Lord of the Rings is truly epic: It is chock-full of battles, heroism, romance, comradeship, royalty, long-days, cold nights, plot twists. But Tolkien's ability to capture the imagination of the everyday reader is, perhaps, his greatest accomplishment. The reader feels drained at the conclusion of Frodo's remarkable journey, but filled with new experiences, as if one was actually there riding, walking and fighting with him and his colleagues. Tolkien succeeds in stimulating our emotions and diverting our minds, while clasping our hearts in a way that no other epic has before."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Do yourself a favor and read this. Go on the journey that so many have gone on before you. This magical adventure is timeless."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not exaggerating, you should read these books multiple times. Not only is the language beautifully orchestrated to give five-sense impressions in the nature of each character and place described, this thrilling, action-packed adventure grips the imagination and inspires the soul to new heights. Tolkien thoroughly immerses readers in cultures and places so believable and yet so unreal that you can't help traveling there again and again. These books aren't just stories, they're the surface of a world full of languages, histories, beliefs, cultures, friends, dangerous, and natures all their own. Appropriate for ages 12+, both boys and girls, and adutls at every age. Because of intense battle scenes and descriptive gore I would avoid for children younger than 12."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This one volume edition of LOTR is great. The books are a wonderful read, and never get old. If you haven't read them before, or have only seen the movies, definitely give these books a try."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love LOTR and have since I was a child. I also drive a lot for work now, so I listen to a lot of audio books. This LOTR audio book is the worst audio book I've ever listened to. In fact, it is actually painful to listen to. Many of the voice actors are either bad or annoying. The voice actor for Frodo sounds like a bad high school drama student reading a script. The sound effects seem to be made by someones Casio keyboard. Also, the sound level is so low on these discs that you have to crank up the volume then get blasted when you eject them. No matter how much you like LOTR, I cannot recommend this awful recording. I have the Hobbit and Silmarillion on audio book, and they are both much much better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"From the first time I read this book as a teenager until now, it has captured my attention and imagination every time.I'm always amazed at the author's ability to create such a rich and detailed history, current story, and future events.Read this classic and beautiful book (all volumes in one) and be swept away in a land of magic, triumph, love, and friendship."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Nothing beats the classics.

I don't think I need to review the work itself -- some love every word, some find it dull in written form, you make up your own mind. This edition adds an interesting introduction on the history of the various editions of the work. My only slight criticism is that the footnotes are placed all the way at the end of the book, rather than at the ends of the chapters, but otherwise it seems a perfectly good version of this classic work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read and re-read The Lord of the Rings and each time there is more to be found.

This is a great edition of the novel because you get all of the books in one. Excellent Excellent Read. I couldn't put it down. Loved the Kindle edition because you could click on the chapters and be taken right to that spot in the book from the index. GREAT BUY!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was one of the first fantasy novels I have read. To date it remains the very best of the lot. It's easy to see why. Tolkien spent a good part of his life in coming up with this epic. The story is vast encompassing multiple characters of different races yet with their human emotions and misgivings. Tolkien fleshes out a wonderful world in Middle Earth, and gives proper attention to details as with time and places in the story. For a first timer to fantasy epics it might be little difficult to get through entire volume, but its been split into three separate volumes and can be better read likewise. I would recommend this book to all people who love good stories. For those who haven't had enough other volumes from Tolkien like the Hobbit should come handy. Die hard fantasy fans can immerse themselves in the additional footnotes provided by Tolkien describing the language of Middle Earth, history, family tree and clans of Middle Earth, highly recommended. Best to watch Peter Jackson's trilogy after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The product was an excellent gift. The product description did not lied; it has all this amazing features, like for example: the maps. Its hard cover case protects the book of any type of damage."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've owned this book for a long time (about 15 years) and have recently taken it out to reread. Even after having been read a number of times it still looks as good as new. Not that a little wear and tear wouldn't be good for this book. It's just one of those kind of books that actually gains character as it ages. As you can probably see, I am quite emotionally attached to this book, both the story of the Lord of the Rings and well as the actual physical book I own. I believe this is the book Tolkien wanted to publish, and I can almost see Frodo hand-writing his story into it.I would maybe prefer it if the leather was a bit more brown, and that the golden scrolls on the cover were a bit deeper and wider, but on the whole I love it and definitely recommend it to all fans of Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings. I am also certain that the cover is made of genuine, high quality leather."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down.

A full set of maps from the complete 'Lord of the Rings' epic is presented in this volume. The book begins where 'The Hobbit' left off as Bilbo Baggins throws his farewell birthday party and struggles to leave a malign and little understood 'ring of power' to his nephew, Frodo. The remainder of the volume follows Frodo and his various companions on what are usually hair-raising adventures that require all the courage, stamina and luck each of the participants can muster. Will their mission succeed? Even were it to succeed, would the outcome of events be changed?While this book is a fantasy, its basic bones are very believable as regards to atmosphere, psychology, suspense and even moments of terror. There are epic events of flight from danger, flight into danger and of massive and brutal skirmishes and battles with the 'soul of the world' hanging in the balance. 'Zillions' of fans read and reread these books so it is very welcome that sturdy versions are on the market. You, too, will enjoy the story and the use of this edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Not much to say other than if you love the movies, this book fills in the gaps in the the story line and explains the characters in more detail."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The book of course is excellent, however, the maps in the ebook are far too small and not possible to zoom bigger.

While its literary merit is often questioned by ivory tower critics, it remains a mythpoeic epic that fascinates the masses. Many have tried to replicate Tolkein's fantasy world; few have even come close to his imaginative vision, at least in the realm of sword and sorcery.Even as a kid in junior high, I remember staying up late into the night, tucked into my blankets with the light on long past my bedtime, reading LOTR several times over, again and again. The books have an alluring, spellbinding effect, transporting the fanciful minded reader into a world that is both more celestial and more hideous than the mundane one we are accustomed to. But is LOTR a great literary work, on the level of Shakespeare or Chaucer or Homer? There is a certain greatness to it, no doubt, but I suspect not. It's interesting that Tolkein derived some similes from Homer in \\"Return of the King,\\" comparing a swarm of orcs to insects in language that is a clear allusion to Homer, perhaps hinting that Tolkein may have intended it to be some sort of epic. But while LOTR is a great fantasy work, I don't believe it's on par with Homer and those so-called \\"great authors,\\" simply because it lacks the same depth. To put it frankly, the work doesn't pose any major questions about the nature of reality, the human condition, metaphysics, or philosophy, like those other luminaries. It spins a good yarn with some metaphysical threads, but doesn't leave us pushing beneath the layers of reality beyond that.MP Gunderson, author of The Planet Keepers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read the LOTR when I was in 3rd-4th grade, and believe me, I have been profoundly affected by it like no other fantasy genre.It gave me a clear sense of what was right and what was wrong, and it also showed me that the temptation of power is a force that is inexblicably hard to cope with. LOTR had a profound effect on society in the past, and now, with the world at war, I hope that people shall read this book, and be comforted by the fact that good shall overcome evil."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Bought this set for my 16 year old brother for Christmas.He loved it!

Tolkien's use of languages and encompassing a massive landscape based on medieval England, combined with his extensive use of multiple races (Elves, Men, Dwarves, etc.) prove, without a doubt, that he was a very talented author. His extensive histories in the appendices of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; show how much depth he had and how much he wanted to inspire his readers. His use of good vs. evil, while not really original, shows that he cared about the influence that his books might have. All in all, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is definitely one of the classic 20th century epics and is a brilliant depiction of Tolkien's inner thoughts."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This set of books will cause one to burn the midnight oil.

Against horrible odds he does this, but for better or worse, the Third age is over, and the Fourth age, the Age of men, begins.I vote this as one of the best books ever created, and a classic for all generations. Tolkien has created a whole other world for us to delight in."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a great story! I really enjoyed reading it.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhh, Lord of the rings. A celabrated book by a celabrated author. The 1000+ page, full volume leaves you spellbound, caught up in the mystical world of middle earth.It may be long but don't let that perturb you for every page is bursting at the seams with wonder. To boost my point a relative of mine read the whole thing over 2 days. Lord of the Rings is a brilliant book and I highly recommend it to any good reader."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though I still have some pages to finish of this one-volume novel, I must say that it has been quite a book. Tolkien definitely knows how to keep his readers interested throughout, and the Lord of the Rings truly works better as a single novel than three separate books, with the pacing of the story. I'll not say anything about the plot: it's quite famous, and there is no need to elaborate on it. If you want to know the story, then you should go read it.J.R.R. Tolkien has some wonderful characterization and seems to be good at making multiple plotlines, involving different groups of characters at different places, really showing how vital each is to the grand scheme of things. A great telling.The reason why I do not give this book five stars, though, is mainly because it really seems to drag sometimes. During my reading of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; at the beginning and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; I had to force myself at some points to continue, though that was near the end. Now I am nearing the end of &quot;Return of the King&quot; and am quite saddened at the fact that these adventures are drawing to a close, but I am quite happy with the way the story is ending so far. Definitely a must read for anyone that claims to be a fan of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R.

He pays so much attention to detail that you feel you are walking right along with the travelers.The first book is the slowest of the three, but not any less captivating, it allows you to get acquainted with the characters and builds a connection with them that you feel in the other two.This is not your typical mid-evil-type adventure book. Tolkien doesn't try to capture you by bashing you over the head with constants battles and gory bloody fight scenes. In fact for how long the story was, I expected more fight but was not disappointed in how many there were.In just under 1500 pages, the edition I bought, he takes you through one of the most magical stories ever told.The language, characters speak in old English, can get a bit thick at times and you might get lost in some places unless you are very familiar with it, but none the less you would be captivated by his words if it were written in Chinese!When you are finally done with the third book, you want to turn around and read the whole thing again for fear of having missed something.Magical is the only way you can truly describe this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This thick paperback packs in all three of Tolkien's classic fantasy books under one cover, making it a highly recommended pick for any newcomer to the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.

As a person who has not read a large amount of books i thought that perhaps a book of this size and complexity would not hold my interest but how wrong could i have been. Tolkien creates a world of pure fantasy, but at the same time there is a reality about Middle Earth because of the increadible attention to detail, everything and everyone has a history and a purpose. The story of ultimate good against ultimate evil is a tale that grabs the imaginaton but when it is interwoven with a beautifully diverse world then you have a book that you cannot put down. If you are a lover of books and have not read this book then you are missing out but if you do read this book it will make every book after sparse and dull in comparison."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one book very close to my heart. I first read this book when I was eight - that's about six years ago now - and I find it extremely sad that everyone has cought on how wonderful this book is after the movie came out. The movie was simply brilliant, and i have nothing against it since it was just to the book. But when it comes to literature as great as this, why did people turn a blind eye? I'm glad that people are reading it now...it is definitely a must read book...but it just makes it a cult book, such as Harry Potter, and although it is a very good book, it cannot rival a classic like this.This collector's edition is stunning. I had the paperback edition of all three books in one, where there was a painting of gandalf on the cover. The contents of that book and this one are the exact same, but unfortuneately a leak from my air conditioning wrecked my book collection.

Full of hobbits, elves, orcs, and dwarves you become completely absorbed in it. I have only one complaint...I wanted it to be longer!The whole concept of the book is amazing in the first place, and JRR Tolkien makes it come alive. You will be on the edge of your seat half the time, perspiring from your anxiousness.It's about a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who inherits a ring that can rule the whole world if it goes into the wrong hands. Frodo and his fellowship that will take the journey with him, (Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn, Boromir, and Merry, Pippin, and Samwise the Hobbits), are set on destoying the ring by throwing it into the fire chasm of Mount Doom. One by one, the fellowship will eventually turn on Frodo, and so he has no choice but to leave on his own with Sam, who will be a great help. With enemy orcs and spies swarming Middle Earth, it is an almost impossible task he has undertaken.I don't want to give away anymore, but i highly suggest reading this book, or at least seeing the movie. It is jam-packed with twists and turns, suprises, and wonderful in depth descriptions. Definatly a must read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read these books for the first time almost ten years ago, and through those ten years, I must have ready them about five more times since. I'm so happy that a movie has been made(I always wondered if anyone would attempt such a fete), a decent one at that. It doesn't compare, however, to the actuall books. Like others have commented, a lot was passed over in these movies. So for those interested in the more vague areas of the flix to be explained, READ THESE WONDERFUL BOOKS. I do recomend, for those less advanced readers, to take your time reading and absorbing. There is abundant detail in every chapter that could get a bit confusing if you go to fast. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just finished reading this book (it is actually three books in one), and I am very impressed, to say the least. Perhaps I will add more at a later date, but for now I am still somewhat stunned. For now I will say only that it is by far the best work of fiction that I have ever read, and I doubt I will ever read a better book. It is a very long read, but I already feel the urge to read it again from cover to cover as soon as I possibly can."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The quality of the construction of this book is befitting to the tale that it tells. I especially appreciate that it contains the appendices that many versions do not. Its only drawback is that it does not include detailed maps of Middle-earth that are found in some of the singular books, only the large overview."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What's there to say that hasn't already been said? The book (actually, books) are massive, intricate, spellbinding, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Not only did Tolkien create his own world, with its own species, languages, and geography; he also started a new genre.If not in the same league as Dostoevsky and Kafka, as Milton and Dante, he is a literary master in his own regard, and more impacting in a sense that more people enjoy and read his works. A marvellous book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings (Leatherette edition) is by far the best book to own. I am 14 and I have read The Lord of the Rings 13 times. Tyhe leatherette edition comes with all 3 volumes of the trilogy. It comes with many maps and drawings. It has a large fold out map in the back for reference. It is worth the 50 dollars (Definitly). This book is a must own. And it is a hard book to damage because of the slide case. Hey, what are you waiting for. Buy it already."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings three times in my teens and twenties and decided it was time to try it again to see if it still moved me as much as it did before. I decided to listen to the audiobook version (unabridged, of course; beware of many abridged versions of this and other long books). Narrator Roy Inglis does an excellent job of acting out the myriad of voices in this vast novel. He even sings the many songs, some in the Elvish language. I highly recommend the audiobook, especially to anyone already familiar with the story; hearing it read adds a dimension. If you haven't yet read it, it might be better to read the print version as there are many subplots and characters to keep track of. I think the Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of literature in the English language. I'm afraid that it is often dismissed as a mere genre novel, of interest only to fantasy enthusiasts. In truth, I think it is more akin to an epic novel like War and Peace. Indeed, having read the latter fairly recently I was struck by some similarities. Not in the writing style, but in the scope and the amazing subtleties of character. Both novels, in addition to being centered on great wars, focus on the importance of smaller characters and apparent random chance in the making of history. The most impressive quality of Tolkien's novel is the way he literally created a completely believable world that is at once beautiful and terrible. The descriptions of geography, languages and the various races of folk sometimes seem excessive, but these serve to create an unparalleled authenticity. Tolkien's Middle Earth is more plausible than the \\"real\\" places of most other writers. One could write an entire book on some of the philosophical and spiritual implications of LOR, especially on the topic of duality. Some, including myself, are not comfortable with the apparent Manichean quality of his universe, where everything seems to be good vs. evil. There may even be some justification for claims that the book has certain ethnocentric qualities -e.g. the constant association of black with evil and white with good, and also the tendency of good being associated with the West, and evil with the East. However, the book also contains enough subtleties and shadings to compensate for this; characters such as Gollum and Saruman, who exist on a shaky moral precipice, show that Tolkien did not see life in simplistic terms. Beyond all of this, and most importantly, The Lord of the Rings is simply one of the most entertaining and exciting novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\" are wonderful books written by a great author named J.R.R.

Tolkien can create the entire world of Middle Earth in your mind is breath-taking. So far, I am reading the Two Towers and I cannot put the book down. I recommend that you read the Hobbit (also by J.R.R. Tolkien) to understand things. For example, it would help you understand how Bilbo acquired the ring and how Sauron, the evil lord of Mordor, created the ring of power. READ THE HOBBIT OR YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY LOST IN THE BOOKS. This book is meant to distinguish good between evil, so read it to your children and let them read it. No harm will be done. I believe it is 1,008 pages, but well worth the time and trouble. If it is confusing I recommend you read it over again. The Lord of the Rings is most likely the best trilogy written in the world.

All his words flow in a smooth, simple way and the book never gets boring. What I really loved about this novel was the characters. Gandalf the wizard seems to be, not only my favorite, but the most well devoloped character in the whole entire trilogy. He's very wise and always expresses his ideas and opinions on certain problems happening around the company. He's not your typical wizard though. There's something about Gandalf that intruges me. Well one thing is for sure, a psychologist would love to analyze this guy's personality. He seems to have a personality &quot;too real&quot; for a fantasy novel. And that's probably one of the many reasons why I consider this fantasy novel to be the best to date."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"i am not a book fan. but as soon as i seen the movie for this, i wanted to see what the book was like. and being my first book, it was even better than the movie. there wasnt a dull moment in ths book.

They aren't characters that i feel i can cheer os gasp for."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is not meant to slight the genius--yes, genius--of J.R.R. Tolkien or his imaginary world. Countless millions have found sustenance in this incredible tale. Moreover, the trilogy practically spawned the entire genre of \\"fantasy\\" and inspired innumerable writers to their craft. The debt we all owe to this trilogy is unpayable. However, as a read, the trilogy is a bit of a slog. I labored through it first as an eleven year old and then as a 25 year old. Both times I found it difficult to get through pages of elven songs, multi-layered histories, and a universe that was bigger that its author could control.With many readers and critics, I find the first book's 100 page romp with Tom Bombodil an awful diversion from the journey. Anyone reading the first book (or the trilogy) would do well to simply bypass those 100 pages without the least cost to your understanding or pleasure. The Bombodil misadventure foreshadows many lesser diversions and deviations from the story.Yes, its almost unthinkable but true: the trilogy could have been even richer had Tolkien been as good a writer as he was an inventor. Another heresy: for storytelling the films (some of the best movies ever made) were actually better than the novels.When you survey the reviews here know this: a five-star rating is orthodox among Tolkien fans and fantasy fans. And many of these devotees have read the trilogy multiple times: like the Bible it gets easier and more readable on later reads, because one becomes more learned and literate in the land of Middle Earth.If you're looking for a world with infinite depths of imagination, you have arrived at the right place. If, however, you are also looking for a pleasurable read, you can do better elsewhere. To get through this three part novel (let's be honest: it's a 1200 page novel, not a trilogy), one has to be willing to do a lot of work--it's more than Tolkien himself can carry."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is an epic fantasy of magic and a battle between the forces of evil and those of good. It is a long tale, in three parts, and it is mostly good. However, there are portions in parts two and three that are somewhat boring. Part three is .. I guess the best word is: dark. This is not some cute tale for young children. This is a myth-like, complicated, story for adults.You see: Bilbo, the Hobbit brought a ring back from his adventure, many years ago. Now, Gandolf finds that \\"Bilbo's ring\\" is one of a set of rings and is magically very powerful. Gandolf decides that it must be destroyed. But, there is only one way to destroy it and a long and dangerous journey will be necessary. For the next several hundred pages we trek through that difficult journey.I am glad that I read the story. It is quite good. However, the tendency to drag along, more and more slowly as the story moves on, is not a plus.While this printing is reasonably nice, the price seems steep for what the customer gets.Buy it.

It was a super page turner. Everybody should read this book and they will love it. Most people will enjoy this book. The plot is very easy to follow for most readers. If you enjoy action adventure books this one is for you. There is no lack of characters in this book. The amount of characters in this is nearly overwhelming but the detail in which they are portrayed is stunning. The detail in which the environment is written in is very good. The plot starts with a group of people called hobbits. These hobbits don't move around a lot. They like to stay by themselves. There are two hobbits that are very adventurous. These hobbits embark on a journey that takes them to all ends of the land called Middle earth. On their long journey they meet several groups of people. On Their journey they are accompanied by men, an elf, and a dwarf. These people all help the two hobbits meet their goal and they all grow very fond of each other. They all have many battles and travel long distances. At the end of this book there are many surprising plot twists. There are also some surprising aspects with the characters.

Bounded in leather, with gilded pages and silk-textured book marker, this edition complements the reading experience magnificently. The leather has a high-quality feel, and so do the pages inside, although the spine looks a little thin for such a heavy book.You can also find two maps which open horizontally and vertically as they are very large, plus the Shire Area map at the beginning of the story. Furthermore, this edition has a Notes on the Text section by Douglas A. Anderson, who does a great job in explaining all the modifications this story has suffered since its original publication. The publishers also added a set of notes about this edition and the changes they did to it.Additionally, just before Chapter 5 of Book II (The Bridge of Khazad-Dm) you will find a couple of colour pages with reproductions of three pages of the Book of Mazarbul (the one that Gandalf reads in Moria with the account of Balin's expedition into this mines), which were created by Tolkien for the publication of The Fellowship of the Ring, but were not added at the time.Given all this, I am sure that most of J.R.R. fans will really appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"An extremely impressive presentation...my family are already deciding who will inherit it!!

Gold, blue and green details contrast the deep red cover. This is very beautiful. 440 pages with several appendices and a nice index in the back. Text is not too small.

I read the Silmarillion first, then the Hobbit and finally LOR. I also followed along with The Atlas of Middle-Earth by Karen Wynn Fonstad. While it is depressing and very difficult to read the Silmarillion, it was worth it by the time I got to LOR. I was able to experience the richness of LOR to its fullest. Much has been written so there is not much more I can really say about this brilliant piece of literature other than it is truly a privilege to read this book. Mine was the 50th anniversary edition. It is a book of quality. The gold leaf held up well and the attached ribbbon that acts as a book marker is very handy. After one read it still looks new. I wished it had pictures like The Hobbit but really pictures are not needed with such a brilliant and gifted author, JRR Tolkien. No one can paint a picture like JRR Tolkien. What truly amazed me is how different the story is in the book verses the movies. The movies are basically an outline to the book. Buy and read this book. You will never regret it. When I started watching the movies, I believed the story to be fantasy. Now being at the end of the JRR Tolkien journey, I am convinced that the story was real!

Hemingway's battle and retreat at Caporetto leaves nothing on the battlefield of Minas Tirith. And while one may say that I am comparing fiction and fact, that isn't the point. The story blurs the line between fact and fiction and almost seems like it did happen and you are reading a first hand account of history.Also, every major character in the story and even most of the secondaries are given a detailed background and full depth. Very rare for most novels. The character Aragorn is as complex a person you will find in literature. He has known happiness and grief, hard toil and loss. You get a true sense of the life he has led. All of the players are given such treatment and while it's been said that the women are given less importance than the men many point out that three of the strongest characters in the book, Eowyn, Arwen, and Galadriel are women.Perhaps my favorite moment in the book is the reunion of the ThreeHunters with Gandalf in Fangorn forrest. Gandalf's retort to Gimli's asking if Fangorn was dangerous: \\"Dangerous? And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the Dark Lord.\\" He goes on to point out that we are all dangerous in our own fashion, and no one should be underestimated. At least that's my take on it.There have been many papers and such written on this book that go much deeper than I can but I have read this book at least 5 times and will read it again. It, like all great books, becomes better everytime you read it. And like all good books it takes you away, expands your mind, and makes you think.

This a fairy-tale of the old kind - but also myth and legend. The reader clearly senses the depth of history in world that Tolkien describes, and this current of untold stories, myths and legends from earlier ages draws the reader into the world.Foremost, however, this is the story of how the deeds of the small is what changes the world and defeats evil rather than the great or might of arms, and finally it is, for me, the greatest tale ever told."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien is a prodigious feat of creativity. Tolkien's imagination encompassed whole peoples with histories and languages and his depths of invention included memorable characters and plot developments.If I could change only one thing in this book, it would be to cull the numerous long paragraphs dedicated to landscape description in detail. Do not these repeatedly bog down the story he tells?But, if so, such excusable detours and dull passages are like the chaff that farmers winnow. We are fortunate to find among the best harvests of grain in this work of Tolkien's lifetime.World literature has been enriched with the arduous quest of Frodo and circumfluent paths of the Fellowship of the Ring. This story is freshened and quickened by evergreen dialogue, battles legendary and conflicts profound.Further, at intervals, characters' voices are lifted in song. I shall remember Tolkien's own lilting voice as a writer for the rest of my life. As Siegfried Sassoon once wrote:\\"Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;And beauty came like the setting sun:My heart was shaken with tears; and HorrorDrifted away ...

My brother first told me about it when I was about five and how it was so cool. At the age of eleven I tried to read it, just to impress my classmates, but I didn't get beyond where Gondor's allies are filing in through the gates at about page 800. I tried again one year later and could not put the book down. I was completely lost in the adventures, horrors, and action. It was great just to let myself slip into the world of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, Trolls, Ents, Balrogs, winged steeds, oh, and everything else. This book contains the best and most realistic battles in any fantasy book I have read but is not lacking in humour either, expressed by Sam so many times. The point I'm trying to make is if you haven't read this book and you like anything to do remotely with fantasy, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first heard the BBC adaptation of Tolkiens trilogy on NPR while I was painting the house 15 years ago. In the cool of the summer evening it would come on with its distinctive theme music and the story would begin. It made the tedious job of painting seem a joy as night after night the drama would unfold towards its dramatic conclusion. I decided then I would have to get a copy. I found one in the library and did the illegal tape thing but am pleased now I have the original.

Embodying in its cosmology the idealism and strength of the old Northern European epics, it reworks for the modern reader what is in store for the person who s to live a heroic and ethical life.

As a child, the trilogy overwhelmed me with its length and detail. Only returning to it as an adult can I truly appreciate Tolkien's masterwork for what it is.Much like Shakespeare, the trilogy is a multilayered work of wonder that tells a story one never forgets. If you should take the journey too, it will change you forever.Works of fantasy fiction are common, but I've yet to see one with Tolkien's level of vision and imagination that seeps through every line and saturates every page.

But the everlasting ten year old boy inside my neural array who still attacks black curtains (hordes of Sauron) in his living room with a ruler (Glamdring) declares without hesitation,&quot;SHOOT THEM AND BURN THEIR REMAINS!!!&quot; for they must surely be mascarading slime from the pit of Mordor! Now seriously let me heap my offering on this love altar. I read the book ten times before I was eighteen. I am sure its theme and passion had something to do with my choice of the profession of arms (I am a Marine Officer.) Though I have not read it since then, I took the opportunity, as I froze on guard in an arctic outpost one night a few years back, to replay the entire tale in my head, scene for scene. It took only nine hours and was the best use of my time I probably ever made. I'm sure I will be rewarded in Heaven on the basis of how well I remembered the story on that night.

This was my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings at the urging of my husband, who loves the series, because he couldn't conceive of anyone having lived to adulthood and not having read the series. Well, he was right. It is an amazing trilogy, not to be missed. The epic story of wizards, drwarves, elves, hobbits, orcs, and ents (my favorite) draws the reader into a world of the author's making.It is a far too large and complex tale to be described here. In truth, it is so large it would probably take a reader several readings to fully devour it all. I will say that, like most fantasy novels (because indeed this one began it all), The Lord of the Rings contains battles, magic, death, undeath, huge insects, and the ultimate battle of good and evil. Unlike most fantasy novels, The Lord of the Rings features superb writing and a truly moral story.The only two 'problems' that I had in reading this book were:1.I am not, normally, a fan of fantasy writing. Trying to read all three of the books straight through was a bit much for me. I would recommend those not normally fantasy fans to read one book at a time, taking a break in between with something else.2.I have the hardback edition of all three books in one volume. It was a bit of a horse to hold onto, especially if you tend to carry books around or read in bed lying down. I recommend getting the volumes individually.See, tiny problems having nothing to do with the story. Certainly, to be able to claim being well read, a person should read this book at least once."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The 3 Lord of the rings books (which is techically 6 books) are by far the most important creation in the fantasy genre! Action packed, detailed in every inch, with the depth lacking in other fantasy novels. It really draws you into the fray. It has a history all its own. Its compex in its simpleness much like life. The fight of good verses evil may be the main plot,but purety verses corruption,courage verses the easy path etc...Makes it a beautifully layered read on many levels of understanding. I myself have read the three books several times. It a journey that grows ever darker and menaceing the closer to Mount Doom. The two towers is about as dark as you can get purely writen in words. The dark Lord is an evil so horible that Tolkien does so geniusly by not giveing him a physical form but rather makes him even more ungodly by describeing him through the other characters fears. I won't give any details of the stories away bt I will say people who only know the books from the movies will be surprised by what has been left out. Like the scene with Tom in the fellowship.. I'll leave it at that. The tale is EPIC literally and should not be missed! There's not much really I cold add to its greatness. Well I better be off before gollum bites me again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Can you really say anything about Tolkien?

If you read The Hobbit first you will be more familiar with the triliogy. Tolkien wonderfully describes the land and characters that you grow to love as the plot proceedes. Though the whole trilogy (including The Hobbit) makes a very long story (although I've read longer) It was hard to put down after I started. It takes some effort though saying the names of characters and places mentally to get their pronunciation correct (some names are-faramir, smeagol, eowyn, eomer, etc.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"With the release of Peter Jackson's film, my husband and I were compelled to re-read a favorite from our adolescence. We were cautious because we heard one reviewer note that...well...the book just wasn't as good as it was when he was 14. Not true! The book is even better than we remembered. We've discovered levels of imagery and sensation that eluded us the first time. In fact, I'm loving it so much that I'm designing a course on environmental images in the trilogy for my first-year college students.What's most fun about this edition is that all three titles are published in a single volume--as Tolkien originally intended. It's not pocket-sized, but the volume is well-bound and lovely. The illustrations are okay, but I still prefer my own mind's eye. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Alas, this edition is not truly leather-bound, but don't worry, that was the only flaw I could find.

Ian Holm and the rest of the BBC cast are superb. With the exception of the much mourned bombadill banishment from the saga, the BBC's attempt is far superior storytelling that will enliven your imagination as opposed to forcing you, as is the case with Mind's Eye, to forever equate Samwise with a castrated smurf."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an awesome book.

These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"it's THE book which while reading time flys by you'd miss breakfest, lunch, diner and the X-filles to read this book"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If it were not for J.R.R. Tolkein's magnificent trilogy (quadrology? if you count &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) I'm not sure I would have become the avid reader that I am. I first read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; in my teen years and they remain the only books I've ever read more than once. They also remain the only fantasy books I truly enjoyed .Tolkein blew open the doors of fiction for me and I have since read many excellent books by authors ranging from E. Hemingway to A. Barrett to D. DeLillo to J. Kerouac to J. Austen to A. Roy and on and on. He opened my eyes to the wonder of entering a fictional world and getting to know fictional characters, all entirely created by human imagination using the tool of language.I have read some of the negative criticisms with interest (few that they are) and while I understand the points (black vs. white, few women characters, etc.) I feel that Tolkein was not intentionally creating negative stereotypes or omitting a gender. I believe he was simply endeavoring to create a fantasy world while not necessarily trying to convey specific ideological, religious or cultural messages. Remember that he first wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for his children. His is a work of fantasy, nothing more. That fact is what makes these books so great.I have not read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; or &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy in over 20 years but plan to soon. I'm sure the magic will still be there. Of one thing I am sure, I will not turn a jaundiced, adult eye on these books.

Personally I'm sure it's the greatest book I've ever read and most of my friends agree with me. There're a lot of things in the LOTR that take your breath away. It's about perilous adventures, magic, love, heroism, good vs. evil but on eht other hand it's not only another epos about mighty warriors and wise wizards. Middle Earth is our world and its inhabitants are like we ourselves. They fight, fall in love, choose between good and evil and create the history of their world - just like we. And sometimes small people like hobbits who are reluctant to become heroes can save the world while the Wise are weak.

I must confess I really envy those who will read it for the first time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a true classic of western literature. Required reading. Tolkien collates the mythology of the western world into a story of unparalleled scope and depth. All modern fantasy is essentially inspired by Lord of the Rings.This edition is great for all around reading. It includes a good deal of reference and background material, footnotes, timelines, geneologies, etc. Not necessarily as fancy or nicely illustrated as some of the hard or leather bound collectors editions, but then again you wouldn't want to carry those around with you wherever you went."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"How does one add a meaningful opinion among a sea of so many others? I don't know. The book is fantastic, inspiring, sad, glorious, and absolutely worth the time it takes to patiently read it. I had heard much talk of the book(s) over the years, but nothing prepared me for the intense, personal nature of so much of it. It is an epic in the classic sense, and Tolkien's character development is quite incredible. While the fantastic, dark, secretive, stealthy, and wondrous sweep of the tale rightly commands much praise, the subtle exploration on the nature of human corruption and it's proclivity to seek power is very arresting. The painstaking character work of Tolkien is, perhaps, what makes this possible, but the draw and pull of the ring on each character, great or small, noble or commoner, is what I found most engaging. It deserves serious, honest reflection from each reader. It's a shame it had to end, and I had a lump in my throat for the last 50 pages, knowing that each word brought me closer to the unfortunate conclusion. I found myself sad as characters passed on or parted ways - the characterization is that intense. Curiously, the archenemy of the story never actually appears IN the story. While he never speaks directly, never acts directly, and is never seen directly, his existence and presence looms dark and ominous over nearly every page - and that, is fantastic, brilliant storytelling. Some folks may not appreciate the genre of fantasy literature, but one owes it to oneself to read this book, and ponder the deep, introspective journey within. Read it - period."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"They say that the English speaking world is divided into two. One, which hasn't read LoTR and the other which has read it. But believe me when I say that even this statement doesn't express much enough the greatness of this magnificient story. The story is simple and yet an epic. Its about how even the smallest of things can change the tides of time and face of the world. This is a story of all stories. Theres fantasy, adventure, mystery, suspense, humour, romance in this saga of friendship, honor, loyalty, sacrifice, courage and bravery.There's one powerful ring, which is to be destroyed before it falls into the hands of evil orelse the world will fall into Darkness forever. It can only be destroyed by throwing it into the cracks of Mount Doom. This responsibilty comes upon the shoulder of one little hobbit, frodo baggins.In the entire story, Tolkein never mentions anything about Life, but after reading the story, you'll yourself realize how wonderful Life is and how a person should respect and enjoy it and thank God for such invaluable gift. In short, Life is a journey to one of the biggest celebration of the Universe. The meaning of Life is Life itself and Death is the celebration of all the moments of good and bad things happened to you;the moments of happiness, sadness, fear, joy, love, hatred, hope, despair;the moments you have spent in light, darkness, morning, night, summer, winter and all the moments you have lived through out your life.READ THIS BOOK AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU WILL NOT GET THIS KIND OF STORY THROUGH YOUR LIFE!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old. Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a superb version of the classic. However, the reference by articandyb to an Eastern press version was intriguing. Anyone know anything about it and how it is different?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said before, but I love this story so much that I just had to put in my two cents worth anyway. This epic tale has everything any reader could ever want: adventure, horror, romance, history.... We are carried away mentally and emotionally to Middle Earth and by the end of the story only wish we could go there physically as well. The story reminds us of the value of friendship, honor, bravery, and begs us to consider what choices we would make given the same sort of circumstances. I've read this book annually now for 30 years and hope to continue to read it for 30 more. Run out and buy it, for even if you've seen the films, you're still missing a great deal. Tolkien's way with words is unbelievable and you'll find if you've planned to read the book for an hour each night, you'll be lucky to get an hour's worth of sleep instead because you won't be able to put it down! Once you've read the story, Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and all the others will remain in your heart forever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings--a challenging, daunting title. The book is over 600,000 words long, and is not by any means a quick read. So why invest all of the time it takes to read this monumental work and everything attached to it?It has been suggested that Tolkien wrote these books in an attempt to educate the masses with ideas and notions from the medieval period. While that may be partly true, no one has really studied or even suggested the psychological reasons for Tolkien's undertaking. He was an Oxford scholar whose specialty was philology(study of languages). He greatly valued the medieval environment in which Lord of the Rings is saturated. There are many points in the books where the medieval influence tends to weigh the reading down, making it more of an advanced history textbook than a story, especially with all of the references to names and events of earlier times gone by. However, that is not to be held against a work of such magnificent significance.It is not simply enough to say that &quot;Lord of the Rings is great!&quot; The book can be approached (and appreciated) on a variety of levels--at the literary, lingual, historical, and for enjoyment for the most part. It is this versatility in which one can approach the book which makes it such a masterpiece. And if one would like to skip over some of the more detailed and descriptive parts, they could still take away a tale of a fantastic journey with enormous ramifications (although it is not recommended).The main point of consideration for these books is that Tolkien meant for them to be an open interpretation. This should mean to anyone what it will, not what the author intended it to be. And maybe, this is a reflection of how he felt about medieval culture, particularly the stories. And we must come back to the crux of this entire work--It is a fantastical world in which trials and tribulations are endured, and joy and mirth are rewarded to those who chose the side of good. For, isn't that the way things should be? As far as the creation of a fantastical world with a vast depth of history goes, the Lord of the Rings has no rival."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is excellent, the way the Lord of the Rings should always have been published. It was the way it was intended to be published as well.If you don't have the trilogy, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just finnished The Lord of the Rings and all I have to say is WOW!! But I don't have to tell anyone how great it is. The Collector's edition is beautiful and should be a part of anyone's library. I bought the paperback version just because the collector's edition is huge and heavy. As far as one reviewer on here... If You are going to dog someone's life work (that so many people hold in HIGH reguard) just because You can't follow a story line, then don't bother writing a review. No one cares what a simpleton thinks and that's how you make yourself look. By the way...

Lord of the Rings has been a favorite series of mine since I read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in fourth grade and devoured everything else JRR Tolkien ever wrote.

Was definitely worth the price I paid, and I would gladly pay it again if I had to.I will never, ever tire of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What to write about clasic adventure book about our famous little fellowship.

Intricate, sophisticated, thorough creation with both humor and drama. It stands up to re-reading many times, and it still stands to be read again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Getting a series as a single volume on a Kindle makes it so much easier to read. Any spelling or alignment errors that others have noted seem to have been fixed by the time I read this (2013). The single version is much cheaper than buying each book separately. Other than that there's not much to say: It's Tolkien-He's a legend for a reason. For those who have seen the movies and now wish to read the books, try to forget everything you know. The movies are an incredible take on these great books, but each is different in its own right. Much of the order of the journey is switched around. Take the time to read the extravagant details that build this amazing fantasy world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to admit that I first tried to read this and the Hobbit forty years ago. I simply couldn't get my brain around it. My interest was rekindled by Peter Jackson's movies, yet I resisted. Finally, as the release of the first Hobbit movie approached, I picked up the copy that's sat on my shelf gathering dust for nearly thirty years. I was hooked and immediately ordered this single-volume edition. I'm now a complete Tolkien fan. I spent a lot of time reading fantasy, and I can honestly say that Middle-earth is the most completely realized fantasy world I've ever experienced. It simply comes to life in Tolkien's capable hands. I'm usually ready for a book to be over by the time I'm finished reading it. In the case of The Lord of the Rings, I was sad that it was over. I wanted more, and I will have to continue reading about Middle-earth. This is the highest praise I can offer any book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Both I and my daughter enjoyed this book. We highly recommend reading it. There is plenty of action and even though it's a long book you will be disappointed that it's not longer when you finish it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Excellent bindings. Same book as always. Tolkien is pretty awesome I suppose. Bombadil and all. Though the movies were not all that great."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Let me start off by saying that tolkien is a great, if not, the greatest fantasy writer ever. This book took me two months to read, not only because i wanted to enjoy it, but also because I kept having to retrace my steps to make sure it took in the info I had previously read. well enough rambling let me tell you what I thought of this book!THE GOOD:1. This was a real refreshing break from the movie hype. To me the book is alot better than the movies.(just my opinion).2. There are also alot more characters in the books who wasn't in the movies.3. Tolkien takes his time to explain the settings around the people. This is very good if you like details.4. Best of all (if you can't afford the extended DVDs)Tolkien finishes the stories of everyone else besides the hobbits and Gandalf. And the book goes into details for a very satisfying ending.5. Also one final good note and then on to the bad. There are bloodlines and an appendix at the end of the book( for those big words noone supposed to really understand).Now to the bad. These are the only reasons I gave the book four stars instead of five.1. Sometimes Tolkien goes into too much detail; often subliminating the main story line just to set the atmosphere.2. I know that Tolkien probably meant for the LOTR to be an intelligent book but come on not everyone can speak elvish and not everyone cares for big words.Well thats it I hope you enjoyed the review as well as the book. PEACE!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"At the outset let me state that I prefer prose to poetry; taste to texture; action and plot to description and setting. I unabashedly admit enjoying The Count of Monte Cristo more than Don Quixote and am liable to devour a book whole rather than delve into its heart and soul like that time I gorged on the first seven books of the Wheel of Time in seven days straight. Perhaps for the preceding reasons I may be classified more of a casual reader than a serious bibliophile. Nevertheless, please don't ignore my protestations completely.I guess it is inevitable that review lists like this will have many more reviews from supporters of a book than reviews from detractors, especially a series of such stature as Lord of the Rings. Loyal devotees would naturally be drawn here while those dissatisfied would likely not even bother. As one of the few detractors though that has bothered to post, let me at least weigh in and try to counter the imbalance I perceive. First this warning to all those out there that have not read or bought LOTR yet, especially those who may have been drawn to it via other popular fantasy fare: contrary to what some of the posts here would have you believe, LOTR is not for everyone.Although this series figured prominently in the establishment of the fantasy genre as we know it today, and is deservedly considered a classic, it is my opinion that it would also suffer from all the stereotypes associated with a &quot;classic.&quot; Lord of the Rings is actually quite a different animal from the popular fantasy stories dominating the market today. It has pretensions of being highbrow and is not a soap opera. It is epic in the sense you'd characterize The Iliad, The Odyssey, or Beowulf (and equally dreary) and not in the sense Jordan's Wheel of Time (which I confess is probably a tad too fruity) is epic. LOTR has more in common with The Chronicles of Narnia (which I prefer) than contemporary populist fantasy.One reviewer said that no one would ever make a series to compare to LOTR. I agree. I think LOTR was the right work that came out at the right time. If another work had defined the fantasy genre and LOTR came out only now to compete with the current crop of fantasy, I suspect LOTR would be a commercial flop despite any literary merit or advantage it may have. Disagree? Please refer to the contemporary series that most closely follows LOTR in style and form if not substance. Not many very well known that I can think of. Most are of the soap opera variety, not classic epic. I would have thought that the imitators would be more recognizable and come in much greater numbers.Like another reviewer here, I had to force myself to keep reading LOTR. Unfortunately I had to keep it up even past the first 100 pages and I did not end up enjoying it. The reason I put up with it is probably the least arguable reason I can think of for reading LOTR. LOTR probably carries enough gravitas because of its significant role in developing fantasy to make it worthwhile to read just for the sake of reading it. Now at least I can say I've read it if nothing else.If you like symbolism and profound insight in a fantasy setting and don't think you'd get bored in the process, you might find it here. I wouldn't know for sure-that's not what I read fantasy for. If that was what I was after I'd read the Bible, Dead Sea Scrolls, Qu'ran, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Catcher in the Rye, or something else.However, if a good story is the only thing you are after, it is debatable if you'll enjoy LOTR. A story that will have you at the edge of your seat with cliffhanger after cliffhanger LOTR is not and I doubt it is a series one would likely lose sleep over."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For his time, Tolkien was a great author.But that was a long time ago and things have changed.When I myself first read 'The Lord of the Rings' I had to literally drag myself through the first 150 or so pages, and only continued reading because of all the good coments I'd heard about the book.After these grueling first 150 pages, the story picked up a bit - although I still thought that it was just 'O.K'.Why people continue to rant and rave about Tolkien's 'great' read, I just do not know.New - and old author's are compared to Tolkien over how good they are, and these critics seem to think that Tolkien sits atop the throne of fantasy.I believe that Tolkien was deposed from his throne a long time ago by the likes of incredible authors such as Eddings, Fiest, Hobb, Jordan and others.If anyone should have the claim to the throne of fantasy I believe it would go to George R.R. Martin - the best fantasist to-date.His book 'A Game of Thrones' was purely riveting and an unbelievable read.This is merely the opinion of a 19 year old male uni student who has spent $1700 on novels in the last 6 years."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was not taken with the Hobbit stories and have no really good reason why not. I am a big fan of sci-fantasy as a general rule."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book I ever read. It had open a world of fantasy for me. It is writen very good and in a very nice language. And the story itself is so facinating that you can't imagine."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Since many others have sung J.R.R. Tolkien's praises here, I will use my allotted space to suggest an alternative view of this writer. Having read the &quot;official&quot; paperback edition of LOTR several times, I am also interested to know whether any reader of both that and this hardcover edition has found differences. There are glaring typos and other editorial mistakes in the paperback edition; have these been corrected? For example, in &quot;The Council of Elrond,&quot; Boromir says that he was sent to seek &quot;Elrond and Halfelven,&quot; which should obviously be &quot;Elrond Halfelven.&quot; I have seen this mistake corrected in another edition, so I know that it was unintentional.But what of Tolkien the writer? Though I hold him in highest regard as a storyteller and master of the English language (those versions indigenous to England, anyway :^), I cannot overlook consistent evidence in his work of his being a real bastard.To wit, Tolkien has a most classic virgin/whore complex. In all his works (from Smith of Wooten Major to The Silmarillion to LOTR), women either 1) weep, give birth, chatter incessantly (Ioreth) and hide in caves (Algarond), or 2) are goddesses of incalculable beauty and mystical power, fierce and fey warriors, or (in spider form, Shelob) the most hideous, powerful demons.With rare exception, evil characters are &quot;black,&quot; &quot;yellow,&quot; &quot;slant-eyed,&quot; and &quot;swarthy.&quot; Good characters are &quot;fair,&quot; &quot;white,&quot; &quot;golden-haired,&quot; &quot;blue-eyed,&quot; and at worst having &quot;jet hair with sea grey eyes&quot; (or some such.)Lastly (for this writing), Tolkien was a staunch classist. Endless references to class, birthright and 'knowing one's place' permeate his works. I can't go on; it's sickening!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have attempted to read the 1st book in this trilogy on about 5 occasions over the past 15 years and I never get beyond the Council of Elrond before I yet again find the whole thing too boring to continue.I loved The Hobbit and admire Tolkiens vivid imagination, but his style of writing in LOTR is just too &quot;early 20th century british&quot; for my liking. I have the same problem with Dickens that I do with Tolkien; ponderous prose! I guess I've been spoiled by many of the excellent sci-fi/fanatsy authors (i.e. George R R Martin) that write edge of the seat, gripping &amp; fascinating stories.Unfortunately, in LOTR, Tolkien's ability to tell an interesting tale seems to have taken a backseat to his world building."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"After watching the first two movies I was enchanted to read the books and I wanted to finish them before &quot;Return of the King&quot; came out on the theatre. Well, I finished all the books and they were kind of a chore to finish. If you are big into scenery more than action then these books are for you. I probably wont read them again because of the extreme detail of clouds, mountains, underground, rivers and such. I'd rather get more of the character's feelings and emotions and it was just hard for me to get that with these books. But the story is excellent otherwise and there are plenty of fighting and treachery."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The lord of the rings is a awsome book to read and get ideas for a story.

The story contains mystical and unreal aspects to create a fantasy, but retains a link with the believable to retain its link with the reader's world.

I thought he movie was great, but also scary!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is probably one of the best of all time. It is the first stepping stone for all the fanstasy novels written today. J.R.R. Tolkien created a world very much our own, though masked with many fictional things,and characters. He created vivid realm with characters that the mass public could relate to. The ring of power signifies mankind's own self corruption and destruction. While the ringbearer signifies man's own salvation. Frodo (the ringbearer)embarks on an epic journey to desttroy the One Ring, which he recieved, to save Middle Earth. During his adventurous voyage, had to overcome many hard-impossible obstacle to keep the ring from the Dark Lord Sauron and destroy evil (the one ring), once and for all. I highly recommend this book to those who love fiction and understand the problems in our world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just wanted to say that I haven't bought this book yet, but I am getting it by this Wednesday. I looked at an open copy of this at the book shop, and I thought it was great. I really like the cover and the spine. It's so artistic and creative. I think whoever made this book (I think it was Houghton Miffflin), I think they are pretty smart to make it this way. I can't wait to get it, soon. I highly recommend it because I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a good book and I thought &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; the movie, was good, too. So if you like Fantasy, I highly recommend this trilogy, especially because it is in one big book and it's a collector's item. It can also be a good thing to read in class incase you get bored and have nothing to do."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't want to say something about the content of the book here, because I think everybody knows it. I give my opinion only to the books printing.First it is only artificial leather bounded. Therefore the price is a little bit too high.... Otherwise the printing inside is ok and very good to read, because the letters are not too small and not as bad as some customers have written here. Also the book block is not glued slanting into the book and the map at the end is also ok.All in all 4 stars and not 5, because of the wrong information about the cover material and the high price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have listened to the majority of the CDs in this collection and what a terrific experience it has been. Rob Inglis' voice is absolutely perfect for the story. All the characters come to life from this single narrator. What's more, the songs and poems in the book are sung and read brilliantly. The passage where Aragorn and Legolas sing to the western, southern, and northern winds for the passing of Boromir has been done exceptionaly well.As noted by others, there are some minor word substitutions and differences in the edition being read from but that in no way diminishes this elegant work. The story is timeless, the reading masterful. It's almost as if the Rob Inglis' voice has been tailor made for this type of story. The imagery of the book really comes alive with the reading. One passage sticks in my mind. It's the one where the Fellowship is travelling down Anduin and Legolas steps out of the boat to shoot down the Nazgul and his flying steed. The reading and imagery are so vivid that the entire scene just builds an image in the mind. Few books and readings have achieved such a high level.Undoubtedly others will find their own favorite moments. That's what the combination of literary and narrative masters provides. At the very worse this work will provide hours of enjoyment. No Tolkien fan should be without this exceptional effort."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an incredibly luxurious and grand edition of my favorite book, J.R.R. Tolkien's magnum opus. It is interesting to compare it to my other leather-clad single-volume edition, given to me as a gift in 1977. The cover is greenish-brown suede, as opposed to the bonded red leather cover of the '77. The garish polychrome 70s graphics have been replaced with a dignified rendering of one of JRRT's own drawings of Minas Tirith, and the edges are gilded instead of plain, a glaring oversight in the '77. The maps are the same; the case bindings are the same as the book. The typography is different, though, with the lurid red print of the chapter headings being made uniform with the text. The introduction assures us that typographical errors have all been repaired, and we shall not run into \\"dwarfish\\" when JRRT wrote \\"dwarven\\". The index is improved, more complete. All in all, a great improvement and, despite the price, a must-have for the Tolkin aficianado. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Sometimes called the &quot;Douglas Anderson&quot; edition, the 1987/1988 three-volume printing of The Lord of the Rings incorporates the final corrections Tolkien made to the book. No previous edition includes all the corrections.Unfortunately, Houghton Mifflin's book production quality has declined through the years and these books are as liable to fall apart with normal usage as not. But any reader who wants the most accurate representation of Tolkien's masterpiece needs this edition. Not even the Alan Lee illustrated Centenniel edition incorporates the final textual changes.The value of owning the &quot;most faithful text&quot; really depends on whether you want to know if a Silmaril was Luthien's bride-price or bride-piece (the former is the correct term, though many editions say bride-price).When I am in doubt about what Tolkien actually intended to say for any Second Edition passage, I turn to the Douglas Anderson printing. It is a necessary tool for any Tolkien researcher."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is one of the few books which is always present on my bookshelf, and was the first book I decided to purchase on my Kindle several weeks ago.

The largest disappointment however for the Kindle version were the typographical errata: misspelled or truncated words, employing the wrong case for proper names (poor Eomer) and in at least one case a Greek letter starting an English word.An additional feature which would have enhanced the Kindle version is the text-to-speech accessibility, which was surprisingly missing. Foreign language versions were also not available. These points are however small compared to the obvious mistakes in the text, which make one question how faithful the other content is for the Kindle version compared with the original books. While I love the original text, I cannot recommend this version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book has ruined my library. No matter how hard I try to place the 50th Anniversary LOTR tome upon my shelving, it sticks out like Superman in the sewer. Not that the rest of my library is full of tattered and haggard volumes, but this edition of Tolkein's LOTR simply outshines the rest. Even when offset with the similarly adorned edition of the Hobbitt the glow doesn't fade.My library is going to cost me a fortune to replace with volumes of equal radiance.I wish this thing had never come to me..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My son wanted to read The Lord of the Rings on his Kindle. When I purchased this version, I was not sure if this Kindle Version of Lord of the Rings had all three books: (1) The Fellowship of the Ring, (2) The Two Towers, and (3) The Return of the King. It does and I'm very happy about it. You don't need to spend $9.99 on each individual book. You get all three for $14.99."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love the books, and I having nothing bad to say about anything that Tolkien has ever written.But if you buy the Kindle version, despite what the product description implies, it does NOT include \\"The Hobbit\\". The $14.99 price includes only the Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love the Trilogy for the depth of beauty in the writing, the history, the created languages -- everything about this is wonderful. But I am not writing to review the book. I wanted to say that whatever problems the kindle edition had, they seem to be corrected. Have not noticed any typographical errors or problems with runes, elven speech etc. It all seems perfect to me. The map of Middle Earth is a bit small, but maybe it is best viewed on a pc instead of the kindle anyway. The map is divided into 4 parts, so you can see each quadrant separately. That helps. If you love LOTR, it is great to have it on your kindle for those moments when you have to relive the meeting with Galadriel, the battle at the gates of Mordor etc."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Despite the fact that this is shown as being published in 2001, the copyright dates first from 1954. There is a reason that other versions have come out since this one: this one isn't good.There are different readers for different characters, and some of the voices are really jarring. Frodo, to my ear, is completely wrong. In addition, it is poorly abridged. One of the most remarkable things about Middle Earth is how wonderfully imagined it is; all of the details are described so lovingly. Not in this version. Here, almost everything is dialog, so you are given little idea of what anything looks like. Some of the most cherished quotations (for me, at least) are mangled. In all, very disappointing. I remember hearing the BBC's dramatization years ago on radio and thinking it was wonderful job on very difficult material. I certainly wouldn't say that of this version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As a work of literature it is hard to argue that this must be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. A classic &quot;good will always triumph over evil&quot; tale that is exceedingly well thought through.The plot might be a little tricky to follow for youngeer readers, ( tip: keep a note pad to remember who everyone is) but the story is spellbinding.I gave it four stars because although the literature is worth five plus, the quality of this boxed set is woefully inadequate. The bindings will not last the first read and the print is way to small for such a large work. Frankly it's a piece of junk and not worth the moneyI had hoped that this would be a special addition to my library but instead i will give it to my 14 year old daughter in the hope that she will read it before it disintegrates.I will keep looking for something of higher quality for my bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well, I had never read LOTR or ever really known what the story was all about. Of course, I saw the movies.These sparked my interest to read LOTR. Not having a lot of time on my hands, and having to commute on a daily basis, I opted for the audio CD version.I think this is a great way to &quot;read&quot; the books. Many times I got to work and wanted to just hang out in my car to see what happened next ;)Anyway, I have gone through Fellowship and Two Towers so far, and the recordings have been perfect. I think Inglis adds another dimension to readings.I have just restarted Fellowship again, and it's just as enjoyable as the first time through :)Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am sorry to have to write a slightly derogatory review, (not aimed at Tolkien's work, but to other reviewers) but I feel it must be done. I am not sure if some of you have actually read all the way through the LOTR. It seems obvious to me that several of you have not bothered to read Tolkien's forward, since if you would have, you would have noticed that he explicitly states that he intends NO connection between his book and WW2 or any other allegorical connection of the sort. I believe it is the reader's duty to keep the author's opinions in mind when dealing with his own work. Now to praise: From the crisp verdant hills of the West Farthing, to the fiery heights of Orodruin, the LOTR is a grand tale. Epic in scope, magic, and vision. Tolkien's literary style is on an adult level, contrary to the opinions of several other reviewers. His words carry feelings of lucidity, humor, weight, and knowledge all in one keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat package. Almost all fantasy authors today owe some aspect of their work to this, the greatest of Tolkien's work. I recommend that anyone remotely interested in fantasy read it. And by the way, O swarm of uninformed reviewers, the Lord of the Rings is one novel, consisting of six books. Most of you think it is a trilogy, even though Tolkien himself, in his apparently seldom-read foreword, said otherwise."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Short of religious holy books I can think of no book ever published that has had such a profound effect on so many people. Spanning language, culture, and time, the Lord of the Rings embodies what is both evil and good, what it is to experience the journey of life, and to recognize the worth in living as a good person. That's all it is. Simple and direct. Far from preachy, Tolkien's masterpiece blooms with vivid imagery and complex characters all alive in a world so detailed that you'd swear he was recounting history.There are hundreds of reviews here and I'm sure many people will say things more nobly than i shall but the true magic of these books is in the way it transforms people who read it. Though I cannot begin to understand how it happens, The Lord of the Rings seems to make its readers more aware of the value of virtue. It can sleep inside of you for years or change your life by the end of the first book. What it will do for you individually I cannot guess though I know it is always for the better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is wonderful. They are the best books that I have ever read in my entire life. The books are very intriging and are page turners from the beginning. Once you read the first book, you have to know what happens to Frodo and the gang and to see if they ever accomplish their destiny. I strongly suggest that you read these books, they live on in your minds after you finish them so much that you have to go back and reread them; just to be back in Middle-Earth, and back with the hobbits, who become so impossibly real to you. Not to read the book is a denial to yourself of so much splendor."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I reread Lord of the Rings about every 15 months, and have not been disappointed. I first read it in my very early teens, and most recently as a cynical forty year old. I read it from the point of a different character each time, not always Frodo Baggins, sometimes Strider, sometimes Gandalf, but each time I find nuances previously unnoticed. I realise that fantasy remains the unfashionable genre, but I am catholic in my reading ranging from Thomas Hardy to Salman Rushdie, Novels, Novellas and Short Stories, Poetry and Prose, and the only book that captivates me today as it did 29 years ago is Lord of the Rings. Read It!

This is the most impressive literature I have ever read in my life! Mr. Tolkien has woven a timeless tale of the struggles between good and evil with perfection. The battle scenes are utterly exhilerating, and the characters are flawlessly depicted. Never before have I seen such an intricate storyline, and I doubt I will ever see another quite like it. If you are a fan of fantasy novels that portray a good and wholesome message, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The centenial birth of Tolkien brought us a very special LTR with illustrations by Lee. The book is published with high quality paper and the art work is second to none. I highly recogmend this book if you can afford it. It truly is eye candy and a classic story that is timeless !"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can you say about &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that hasn't been said already? Obviously this is not just a fantasy novel, it is the fantasy novel. It's the one that moved the genre beyond cheesy entertainment and showed us what could an author with real vision, skill, and understanding could do. Tolkien brought us meaning, depth, and power. He brought us a story that is truly magnificent. Small wonder that so many of today's fantasy dwarves have decided to just rip him off rather than coming up with their own story. Small wonder also that those who are actually forging new frontiers and thinking up new ideas continue to cite Tolkien as their favorite author and leading influence.What exactly is it that Tolkien gets and the dwarves don't? Everything, really. But character is at the heart of it. Tolkien starts out with characters; that's why he wrote an opening chapter designed the show us the world of the Shire before the action actually starts. We understand Frodo not just as an automaton who experiences fear at point A and hope at point B, but rather as a living, breathing person. We know where he comes from, how he was raised, what drives him, and so forth, and thus we actually care what happens to him. And Tolkien does something that Brooks, Jordan, Goodkind, et. al. would never even consider: he works out true, dynamic personalities for his entire cast. Even minor characters such as Legolas and Gimli are distinct, not just cheesy comic relief sidekicks.But what really builds &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into the greatest experience in fantasy is the little moments. Things that don't necessarily have the fate of the entire world hinging on them, but which are still emotionally memorable. For instance, when Sam first sees an enemy soldier dying near the start of book four, he pauses a moment to reflect on what that man's life might have been like and why he chose to serve the side of darkness. I also especially commend the scenes in the Houses of Healing in book six, Gimli's reflections after visiting Lothorien, and some of the pleasant banter between the hobbits in the first three chapters. Robert Jordan and the terrible Terrys, obsessed as they are with lame fight scenes and cheap melodrama, probably wouldn't be capable of such truly moving moments even if they had the desire to be real authors.Some people claim that Tolkien achieved his current vaunted status merely by being the first author to stew together mythology and fairy tales in a novel with such a large vision, and that his actually skill at writing isn't that great. They're wrong; it is that great. In the nuts and bolts elements of writing, he is without peer. Look at the landscapes. When the Hobbits arrive at the Black Gate and see the barren mountains of Mordor, Tolkien actually makes you feel the desolation of the landscape and the brooding presence of evil, rather than just telling you that they exist. I personally have always been delighted by authors who throw in some descriptions of nature just for the sake of describing nature. It not only helps you visualize the scene, but also lets you enjoy the beauty of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Last year I began to read fantasy works. I began by reading Robert Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series. But at the beginning of this year one of my professors began telling me that I needed to read Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. So, for my B-day my girlfriend purchased me the Millinium Edition of the LotR. All I can say is if you haven't read this book, you need to order it right now. Never have I been drawn into a world such as Tolkien's. I had my apprehension's after seeing the Hobbit so many years ago. I thought that the LotR may be a childs book. I was so wrong. You name it, this book has it. It is wonderfully written and easy to follow. The Millinium Edition is broken into 7 small books in a beautiful holder. They are all black hardcovers with the famous verse written of the front in Elvish with a ring and the eye.The LotR is broken into 6 books. Each book (Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return) is seperated into 2 smaller books, the way Tolkien originally intended to publish them. There is not much else to say, get these now!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not exactly sure what other reviewers have experienced regarding their reports of poor quality control with this edition, but I have a beautifully bound and printed copy, and have absolutely no complaints. This is simply the finest edition of Tolkien's timeless classic I've ever owned. I've examined my copy quite thoroughly and have noticed no defects in workmanship whatsoever. Every minute detail from the red and black text to the gilded pages make this edition worth the asking price and more. The book is kept in a handsome slipcover and fits right at home between the highly regarded \\"No Admittance\\" bookends. This is the edition aficionados of Tolkien's work should not be without."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is for that of the edition of the book not the writing itself. Or course Tolkien's writing is phenomonal.This edition has a beautiful case and amazingly illustrated cover protecters. They are all hardcover and are not too heavy. The pages are near tear-proof (of course, not if you try) and are resistant to dirty fingerprints and small bends (if you don't do it on purpose). All in all, this version is quite worth the price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Being a Lord of the Rings fan for 7 years, I decided that it was time to buy an illustrated set of it. I'm so happy that I bought this one!!The dust covers are very beautiful with illustrations by Alan Lee. The box is also illustrated and the books fit in very good. Every book has ,under the dust cover, the actual cover: nice red fabric with in gold the title etc. It looks very 'Tolkien-ish'The books are all illustrated, about .. well I haven't counted them but there are lots and lots of beautiful illustrations. They are all a bit 'watery', but it fits the mood of the book.I read complaints about the glossy pages. Personally, I don't have any trouble reading, even if there's bright light. The pages are smooth, but do not reflect much light.So, I don't really see one negative thing about the box - except that the books are very tight in the box and it is difficult to get them out.If you are a real Lord of the Rings fan, please buy this edition. It's great!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a work of art. I am using this book as a way to get my son to love books and have been reading it out loud to him.

If one wants to truly emerge themselves into the story than Middle Earth is the way to do it. I read these books before the movies cam out so I was able to see what they left out and changed. While the movies were amazing they still did not equal the enormity of the story or most of its complexities. These books changed my life and certainly changed the way I look at reading and books. Also J.R.R Tolkien was an absolute genius who both taught and graduated at Oxford and he also knew 14 languages.If one likes the Lord of the Rings you should read some stuff at wikipedia.com about Tolkien. the whole world of Middle Earth including languages, history, cultures, species,geography etc. were all created by him. Truly one of the best stories of the 20th Century and will live on until the end of time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For those of you who are fans of the movies, be aware that Peter Jackson's vision of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not J.R.R. Tolkien's vision. Although the movies are remarkable, necessarily due to time constraints, they are nowhere near as complex in plotline and characters as the book.This book deserves to be an all-time classic, not only in the fantasy genre, but in the general literature genre. It is the one book I would want if I were to be confined to a desert island.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" in all its brilliance provides me not only with one of the most remarkable sagas ever created, but gives me an entire world devoted to the pursuit of good for the sake of others as well as self.Who can forget the sacrifices Frodo and Sam made in order to destroy Sauron? Who can forget the bonds created in the fellowship, leading even a dwarf and elf to become true friends?Even the more minor characters are well-drawn, not the \\"cardboard characters\\" so prevalent in other fantasy books.This book almost demands multiple readings, as it is too immense to digest in only one. I have owned the beautiful red edition for about twenty to twenty-five years, but read it only once a year. I have read and re-read,until they fell apart,at least three paperback editions of the book.I highly recommend this book to all serious readers who wish to immerse themselves in the book of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The hardcover single-volume Alan Lee illustrated Lord of the Rings is not the sort of book you want to get for someone who is just starting to read the trilogy. It is large, heavy, and rather unwieldy for long reading. Not to be sacrilegious, but it is a bit like a very nice Bible. Lovely to have on your shelf, but not the sort of thing you want to toss in your backpack.For the Lord of the Rings fan, however, this is a perfect gift. Alan Lee's color illustrations are a marvelous complement to Tolkien's work, and the presentation of the book in general is very well done."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My only complaint is that it's abbridged. The voice actors are quite good and the music fits very well, creating the appropriate mood nicely. Every now and then the sound effects are a little cheesy (Gandalf's magic) but overall quite well done. Excellent for introducing the story to someone who doesn't have the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book makes an excellent gift for any Lord of the Rings fan. I gave it to my boyfriend for his birthday, and he absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Mr. Basu, a reviewer below, criticizes Tolkien for &quot;glorifying war in essentially a children's book&quot;. First of all, LOTR is not a children's book. The Hobbit is a children's book. He then continues by decrying the idea that the minions of Sauron are not &quot;reasoned with&quot;, they are simply killed. Well, of course they are. They're *evil*. Inexplicably, he proceeds to chastise the Allies for &quot;not doing anything about Hitler&quot;. Eisenhower and Patton must be rolling in their graves. Mr. Basu then commends King, Gandhi, and Einstein. Great men, certainly. Unfortunately for him, NONE OF THEM DID A THING ABOUT HITLER! Every buck private Allied soldier who spent a day in the European Theater exceeded the accomplishments of these three combined in defeating Hitler a thousand fold. In another feat of logic, he says that &quot;real evil can be reasoned with&quot;. Of course! Just ask 6 million reasoning, reasonable Jews! As he is evidently intentionally unaware, that would require SPEAKING WITH THE DEAD! Who were the Jewish heroes of World War II? The ones who allowed themselves to be herded off to Auschwitz and Dachau, or those of the Warsaw Ghetto, who fought bravely, against all odds, in defense of their own lives and those of their children? His sort of moronic pacifism is unfortunately prevalent. If, as Mr. Basu asserts and is certainly true, Tolkien rightly opposed it, that is only all the more reason to recommend these books.I wholeheartedly recommend reading Tolkien's works, starting of course with The Hobbit. They are one of the great achievements of 20th century literature, and will outlast any and all pretentious, &quot;multicultural&quot; fluff of the sort probably favored by Mr. Basu."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is so much to be said against The Lord Of The Rings that it shouldn't be worth the effort. A book that, judged by conventional standards, contains so many appalling lapses of taste and so much coarse vulgarity really ought, by now, to have faded from sight.From many points of view, it has dated badly, and its aesthetics and politics are now so odd that you might be forgiven for thinking, as Peter Jackson's new trilogy of movies rapidly approaches, that its appeal, after all, is one of a delicious period piece.But all judgements have always been confounded by this extraordinary book. It ought to be too long, and too pointlessly abstruse, to command wide popularity; it is not a book for children, and yet not a book for adults either; its style is too elevated for popular literature, but too coarse for &quot;high&quot; literature. There is no reason on earth for anyone to like it, and there are plenty of readers who still think that the judgement of JRR Tolkien's first publisher - who was surprised when it started to look as if the book might make as much as 1,000 - was much sounder than the people who, in the past 50 years, have bought more than 100 million copies of the book.However, by now, The Lord Of The Rings is unarguably a part of English literature. Contrary to popular belief, 100 million readers can perfectly well be wrong; but the continuing life of the book cannot just be ignored. It is just there, massively.But, in many ways, it is just awful. It is amazingly humourless, and Tolkien knows it - over and over again, he writes &quot; 'Come, master Pippin!' Gandalf laughed&quot; - a very bad sign, all those laughing wizards. You don't have to be politically correct to be mildly alarmed by some aspects of it. Apart from Eowyn, the women in it are not madly significant, or allowed to do anything much. There is Galadriel, who stays at home being Wise; there are Goldberry or Rose, who stay at home being Patient Helpmeets; there are Lobelia Sackville Baggins and Shelob, who stay at home being completely ghastly.It is an appallingly nave fantasy of good and evil races; mostly, the good people are tall and blond and speak Nordic or Celtic languages, and the bad ones are dark and hairy and talk a sort of Persian - those guttural dwarves are allowed a sort of virtue, but it is rather grudging in tone. Sam Gamgee is a loyal retainer of the most frightful variety, still &quot;Mr Frodo-ing&quot; away and knowing his place 1,000 pages in; basically, he is Dickens's Sam Weller, and Tolkien couldn't even be bothered to change his name.Tolkien probably knew as much about language as anyone, but it would be fair to say that his interest stopped at grammatical inflection. The Lord of the Rings, by ordinary standards, is just badly written. Great swathes of it are in a sort of Ben-Hur biblical: &quot;And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them... until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords...&quot;There are endless mock subtleties of the &quot;It seemed to Sam that he saw...&quot; variety. And there is, too, that infallible sign of a really bad writer, the overuse of the word &quot;suddenly&quot;. Everything in The Lord of the Rings happens suddenly, dozens of times a chapter. And yet it is one of those very rare books that confounds all objections, all standards, and which in the end may make its own standards. Nobody, I think, has ever produced anything with the imaginative density and intricacy of the book. The reviewer's clich&eacute; is, for once, apt here; he really created a world.The power and resonance of the book come in part from an ethical debate that is much more adult than one remembers - it is haunted by the cruelty of its age, and is not, in fact, just about the alternative of Good and Evil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions. It is really about slow corruption, and is at its finest in the portraits of Saruman and Denethor, characters who it is not difficult to parallel in 20th-century history.But its claim on real greatness comes from the sense of huge, half-glimpsed vistas of history and language, the illusion (which may not be an illusion) that its author knew exactly the languages each of its characters would have spoken and understood the events of ancient history that lead all of them to act as they do.In a realistic novelist, writing about a real war, this would be a remarkable feat of intelligence; when you consider that Tolkien invented absolutely everything - the backstory, the languages, the geography - it quickly becomes almost incredible. At some point, the critics and the literati have to admit that they were just wrong, and, by now, it is probably time to start considering his extraordinary flight of imagination as one of the key works of modern literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"You're charging twice the price for the EBOOK than the soft-back version of the book. I find this backwards and annoying. I find it equally annoying that no one else has stated this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Why'd this guy have to leave us? Who shot JRR? I hope he's enjoying the creativity of the only One more imaginative than himself--the Creator of the Universe. As for us, still strapped to this mortal bowling bowl and rolling down the lane of history (hopefully, staying out of the gutter), Tolkien's absence is our loss. I'm sulkin' without Tolkien...wishing he'd written more, wishing he'd never written LOTR in the first place. Why? Because it's spoiled me--I can scarcely enjoy the barrage of inferior fantasy. The musty, damp, and gritty reality of Middle Earth reveals uncanny moments of beauty, then strips back the uneasy facade to show us seductive and frightening evil. Only an author familiar with the spiritual reality of such a cosmic battle could use a fictional tool to etch it into our culture with such vividness. And only a man like Tolkien, a man in relationship with the True King in heaven, could show the costly, but victorious battle against the Darkness."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This work of art has been a foundational pillar for my life from the first time I read it. It is the all-encompassing, never-ending story that has never been matched; likely it will not be matched in the future, either! There is a purpose behind the telling of any story, and the purpose here is the exploration of language. I mean only this: the story line is as old as man, but the words (oh! the words!) used are magnificent! If you have read, and have not felt the bright sunshine of an autumn day in The Shire, or not seen the towers of filth and smoke spewd forth from Mount Doom; if you've never felt the dread of the passage at Cirith Ungol, or never nearly wept at the beauty of Arwen Evenstar - well, you need to read it again! There is a language that encompasses all emotions, all logic; that is forever in its telling, yet finished all too soon. This is the language that Tolkien speaks with, and we would do well to listen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: I have the greatest respect for J R.R. Tolkien. He is a legend to all authors - Adult, YA, Middle Grade or otherwise. He stepped out of the box and filled blank pages with true imagination. The imagination and devoted research, and sheer, obsessive attention to detail put into this book, he has made Middle-Earth a world as complex and enormous as our own.Just saying.So, this might be the toughest review I have written up-to-date. So, I'd better start at the very beginning, when I first read the first part in the Lord of the Rings.I started this series in the hope to be influenced like so many other readers. To be taken away on the fantastical world of Middle-Earth. I honestly wanted to love it. What happened after the first 4 chapters? I fell asleep. Never had I been so board that I've actually fallen asleep. Then I skipped the last 200 or-so pages.THE END.That was my first try at LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring. I didn't rate it nor review it. I berried it deep from my memory and I never spoke about it ever again. But, later in my life, my life will once again intertwine with LOTR...My sister, for a thoughtful gift, gave me the whole trilogy, thinking that I've never read it and that I'm \\"missing out.\\"I wasn't going to read it, but some of my friends encouraged me by saying stuff like, \\"it will be better\\" or \\"you might like it this time\\" or \\"if you get board; think about Orlando and Viggo.\\" (The last subjection actually helped a lot.)So now, here I am, after reading it once again, trying to say my feelings in the nicest way possible.* First off, I need to get this of my chest. Frodo; fall into Mount Doom you stupid Marie-Sue. There. I said it. And it felt GOOD.* Sam; you still rock.* It was so heavy and slow that it hurt me.* Don't take this the wrong way, I love description. It is a beautiful thing in writing, to see threw the authors eyes and see, smell, hear, touch his/her world. But to go down as to describe every leaf, stick and pebble as to give me headaches?* The characters (except Sam) didn't feel real. They didn't jump off the page. Yes, we learn about their past but none of them have an individual voice. They all sounded like the same person.Despite all these defaults, I loved the world of Middle-Earth.

I am not here to review the contents of it, since many other reviewers have already written what I wanted to say. I want to comment on a particular edition, the One-Volume Hardcover 50th anniversary edition. I wanted a sturdy, well-made copy of the Lord of the Rings, but was not willing to buy the expensive collector's edition. So I searched for an alternative, and I found this. It is less than half of the collector's edition price, with the same 50th Anniversary text. Plus, it is a sturdy copy, and well-bound. It has the same illustration on its dust jacket as the paper-back edition, illustrated by renoun artist Alan Lee. The best thing about this edition, though, is its pages. It is not the regular kind of acid-free paper, it is a strong, almost shiny paper (no, it doesn't hurt the eyes); it is hard to explain, but you'll know what I mean by this if you get it. This book is a beautiful, well-made copy of Lord of the Rings that will last for a very long time. Get this one.As a side-note, I bought my friend the paperback version of this book as a present (she being a Tolkien Fan and in need of a replacement for her beaten up copy) and found that the paperback is also a wonderful alternative to buy for one who doesn't want a hardcover edition. It is a sturdy and pretty copy, and though the paper in the paperback is not of the quality of the hardcover, it is acid free. Plus it has the revised text."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In view of the newly found popularity of Tolkien's classic, I decided to update my old Unwin Paperback edition of LOTR. I compared several editions out there (Boxed Rei, Houghton Mifflin and the sober Harper-Collins with the black cover and the single ring in the centre), and decided to buy this one. It is, hands down, the best.The folding maps need some care, if you're like me and try to keep your books as if they were brand new. Overall, it's very well put together and makes a great addition to my library.I'm sorry if this review seems superficial, but I feel all that should be written about the books themselves has already been written--and perhaps more. Suffice to say that this is the edition for the true fan of the books, although the whole thing makes a rather big (and elegant) tome to carry around the house.If you want your children to read it, perhaps a less intimidating edition would be in order, though (my old Unwin set is ideal for that, and it's making its way to the younger in the family)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Houghton Mifflin Co published three editions of the one-volume LOTR, all of which include the complete text and the appendices:This 1991 centennial edition has largest text. It includes durable binding, smooth white pages, glossy illustrations, an illustrated cover jacket, and an red ribbon bookmark sewn into the binding. However, the book is the largest LOTR book I've ever seen in my life -- It's quite hefty.There is a red, faux-leather collector's edition published in 1974. It is slightly smaller in dimensions compared to the centennial edition and weighs considerably less. The cover is beautiful and unmatched in elegance. Chapter headings and margin headings are in orange red. The pages are slightly tinted yellow, as smooth as the centennial edition, and seem to emit a pleasant flagrance. However, there is &quot;broken type&quot; on nearly every page because the text is not conventionally set, but rather a photo offset from another edition. (Conventionally set text would read like a Word document printed with a laser printer. Photo offset would be as if one had scanned that laser-printed World document into a JPEG, and reprinted out that JPEG.) The binding of this edition also seems to be of lesser quality than the 1991 centennial edition.There is also the LOTR Movie Art Cover edition printed in June of 2001. Like the centennial edition's cover illustration, this edition's movie art is also on a cover jacket. I am not too familiar with this edition, but from casual browsing, I've found that the text, though smallest, looks the most &quot;conventionally set,&quot; and the pages are of the same quality as the centennial edition. The book is smaller in height and width but thicker than the collector's edition. The binding looks solid enough, but there is no movie art in the book.My personal favorite is the centennial edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"13 May 2011 - I got an email from Amazon and on my response with \\"YES\\" the corrected version of this text downloaded to my Kindle, finally!!! just short of 2 years after I first complained about it.

Mr. Inglis seems to have a whole world of different voices. I can't imagine how he managed to come up with so many or how he managed to remember what voice he picked for each character. He performs so well that this is really more a dramatization of the whole book rather than just someone reading it; even his voicing of the narration is perfect.I've not listened to the whole yet, being about half-way through the Fellowship of the Ring. I assume that the quality of the performance will be just as good for the parts I've not listened to yet. However, I do have several quibbles (which are not enough to lessen my rating, but which I found surprising against the overall quality).The first quibble has nothing to do with Mr. Inglis himself: Sometimes I can hear, faintly, another voice in the background. It sounds like this voice is also reading something. To the creators of this recording: get better sound-proofing. Mr. Inglis's voice and performance are so wonderful that it is a pity to have this distraction.The second quibble has to do with Mr. Inglis: I happen to be listening to this recording while following along in my printed books of the trilogy, therefore it becomes obvious when Mr. Inglis departs from the text. I really don't mind the sometimes excessive use of contractions that are not in Tolkien's original (even though \\"don't use the ring\\" really does not have the same emphasis as \\"do *not* use the ring\\") and it's not so bad when he substitutes one word for another of the same meaning (possibly he may be reading from a different edition).However, occasionally, Mr. Inglis makes boo-boos that change the meaning of the sentence being read. At least two come to mind (and these from the first half of the Fellowship): Near the end of the Tom Bombadil episode (when Frodo and Co. are taking leave of Goldberry) a \\"morning\\" is changed to a \\"misty morning\\". The word \\"misty\\" is not in the text and confuses the meaning of the passage as the sentences that follow imply that the morning is a clear one. The other most noticible change is that Sam's statement \\"How do *we* know that you are the real Strider...\\" gets read as \\"How do *you* know that you are the real Strider...\\", which makes no sense. These are the two errors of reading that first come to mind, but there were more. Enough, let's say, to surprise me in a performance that is almost pitch-perfect.However, like I said previously, these quibbles don't reduce my rating and the set is well worth any amount of money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First: Amazon's rating method--i.e, that all editions of the same work are included under one rating thread--is useless.

I revised and posted it on Amazon's UK site. As I say in the first paragraph, I want to bring this element out to show readers a little acknowledge fact about the most important novel of the twentieth century. Of all the reviews I've written for Amazon this stands as the one with the most important thing to say. Ideally, reviews, etc, should be used as enhancing literature and \\"comparing notes\\" as Lewis says in his EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM. This is what I mean to do here, to enlighten and compare notes. The enthusiasm of the original review is tempered with a more mature voice. Tolkien's work is strictly his own, but I feel Lewis should get acknowledged for his contribution to fantasy literature by his encouraging Tolkien. However, I am getting ahead of myself. I hope this review helps you better understand the powerful literary group that was the Inklings.Mike London, 8-22-01.The Review: It is often customary to sing the praise of Tolkien and his accomplishments, but in this review I purpose to bring out an aspect often neglected in the circle of Tolkien fans, and that is the influence his Christian brother C. S. Lewis had upon him. Because there is so much else covering Tolkien's achievements, I, in this review, will stress Lewis and how, in keeping a keen interest and continual encouragement in this work, is, in an indirect way, as much responsible as Tolkien is, though this book is none of Lewis's creation. I only choose to stress this because it seems it is not very often pointed out.C. S. Lewis has accomplished many things as a writer and a Christian, which an incredible amount to contribute to the world of literature. Some will argue what is his most important literary contribution, wether it be THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, TILL WE HAVE FACES, literary criticism, or his apologetic works. But these arguments always leave out what I feel is the single most important contribution he ever made to the world of literature.THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Without Lewis, we would not have the genre of fantasy as we know it, because Tolkien would not have finished his masterpiece. In Tolkien's own words, he says, \\"But for the encouragement of C.S.L. I do not think I should ever have completed or offered for publication THE LORD OF THE RINGS,\\" in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, #282. Lewis said that he had no influence on Tolkien in the conventional way - that is, Lewis had no influence on WHAT he wrote. His main contribution was just to listen. He said of his own role to his famous friend was that of a midwife to Tolkien's works, not a father. As far as any substance or influence goes, I think the only appearance of C. S. Lewis in the works of Tolkien is the character Treebeard, which, according to Carpenter's biography TOLKIEN, whose voice is modeled after the speech patterns of Lewis, with his great \\"ho hum\\" voice that had a tendency to be rather booming. In Lewis's own fiction, the character of Elwin Ransom from his space trilogy is modeled after Tolkien, for Ransom, like Tolkien, is a philologist, and according to Tolkien some of his ideas and concepts regarding the discipline of philology were \\"Lewisfied\\" (Tolkien's terminology, not mine) in the character of Ransom (again, Carpenter, and I think this information is also in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN.)Without C. S. Lewis, Tolkien would have never completed THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and it wouldn't be published, and the fantasy market would be totally different today - if indeed it existed at all. As far as literature goes, C. S. Lewis has nothing that can compare to this (although his body of work is better than Tolkien's). It makes the accomplishment of Lewis even more drastic than before, and although it is none of his invention, in an indirect way Lewis is as much responsible, even barring THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, for the fantasy market as Tolkien (although Lewis's greatest accomplishment in life is leading people to Jesus through his writings).So much has been said of the accomplishments Tolkien did little needs to be said here. Essentially, with the publication of this book (it is NOT a trilogy, as Tolkien was always quick to point out) Tolkien single handedly invented the fantasy genre as we know it today. Almost every fantasy novel today has a debt to Tolkien and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, even if the writer has never read it (which is highly unlikely). This is fantasy's masterpiece, the one that started it all. Like the Amazon.com review said, this is the Bible of fantasy. It is also, perhaps, the single greatest Christian novel ever written (Tolkien was a staunch Roman Catholic, ans his views and worship came from Middle-earth). Several poles have been taken, naming this the book of the century. Without C. S. Lewis, none of this would have been possible, because Tolkien would not have finished it. (The same can be said of his son Christopher, who read it as it was being written).So you see, it's because of C. S. Lewis that and Tolkien's son Christopher that Tolkien finished what has been hailed as the most important novel of the twentieth century. We owe C. S. Lewis a tremendous debt in the field of literature, and this only greatly increases that debt for the enrichment he as brought the realm of written word. This book is the single most important thing contribution he ever did in the field of literature simply because he stood fast and encouraged his friend Tolkien to see it to completion. Bravo Lewis! And of course a hearty applause for Tolkien.----------[I replaced the original review with the new review back in 2001.

Thanks again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review compares the new 3 book hardcover box set illustrated by Alan Lee (ISBN 0618260587, pub Nov 2002) to the single volume hardcover edition which also contains the Alan Lee illustrations (ISBN 0395595118, pub Nov 1991).All of these books have the typical fabric covered cardboard dust jackets, and each jacket cover is emblazoned with a sample of the artists' work. The binding of the 3 book set seems superior to that of the single volume and will probably last longer, especially when you take into account the fact that with one book, there are 3 times more pages to be held together!One of the biggest differences between these books is the quality of the paper. The paper in the single volume is white, non-gloss, and unsuitably thin; the text of an underlying page can easily be seen. On a positive note, the pages that contain the art work are thicker with a glossy finish; the art is on one side and the opposite side is blank. The paper in the 3 book set is white, semi-glossy, and fairly thick. Pages that have art work on one side have text on the back.There are also differences to be found in the printed text. The single volume is bolder, coarser, and very easy to read. The 3 volume set employs a more delicate and elegant style of type, which makes it slightly harder to see from a distance, but nonetheless is easily read.Both volumes do a good job of presenting Alan Lee's art. The pictures are placed to follow the story, and I think Mr. Lee does an excellent job of using Tolkiens words to create a visual presentation of the characters and locations. Some people have complained that the colors are a little drab, and in some cases I would agree, but I think that one of the reasons for this is the fact that all of these pictures were done in watercolor. One thing I noticed was that the colors in the one volume set seemed a little more vibrant and are probably truer to the original paintings than those in the box set, but this will not be noticeable unless you have them side by side. In addition, the maps in the single edition are all printed on the same thin paper as the rest of the text and are located in the back of the book. In the box set, the maps are printed on the inside covers of the dust jackets.In summary, I feel that this box set is probably the best hardcover edition you can buy, illustrated or not. It is very well constructed and I think you are getting a lot of value for your money. I would also like to mention that there is an Alan Lee illustrated hardcover version of \\"The Hobbit\\" which is the same size as this boxed set and looks good on the bookshelf together. It is ISBN 0395873460, pub 1997. For anyone wishing to see the artwork contained in these books as well as other Tolkien inspired art,. John Howe is another well known artist of Middle Earth who, along with Alan Lee, served as a creative consultant for the current 'Lord of the Rings' movies. Ted Nasmith has also created some very nice interpretations of Tolkien's work. Keep in mind that some of the pictures are from books other than the 'Lord of the Rings' such as 'The Hobbit' and 'The Silmarillion'."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I originally read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; eight years ago, when I was eleven years old. While I understood and enjoyed some of the story, I wasn't old enough to truly get into it. A couple of months ago, I was browsing a local bookstore and ran across the leather-bound Collector's Edition. While it held a hefty price tag, I've always been a big fan of high-quality, solid-feeling items. Especially books. So, I purchased it and read the story for the second time in my life... It was even better than I remember it as a child.The bottom line is that if you're looking for a long-lasting piece of literature (physically and mentally), the Collector's Edition is the book for you and is completely worth the price you'll pay."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think that this was the best book that i have ever read.

That is not to say that the reader (or listener) will not thoroughly enjoy the tale as J.R.R. Tolkien has an uncommon ability to weave a story. I read this series of books about 25 years ago over a two week period. As these are lengthy books (really not lengthy enough) and I am no speed reader, it should tell you how engrossing they were. Every year since then I have read these books again. When I discovered a box under the tree from my sister, I was delighted to find the BBC dramatization of these books on CD. The BBC did a wonderful job with this story. It almost feels as if you are there with Frodo and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring. So go and join with Frodo and the fellowship and have yourself a merry adventure.

(I can't speak to the defects of the edition, as I haven't seen this edition.)W.H. Auden said of LOTR \\"if anyone says that he does not like it, I will never trust his literary judgement again.\\" When one of the greatest English-language poets of the 20th C. says something like this, he should be paid attention to. Now, I'm not saying that anyone should say that he likes it if he does not; far from it. But consider: do you consider your literary judgement superior to Audens? What have you written lately? Do you not think that, when your evaluation of a work is so different from that of someone like him that perhaps, just perhaps, you may have missed something? Just because someone who is tone-deaf can't appreciate a Beethoven symphony, or someone who is color-blind can't appreciate a painting by Matisse doesn't mean that there is something wrong with either the symphony or the painting, but rather with the ears and eyes of the beholder.The charge that JRRT is a racist falls flat as soon as it is seriously examined. The whole point of LOTR is the members of the different races--dwarf, elf, human, hobbit--uniting and overcoming their mutual distrust and dislike for one another in the face of something that will destroy them all if they do not unite. The one character who is arrogantly sure of his race's superiority, and who never thinks that he could be wrong, is Denethor, and look what happens to him!As for the charge of the glorification of war, that, too falls flat. JRRT had been a junior officer in the British Army's infantry during WW I; he was at THE SOMME. He was one of seven good friends to enlist together; only two survived the War. How could a man like that glorify war? Read his descriptions of the Dead Marshes and the Morannon in LOTR, and of Sam's reaction to the skirmish in Ithilien; read the description of the Battle of the V Armies and the aftermath in THE HOBBIT. These are not the writings of a warmonger.In short, for those who did not like the book, finding it 'boring, trivial or contemptable', JRRT himself said that he didn't mind, as he had similar opinions of their writings, or of the sort of writing they appear to prefer. For those of you who think he had a sinister political or social agenda, read it again, a little more carefully, and you will see that you are mistaken."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If a perspective buyer one is looking at this particular edition of the LOTR, one can assume a few things.1) He/She has already read the books.2) From that reading he/she has developed the devotion to the books that would encourage them to purchase an incredibly expensive edition.Therefore, I would ask that neophytes and Philistines keep their myopic understanding of the books themselves to reviews of the $7.99 commercial paperback edition, not the 50th Anniversary Special Edition, nor the Three Volume Illustrated Edition, nor the Original Red-bound Special Edition.I don't care that you \\"thought the movies were better\\" or that you \\"got bored\\" by the exposition. Tell someone who is shopping for their 10 year old.If I am looking at an edition that retails for $80, I am not interested in any moronic drivel that masquerades as criticism.

Espoecially disturbing were when the high elfs had voices that sounded like Alvin, Theodore and Simon, rather than the noble creatures they should sound like, and Tom Bombadil sounding like a tripped out leprechaun. It also bothers me that almost every actor seems to be reading, so much so that you can hear the pause as they come to the end of a line or page, even if it is mid-sentance.

My expectations were to have someone read The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King word for word, but I was wrong, and deeply disappointed.What I got instead was more like a play, an adaptation of the story with multiple actors and sound effects.They got most of the story down, even Tom Bombadill (who was skipped over in the movies), though I feel they left out a few minor things (the fate of Bill the Pony was one that comes to mind, minor, I know) so in that respect it wasn't a let down.The let down came from my own expectations and from the presentation. My expectations are something that's my own fault, I should have researched this more (I was in a rush, the trip came up suddenly) so, if you're like me and hoping this is a reading of the great books, look elsewhere but, if you're ok with listening to a made for radio play, you might enjoy this.The presentation faults were very hard to get over. A few of the voice actors are fine, but most of them were hard to listen to. The actor playing Frodo seemed to be uninterested, Sam was almost painful to listen to, Saruman sounded more like an Ork, and the Ring Wraith's were almost impossible to understand. Add to this the very 60's sound effects and a lot of \\"yes...\\" comments said at odd times... it was a bit melodramatic and not all that well acted for my tastes.In closing, most of my disappointment comes from my expectations not being met due to the fact that the product was not what I expected it to be. The story is there, yes, but its under the not so great voice acting and terrible sound effects. If all you want is to have the books read to you, look elsewhere but, if you're in the mood for a different rendition of the books, and are ok with some cheesy acting, the price is right for the amount of time you'll get out of this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I ordered a set of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and upon arrival I noticed that the books were individually priced and that I had payed nearly double the price of the three books! I emailed the company which I had purchased from and inquired if it would be possible to return the books for a refund. I was answered promptly an told I would be able to retun the books for a full refund. I then sent the books back and checked to see if and when the company had recieved the package, which they had. It's has now been nearly a month and a half since I have returned those books AND I HAVE YET TO BE REFUNDED!!! I have emailed them twice and have received no reply. I do not recommend buying from this group and if anyone could help me get my money back it would be GREATLY appreciated!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've known about Tolkien since I was a teenager and first discovered the fantasy genre. Nonetheless, I never got around to reading LOTR. Then \\"life\\" happened and I found myself in mid-30s, having seen the movies, and with enough time to spare that I finally decided to make the effort and read them. Others have sang the praises of this wonderful tale with far greater skill than I am able to muster, but suffice it to say that this is the best story that I've read in my whole life. Being a Christian, the allusions to the person of Jesus Christ caused giddiness within me that I haven't felt since I was a much younger, and less careworn man. Being a fan of fantasy, I have read no other author who spun so rich a tapestry as Tolkien. If you can read, take the time to treat yourself to this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's consensus throughout the publishing world that The Lord of the Rings is the greatest literary achievement of the twentieth century. No other writer than J.R.R. Tolkien would dare to have spent most of his life creating background material for a single book. Even if you have seen the movies, you should read the books because there is so much stuff in the The Lord of the Rings that never made it into the films.The thing that impresses me the most about The Lord of the Rings is how real everything seems. I'm not yet fully convinced that there isn't a real Middle-Earth with Hobbits, Elves, and Wizards in a forgotten pre-history of our world! Anyone who considers themselves a true fantasy fan should read these books.The Lord of the Rings is one of the only books (trilogy or otherwise) I find myself constantly reading over and over again. They truly don't write books like The Lord of the Rings anymore. It is a masterpiece of literature without peer and will remain so for years to come. One ring to rule them all indeed!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I recieved this book and the artwork on the novels in fantastic. It really gives the books a great look and I have had fellow friends and family comment on how wonderful the artwork is too.The whole Lord of the Rings novel is split into the three parts making it a trilogy, like the movies. This makes for easy handling of the book while reading instead of readind and trying to hold a 1000 or more page novel in your bed or in a chair.This novel has a great story to it. Anybody looking for a great long novel would definetly enjoy this one. It gives a lot of background into the characters and really helps their image develop in your mind.This product is an A+ for me and they couldn't have done it any better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I really liked this anniversary edition. it is absolutly beautiful. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It is a good item for a collector."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this book for my husband who is a huge Lord of the Rings fan. He then said, \\"This is the best anniversary edition I've ever seen.\\" The book is extremely well made and absolutely beautiful."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These books, which are the full story of the One Ring, which is explained along with other matters in The Silmarillion (Written by Tolkien, but his son edited and published it on account of his father's death) are indeed one of the best if not the best fantasy books written. The plot is simple and intriguing at the same time. I love these books and find Tolkien to be a sheer genius, as he created and made the entire history of Middle-Earth, almost as detailed as a Bible. Something that may draw people away is racial comments, which are proved UNTRUE. Tolkien published the book and said it has nothing to do with outside affairs. The Orcs in these books are evil, and always considered so, as they are TRAINED to be evil, yes trained. Elves in these books are usually portrayed the greatest, but note that the Orcs came from Elves, which says that they cannot be perfect. Same with Hobbits, look at Smeagol (Gollum) who was a Hobbit and became a vile creature. Apart from that, I'll comment on how the book is so great. The incredible description of characters, which makes you feel like you actually know them. If you were to read the LotR, I would recommend to read The Silmarillion, first, followed by The Hobbit. Those two books are for those who really wish to know the series. It's still easy to read the LotR without being dumbfounded, but I think it is a wise choice to read these two. If the man takes his entire life making and building the history, and creating the languages and the people, you just have to know that his books must be excellent. Thankyou."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For all parents who have taken your children to the newly released &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, I challenge you to pick up &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and read it aloud to your children. This will work best with kids 10 and older. Read a page or two every night at bedtime. I've read through &quot;The Hobbit&quot; twice to our kids, and have read through &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy once to them. Our boys are all teenagers. We read every night for 20-30 minutes. We've also unplugged our TV and replace this time with reading in our home. Tolkein is an excellent storyteller, with vivid descriptions a cinematographer can only begin to play with. Your child's imagination is so much greater than that of any movie maker. Give them the gift of your time and Tolkein's genius writing: Read Tolkein Aloud to your Kids!For two books filled with other creative ideas for parents such as this one, take a look at &quot;The Family Cloister&quot; and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot;, both written by David Robinson."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What else can you say about this work. It is the greatest tale ever told."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Look, it's quite simple. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, something's wrong with you. If you think this is a children's book, you're mistaken. If you think it's just another dime-a-dozen pulp fantasy novel for Dungeons &amp; Dragons geeks, think again. This is a classic of English literature.Tolkien's world is so mind-bogglingly deep, rich, and vast that when you reach the end of the book, you might be startled to find yourself back in the &quot;real&quot; world. Tolkien's genius just sucks you in; his prose is utterly convincing. The characters become a part of you. His portrait of Middle Earth is one of the most vivid and lifelike ever put on paper.The language is sometimes dense, but it's so rewarding that it never feels difficult. The first time I read the books I think I completed each one in a single sitting.This is a book for everyone. It truly is mythic: there are the archetypes of Paradise, destiny and free will, Armageddon, the crusade of good against evil, and Man's place in the cosmos. You'll find yourself reading it time and time again. Invest in the hardcover edition, and pass it on to your grandkids."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best fantasy book ever written. Anyone who enjoys fantasy should read it. I personally thought it was going to be montonious, but it wasn't. The descripions are so vivid you really can't get the whole picture withtout reading it several times. You can really relate to Frodo's struggle against the lure of the Ring with every-day battles against corruption and selfishness. And the illistrations are incredible. JRR Tolkien is a master at at worlds, a wizard at his own art. There truly is no prase for a book so classic. I've heard of people saying that its boring, that the conversations take too long, and so on. Well, maybe this just isn't the book for you. But for thousands of others it is, and this is at the top of my book-recomendation list. We have grown too used to books that are short and without any depth--a trilogy today can never match the breadth and beauty of Middle Earth. Even some of the best fantasy writers today can't match this--Tolkein's writings top the charts. Yes, there are many great fantasy books out there that come close, but can never pass this. He was the first great fantasy writer in this genre of fantasy, and I think he will still be the greatest fantasy writer hundreds of years from now, just as the songs of the fifties, sixties, seventies and eigthies will be played many years from now.READ THIS BOOK.You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can I say?

If you like any fantasy books (e.g. Harry Potter, The Once and Future King, etc.) you'll love this series. Also try all of J.R.R. Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a review of the Soundelux edition of the 1979 NPR broadcasts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (LOTR).Hobbits are funny little fat people with hair on their feet. They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.The company travels through strange lands, confronts awful perils, makes exotic friends, and all the while battles the evil influence of Sauron, the Dark Lord. Eventually they become separated and undertake individual quests. They perform mighty deeds, endure privation, suffer grievous wounds, and some of them even die, but finally the survivors reunite at a battle before the very gates of the Evil Empire. The battle is not an Armageddon, with a fore-ordained winner. It is a Ragnarok whose outcome cannot be known. Writers have often imitated, but never equaled, Tolkien's adult fairy tale.Although I'm not 100% sure, I believe the Soundelux production differs from the BBC production of LOTR. The production values and acting quality suffer by comparison with the BBC production of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; To say that production values are only adequate is no condemnation. A great story can survive even a poor telling, and this production of LOTR is NOT a poor telling of the story. One strong recommendation for the Soundelux edition: the producers edited out almost all the songs and poems which add such tedium to the print version of LOTR."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's the best Saga that I have ever read.

Compare the number of high ratings to the number of low ratings. I can't help but think that those who gave this classic a low rating started reading it determined to dislike it, and/or decided to skim through the book rather than actually read it.I just can't understand the people who say it's boring with the characters just travelling place to place not doing anything. Or saying Tolkien is racist. Or that the text is juvenile.Nothing like that happens in the books. Are they just staring in the general direction of a copy and selectively reading in their own &quot;special&quot; way ??? Who knows.Follow the democratic process, and try it.Ok look, if you're really skeptical, save reading the Prologue until the end. You'll _want_ to read it by then.

Thenovel is an in-depth look at the world of Middle Earth, and,more specifically, the quest of the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, torid Middle Earth of the One Ring and its master, Sauron, theDark Lord.The Lord of the Rings is among the best works of fantasy fictionever written. Tolkien does an excellent job of fabricatingan entire milieu within which his characters operate. Tolkienwas a linguist, consequently, he actually created several languagesfor his characters to speak. He was also an avid fan of mythology,and created a whole pantheon of mythological deities which addsgreat dimension to the work. The depth of The Lord of the Rings is definitely one of its strongest points.The Lord of the Rings takes the reader on a spell-bindingadventure through forest and fen, over and under mountains,and into the darkest recesses of evil. And indeed, it is theclassic saga of good versus evil, but it is quite differentthan most stories which fall into this category. Tolkienunderstands that good ends cannot be achieved without sacrifices,and the ending to his novel is ample proof of that.The only major problem with this book is its length,which is compounded by long stretches of detailed description.Tolkien was painstakingly thorough in his descriptions ofthe surroundings of the characters. Additionally, there aremany snippets of poetry which, while they can be entertaining,do not contribute significantly to the work.The Lord of the Rings is a must read for fantasy fictionbuffs. Tolkien has also authored several other books whichsupport this book, including The Hobbit and The Silmarillon."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read this wonderful tale too many times to count over the years. With each reading, I appreciate even more Tolkien's amazing world of language, cultures and geographies, along with his wonderful ability to spin a story. It was convenient to have it in electronic reader form, but I missed the maps from the books. There is only a general map in the front and it doesn't do the job of the maps in the original three book set. Reading Lord of the Rings is like reading a historical account of a great war. Any such account needs maps for reference and context.

I don't think I can add much to one of the most reviewed book of all times but I will always keep in mind what Ursula K. LeGuin wrote about it in her \\"Rhythmic Patterning in The Lord of the Rings\\" article, that \\"It's a wonderful book to read aloud or (consensus by the children) listen to.\\" and that \\"... it wants the living voice to speak it, to find its full beauty and power, its subtle music, its rhythmic vitality.\\"After the end of this literary journey, I have a strong feeling, an inner sound that tells me I have yet to face many events that will be tied to LOTR in some way. This may well be the echoes of my past reading, and sometimes reading aloud; but even if that feeling is illusory, and the sound is void, I have to thank to Tolkien for having created such a repercussive narration.

I was so enthralled that I wanted to purchase a new copy for myself to replace the paperback version that I was borrowing, which had begun to tear apart due to wear and the excessive amount of pages. I was ecstatic when I found a \\"Hardcover\\" edition of the same version on Amazon for only $0.80 with free Prime shipping. Unfortunately, I opened the package today to find that the version shipped to me by a seller named \\"Bob Lewis\\" was really only the same paperback version that I already had. The shipping was fast, the price is excellent, and I love these books, but be warned when ordering that if the price seems too good to be true for a hardcover, then there is a good chance that you will actually receive the paperback. Normally I have no problem with paperback books, but this edition is cheaply bound and the extreme wait of the 1000+ pages tends to tear them from the spine.

The old one, the original, not those new crap. Really nice for your library too"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have never been a reader, infact I hate books because I have always found something better to do. For years I have tried to get into reading without success. Until one day, I decided to pick up &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and read the first few pages, for fun. Well, pages turned into chapters and before I knew it I had finished the book. Craving for more I relished the three books which followed The Hobbit. Not only did it change my view on reading but my view on life itself. I can honestly say that reading the Lord Of The Rings trilogy is one of the best things I have ever done. Nothing I can say about the book will do it justice. All I can say is: if you like magic, mistery, adventure, heriosm romance or even a classic, look no furhter than the Lord Of The Rings. The book itself is rich in culture and history and I promise you that after 100 pages you'll be hooked. I fell in love with the characters and if truth be told, I cried when I finished it. It will forever remain a part of my life and I am not at all surprised to see that it is Amazon's book of the century (twice). The only mistake I made was reading it first, now any other book I read will have to be compared to the uncomparible masterpiece that is Lord Of The Rings. I urge any person who calls themselves a reader to gorge themselves in the wonder and TIMELESS beauty of Lord Of The Rings, for in my eyes you are not a reader until you have read this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one of the greatest achievements of the written word. Tolkien did what few writers can do. He creates a mythology, a different world. I consider Tolkien to be one of the greatest writers of all time. Other people will say Dickens or Shakespeare. Yes they were great writers, but Tolkien went beyond creating a story. He created an entire world. Can't say the same of Dickens.But the story is very good as well. It is a very powerful story of triumph over incredible odds and triumph over despair. Tolkien served in the First World War and lost almost all of his friends. He saw so much death and horror and he needed a new explanation of good and evil. That's where you get this story where good and evil are so clearly defined. He also created this world where the heroes do not succumb to despair. Tolkien had to triumph over despair himself after the disastrous war. The characters embody his spirit of going on even though there may not be any hope.But also, some of the most powerful parts of the book come after the Ring is destroyed. The book is also about things that have gone and will never come back. The full, complete story of the elves coming to Middle-earth and then leaving it to men, is very sad and powerful. After the Ring is destroyed many things happen to show this theme. The funeral of Theoden, the various partings with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Celeborn and Galdriel, the return to Rivendell, the Scouring of the Shire, and the Grey Havens. Treebeard says that the world is changing and he is right. So many things that were good are passing. It's a shame that they couldn't put all this stuff into the movie. But the modern moviegoing taste is more giant climactic battle scenes and five seconds later it fades out and the creadits roll. Even with the ending in the movie as short as it was, people complained. \\"Too many endings, man\\". Yeah, right.But, on its own, the movie is great and the book is great. They are different things and should be considered seperate from each other.This book remains one of the greatest of all time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read LOTR many times in both paperback and hardcover. On the Kindle, it's easy to carry with me and has the added benefit of Kindle's preloaded New Oxford American Dictionary. I can pause my reading momentarily to instantly satisfy my curiosity about the source of words like \\"barrow\\" and \\"withe.\\" (Yes, I'm a nerd.) Being my favorite book, LOTR has many passages that have stuck with me over the years, and the Kindle's ability to search for specific words makes it easy to locate all those pithy quotes I half-remember and the context in which they were spoken. The Kindle version offers the capability for greater depth of enjoyment in a book you've probably already read.The Kindle version has all the notes, forewords, prologues, and appendixes of various editions released over the years. There are at least seven maps that encompass both overviews and close-ups of various regions of Middle Earth. My Kindle is the smaller one, so even with the magnifying feature, it's a little hard to see the map details, but then I'm over fifty, and my eyes aren't what they used to be. At least the maps are there, and I do have my traditional books for bigger maps as well as a giant fold-out one.Having all three books in one printed edition can be heavy and unwieldy when you're reading it, but three-in-one is a convenient benefit in the e-version, and it gives a sense of cohesion--especially when doing word or phrase searches where you don't know which book of the trilogy to look in. I'm a huge LOTR fan, so the Kindle edition was well worth the reasonable price to add it to my Tolkien collection!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought the paperback copy, but was unable to finish the book bec it's too big and heavy. Wanted to get the kindle edition, but i don't want to pay the hefty price. One day while browsing my wish list... Surprise.... Surprise... It just 9.99$. My waiting paid off and now I can enjoy one of my favorite movies of all time in its book form. Haven't really found any major problems in the kindle form but for some very minor typos ( et for eat ). No biggie... At least I don't have to carry the very huge book. I am enjoying the book very much..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was disappointed by this set. Although promoted as \\"The Lord of the Rings J. R. R. Tolkien and Alan Lee (Hardcover - Mar 1988), the only illustrations were on the covers of the books. Also, the copy I received was missing the last 30 pages from The Fellowship of the Ring (the most important climaxes in the book!) and skipped straight to the index. I do not know if this is a publication error or if I just happened to get a bad copy, but I thought it better safe than sorry to get a different edition instead.If you want additional content like illustrations and the sort, this isn't the set for you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Only an balrog could object to an revised 50th anniversary edition, with corrections beyond those in the the standard revised version. BUT...This is *not* a leather binding: it's a very ordinary hardcover edition with paper-thin faux leather glued over paper boards. The bookmark ribbon breaks the binding. Signatures glued rather than sewn together, not held together by the 'leather,' separated from paper spine. Poor production generally: end papers badly centered, more than a little random glue and rubber cement on the covers that really mars the appearance. Mine is the second printing, I do not see the poor type-setting complained of by other reviewers.Look at Customer Image #18 to see for your self.It's an OK one-volume edition, given the revisions and illustrations. *NOT* a 'collectible', barely worth the discounted $56 given the disappointment factor. *Don't* give this as a gift to a Tolkien fan, expecting rapture.Calling this 'leather bound' is *serious* misrepresentation of the product."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I do not own a kindle, i just use the app on my phone and may start using it on my computer(s). The Lord of the Rings is a great book to start out a kindle ebook collection. If you get sucked into the world that Tolkien has created, you will want to come back to your favorite passages again and again. And unlike a cumbersome book (or three, depending on how you bought the story), this is very easy to search and book mark and add notation (or tags for searching). It will get you using some of kindle's more advanced features and it will increase your satisfaction as you can quickly bounce between appendices and the main story.Even if you have a physical copy, any fan would do well to pick up this fabulous digital edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is for the Houghton Mifflin (Nov 2002) 3 book hard-cover boxed set (ISBN-10:0618260587). What can I say about the books other than they are so good, I chose to purchase this edition to have as a keepsake. They are big...approx. 8\\" x 10\\" and weighty...but well made and beautiful. The illustrations by Alan Lee provide visual treats to further enhance this masterpiece of fantasy fiction. I have read the story countless times...so many in fact that my original book is falling to pieces. This new boxed set will see better handling and care. It is well-made with clear type on semi-glossy paper. Some people have reported a bit of glare off the pages but it is nothing too serious for most lighting conditions. This edition is a very worthwhile addition to my collection."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"JRR Tolkien is the grandfather of modern fantasy; his epic work THE LORD OF THE RINGS continues to inspire writers. Without Tolkien, we don't have Terry Pratchett, JK Rowling, Jim Butcher, Mercedes Lackey -- the list is long. Tolkien took fantasy from the province of children and created a new genre of literature that was the proper playground for adults. He made a place for the myths and legends of the past to come and be welcome in the modern world.THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a grand epic story set in the world that Tolkien created called Middle-Earth, astonishingly peopled and rich in lore, languages and cultures. (The different languages caused publication errors and inconsistencies in many early editions.) It is fabulous entertainment on so vast a scale that no movie to date has completely captured all the diverse themes and characters. (Yes, Peter Jackson made a great try, but where's Saruman, eh?) It is difficult for a short review to do this great work justice. But part of the impact and fascination of the work can be explained by examining Tolkien's three main heroes.Gandalf the Wizard is an attractive figure, mysterious and powerful. With his long beard, homespun robes and long staff, he has some of the characteristics of a Biblical prophet, and he is indeed a messenger of the gods, sent to struggle against the evil of the Enemy. He's kind to hobbits and children, good with fireworks and special effects at parties, but he's also capable of chasing away Nazgul and healing King Theoden. He's likable, compelling, magical and not without touches of humor. He can't even die -- he gets sent back to assure that his job gets done.Aragon is a figure out of legend--the king in exile who will defeat the Great Enemy and restore the kingdom to peace and glory. Spurring him on in his ambition is the great love of his life, Arwen Evenstar, who will chose a mortal life to be his wife and Queen. Aragon changes in the eyes of the reader from the suspicious Strider to the noble king being crowned at Minas Tirith but this is a case of his nature being gradually revealed to us.Wizard and warrior king are stock characters in traditional fantasy. Tolkien gives us great examples in Gandalf and Aragon, but the compelling edge of his great epic comes from the character of Frodo. Whereas Gandalf has a job to do and is given great powers to help accomplish it, Frodo has only dogged perseverance. While Aragon wins his kingdom and his elven princess, Frodo hazards all he has, and loses it. He sacrifices everything for the Shire, but returns so damaged in spirit that he can not live there.When I first read this book as a teeny-bopper, I thought Gandalf was cool--galloping around on a fabulous horse and zapping bad guys on winged monsters. Later, I thought Aragon was a heartthrob--so handsome and noble, all the girls are crazy about him. But as I get older, the character of Frodo speaks to me: the little guy, putting one foot after another on a hopeless quest, bearing a treasure that must be destroyed, knowing in his heart that he will fail before the end, and at the last, accomplishing his quest only because he showed mercy to an enemy. Is this fantasy? Or wisdom to armor one in the quest for a life well-lived?More than 40 years after I first read this, I bowed to the inevitable and replaced my tattered paperback edition with a boxed hardback set. I love having the red and black ink maps of Middle Earth in full fold-out glory."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is not leather. If you read the product description at Houghton Mifflin's website, http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=689507, nowhere does it claim to be leatherbound. That being said this is still the most beautiful comprehensive edition of the Lord of the Rings I have laid eyes on. I would advise not trying to pull the maps apart the first time, I used a pocket knife to seperate the pages, as you will certainly tear them. I've submited a correction about the leather binding to Amazon, hopefully they will correct this. I would hate for anything to detract from this work of art."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can't imagine a better reader for this material than the man they chose, Rob Inglis. I listen to LOTS AND LOTS of audiobooks, and this is among my favorite. The books themselves are quite imposing in size for someone like me, in that I don't have a whole lot of time to read, so the audio version is always my first choice. This is a breathtakingly spectacular piece of work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Sure this is a handsome, sturdy edition, but nothing new here. Some Tolkien paintings are nice, slip case is nice, but its hardly a revised text, it's the same text they've been printing for years.If you have the red-leatherette version or the magnificent Allen Lee Illustrated version don't go this route. If all you have is three volume or paperback, this ones a nice addition.I would, however, recomend the Allen Lee version, the text is not only complete, but the page numbers are correct and do not start over at \\"1\\" with the Two Towers and ROTK. Plus, Peter Jacksons films look exactly like the Allen Lee illustrations, some are so close they look like he was painting the film, not the other way around.So, nice copy, but not an upgrade."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'd like to know why this edition, being sold as the 'Illustrated Edition' has 34 sample pages available on the web site of which NONE show any examples of the illustrations (except the cover) ! I hope you will treat this review as 'contructive criticism'"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read The Trilogy many times over the years, often in the summer. This year I decided to download the trilogy for my Kindle Fire. I am so glad I did! The price is a bargain, having all 3 books in a single download is a no-brainer and it's simple to quickly check the maps and navigate. So glad I got this, my daughter plans to read it next."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I always was a giant fan of Lord of the Rings, ever since I got my hands on a copy of The Hobbit only to find out there was more to the story. I never owned a true copy of Lord of the Rings until now and this book does not disappoint. It is beautiful and extremely well made. This Leather Bound edition is truly the One Book to Rule them All!!The Leather Bound 50th Anniversary edition of Lord of the Rings might be fairly expensive compared to the simple hard-cover edition, but it makes up for it in style.- Leather Bound book cover and Leather bound storage case (it feels like 'faux' leather to me however). The leather isn't pitch black like the default image shows, and appears blueish if you try to photograph it. The Leather my edition came with has this nice Black Ash look to it. Imagine black with some ash gently brushed into it.- Pages are gold edged, and are extremely reflective. The pages themselves feel heavy duty and smooth to the touch. Also included are 3 pages from the Book of Mazarbul on laminated pages. Although I found the pictures a tad dark, it makes for a nice collective piece of Tolkien art.- The leafing on the leather itself is high quality and clearly meant to lastThe included maps are beautiful, as is the addition of red text throughout the book on key elements (such as the writings on the ring) is a nice touch. Included is a lovely red ribbon that is smooth and high quality. It is bound to the book inside the binding itself. With the entire story printed under one cover this book comes in at about 4 lbs**Overall this is a must have for the Lord of the Rings fan whom has always wanted a single print edition of the book. There have been over 400 corrections made which makes this book the most accurate print version to date. For the collector the [Leather Bound] version is worth the price! High quality and just beautiful workmanship was put into this book. For the casual fan, perhaps the standard hardcover edition would be enough and saves you some $ in the process.* A few warnings to be aware of with the Leather Bound edition.1- Check your binding! The ribbon itself is bound to the binding itself. My edition had the ribbon bound in the \\"middle\\" of the book and the binding was flawless. Reading around it appears versions where the ribbon was bound towards the beginning or end of the binding itself caused the binding to \\"weaken\\". (there are even user pictures showing this above)2- This isn't a 100% solid leather covering. It is just leather wrapped around a standard hardcover frame. (you can tell because the leather itself isn't attached to the book at the spine)3- The Maps are attached / bound to the book so don't quickly yank on them or they will rip. Be very careful when opening them also as they used adhesive to hold it closed (no idea why they would glue it closed)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Others have already left excellent reviews of this edition [ISBN 0-618-26051-X] and of the book, but I wanted to address a couple of points made by reviewers.1) I'm not having any difficulty with the glare cited by one reviewer. While it's true that all of the pages are glossy, not just the illustrations, this has not caused me any eyestrain or irritation. Changing the book's angle to the light resolves the issue easily.2) The bigger challenge is the weight of the individual volumes. I chose this edition over the one-volume ones, because those seem to me to be more for display than reading. Even divided into three parts, however, these hardcover volumes are too heavy to hold unsupported for long. You will want to rest them on something, and those with wrist issues may want to consider the paperback editions.Overall, however, I agree with other reviewers that these are beautiful books with color illustrations, 2-color maps, and clear text (not too tiny). They offer a middle way between a truly massive one-volume and less displayable paperback versions."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I will not rate the content of the work other than to say, yes, this is the quintessential and definitive work of fantasy fiction on the planet. ALL other 20th century and beyond works owe much influence and inspiration to it. End of discussion. Those that say it's \\"boring\\"? simply don't have an attention span longer than the first level of their favorite video game. Real life takes longer than that.But this review is not about all that. This is to speak to the actual physical edition and it's quality. I purchased this edition a few years ago so as to have a substantial \\"Master Bookshelf Copy\\" of the work. I never intended that these books would be my \\"reading\\" copies. I have lesser versions for that duty. Others have complained that this version is of very poor quality concerning paper, printing and binding. I have not found my copy to so afflicted. I went back through each book to check. And I found consistent and solid black printing throughout. The maps were not adversely attached and are easily removed as needed. The covers, while not exceptional, are certainly adequate and acceptable.I have no tangible complaints with this edition where it concerns quality."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm reviewing the latest Houghton Mifflin print of the Lord of the Rings 50th ann addition.This is a beautiful book, no question. Two reasons why I didn't give it a 5 star.1) It's a little confusing from other reviews and book description whether this is really leather. With this book in hand, I can say it is NOT leather. It is leather look. In fact, it is not the best faux leather either, but it is a nice material and cover.2) There's a little bit of rubber glue that holds the foldout maps shut. Opening this is a bit hard and leads to a little bit of rip. So be careful when you open it for the first time. Once open, you can rub off the rubber glue and it's all good.Otherwise this is a great book. Good size and heft. Typeset is big enough to read easily. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a critique of Profesor Tolkien's works: I defer to others more qualified than I to judge his writing.This is merely a review and description of a specific version of The Lord of The Rings. A number of reviews and comments have prompted me to point out some sought-after features of this edition.First, this is only about the edition known as \\"The Centenary (1892-1992).\\" It was published in a single volume by Houghton Mifflin in 1991 to celebrate 100 years since the birth of Professor Tolkien in 1892. To easily identify this book look for, on the back of the dust jacket, a special centenary medallion and ISBN-10: 0-395-59511-8.Alan Lee, reknowned Tolkien artist, was specially commissioned to paint 50 illustrations for this \\"Illustrated Edition.\\" They are beautifully rendered on glossy, high-quality paper and interspersed throughout the book.The book is set in large type, with the typeface clear and easy to read. The paper is good quality, bright white and shows little print \\"bleed-through\\" from following pages. On a personal note, special attention was obviously paid to this edition, as compared to some of the other poorly printed editions. The cover boards are in brown cloth with a simple gilded imprint of the professor's trademark signature. Nothing very fancy, but elegant nonetheless.What should be great news to many readers, this edition is CONTINUOUS from page one to the end. The table of contents lists the SIX books, as Prof. Tolkien intended! Page numbering does not start over after each book:Books 1-2 (Fellowship) = pp. 33 - 428Books 3-4 (Two Towers) = pp. 429 - 772Books 5-6 (Return) = pp. 773 - 1069Appendix A-F = pp.1070 - 1172Six maps of middle-earth are bound in at the end of the book. They are of various aspects of middle-earth, in black and white, and are not fold-out style. They're of medium quality and nothing to write home about.This is a wonderful edition, identified by its special Centenary medallion on the back of the dust jacket, quality printing and beautiful artwork by Alan Lee. If your wrists are strong enough to heft a single-volume LoTR, this makes a great reading copy for your library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love Lord of the Rings - I have several different editions because I like the feel of different sets. I went onto eBay to find copies of the first ever set I read when a teenager. So you could say I am a fan. These books are crisp, clean and beautiful. The illustrations are the best of anything currently in the market. With all that, I would agree with a prior reviewer and say that there could be more color but that is really the artist's choice. Also, for the price I would have loved more pictures.If you are a fan, or friend/spouse/etc. of a fan, I would recommend this set. Be prepared for heavy books (personally I like them) that smell lovely and are a joy to read or browse. If you want something to read around town, obviously get some paperbacks. :-)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If your not convinced yet...This work has been reviewed over and over, so basically everything I have to say has been said before! But *refer to title*!Life without the Lord of the Rings, well... I don't know what it would be like to have never read this book, or even worse, to have read it and failed to be touched by it's meaning, the language, the wonderful characters, all the 1001 places and the history and culture of Middle Earth.If you aren't yet convinced, read this book!! The movies are absolutely, positively no substitute!And the leather bound edition is so beautiful! The ultimate gift for a Rings fan.This is more than a fantasy tale, more than a rollicking good story (though it is definitely both those things). This is a literary work, though not in the conventional sense, which explores themes of heroism, bravery, endurance and most of all friendship. Not to mention good and evil.This is the mother of all epic fantasy - read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The epic scope of this book makes it hard to describe. Good triumphs, but not without paying a tremendous price. The pain of betrayal and the power of friendship are each given a full examination. A whole world is created, with languages and customs that are far from those we understand, but that are based on their own inherent logic. This is just an incredible book; it transports the reader to a world where darkness and light struggle for dominance. There are few books that have this power; make sure you get the opportunity to be part of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J R R Tolken does a wondereful job creating an inner world for the reader to escape into. The story and the characters rivot you to the pages so that you just can't put it down.His first in the series, &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was also great but he deffinately surpassed his writing skills in this and the other subsequent books in the trilogy set.I highly recommend this reading to anyone and strongly suggest to read the entire trilogy set."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the mother and father of all &quot;modern&quot; epic tales.

The format of this book only adds to Tolkien's already astounding masterpeice. The red, leather-bound book with a matching case looks like you pulled it off of a shelf in the hobbit hole of Bag End. It has suprisingly durable gold writing and designs and a large fold out map in the back. It has all of the back ground reading and appendixes you could ever hope for, including general history, family trees, races, places, some hobbit-lore, and a very thorough index. I have fond memories of reading this book and I will have more as I will soon read it again. 1215 pages of happieness, wonder, and, of course, hobbits. A MUST read for anyone with an imagination. I reccomend reading the prelude to this book, the Hobbit, first. Happy shopping"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings over and over and never get tired of it. This is the epic adventure story of a young hobbit, Frodo, who is given the task of destroying an evil ring that, if taken by the enemy, would destroy all of Middle-Earth. Tolkien weaves the story vividly and it enchants the reader making them feal like they actually are in Middle-Earth. You get to know the fellowship and follow them in their paths. The wise Gandalf, the loyal Sam, the stubborn Gimli, the Brave Frodo, the spry hobbits: Merry and Pippin and many other marvolous charictors are alive in the pages of this book. The Lord of the Rings will surely delight any fantasy lover and make you beg for more.The movie is wonderful but it can not compair to the work of Tolkien, read this book and you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"An amazing tale of the small and insignifigant defeating the all powerful. True epic and grandious in its development. One of the most influencial books of the 20 century if not of all time.

For anyone and everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Nothing that I can think of. So I'll simply quote part of Edward Wagenknecht's review of The Two Towers (the second part of the novel) for the Chicago Tribune:&quot;To sum it all up, here is a wonderful story, set in a world which paralyzes the imagination, and told in magnificent prose. What more can an author give?&quot;What indeed?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien has taken the art a writing to the extreme when he wrote these books. There is so much determination, will, and love enveloped in these pages. Frodo has no hope left for his journey, but he tells Sam he will die trying. There is not one person in the world I can think of with that much courage and good inside themselves that will automattically do the right thing, even if their life is at stake. The love Sam shows Frodo, the malice Gollum has within himself, and the purity of the elven people makes me wish I was there in lothlorien with the fellowship. Tolkien created a whole new world for us to enjoy that is as vivid as the one we are in now. To have such a mind that is capable of having this vision, let alone being able to express it so passionately with words is beyond my comprehension. These characters are developed with care to perfection. Anyone who does not like this book needs to reevaluate their definition of a good book, because this is the perfect example. You will cry tears of sadness, joy, and mirth when you read this trilogy. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"so cool...i loved these books and the movie was pretty good too.

The first two books were very good but the third book was the best.During this series you will be taken through a world that is new and very realistic. It is realistic because you can relate to the world and the cahracters. When they feel pain and suffering, you feel it, and when they are feeling happy,you feel it. I fell in love with many of the characters. My favorite character in the series was Gollum(a.k.a. Smeagol).While reading this book I could not put it down because the story gets better and better as you progress. So when it was the end I was disappointed. Every time you turn the page there is a new character or story. For example when the wizard Gandalf died in the first book, you turn the page in the second book to find that he came back more powerful. This series will take you on a ride through your imagination.This book is also the kind if book that you can read over and over again and still be suprised at what you read. You never get bored.The reason why I enjoyed the books very muchwas it was very original and gave a fresh perspective to life. The depth and the amount of time put into this book was well done. What also fascinates me is that J.R.R. Tolkien studied language as a major. And in the series he wrote his own language. What also was very interesting was that the books are wupposed to reflect Tolkien's life journey.One of my favorite characters was Samwise Gamgee, one of the hobbits of the Shire. I thought he was very brave and courageous.I also liked the character Gandalf who was a wizard and he was very wise.I enjoyed the setting and the landscaping of the books.

I would HIGHLY recommend this (along with thousands of others out there) book to anyone who loves the fantasy genre. While some may find it drags a bit, I find it hard to imagine not being taken aback in awe of the sheer scope of this series. I read some hysterical reviews some time back of people claiming that the book promotes racism because white is used as the color of &quot;good&quot; and black as the color of &quot;evil&quot;...absolutely adorable to see kids so insecure in their station in life as to blame a fantasy novel for promoting racism because of the description of the &quot;dark lord&quot;...irregardless, I'll leave the reviews to speak fo r themselves. out of the 1000+ reviews less than 40 (as of my time writing this) are one star, and the vast majority are 5 stars. I'm not saying you'll love it, but as a well-read fan of the genre I can honestly say that I LOVED these books and chances are you will too. oh yes, and those who can't swallow some descriptive imagery and intellect in their books need not apply..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because I was involved in a stage adaptation of \\"The Hobbit\\" a few years ago. I really thought the it would basically be another version of \\"The Hobbit\\" just far more drawn out. I cant even count how many in which I was wrong. \\"The Hobbit\\" was a great book but it does not even come close to how great LOTR is. The story is gripping and the characters are fantastic, even though inner monologues are not used to describe how they are feeling. Tolkien was a story teller of genius. LOTR is a very impressive tale that, in my opinion, might have been even longer in the author's mind. The mythology that Tolkien created will live on as long as the Pagan or Norse mythologies of ages ago. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is STUNNING. ( But one really should read the Hobbit and maybe the Silmarillion before reading it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"i love this book. it restores all three lord of the rings books into one volume like it was originally planned to be all those years ago when it was written. there are maps of middle earth inside along with geneology of the hobbits and an alphabet of the language. i got this book for my last birthday but first read it 9 years ago when i was in 9th grade. it's a bit heavy to carry along with 3 other skool books but i managed and believe it or not it actually got me out of trouble once. anyway, i love this book just because of the aesthetic beauty of it. the story inside is wonderful as well. it's the tale of frodo baggins and his inheritance of the One ring from bilbo. it goes from the rolling hills of the shire to the dark shadows of the mountains of mordor. the quest to destroy the ring and frodo is the only person to have the strength to carry out the deed. it's the tale of the nine and their odyssey to mt. doom to throw the ring back from whence it came. this book is filled with danger, battles, orcs, evil spirits, ring wraiths that hunt the bearer, and sauron the original owner of the ring who wants to get it back. a must read for any fan of the hobbit or of the new movie that has come out."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read the Millenium edition of this book and i loved it. The book is simply addictive. After having finished with The Lord of the Rings, i had wished that there was no end to the story. It is full of mystery. I am now purchasing the collectors edition and am going to read the story over again. This is a must read. So buy your copy NOW."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'll try to keep this short. The Lord of the Rings is, without a doubt, the best work of fantasy I have ever read, as well as a masterful work of literature. I have been able to find very few fantasy authors (or any authors, for that matter) that even approach Tolkien's skill. Middle-earth is alive for me. I feel truly priviledged to be able to share in Tolkien's creation."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien never intended The Lord of the Rings to be a trilogy. It was split into three parts because the publisher felt it could be promoted better and that it would sell better as three separate books. This volume offers fans a chance to read it as the author originally intended, as one complete book. I have had mine for over 20 years and it is holding up very well. The paper is fine quality and it has a sewn binding. It's not easy to carry, though, so I like to keep a paperback set around for portability."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read the Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring recently they are great books and I am going to read the other two Lord of the Rings books a.s.a.p!! I just saw the movie last night, and it is amazing. The special effects are great. I can't wait to see what awaits Frodo & Sam on their journey to Mordoor!(I'm sorry if my spelling is bad)These books rock, and if you haven't read them you should!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Time will tell if Harry Potter can claim to be a literary classic and a fantasy masterwork. Frodo Baggins, however, has lead the way.As small as hobbits may be, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ranks supremely as being some of the finest, well-written fiction to be produced in the English language. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; you'll get it all (and save a few bucks in the process!).Tolkien's delicious use of written diction and depth of storyline is why his famous hobbit enjoys the lengthy stay in libraries that he has. Compare it to other great trilogies and tales, from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to CS Lewis' &quot;Narnia&quot; trilogy.A lot of poorly written novels litter our library shelves, but shining is &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; Tolkien used his vast understanding of archetypes, ancient storytelling, and the body of fiction. He took years to write these tales, laboring over ever tiny phrase... as opposed to cranking them out within months. He didn't write for the marketplace, but the marketplace loves him.I fully recommend &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It is a great deal for some great books by a great writer.Thinking about Bilbo now... some eggs and bacon would taste good just about now (read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and you'll know the reference).Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not sure what I'm going to add by writing this review. This story is one of the classics that everybody should read. Apart from that, its the greatest story ever written in the fantasy genre. If Tolkien wasn't the one who invented this genre then he is quite easily the most influential writer in it. Period.The story is a continuation from the Hobbit. Bilbo is still involved but the main character now is Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's relative. Frodo is joined by several friends (including Gandalf) and sets off on a journey that is just slightly more important than Bilbo's saving the Dwarves ancestrol home: Frodo must save the world.Being a long story you may find yourself constantly looking back in the book to remember place names and characters. Its worth it, however, as you can tell that Tolkien inserted each tiny detail with a maximum amount of care and precision.It has been said that Tolkien's intent was to create a &quot;mythological&quot; history for England. I would say that he succeeded."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I cannot think of another fantasy novel that even approaches The Lord of the Rings for sheer story telling magic. It raises the genre to the heights of the best literature the world has to offer. Yes, it is long, but so worth the time and effort. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the series that started it all! Harry Potter? Star Wars? They ALL have their roots in the LOTR. Tolkien's masterpiece is as fresh today as it was almost 50 years ago. The story of hobbits, orcs, elves, and a Ring is a perfect novel for teen-agers, as well as adults. It is a perfect &quot;transition&quot; book for young adults to test the waters of more adult fare. Its themes of absolute power, good vs. evil, and the little guy getting the glory, and I literally do mean &quot;little&quot;, is a perfect book for all ages. Enjot the series and enjoy the upcoming films."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is about a young hobbit named Frodo, who posseses the One Ring. This ring,if fallen into the hand of Sauron(The Dark Lord,who is the most evil and powerful wizard alive)),can wreck the whole Middle Earth. Frodo,Merry,Pippin,Sam,Gandalf,Gimli and Aragorn make up the Fellowship Of The Ring. They set out to destroy the One Ring...forever. Many troubles stand in their way like Ringwraiths(Black Riders), a meterious Gollum and many more. For people who love fantay and mystery I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read many fantasy novels over the years. Every time that I think I've found someone that outshines Tolkien, I come back to find that the books have deepened in my absence.The first time I read the book, I enjoyed it because it was a rip-roaring good story. While it starts off a little slow (I'm not a fan of Tom Bombadil), it ratchets up and maintains a taunt pace for another six or seven hundred pages, not an unimpressive feat. Strangely, Tolkien manages this without following some of the cardinal rules of storytelling (for example, show, don't tell; and end the story right after the climax).The last time I read it, I had just read the Silmarillion, which is basically a history book of Tolkien's world. I was amazed at the level of detail in the Lord of the Rings. Characters often refer offhandedly to ancestors or events thousands of years in their past. In an earlier reading, I would just let the strange names wash over me, but this time I understood more of the references and why they would make the connection in the context of the story. While the deep joys and sorrows were felt the first time I read it, seeing that this was merely the latest in a series of battles that had been going on for thousands of years made the sorrows that much keener; and seeing these characters achieve feats of heroism that their ancestors had not managed made the joy that much sweeter.C.S. Lewis said that a book not worth reading twice was not worth reading once. This one is worth reading many times over.I have to agree with other reviewers that this particular edition, while gorgeous to look at, is rather difficult to read. It is too heavy to hold comfortably and the fold out map makes following the journey more difficult than it need be."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's amazing! One of my most exciting dreams has come true! I'm now the owner of an english edition of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". And a truly spectacular edition it is, I might add. The mere fact of reading such a story using such a book, makes one enjoy the expierence even more vividly. I do not exaggerate by saying that Master Tolkien would be proud of this work. This edition is a masterpiece in itself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The writing, of course, gets five stars.Until recently, my favorite story was represented on my bookshelf by yellowed paperbacks from the \`70s. I went shopping for a durable hardcover edition that would better reflect my love of Tolkien's masterwork.Having enjoyed Alan Lee's work as a designer on the Peter Jackson films and his exquisite illustrations in the book CASTLES, my choice did not take long to make. I was not disappointed.Lee's watercolors are detailed and evocative without imposing on the reader's own imagination. Although there are several portraits and battle scenes, characters are usually dwarfed by the vast landscapes and imaginative architecture that Lee excels at rendering. Tangled untamed forests, crumbling castles, and savage mountainscapes abound. These illustrations hold up to repeated viewings. The prevailing atmosphere may seem grim to those readers who may expect vibrant, children's book colors. The picket-fenced charm of Bag End, for example, is sombered by autumn leaves flying before dark gathering clouds.Although I highly recommend this edition, I cannot quite give it five stars. The print quality of the text pages is not up to that of the color inserts. The type is nice and large, but it is often broken up or flecked with fuzz, as if the plates are wearing out after multiple printings. Also the maps are weakly reproduced, unlike the large red-and-black foldouts I enjoy in my copies of THE SILMARILLION and UNFINISHED TALES. Indeed, these are quibbles, but for the hefty suggested retail price, I hoped for perfection!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Okay, so I've only read the last two books of the series and the Hobbit, so what? Ive seen the first two movies, and I bought the last one, but it hasn't come yet, and I'm reading the first one now, and so far it's terrific! I'm so glad someone has taken the time to put this book together, and I don't have it , but I saw one version of it at Books A Million (I think it was without Alan Lee's beautiful illustrations), and it looked terrific. It wasn't very large, and I would feel comfortble carrying it around, if I didn't feel it was so valuable. I think it's worth the price, because Alan's illustrations are very valuable to me. I espcially love his drawings of Rivendell, and I hope that one day I could possibly learn to draw like that instead of just cartoons. In case you didn't know, I only just turned 12, but I wanted to make the adult's review-thing because I don't want anybody to think I'm childish, because I value the Tolkien books as much as someone twice my age, and I think it's terrific to see such a great deal for all of the Lord of the Rings series combined, especially with such gorgeuos illustrations."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to admit that I hadn't read the books before the films were released. Even after seeing the first film, I wasn't a fan. However, my former roommate's enthusiasm for the series (he bought the DVD the day of its released) and a second viewing of The Fellowship of the Ring made me a convert. The books themselves astounded me with their depth, moral quality and sheer imagination. A book that I had previously associated with geeks who rolled die with more than 6 sides made me think about questions like the nature of good and evil and whatnot, all within the confines of a thrilling narrative. If you are wary about the book, check it out for yourself. Its a great read and adds even more depth to your viewing of the excellent films."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is definately the most well-known fantasy novel of all time. I belive it is also the best written. I have read fantasy novels by many authors, but I keep coming back to The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien seems to write in such a way as to include incredible amounts of detail and imagry, without making the book too long and drawn out. The plot is incredibly complex, but it is not boring, because there are continually things happening. The action never stays still, and yet it is not an action story.If you are a fan of Tolkien, this is the edition of The Lord of the Rings that you want. It has many beautiful colour illustrations that somehow were suprizingly close to how I visualized the scenery in the book. Having the story all in one large volume is very convenient, as I never just read ONE volume of The Lord of the Rings, I read it straight through from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King, and I dont like to carry 3 books with me at once."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a review of the Centennial Edition released around 1992 for the 100th anniversary of Tolkien's birth (Tolkien lived from 1892-1973). The Centennial Edition is devoid of the movie art, photo stills or any similar tie-ins to Peter Jackson's production of The Lord of the Rings movies. The book itself (or books, if you read it as a trilogy) is a classic and doing justice to it in a review of less than 1000 words is nearly impossible.This single-volume hardcover is commonly referred to as the Alan Lee Edition. Lee contributed about 50 watercolor plates for the book and they range from solid (the Old Forest, Treebeard) to spectacular (Dawn over Minas Tirith, Helm's Deep, Orthanc, The Black Gate) and, altogether, render Tolkien's world realistically while simultaneously (through the medium of watercolor with its muted colors, soft lines and blended images) maintaining the mystical qualities of Middle Earth. Lee is probably the most accomplished of the Tolkien artists (John Howe, Ted Nasmith, the Hildebrants, et al.) and his paintings of the Morannon (the gate of Mordor) and Helm's Deep are famous images of Tolkien's world. The print quality of this edition is a larger and clearer version of the text used in the mass-market paperback editions from the 1970s and 1980s. The maps are only ok, and that's the sole problem with the edition.Alan Lee (along with John Howe) was one of the artistic consultants for the Peter Jackson films. His artwork is therefore a basis for the \\"look\\" of many of the films key sequences. This edition provides a fine one-volume compilation of The Lord of the Rings, replete with the art gallery of the most influential of the Tolkien artists. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"True Tolkien fans won't be disappointed by this edition of the trilogy. This is not just another version of the Lord of the Rings; this is indeed a collector's edition. The entire trilogy is here, as well as the appendices. But what really makes this edition so special is the fine craftsmenship of the volume itself. It is beautifully bound in red leatherette in a matching box; the spine and cover are decorated with stamped gold and jewel-tone colors. It is printed on high quality paper and includes a wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth. Houghton Mifflin have done a splendid job on this truely deluxe edition of Tolkien's wonderful trilogy.In an added note, The Leatherette Collector's Edition of the Hobbit is a fine companion to the above volume. It is also boxed and is nearly the exact height as the trilogy. The two look stunning on any collector's bookshelf. The Hobbit also contains illustrations by the author, an unexpected bonus!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are SO many different LOTR editions out there. It's difficult to know which one to choose. If you want one that is going to hold up over time & through many readings, I say the Red Collector's edition it the best, by far. Forget all the paper backs. They may be cheaper, but by no means as durable. I was torn between the Illustrated edition & the Red Collector's edition. After looking at both of them, it was a no-brainer....the Red Leatherette wins by a Landslide!!!! The book is a nice size....not too big, yet not too little. The beautiful gold, blue & green foil embossing that embellishes the front cover, back cover, & spine add to the book's elegance. It looks like something that fell directly out of Middle-Earth and right onto your lap! The entire Trilogy along with the appendices and a fold out map are contained within the single volume. A sturdy protective slipcover is also included. A wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth is secured inside the back cover. I have read reviews that complained about the type-set. I think that it is fine. There might be a couple places where a letter, like the top of an \\"a\\" or \\"e\\" might be a little light. But this is few & far between & does not affect one's ability to read this treasured tome. The pages are a soft white...almost like an ecru...not quite yellow, but very easy on the eyes. There are no illustrations, but they are not at all necessary. The Illustrated Edition has illustrations, but just cannot measure up to the Red Book. It's pages are a bright glossy white...harder on the eyes to read.... and although Alan Lee did some wonderful artwork, it really doesn't add too much to the tale. I am happy I purchased the Red Leatherette Collector's Edition. In addition, I also purchased the Green Leatherette Collector's of the Hobbit.It is also simply beautiful! (Read the Hobbit first. The background in it will help make LOTR make a bit more sense to first time readers.) The two collector's editions make a great set that can be treasured & enjoyed for many years to come! You won't be sorry!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you're considering buying this volume, presumably you already know that Tolkein's Lord of the Rings is justly lauded as a classic of English literature and a mainstay -- very arguably THE mainstay -- of fantasy fiction. So, taking all that as read, here is a quick review of the Collector's Edition.Handsomely bound in red leather -- or a very good fake -- the book consolidates all three parts of the Lord of the Rings between two covers, along with the copious appendices at the end, and a map bound in to the back cover. The gold filigrees and designs on the book are intended to make the collection resemble the Red Book of Westmarch, at which it admirably succeeds: This FEELS like an interesting old book from a fantasy classic.The volume has the heft and weight you'd expect, and opens easily: Even mid-way through The Two Towers, with hundreds of pages on either side, the book can lie flat for easy reading.By necessity, the paper this volume is printed on is much thinner than that used for the Collector's Edition of the Hobbit, although I did not have any pages tear, despite sometimes unexpectedly hard use. Likewise, the spine did not hold up as well as that of The Hobbit, although since this book is far larger and heavier, some of that is to be expected.The map at the back is bound in a little too well for my tastes, and it is difficult to read without running the risk of damaging it. Reprinting the map elsewhere in the book in addition to simply binding it in would have been preferable.The slipcase is bound in the same red leather. While not likely to stop a bullet, it is well-built and should last for the lifetime of the book.In short, an excellent book that will be an heirloom you will be proud to pass on to future generations of readers. A must own for any serious collector of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I rammed this sucker into my Kindle and ran the whole thing out through text to speech while driving.

The text is very small, and the pages are a little thicker than bible paper."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"To be clear, this is a review of the black leather bound edition that came out in 2004. I will not go into the text itself as it has been well established as a masterpiece already.In a word, this edition is gorgeous. The pictures do not misrepresent the book, but it is really something to behold in person. The leather feels great. The gilding is flawless. The pages are smooth to the touch but not glossy like photo paper. The bounding has an appearance that almost reminds me of marble. Even the ribbon is as tasteful a maroon as can be imagined. I was concerned that the book would tend to want to close itself while laying on a table, but it does not. The little details are what make this edition the finest I have ever come across.Even if you already own an edition of LOTR, I highly recommend that you pick this one up. It is a joy to hold and read.A word of caution: The maps in the front and back of the book come folded extremely tightly and held closed by a weak adhesive. I got the impression that they will tear easily if you are not careful when opening them for the first time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a review of the red Houhgton Mifflin Collector's Edition, ISBN 0-395-19395-8, no longer in print. If you are looking for a review of the black 50th Anniversary Edition, or of the Lord of the Rings as a story, skip this review.The Good:1. This is a handsome book. Its boards are bound in red faux leather, as if it had been produced by a cost (or animal rights) conscious bookbinder after the style of the original at Undertowers. Stylized trees and stars, in gold and blue and green, adorn the covers and spine. It has some heft but feels good and lies open in the hand.2. The Shire map is drawn in a finer hand than that of my paperback reading copy. It seems less cluttered; everything is there, but the finer lines give the appearance of more space.3. The book is printed in red and black. The red adds very little to the text, but it looks great on the big fold-out map of Middle-earth.The Bad:1. The fold-out map of Middle-earth is the only map of Middle-earth. It is very large, and it is not convenient to unfold it while reading. I would have included the quadrant maps prepared for the paperback editions in addition to the fold-out, for easier reference while reading. There are more than enough blank endpapers.2. The large scale map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor is missing. They didn't print it on a fold-out and paste it into the book, they didn't reduce it and print it in the text block, it's just not there. This is an integral part of Return of the King, having been published in the first edition and (as far as I know) every edition thereafter. Its absence is very regrettable. The Houghton Mifflin catalog says this edition includes fold-out maps, plural; so do I have a defective book, or is the catalog text wrong?The Ugly:1. The font in the textual note and the table of contents is slender and crisp, but the font in the text is slightly larger and less crisp. It's still entirely readable, but some letters are broken or bleed.2. The page numbering begins anew with each \\"part.\\"3. Some of the pages were wrinkled.So, three stars. It is a good looking book, on the outside, but the inside falls short. I wouldn't recommend it as a reading copy due to the map issues, and I don't think it's really worth \\"collecting.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this (ISBN-10: 0618517650) edition from Amazon a few weeks ago and I must say it truly is the best edition I have seen on the market thus far! The paper is of a very good quality. The binding, however glued, is quite sturdy and the overall quality is truly excellent. The only thing I could criticise is the fold out maps glued to the front- and back cover over the book. These can be a nuisance when reading and also can be annoying to fold back into it's original state. This is a problem I encountered when I took a look at the maps. the one at the back of the book I could fold back quite easily but the map of Middle Earth on the front cover I could not. This resulted in a corner of the map to be creased which is truly annoying. But all in all it's a very nice purchase and I truly recommend it to anyone who wants to own an edition of The Lord of the Rings that will last him/her a lifetime(with the propper care of course).PS: to those who are still in doubt about the cover being leather or not I can assure you it is NOT leather bound. in the details it clearly states: 'faux-leather' which means (for those of you who are not familiar with the French language)FAKE LEATHER."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an excellent recording. It allows you to live within the story of the book while driving, working, cleaning, relaxing, etc. The narrator is superb~including singing all the songs and speaking the languages of the elves, dwarves, etc."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First, the 50th Anniversary Edition is the best edition of the LOTR I have ever owned. The cover is beautiful and feels nice, although a close inspection suggests it might not be genuine leather. The gold and copper lettering adds a classy touch, as does the gilding of the pages. The pages are nicely type-set and easy on the eyes (OK, after typesettingmy own bookI tend to notice typesetting, font choices, etc. first before anything else), and I was able to get the maps out without tearing them with one minor exception (see below).My three complaints are:1) The binding feels weak in some ways. Other reviewers have noticed this too. I would prefer a binding with a more substantial spine that is clear that it will last.2) The binding on close inspection appears to be printed as if to appear to be leather. It looks to me like an imitation leather. This makes me question whether the publisher is being generally up-front about the rest of the book. I cannot find information on the type of paper used (if it is acid-free etc). Consequently I can't tell if the book is built to last.3) The folded maps in the covers present a difficult design problem and one the publisher wasn't able to fully overcome. While I was able to undo the glue without too much difficulty (see below for how), on unfolding the back cover map, it ripped ever-so-slightly due to tension from the rest of the book and the binding. This small tear (hardly noticeable) is not glue-related.As for how to undo the glue without ripping the maps: here's what I did: Hold the map firmly down and gently lift the edge so that there is a slight tension on the glue (it doesn't take much). Maintain this tension for a few seconds and the glue will release. Don't try to force the glue to release. Just apply a little tension and wait.All in all a very nice edition. I just wish it was more honestly marketed and/or more ruggedly designed. I subtracted a star for those engineering and marketing issues."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I will begin by saying that I have had no quality control issues like many of the 1-star reviewers. I am not saying they are lying, but mine was fully in tact. The format of this was incredibly well done, the gilding is quite amazing and I had no problem cleaning the adhesiveness of the pages. After a few flip throughs the pages are all separated without any negative effects on the edges. My only complaint is that the maps are included rather oddly, being folded up in the front and back of the book. I would have preferred them to have been simply page printed, as well as being included as separate pieces to perhaps be framed. :DOther than that I cannot see any problems with it, the corners are well bent and clean, and the bonus pages are amazing. The bonus pages are those that include actual artifacts that Tolkien created, such as pages from the Book of Mazarbul, partially burnt and cut and covered in Dwarvish writing. It really added a more immerse feel to the story, which is already incredibly engrossing. I very much suggest that you get this, it is printed exactly how I imagine Tolkien wanted it to be, all as one story, divided into the three volumes, each containing two books.Overall I cannot complain about this, the maps were a tiny nuisance, but if you're getting an edition this expensive you probably are enough of a nerd to know exactly what the maps look like by heart, like me xDIf you love The Lord of the Rings, buy this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I prefer reading these books with my normal paper copy, but having an electronic edition to read when on the go is a big convenience!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can not recommend the paperback version of the book.

I bought the Kindle version for an excellent price and have been reading away hours. The novel itself is a classic fantasy, a must read for all book lovers for its quintessential place amongst the genre. The story is, while now tired in the face of an ever-growing bulk fantasy output, still held high by the cachet of its deep lore and consistency. The interesting tale of the various editorial and publishing history is discussed in the foreword. My one regret with the otherwise very readable and superb Kindle version is either the lack of or my inability to access any of the Middle Earth maps that are provided in the text version. Geographically important details in the book (a book very focussed on details!) can't be fully appreciated without access to these maps more readily.

Combined with the glossy paper, it would be a nightmare to read. I am so disappointed with this set. Was looking forward to another read through but it sure will not be with this set - do not want the eyestrain!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"How do you celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book that started the love affair? The book most likely single &#34;handedly&#34; giving us Dungeons and Dragons?You give it a release fit for a returned king!According to the preface, many, many instances of misspellings (according to what Tolkien had intended, not necessarily actual misspellings), grammatical changes (again, Tolkien didn't always use things in a grammatically correct fashion, which is what his original intent was) and general restoration work took place to make this THE definitive edition of the book.And they did an amazing job of it. This will be the version of the book by which all future editions will, and should be, judged.If you're looking for a reader edition, one that you can carry around and not worry about damaging, then this isn't for you. You can get much less expensive editions. If you are looking for an edition with the most &#34;correct&#34; text, is presented as a piece of art and looks amazing on your shelf, this one is for you.The page edges are golden lined. All of the runes, and various languages, are beautifully represented in text. You also receive two high quality, frame worthy, maps. And to make it easier to remember where you are, a ribbon book mark embedded in the spine. You also receive a hard slip cover with Tolkien original artwork to store this on your shelf.If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, or any of Tolkien's work, this edition is positively the most beautiful presentation to date, and worthy of purchase.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"was delivered quickly and was of good quality.

Great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I had seen the movies so I figured it was time to read the book. I loved the movies and the books. I can see why the movies left out some parts, not because they are not good, the movies would have been five hours a piece if they had included everything."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"After seeing the Hobbit, I had to re-read all 4 volumes from start to finish.

Nice perk for the kindle version.Other than that, best way to get the whole LotR trilogy for cheap."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I own both radio dramatizations (Minds Eye and BBC). On the whole I prefer the Minds Eye one. Both have their pros and cons, but as a fan of the book this one was more accurate to the story and conveyed a better sense of emotion than that of the BBC story. The BBC has a way better sound affects, overall better production value, and a more evened out (and higher priced) cast. Still, though, overall the Minds Eye produced better voices for Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, and Faramir than the BBC production did, and Frodo was well done also (just not as good as Ian Holm). However, the top factor for me was that the Minds Eye is just far more accurate to the book itself, for my money, than the BBC version. Others opinions obviously very. Know what you're looking for in whichever set you buy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an excellent collector's item and is of exquisite beauty. However it has no illustrations except those of maps (it also has a fold out map in the back which is good) so those seeking a LOTR edition with illustrations other then maps I would highly recommend getting the hardcover edition that is illustrated by Alan Lee (of course famed for his LOTR art) which will cost you about $52 give or take. Another quarel I have with this book is that it does not have a integrated bookmarker, the book is VERY complete in appendices also such as these: Annals of King and Rulers, Tale of Years, Family Trees, Calendars, Pronunciation of Words and Names and Index of songs, persons, beast, places and such (you get the point). My only recommendation is this, only buy this book if you are an avid LOTR fan / book collector (like myself on both parts). Also on a further note if you seek more exceptional maps you would have to buy the books that cover just the maps of middle earth such as these three: The Atlas of Middle-Earth (Revised Edition), The Maps of Tolkien's Middle-Earth and Maps of Middle Earth: The Lord of the Rings Map Set, also try and pick up The Hobbit (Leatherette Collector's Edition) if you are interested in collector's items as much as me."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's a great book and it's a great narration. The voice of Rob Inglis is warm and lively. Sometimes it remembers me of a voice reading a fairy tale to children. You can get lost in it, just close your eyes and put your headphones on.It's so easy to know who's speaking, because every voice differs from the others and that's what makes it so lovely. You can see Gandalf when you hear him speaking.Sometimes you may seem a bit strange to the other passengers in the train, when you sit there smiling, but nobody knows why you are smiling. But what does it matter?You can hear that Rob Inglis loves what he's reading. It must have been a pleasure to read it and it's a pleasure to listen to it. 52 hours is much to hear but I think I will start again immediately the day I will be through."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is a great book for the price and some reviewers may be right about the print quality being poor but my copy is very good. The only thing being is that it's not leather but rather pleather bound (plastic leather), which explains the affordable price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I would like to say a few words about this book (the collector's edition) vs. the illustrated version. It seems that a lot of people have commented about the broken type that is in this version. Sure, there is an occasional letter that is not perfectly formed or maybe it has a small break in it. However, I do not believe that it takes anything away from the reading experience. In fact, I think that the photo offset printing gives the book an aged look that goes very well with the leather binding and the light yellow pages. Everything about this book is pleasant to the eye - the binding, the print and the paper. One should also note that the hardback film cover books are also photo offset and they also exhibit a few print quality defects.If you are into perfect &quot;laserjet-like&quot; type then sure, this is not your baby -- you might want to consider the illustrated version. If pictures are a must then again you need the illustrated version. However, I might comment that while the pictures in the illustrated version are very nice they do nothing for me as far as enhancing my reading experience.The collector's edition is my favorite format."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Being concise when describing a work of this magnitude is difficult, to say the least. But Professor Tolkien's work, many years in the making, deserves both high praise and rapt attention.To The Lord of the Rings, his life's opus, belongs a place of great honor amid all in the Fantasy genre of any medium. Often imitated by works lending Fantasy it's rather sullied reputation, The Lord of the Rings has never been duplicated. Indeed, this is the literary work against which all others of that genre are measured.It is powerful on so many levels. The depth of emotion which the reader shares with its characters is unique among even the greatest novels ever written. It's backstory spans thousands of years, but with such accuracy and detail that the reader perceives history rather than fantasy. And it is interesting! Despite the Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits central to the story itself, the reader is convinced of embarking on a worthwhile quest with them, and with terrors and delights of his own.But it is more than simple entertainment. It is ennobling to read of such lofty depth and serious virtue, all the while appreciating life's simple pleasures and everyday indignities. These things are woven into a tale of the agelong opposition of good struggling against all odds to fight evils both great and subtle. The Lord of the Rings is absolutely a must for those who appreciate being both entertained and ennobled by something as simple and inexpensive as a book; but here is a tome which has sold 50 million copies in over 25 languages worldwide. It delves into and explores social issues as far-reaching now as when it was written decades ago. Thus, it is partly because of Tolkien's effort, in the hearts of those who appreciate it, that the fires of good in each of us have not gone out. Read on!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Leather is \\"leather-look\\" paper on both box and book cover. Page edge gilding is a tacky bright gold. As others have said, because of improperly placed glue, unfolding the maps guarantees ripping the maps (you might have better results if you bend the maps so that you remove the glue from inside out). At any rate...I now have a brand new $50 book with scotch tape on the damaged parts of the maps. Paper is very slick & somewhat shine-y and there is zero info as to whether it is acid-free. I cannot recommend this edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have never read any LOTR books before this one,so i can consider myself to be more objective in this manner than the TRUE fans are(i am not a big reader of fantasy books.This is my first 1000 page book too :) ).But ... :I was really impressed how this book drived me to read on and on.The part i loved in an instant is when the journey of Frodo begins and how Tolkien describes the scenes (going from Shire out to his new home for example).The thing that the author describes in detail what's up in the Shire is also enjoyable.Its quite creepy when he goes in detail when they were in some dark remote place in some forest... I think this is a FEATURE,since it makes me feel i am with them - even when they were cousy in their hobbit holes.You know,as if you were an observer of some sort... a listener or something like that.When someone said in the reviews,that the book had some scary scenes - its totaly true!As i said, Im not a big reader,so this is my humble opinion and not a real review.Quality:The paper is verry smooth and has some saturated white colour (a bit yellowish ,like an old book or something wich is verry nice to see - as if this is an old journal or an antique book.The paper doesnt shine back if a strong source of light is directly lit.The page's texture is smooth and the fonts are verry well read.A single page has a bit more text than a normal book has,wich is verry esteticaly nice,in my opinion).Its true,that the 2 maps can get torn if you're not carefull,but apart from that ,its a nice book that has plenty of additional content (like appendix with family tree of the main characters, elven language explained, rune writings explained,the journal of events and a bit of history/aftermath aswell).I really liked the golden gilded edges of book's pages (this helps you turn the pages a bit - in my case,a lot).I hope you enjoy this book not only by its beauty,but by its content aswell (and im positive you will be satisfied in both cases)(edited)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},A=["disabled"],E={key:0},M={key:1};function H(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",L,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,A)):b("",!0)])}const q=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-8381943c"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/43.md","filePath":"quotesmag/43.md"}'),O={name:"quotesmag/43.md"},P=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
