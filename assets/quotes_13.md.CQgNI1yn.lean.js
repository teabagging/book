It is about a thirteen-year-old boy named Brian Robeson. He was in a plane crash Brian soon found himself on a survival mission in the Canadian wilderness. He had just gone though a divorce of his parents and was very unhappy and upset. His dad moved to Canada for a new job. About half way through the trip the pilot died from a heart attack and died which left Brian alone to fly and land the plane.His first major achievement was making fire and it was his most important. Brian also figures out how to catch food and cook it...."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In the book Hatchet, Brian, the main character gets on a plane after he finds out the big secret about his mom during the school year and the beginning of the summer to go and vistit his dad. On the way to Canada where his dad lives his pilot teaches him how to fly. He ends up having to know how to do this cause something happens to the pilot and he has to fly the plain. He then lands in the middle of no where and has to live on his own. He learns how to find food and live. This is a good book until the end because it is very descriptive. I dont like the end because it is way to short and it didnt explain enough."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"As you open the cover of this book you get enthralled to the point where you cannot stop reading. The story starts out slow. After reading a chapter you may want to stop. It may seem like the story is going nowhere and isn't very interesting. You shouldn't stop reading. By the second or third chapter you will be totally enthralled, and be glad that you didn't stop reading.This story begins as Brian is flying over the Canadian wilderness on his way to see his father. When the single engine Cessna suddenly crashes, it leaves him stranded in the forest. Brian has to adapt to his new conditions. He is forced to learn how to survive with little supplies and experience. All Brian has are the cloths on his back, a hatchet his mother gave him, and any supplies he could recover from the wrecked plane.Brian Robeson is the main, and almost only, character in this book. He is thirteen years old. Brian is dealing with his parent's break-up. He is the kind of person who keeps things inside, thinking about their divorce all the time.The author of Hatchet, Gary Paulsen, uses many descriptive words in his writing. When reading his book you can imagine yourself in the book seeing and talking to the characters. By describing every little intricate detail one feels like they are actually in the story. As you read more of the book the deeper you sink into the heart-stopping suspense. The only criticism I would give to this story would be that there wasn't always action going on. It was a little repetitive at times, when the author was talking about every day life. Overall this book was great and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet was a reaaly great book. When readding this book I became a book worm. It was really weird because I hate reading books. This book really made me appreciate reading a little bit more. This book also made me read the sequels, Brians Winter and Down River. they were just as good as Hatchet. There is a secrete, read all three books and you will be satisfied.The author, Gary Paulson, did a great job detailing what Brian (the main character) was thinking and what he did to survive the Canadian wilderness. He did a great job on all three books and having one book really lead to another.As flying over the canaidian wilderness Brian looks down and all he sees are trees. He begins to think of his father and his mother. His parents were divorced and he was flying to see his father in canada. The pilot of this little bushle plan looked over and he had a heart attack. Brian took control of the plan and flew it into a lake. He survives but the real survival is stearing him right in his face- the canadian wilderness. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure books and is not affraid of reading this book all night long."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I first read the book &quot;The Hatchet&quot;, I thought it was a great story, so much that I read it twice. This is not a normal occurrence; in fact, I hate to read, but the story of Brian and how he survived was such a great story. To this day it is still one of my favorite books.I first read the book in fourth grade, which was about eight or nine years ago, and it still sticks with me today as one of my favorite books. Yes, it is meant mainly for a younger audience, probably a great book for someone in junior high, but it can be a fun book to be read by all that like a good story of adventure.The reason that I think this was such a good book was probably because I'm a nature freak. I love being in the wilderness and I think every little boy in America at one time imagined being lost in the forest and surviving on nothing but their wits. I heard some other people comment on how they think this is an overdone story, and someone actually compared to the movie Cast Away. Both stories have similar plots, but what makes this story different is that Brian, the protagonist of the story, is no more than thirteen years old, and his plane crashes into the wilderness. The poor boy has to endure the punishment his body took from the plane crash, nurse himself back to health, and then survive with nothing more than a hatchet. I thought it was a great story, and most people that I know who read it all had great things to say about it.Also, Gary Paulsen has written quite a few books with the same kind of wilderness setting, so if you liked The Hatchet then you will like his other books too. He also wrote a sequel, which wasn't quite as good, but if you liked &quot;The Hatchet&quot;, then it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read this book twice. Once in middle school and again in high school. Still I believe this is my favorite book of all time. Hatchet is an epic battle between man and nature. Brian Robeson is on his way to Canada in a bush plane to see his father. The plane goes down and he's stranded. He has to rely on his instincts and his hatchet to survive. He had some run ins with a few animals while struggling with hunger and coldness. I would recomend this book to readers of any and all ages. It is a great piece of work."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy named Brian Roebson who is about to see his father and he has to board a plane to get there. But, the pilot gets a heart attack and Brian is left to fly the plane solo but doesn't know how. The plane crashes in the wilderness in Canada in a L shaped lake and he is stranded in the wilderness without food and he doesn't know anything about surviving. The pilot is dead and there is nobody he can speak to get him out of there. also winter is coming up soon and has to hurry and get out of there or else he may freeze to death.This book is beautifully made and Gary Paulsen really made readers feel what it is like to be all alone in the wilderness surviving. I definetly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think Hatchet is a great book because Brian is alone and all he has is his Hatchet.

I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Exciting-very! I'm eight years old. My camp counselor read it to me.

I challenge you to read all his books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think Hatchet was very good and full of action.My favorite part was when Brian got caught in a tornado or when he reilized the fish he was eating were eating pieces of the dead pilots head.I think Gary Paulsen is a great writer.I think I would give it five stars.The plot is great and I think you would like it to!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"What I like about the the Hatchet is how Brain gets lost in the woods all by himself. Why? Brain survived all alone. With the Hatchet he builds a fire and it helps him get some food."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Hatchet is an excellent book to begin the school-year. Reluctant readers are easily drawn into this novel and basic literary terms can be easily explained."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"(From my daughter) - I'm 11 and in 6th grade and we read this book for class. I loved the book, but it was a bit gruesome in parts. It's a great story about overcoming obstacles and surviving despite the odds. My favorite part of the book was learning to build a fire without any matches! This book teaches you a lot about what it would be like to survive a plane crash and be left all alone to fend for yourself out in the elements. All you're left with are your own thoughts and you have to process things that happened in your life because you don't have anyone else to talk to. You have to learn to be resourceful and figure out how to survive, even when you don't want to."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was a very inspiring story as Brian never allowed himself to give up. Great story to read to kids as well as they can have a better understanding of how some people can live with the bare minimum."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I liked this book because it was an adventure book and a ether girl or boy book.

He was riding in a bush plane with a pilot. Brian could not stop thinking about his mom and dad's divorce, so the pilot let him fly the plane. The pilot taught Brian all about the plane controllers and how to fly the plane. A few minutes later the pilot had a tragedy. I think this story is really good because it has a lot of detail of all the things what Brian ate, how he fought through all those days, and how he built a shelter. I felt so sad when he was stranded all alone in the Canadian wilderness, but I liked this book because it was so exciting, i would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Yes, I would highly recommend the book, Hatchet, to everyone. I enjoyed reading the story. Brian was in a plane to go see his dad in Canada when the pilot had a heart attack and died, leaving him alone in the plane, in the air.

Brian is alone with few survival skills and tons of unknown animals. While alone in the wilderness, Brian thinks mostly of his parents being divorced. Brian struggles to survive, since he is more of a city boy who knows just about what he reads in books. Brian learns how to do things in the wilderness. He learns how to see things diiferently but one thing holds him back from everything; the secret! The secret is the one reason why Brians parents split up. Brian wants to tell his father but he just can't. I think that if you like books with a bit of mystery and exitement this is the best book.

The characters mentioned in the story are; Brian, Brian's mom, Brian's dad, and the pilot. The setting of the story is in the Cessna bush plane and the Canadian wilderness. My favorite part of this story was when Brian got sprayed in the face by a skunk. This book is a very great book. It has many literary genres such as adventure, fiction, and drama. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and excitement."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a book that is about a 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson who is left in the woods with nothing but his hatchet that his mother gave him and the knowledge that he has earned. Brian was on his way to his fathers house when something happens, the pilot dies, and the plane crashes into an L shaped lake in the Canadian wilderness. The whole book is about decisions, questions, and other things that Brian stumbles over during his adventure in the wilderness. The one thing that bothers him the most in this book is &quot;The Secret&quot;. The only thing I didn't like in this book is that they didn't share the mother and fathers perspective. Other thatn that, I gave the book an amazing 4 stars! I encourage everyone to read this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a thirteen-year-old boy whose parents have separated.

Brian is forced to land the plane on a lake and swim safely to shore. The rest of the book deals with Brian's survival in the wilderness. Quite simply this is the best book I have ever read! It was a book that hooked me from the first pages. The story is written with such detail that I could see each step Brian took. I felt like I was an invisible observer in the woods. Gary Paulson has written one great book that everybody should read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"An exciting adventure story. Our fifth grade class read this book as we listened to the audio tape of it. After we read the book we watched the movie of it and discussed the differences between the book and the movie. The book gave better details concerning Brian's feelings, the things he did to survive, and the thoughts he had as he learned he could take care of himself. This is the type of experience which holds your interest and makes you want to read it all at once. Some of the students enjoyed the movie because we could see the scenery and realistically understand where he was and how it looked where he was. This is such a good story that we want to read another of Gary Paulson's books. GREAT STORY!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a story about a boy named Brian Robinson.

When the plane crashed I felt so sorry for Brian. I could have never survived the way he did. He had nothing but a hatchet, which he used to make weapons and to protect himself.

This is truly an excellent story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a plane that crashed, because the pilot had a heart attack. The one surviver, Brian, who was going to see his father, was still alive. He has to use his one tool, which his mother gave him before he left, a hatchet. To survive in the jungle. While in the jungle he has all kinds of adventures."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book, &quot;The Hatchet,&quot; by Gary Paulsen was a great book but just barely missed getting five stars. The reason I gave it four stars was because it wasn't as good as other books I read. It as often confusing and I did not no where the character was at or what was going on. Other than that it was a great book. The book was very exciting and some times he would be doing very well with the conflict he was in then another conflict would come and mess every thing up like a tornado or getting attacked by a mouse. The Hathcet was a great book for those who do or don't like adventure. I recomend this book to anybody young or old. This book makes you look at things differently, and I hope everybody reads it.THE END!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I became interested in reading Hatchet from friends that told me about it. They said it was a great book to read, so I did. The book has really only one character in it . His name is Brian Robeson. He had just gone though a divore of his parents and was very unhappy and upset. His dad moved to Canada. He was flying in a small plane. About half way thogh the trip the pilot died from a heart attack and died which left Brian alone to fly and land the plane. It all goes down hill after that. Brian's first few days he gets eaten by bugs and also eats piosonous berries. After wards Brian start to figure out how to survive in the wild. His first major achievement was making fire and it was his most important. Brian also figures out how to catch food and cook it. Then Brian thinks his good luck had ran out when a tornado hit and wrecked most of his stuff. The day after it hit he notices that the tail end of the plane was sticking out of the water and he remembered there was a survival pack in there with an emergency transmitter. Brian swims out to the plane and cuts a hole in it and finds the pack. He then turns the transmitter on and is saved within a few hours. The conflict of this book would be man vs nature because Brian had to deal with nature to survive. Man vs himself is the other conflict and I think it is that because Brian had to use his knowledge and talents to survive. Over all I thought this was an excellent book and I recommend this book to any one that wants to read it. If you like exciting, adventeruos, hard to put down books then read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a fine work by Gary Paulsen.

My 6yo has started reading heavy books and kept stealing my version of this, so I bought him his own. I didnt realize this one was a special edition, much bigger print, with pics, but same exact story. This is an amazing novel, I would suggest it for any age."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have loved this book for many, many years. I actually read this one when it first came out and remember not being able to put it down. When I was looking for books to share with my own children - especially my son - I rediscovered this gem. Both of my children enjoyed the story and were entranced at the idea of &#34;living off of the land&#34;. They were suitably impressed with the character's ingenuity, determination and grit. I think the book is suitable for most age groups. There are some scary parts in it to be sure but nothing that most kids cannot handle. My youngest, 5, did not get scared at all, so I judge my opinion based upon her reaction. The book is not long and it is exciting and well written. This is the first book of a series of Brian books. I had no idea of that until I bought this one again several months ago. If you or your children enjoyed this one, I recommend trying out Paulsen's Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod book. It is a bit coarse and I absolutely glossed over some of the language and events in the book for my own kids. I suggest pre reading it before giving it or reading it to children under 13. It is a hilarious book though and full of epic-ness."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet on CD. Great reading. Great book! My children loved it.

Brian, a 14 year old boy survives the crash. Then he has to survive in the wild. Luckily he has the hatchet his mother had given him, but that's about all he has.

He sees the world in an entirely different way. He is forever changed. The things he took for granted when in civilization are missed at first, but he comes to realize most of those things are not central to survival. When he can finally access the survival kit from the plane he finds a gun, but he sets it aside, he wants to consider how a gun would make his wilderness experience different. He isn't sure he wants a gun. He is completely satisfied with what he accomplished.My 8 year old loved this story. It stimulated him to think about what he would do under those conditions. I've always enjoyed survival stories. This one is particularly well done as we are in Brian's head and hear what he's thinking, how he motivates himself to solve the problems he is facing. Brian has many setbacks but he thinks out the problems and comes up with a plan. I've already ordered the sequel, River."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"son loves this book.

I am an eighth grader at a school in Italy. I have read the book Hatchet, and I thought it was great! I liked the authors use of imagination. Gary Paulsen is a very creative writer. I enjoyed this book because it was very down to earth. I thought it was excellent concerning how the author went down to pre-teens and adolescent age. Many kids can relate to this book because many have parents that are divorced and can relate to Brian's pain. I really don't have a favorite character because Brian is practically the only character in the book. I admire Brian's actions and how he took care of things. I also admire his confidence and patience. Brian is one of the most courageous character's I have ever read about. I thought the book was great and all, but it wasn't perfect. There were some qualities in the book &quot;Hatchet,&quot; that I disliked. I disliked how the author described the scenery too much. I mean, sure, Mr. Paulsen can describe the scenery, but not all that much. It got kind of boring after awhile. I also didn't enjoy how Gary Paulsen said words over and over again. I think it is quite ridiculous how the author kept on bringing up the so-called &quot;Secret,&quot; out of the blue. For example, he'd be telling how Brian was scared to fly in the plane, then all of the sudden he would bring &quot;The Divorce,&quot; up or &quot;The Secret.&quot; He did it throughout the book. But I didn't mind, after all, Gary Paulsen is human. The book &quot;Hatchet,&quot;is a great book that should be read by all. I thought it was fun-filled and exciting. I encourage pre-teens and adolescents to read this book. I could not put this book down.

And it is these seventh grade students, struggling with reading, who enjoyed a feeling of competence as they read about Brian, the boy from the city, who must learn many of the facts which they find second nature. Because the chapters are untitled, the novel allows for discussions of main ideas and application of vivid imaginations to come up with illustrations and titles. It can also be a springboard for discussions about divorce and fidelity and the effects of family secrets."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It is one the greatest book Gary Paulsen has ever writen.It is a good book i would recomend this book to people who like survival books.I really like this book i always read this book when i am not doing anything."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought the Hatchet, was a good book,but at first in the begining it wasn't all that interesting but when I got more into the book it got to be more interesting and fascinating.

One of the major reasons I enjoyed this book is because it's about a boy my age. The plane brine was riding on had an engine failure and crashed in to a lake. Brine was the only survivor. Another reason I found the book to be so wonderful is because It's by my favorite author, Gary Palson. Most of his books are a true story about himself. Of course, my favorite reason for loving this book was wonderful to read. My favorite part of the book was how brine struck his hatchet against the wall of the cave, and made a fire from the fling sparks.

A tornado,bugs, wild animals and the need for food are problems Brian hadto cope with. The hatchet his mother gave him is obviouslyhis most important tool, because without it he couldn'thave made fire, his bow, spear and arrows, or the raft. The hatchet made all the difference. I will probably read it again and I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you've ever wondered what it would be like to live in the woods with nothing but yourself to rely on."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"One of my best books I have read in the past year has to be Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It is a marvelous book about a boy who is surviving in the wild. One of the major reason I enjoyed this book was Brian .He was a twelve year old kid surviving on his own . Another reason I found the book to be so wonderful is they have so much expression in their character .Of course my favorite reason for loving this book is that it was man vs. nature .As you can see Hatchet By Gary Paulsen was truly my favorite book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I want to tell you about Hatchet, my favorite book by Gary Paulsen, and why I like it. The first thing I like about it is its realism. A man having a heart attack complains about himself having chest pains. Also, whenever the main character, Brian, is fishing, he tells the secret about fishing with a spear; aim higher than it looks. The next thing I like about Hatchet is the detail. It explains how Brian feels every step of the way in the forest. The last thing I like about Hatchet is the plot. A thirteen-year-old boy stranded in a Canadian forest by a lake in the shape of an L. He has to fight to survive while he looses hope in rescue each day. He has to eat, drink, make a fire, build a shelter, and more. So, these are the reasons I like Hatchet. If you haven't read it, then go pick it up. If you have, then read it again."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book did not impress me as much as i thought it would. The story line is hard to believe, but the way Paulson writes in this book is amazing! Brian R, age 13, gets trapped in the woods after his plane crashes. Now, it just so figures that his mother gives him a hatchet, which he uses to survive. When the plane crashes, it slams into the water, which would of instantly killed Brian. But he ends up surviving in the woods for about 50 days and is finally found, even though he is in the middle of the wilderness. The events that happened were exciting, but the story line was not impressing. 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book has a pretty good story, but there were too many flashbacks and repitions in this book.

If you love survival stories you would love this because he is stranded in the middle of the Canadian forest with no supplies. He had no supplies because his plane sunk on his way to see his dad.A part I liked was when he feels like a survivor not a city boy. As a city boy he was use to get things he wanted. But as a survivor Brian wasn't so selfish and thought more about his actions.The part I didn't like was the gruesome details which there weren't a lot of them.

I didn't really like it because it was a long book and it went on and on. Also I don't really like survival stories. Another reason I don't like the book is because it's just like Brian does this, then he does this, then this happens and it goes on and on with boring events that do not want me to keep reading. I would rate this book a two on a scale from one to five. This is why I do not like the book Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"i read the first chapter of this because my daughter was doing a book report.

Brian is flying to visit his divorced dad in Canada in a small bush plane, when suddenly the pilot has a gruesome heart attack in the middle of flying. Brian is forced to live for weeks in an unforgiving environment with a small hatchet as his only tool that was given to him by his mother before taking off.I think that Hatchet is not very descriptive and lacks descriptive words, causing some parts of the book to be boring to read. Brian's survival in this environment seemed to be lucky in a way, and it seemed he didn't have many hard challenges, even though he is alone and is in the middle of nowhere.Hatchet is a well thought out story. Some parts are interesting and fun to read. I recommend this book for all ages. Even though the book lacks detail and description this makes Hatchet a fairly easy book to read and also makes the story go quickly."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I love Gary Paulsen books and I think that Hatchet is his best book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is the story of Brian Robeson. A young boy with a frustrating home life. But as Brian boards a small airplane taking him to see his father in Canada he realizes he is the only passenger. Quickly frustration becomes fear. However the flight seems to be going fine and the fear seems to wane. That is until the pilot dies of a heart attack and sends the tiny plane plummeting into the ground. Miraculously Brian survives the plane which landed in a small lake. But can he survive the hunger, the animals, the elements, and the loneliness he will find in the Canadian forest when he has nothing but a small hatchet to help him?This is a great story if you like adventure and nature tales. Though it starts out a little slow it picks up quickly and draws you in to it. The under story about Brian's parents and home life gets a little confusing at times but mostly it helps enrich the story. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this is the best book yet the beast thing that happens is he gets to fly a plane and then a distater happens read the book"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The following book reviews/recommendations are from two students in my literacy class:Review by Bergen Jones (7th grade)I'm going to tell you a few reasons why I recommend the book Hatchet to everyone. First, Hatchet is a good book if you like survival books. Second, the book Hatchet tells you how to survive and take care of yourself in the wilderness. Third, Hatchet shows you what it takes to live in the wilderness alone. Fourth, Hatchet is a good book to show you how to get food when you don't have any food. All in all, I recommend Hatchet to everyone because it's a good book and easy to read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is an outstanding adventure novel written about a 13 year old boy, who crash lands in the Canadian wilderness all by himself. He has no food, shelter or navigation out of the wilderness. The only thing he has is the hatchet his mother had given him before he left. Now Brian must face the brutal forest and survive on his own, until his help is on the way.I believe Hatchet is one of the most inspiring books i have ever read. How could a 13 year old boy survive the harsh winters, dangerous animals and lack of food all by himself. On page 125 Brian thinks to himself as he catches his first fish, \\"He would not forget his first hit. Not ever. A round shaped fish with golden sides, sides as gold as the sun.\\" This was an important part in the novel because, this gave him the hope and desire he needed to survive. As the story progresses Brian faces many difficult challanges, and learns a valuable lesson that he would never forget. Never give up hope just because you don't have the modern tools we use today. Mother nature is the biggest tool there is. So don't pass up the chance to read this wonderful novel, and also dont forget to read Brians Winter and The River also written by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"By Aaron-Hatchet is about a boy named Brian is a boy who has to survive in the middle of the Canadian forest due to a plane crash, with nothing but a Hatchet. Through this story you will learn about the secret. Read the book to learn what if Brian gets rescued and to see what the secret is!The Author: This author of hatchet is not my favorite author, but I like how all of his writing almost rhymes.The Book: This is a good book although not my favorite. The writing in Hatchet is good and clear, but the story is kind of plain. There's action in the beginning, and action in the end, but not much in the middle. Not much happens, and it just goes on and on.My favorite part of the book is the beginning when the secret is introduced, but the author never makes you want to know what the secret is.I would probably rate this book 2 or 2.5 stars out of 5. It might be worth reading if you like survival books.By Ethan-Hatchet is a story about a boy named Brian who is stuck in the east Canadian woods after his pilot suffers a massive heart attack and dies, crashing the plane in a lake, in the middle of the woods.My favorite character was Brian because he is the only person that is really described in the story. The main character Brian runs into lots of problems during the story, but eventually he gets out.I couldn't really relate to Brian because I've never been stuck in the wilderness. But I have eaten berries that made me sick.By Justin Ch.-Hatchet is about a boy named Brian. Brian is 13 years old and his parents are divorced. Now he is on a airplane to visit his father but then the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes but Brian survives the crash. Now he is trapped in the Canadian forest he has to survive, make a fire, hunt for food, and make a shelter. In this book I didn't like it because it always have flashbacks and it's not on topic.

Unfortunately that was reality for Brian, in the book; Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It all starts when a single engine plane on its way to Brians dads house crashes in the widerness of Alaska, on an island. The piolt doesn't survive and brian is all by himself. Brian lives with great hunger and many other terrible conditions by himself. This novel kept me on my toes and looking forward to what was ahead! There are plenty suprises and interesting things that happen to Brian. I think Hatchet is directed towards ages ten and up. Read this book you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Is it no surprise that Paulsen has sold millions of books? I have read several Paulsen books and would say this is his best work. Yes, the follow ups of Brian's Winter and Brian's Return were good, but this one set the bar pretty high. Reading it as an adult I was of a different mindset than say a 6th or 7th grader. I felt at times circumstances were a little unrealistic, especially for a kid in the CANADIAN WILDERNESS. It's not exactly the woods behind the house. However, giving it some latitude I decided to look deeper at the character not the setting, and there I found a young boy who epitomized survival. The great thing about fiction is the departure aspect, where we can shed the reality of our world and venture off into the woods. It's a delightful story that should resonate with young readers.As a writer I try not to be too critical of other writers because I know how hard it is to sit down and write, revise, edit, revise, edit, etc. There are avid readers who are not writers, and though they may criticize or praise, as is their prerogative, one should consider the difficulty in delivering a story that will stand the test of time. It's been 20 years now since the release of Hatchet and it still sells. I believe Paulsen delivered on this one. Well done Gary, well done.Scott A.

Hatchet is about a boy named Brian. He goes to his dad&iexcl;s house on a private plane and some how he doesn&iexcl;t arrive. Are you anxious yet? Come read some more.I think that the theme of Hatchet is survival. Brian has an incredible journey for hunting. He shoots an enormous black bear that was incredible. He also shoots a lot more little animals such as deer, mice, and rabbits. The mosquitoes were coming, so Brian has to build a shelter to live in so they don&iexcl;t bit him. Brian also made his first fire by himself. Brian got cut, so he used his old clothing to wrap it up and he made new clothes. All of the examples were apart of the theme.The theme is very important but, the characters made the story mostly what it is. Brian is the main character in this story. He goes to being a geek in the city to being a survivor in the wilderness for an enormous amount of time. He goes through major changes such as getting food, making clothes, and adapting to the theme. If Brian wasn&iexcl;t in the story, it wouldn&iexcl;t be Hatchet any more.Although the characters are important, the setting of the story sets the stories tone. Gary Paulsen described the setting wonderfully. I could mentally draw a picture in my head and it felt like I was sitting there when I was reading, now that has to be a good descriptor. I could picture the mountains, trees, and the beautiful sunset. That is as good as I can explain the setting, I hoped you like it so far.Through all of the struggles Brian went through, he gets rescued.

His narrative of a boy lost in the Canadian wilderness was an inspiring story that gives the reader the eagerness to turn the page as if Brian's destiny was our destiny. The descriptive tone left me with recollections of my own adolescence and summers spent roughing it in the mountainous regions of the Mogollon rim country in Arizona. Mr. Paulsen spells out every detail with amazing vivid colors that allows your imagination to place you right next to Brian as he battles the bear or captures the \\"fool birds\\".

There are no other passengers on the plane so he is the only one he can rely on when the pilot suddenly suffers from a heart attack and dies. Brian is forced to try to land the plane when it runs out of fuel. He crashes into a lake and manages to swim ashore with a hatchet as his only tool.Brian is forced to remember useful tips he's heard in school and seen on television to survive. He encounters wildlife such as bears, wolves, a porcupine, and a moose. Brian learns new survival skills from experience as he undergoes successes and failures. He develops a sense of his surroundings and is able to discern sounds and shapes in the brush.The plot is suspenseful and realistic. As Brian encounters obstacle after obstacle, the reader wonders how Brian will overcome each one. The situations and solutions are true to life. For example, when Brian is attacked by a moose, he learns that if he tries to get away quickly, the moose will attack again. However, if he slowly moves away, the moose seems uninterested and allows him to go. Also, Brian learns that if he aims just under the fish he is trying to hit in the water with his bow and arrow, he can hit it because the fish isn't where it appears to be. Brian remembers that water refracts or bends light.There aren't too many characters in the book as it is mainly about Brian's survival on his own. His parents and a friend of his are mentioned briefly. The reader can interpret from what is said about his friend, Terry, that he is a good friend. Brian remembers past good times with him and wishes he were with him. Brian's parents seem like they are good parents, however, one might interpret that they divorced because Brian's mother was seeing another man. So, the reader isn't too fond of the mother.Brian, of course, is the most interesting character. He grows and changes from a typical teenager into a young man with increased survival knowledge and experience. He becomes more thoughtful and observes what is happening around him more. Brian is a teenager far more mature than others his age. He's had to maneuver a plane and survive an ordeal that most people only read about!Hatchet is a wonderful book about survival and the growth of a character. It reminds you to appreciate life and not to take it for granted. The book is easy to read, but contains many repetitions.

Brian is in the copilot's seat. When the pilot embarks to have shoulder pains, Brian is pondering about his parent's divorce. Brian never told anyone that he knew about the divorce. The pilot teaches Brian how to steer. Then the pilot has a heart a tack. Brian will now have to steer. He makes a plan. His plan is when he finds a lake he will land in knee deep water. Brian spots a lake; he hits trees then goes out in the lake. He swims a-shore and lays down and sleeps. Brian is very swollen on his forehead. He has to find some food. Brian saw two birds that flew to some berries. He figures that if the birds can eat them he can, too. Brian thought that he was going to get rescued in a few days. A month goes by; he stills does not get rescued. One day Brian was getting fish out of the lake when a moose came and threw him into the lake. Then that night a real strong wind like a tornado came and took everything Brian had. The dead pilot is still in the head of the plane. The end of the plane stuck out of the water that had the survival pack. Brian has to get that pack. He makes a raft. Then the next morning he sets out first thing to get that pack.

It tells us an amazing story of how a boy survives in the wilderness of Canada for over two months! I love this book because there is a curveball around every corner. One moment Brian(the boy) could be out looking for food and the next being rammed by a moose. The question for all you wondering is, will he survive?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a great book. Especially if you love adventure and the wilderness.

Finally, Brain finds a place to crash it in a lake.

Brain has to take all the skills he knows and has to be able to survive in the wilderness, until someday, someone will find him and he can go back to living the way he did before."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, a 13 year old boy with separated parents, is on his way to visit his father in a plane when his pilot gets a heart attack. Desperate, he lands the plane in a remote lake of the Canadian forests. Despite being alone, Brian learns how to survive without a survival pack - looking for food, building a shelter for himself and hunting. He discovers fruits, hunts birds and learns how to create fire and cook. When he sees a bear, he learns how to stay calm and overcome his fears. This is a beautifully written story I would recommend for the young and the \\"young at heart\\". Read the story yourself to find out about the adventures of Brian Robeson and what happens at the end of the story!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was a great read! Brian's plane goes down and he's forced to survive for an unknown length of time in the Canadian wilderness. The book captures the same spirit as the movie Castaway; it's only more impressive since the book was written before the movie, and involves a child instead of a grown man. Brian encounters setback after setback, but perseveres and shows his true spirit and strength. The book is a true testimony to the power of the human spirit to survive anything. My one criticism is Brian's constant bemoaning over his parents' impending divorce and the dreaded &quot;Secret&quot; he carries. Pullease...if the author wanted to show a change in Brian's character, he certainly could have used something more substantial and less cliche. Other than this minor (and useless) subplot, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It's the perfect gift for a nine or ten year old."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a very good book, and I would recommend it. Here's the first part of the story. Bryan, a kid whose parents are suddenly divorced (by his mother), before that happens he sees something, the secret his father does not know. This is what the secret is, he was biking with his friend when he sees his mother in a station wagon with a man with blond hair. While she is driving she turns over and kisses his lips. Now he is flying to his father, the pilot suddenly has a heart attack, and rams his foot inot the right rudder pedal. A few hours later Bryan has to make a crash landing right by a lake! Then he has to find food, shelter, weapons and fire with no survival pack. I won't tell you the rest because it would spoil it. I liked this book so much I listened to it twice in the car. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian, a 13-year-old boy, is sent to live with his father in the Canidian wilderness. The pilot of the brushplane that he is flying in suffers a heart attack and dies. Left to fly the plane alone, Brian crash lands the plane into a lake somewhere in the wilderness. Brian has to learn survival skills to stay alive. Many challenges come his way like being run over by a moose and breaking a few ribs, a tornado ruining his camp and loosing most of his supplies and even getting sick from the berries he finds near the camp. Finially, Brian learns that the tail end of the plane is still sticking out of the water in the lake. He swims to the plane, cuts a hole in the tail and grabs the survival pack from the inside. After getting back to the camp he looks through the bag and finds a radio transmitter. Thinking it doesn't work, he puts it aside, not knowing that he left it on. A plane finds him and saves him, and he is taken back to his home.This book shows many virtues like responsibility. It has many survival skills for the wilderness and for every day life. I think more people should read this book. If you like adventure and suspence you should definately read it. I really liked it and I think you will too."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brain. Brain's parents are divorced.

It's more about a boy than a hatchet.In the book, the boy was in a plane crash. He was out in nowhere and was almost killed. He killed his first fish with a spear he made. He made a bow and arrow and killed his first meat, a squirrel. He built a shelter that was knocked down by wind. He was alone in the meadow.The book was exciting because it made me want to see how he built his shelter.

Brian then has to take control of the plane but he can't and the plane crashes. But he is still alive. But he has to survive through out the forest alone ,and lost with the hatchet that his mother gave him before he left. He missed two airplanes but the third one he didn't and left him back to the airport. Thank god for the third airplane that came and rescued him!!! I actually liked this book because how a boy survived in a forest and I like books that has problem just like he did. One thing that I really liked about the book was how the author used metaphors, and similes how the plane reacted to the crash. For Example: The plane, committed now to landing, to crashing, fell into the wide place like a stone. One thing that the author should have done better was put a title to each chapter, so the reader could predict what would happen next. Also so the reader would be able to understand the chapter and why is it named as the title. I recommend this strongly to those who like adventure stories because it has a lot do with that."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"\\"And his leg was instantly torn with pain, like a hundred needles going through his leg!

Book and author are wonderful, but many Amazon reviewers have already pointed that out more eloquently than I could. What still needs to be said, however, is how brilliantly Peter Coyote reads this incredible story. He finds a lyricism in Paulsen's simple, heavily repetitive prose and he captures the pathos of Brian's every experience, both the terrible and the triumphant. Listening to Mr. Coyote one feels Brian's fear, his despair, his resolution and finally his hope.As a teacher, I would especially recommend this to younger students (5th grade and up) who have trouble reading. To listen to a wonderful book beautifully read can go a long way towards creating a life-long reader."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have just read this book and it is an amazing story about bravery and survival.

As he headed for his father, who lived in the Canadian wilderness, the pilot of the single engined plane had a heart attack. Brian vaguely knew how to fly the plane and landed it in an l-shaped lake. He survives the crash and is able to swim to shore. He then, builds himself a shelter and makes a fishing spear. To survive he used his hatchet and birch bark to make fire. To keep from starving, he ate gut berries, berries that made him sick, raspberries, and he eventually learned how to fish and hunt with spears. While fishing, he had an encounter with a moose that left him with broken ribs. To make matters worse, a tornado destroys his shelter and scatters his weapons. Right after the tornado, he realizes that the plane's tail end was sticking out of the water and the survival pack was still inside. He retrieved the survival pack and enjoyed the food, weapons and sleeping bag. There was also an emergency transmitter that, he believed, was broken. Little did he know, a nearby plane received the transmission and he was rescued. During the story, Brian learned many life lessons and had to learn things he would need to survive. He also developed a new outlook on life and an appreciation for what he had."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"You have to read this book! Hatchet is a great book written by Gary Paulsen with 195 pages. This is my favorite book I've read this year. This is the first book in the Hatchet series.Hatchet is about a boy named Brian Robeson on his one way visit to his father when the single-engine plane in which he was flying crashed. Suddenly, Brian finds himself alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but an old ripped up rain coat and a hatchet his mother gave him as a present and the dreadful secret that has been tearing him apart since his parents' divorce. But now Brian has no time for anger. And you will just have to read it to know the rest to find out what happens.My favorite part of the book is when the plane crashed because it was weird how it all happened.

I rate this book with five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"You have to read this book! Hatchet is a great book written by Gary Paulsen with 195 pages. This is my favorite book I've read this year. This is the first book in the Hatchet series.Hatchet is about a boy named Brian Robeson on his one way visit to his father when the single-engine plane in which he was flying crashed. Suddenly, Brian finds himself alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but an old ripped up rain coat and a hatchet his mother gave him as a present and the dreadful secret that has been tearing him apart since his parents' divorce. But now Brian has no time for anger. And you will just have to read it to know the rest to find out what happens.My favorite part of the book is when the plane crashed because it was weird how it all happened. How the pilot had a heart attack and Brian had to fly the plane.The most important thing I learned from reading this book was not to ride on a plane with an old person because they might have a heart attack.Some other books by this author are the rest of the hatchet series, the woodsong series and more.I recommend you to read this book because of the adventure it has. I rate this book with five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was written 20 years ago because the situation could be present day and the protagonist could be any one of us struggling to survive a plane crash in the wilderness. My 8-year old and I read this book together and compared it to \\"My Side of the Mountain,\\" also a boy's survival story: Hatchet was preferred by both of us for its drama and the depth of emotion the author provides for the boy, Brian Robeson. Life lessons in this story include determination (building a fire) and the ability to change yourself by recalling things you have learned in your past and pulling from your inner strength. Brian's toughening to both the environment and his family's split makes the reader realize that we should appreciate what we have and accept the things we cannot control."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I ordered this for my grandson who loves to read. He was anxious to get it and was happy to start reading it. Good value."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson enters the Canadian Woods angry over the divorce of his mother and father. He set out to visit his father for the summer. The plane he is in crashes into a small lake and he is stranded in the woods for months. Through the beauty of nature and the tough act of learning to survive Brian finds peace in the wilderness. He learns how to cope with his parent's divorce. While there, he reaches an all time low, but soon realizes that feelin sorry for himself won't help him. This story teaches survival and how to work through hard ships that children may face without giving up. This is a great read aloud for teachers of students in 5th grade. It deals with anger and depression issues that children face when their parents get a divorce. I think Hatchet is a great read for children that are facing a similuar difficult situation. I think the story teaches a lesson in survival period.Brenda Jones author of \\"Standing Up\\" and \\"No, I Don't Want to Play Today\\"Standing Up"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"An excelent plot,good sequels and good characters.who the hell could rate this a 1 star book?!Overall,a must read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is based on a real story this is a book that leaves you in suspense it is about a teenager that his parents are separated.

The book is adictive, once you start readding you can't stop. I highly recommend this book.The book is about a boy named Brian who gets in a plane crash, landing in the middle of the Canandian forests. He must think back to everything about survival he has learned. During this time he changes, from a city boy to a wilder hunter. He starts to use hs instincts for every move he makes. Although this change takes place, he is an emotion wreck, but soon pulls himself together to survive.Although this book is very exciting at times, there are some dull parts. For a while, Brian has the same routine everyday, but Gary Paulsen pulled though and delivered an action packed ride of a read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I purchased the book \\"Hatchet\\" on CD. It's a great book for a young boy (12) who does not like to read, and reads below grade level. This way he can follow along on the written page as he is listening to someone else read the fascinating story. It's a book that kept his interest. Tracks on the CD do not always coincide with chapter beginnings and the reader on the CD does NOT announce the beginning of a new chapter. This is done much better on the CD for \\"Brian's Winter,\\" also by Gary Paulsen, where a bit of music lets you know you are coming to the end of a chapter, then there is a short pause, a new track starts and the next chapter is announced. This makes it much easier to find the next place to start reading and listening."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is the best book I have ever read before.

There are a few soap opera kind of stuff (like Brian's mother going out with another man), but Gary Paulsen's books were always good, clean, family entertainment. The fight with the moose (or deer, I can't remember)is the best part. I give it 4 stars, for it's truth about survival, but the bad part was the soap opera shtick.

Hatchet is outstanding book written by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet was a Newberry Honor book. Hatchet was also noticed by the Voice of Youth Advocates. Hatchet is a series of books. Including The River, Brian's winter, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt. Another good book by Gary Paulsen is Dancing Carl. In Hatchet the amazing strength of Brain will amaze you. Hatchet is one of the best books I have ever read.Brian is heading to the airport. When his mom gives him a hatchet. The thing she doesn't know is that it will become one of Brian's only things he has left. On his way to Canada on the plane. The pilot starts to complain about his chest. The pilot starts to have a heart attack. The plane crashes and Brian is left stranded by himself in the north canandan woods. With some creative ways he has food and a home. But one bad night sends him back to square one. Just when every thing seems to fall apart. He remembers something in the plane that might just help him get home.I like the descriptive writing of Gary Paulsen. I was able to paint a picture in my head. Gary Paulsen said he look at the water and saw his relflexing. He said Brian saw big deep cuts on his face. And big blue bruises. The descriptive writing of the character caught my inertest. It will for sure catch yours.I liked the descriptive writing of the setting. It made me feel like I was watching him do all the things he did. Gary Paulsen said he was standing by the bright green raspberry bush with big red berries. It made me well like I was watching Hatchet was an exciting book. I didn't want to put it down it was so interesting. I wanted to know what happen next. Once you read Hatchet remember to read the other four books in this series. Hatchet is a good book for teachers to read to their students. Hatchet is also good for fifth through seventh graders. I give Hatchet five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were stranded alone in the wilderness with no food, no clean water, no clean clothes, and no more than a hatchet to keep you alive? Well, in the book Hatchet, this thought is clearly and visibly brought into reality! Written by the reasonably well-known author, Gary Paulsen, this 159 paged adventure and realistic fiction book is focused on that precise idea - what would happen? Gary Paulsen will capture you through a vast and stunning adventure crammed with suspense, shockers, excitement, and relief as he has accomplished with some other of his award winning books, such as his recently wrote mini series for Hatchet. Some other books in this mini series are: Brian's Winter, which is the sequel to Hatchet. It claimed the IRA Youth Adults Award and was on the ALKA booklist, a huge honor. Brian's Hunt was the next book, and it was on the ALA Booklist and won the School Library Journal. The final book was Brian's Return, which won the Horn Book Award and the Kirkus Review. Hatchet is the first book that inspired these sequels. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hatchet. It was well-worth my time to read this outstanding novel. I get bored with books very easily, but there was something about Hatchet that made me never want to stop reading! It was exciting and jam-packed with action and stimulation. I never wanted to set this book down.In the book Hatchet, Brian Robinson's parents file for a divorce and Brain's father suddenly moves to Alaska. Brian takes a tiny private jet to visit his father in Alaska, but on the way there something goes terribly wrong. You are suddenly caught up in a burst of suspense, strong emotions and jittery fright as the pilot abruptly suffers a massive heart attack and dies instantly! In a snap, Brain's world collapses and he fears he will die. He is alone in a plane sitting next to dead pilot, miles off course, and only a little gas left. He has two choices - go down then before the fuel runs out, or stay up and fly until the fuel runs out. He chooses to stay up, and the plane eventually crashes with a loud bang in a still, pristine \\"L\\" shaped shimmering lake in the middle of the untamed, rugged Canadian wilderness, and Brian is left with nothing but a hatchet to keep him alive. Gradually, Brian learns to take care of himself by hunting, fishing, and gathering plants, and learns a lot about himself. He maintains himself and remains cheerful and optimistic, but optimism rapidly turns to terrified panic as months race by and no one comes. Will he be rescued? Or will he be forced to live, and eventually die, out in the bitter, wild wilderness alone?The book Hatchet had a lot of suspense. The first event that sent an icy shiver down my spine was when the pilot steering the plane suddenly suffers a deadly, immense heart attack and dies instantaneously. The way the author described it made me grit my teeth nervously and break into an icy-cold, panicky sweat. Another thing that put me on the edge of my seat was when a massive, terrifying tornado rips violently across his quiet lake and ruins mostly everything he has. He almost lost his life in the terrible natural disaster!Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that the character was strong, brave, and determined. I noticed that when he first got to the lake, he was a city boy and he had no idea how to survive! But he tried hard and struggled to stay alive, thinking hard about everything he did. If it were me, I probably wouldn't be able to survive. I think that the main character is someone to look up to for his courage, self-control, and optimism.Overall, I think that this book is phenomenal. As I was reading it, I could vibrantly see all the events in the book happening because of Gary Paulsen's amazing portrayal and word choice. The plot was packed with action and anticipation. It was absolutely a thrill to read! When I was reading, I felt like I was right next to Brian and I felt everything that he felt. I highly recommend this book to everyone that loves a good read stuffed with adventure and suspense. Hatchet is a whirlwind of action-packet ecstasy and stimulation that is sure to get your heart racing! If you read the book Hatchet, I can guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It is a very exciting and dramatic novel. I imagined myself in that position very easily, except for remembering all the survival skills he had learned. When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down, literally. It would be a great book for a outdoor loving boy (like me). I am 9 and my mom and I read this continuously every day for a month. My little brother would listen in as well - it was so good. I loved it so much, I might even read it again. It was mainly about a 13 year old boy coming from New York to Canada to visit his father. When the pilot suddenly had a heart attack, instinctively, Brian took over, flew the plane and crashed in a lake. He survived in the Canadian wilderness with only his clothes, a tattered wind breaker, a hatchet, and his brain, for 54 days."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is great. It's an exciting adventure story about Brian, a 13 year old boy who must fend for himself in the Canadian wilderness. The author wrote it in such a way that I found myself wondering what I would do in Brian's situation. It was tense and realistic, but still had moments of humor (such as when he names his raft \\"Brushpile One\\", or when he gets a sudden windfall of food and decides to first \\"eat until he drops\\" and then be careful and ration the food.)There are some gory and upsetting parts, but I didn't find it depressing."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This book was awesome and full of action and adventure.

The whole book was spent almost in one spot. Other than that alot of things happened in the fifty some days he was stranded in the forest.

Other than that it had a pretty good plot. thats why I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I like the book Hatchet because it was pretty cool. What I like about he book is that he can survive in the woods so long, like when he found the turtle eggs. He cracks them open and ate them whole. I also like the part when he got the fire going from his hatchet and a twenty-dollar bill. That would be really hard to do. My favorite part in the book is when he made a raft and spent all day trying to get the survival pack out the water.This story is about a kid named Brian who was going to visit his dad in Canada because parents just slit up. Before he leaves, his mom gives him a hatchet. The pilot had a heart attack and the plane was about to crash, he had pulled up on the handles then the plane went down into an L shaped pond. When he woke up he found himself alone on a sandy beach surrounded by woods.I would tell almost every one to read this book because it has really good parts in it.

First, the book has a lot of action, and second, I can relate to the book a little bit. One of the best reasons I read the book is because my friends said that it was a great book to read. When I started reading the book I could see how the boy who got stranded felt.

It has action and it has suspense. A boy stranded in the wild is a good topic to write about. The book that went with it, or the sequel as some call it is Brians Winter. It is alot like the Hatchet, but during winter time. I think anybody who reads this book will be satisfied. If anybody is into books that have people stranded, and have to fend for themselves, then this is a book for them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen takes place in the wilderness.

If I was the one in the book I would have never flown in a plane to go see my dad. I would of just had him come over here. Non of that would have happened.

It shows how one person can survive in the Canadian wilderness. Brian Robeson was going to Canada to visit his father. The pilot had hardtack and the airplane crash on the lake. But Brian was safe. He slimed away from the sinking wreckage of the plan. When he rested on the shore of the lake that had crashed he got up and tried to look for somewhere to sleep because night was coming. First he lived in the forest and he didn't have anything eat he tried to find something to eat. When he found raspberries he eat too many of them and he threw up because the doesn't good. Brian started new life there. He tried to hunt for animals to get some different food. He even made a fire, which helped him a lot. Brian was there for 54 days, bat he survived.When I was reading Hatchet I felt born for Brian because he was only 13 years old and he had to be alone. Sometime it was funny when he was doing this stuff because couldn't do it. Overall I thing that this book had good influence on me.I like this book because it is easy to understand and it is not to long. I also like because I like to read adventure books and books that have a lot action. I learned from this book a lot. The first thing is that you have to always yourself you can't depend on someone.

If you don't like books where people die or someone has to kill and animal then maybe you should not read it. If you are the type of person who is willing too understand why someone must or has too kill an animal because of starvation then this book may be good for you. And if you are a person who is in between you may want to read the back or the inside front flap of the book before you start reading. It is a GREAT book for people if they don't mind some teensy bit of a little to many details. If you like this book you may want to try reading:My side of the mountain or it's sequels,on the far side of the mountian andFrightfals mountian or thebook for young children called Frightfals daughter.Another great book is,Island of the blue dolphins and it's sequelZia.Another book I recommened even though it has barely anything similuar with the rest,Watership down.READ THEM ALL!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a well written easy to read book.Hatchet is about a boy traveling to see his father by airplane. When the plane crashes into the lake, Brian is the only survivor. Brian learned to live in the wilderness because he had to do so until he could be rescued.The book is ok, not one of the best books I've read but if you like books about the trials of surviving...this one is for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson was troubled for a while when his mother sends him to visit his serperated father over in norhern canada at an oil rig. Brian then gets excited and prepared for the visit as his mother gave him some presents, one of them being a small hatchet. As he was on the plane his personal pilot suddenly had a heart attack and died causing the plane to go an unknown amount of miles off the correct route and crash down in a lake. Brian is now forced to survive in the wilderness alone and out of reach of any civilization with just a hatchet. This book was brilliantly written to test the mind of a thirteen year old boy's survival skill in an unknown area in the Canadian woods.Brian was brought to life by the writer with precise details and actions to give the reader exactly what they needed to know about him. The book started out giving Brian's physical features and throughout the entire book there were different types of actions to express how he had changed during the book. He started out as a quiet, shy and fragile kid and survivingthw ilderness transformed him into a much wiser and stronger person. He even lost about 20% of his body fat during his stay alone in the wilderness.This book was one that made the reader keep reading and reading becaue Brian found problems and tasks to overcome every day so I couldnt put it down until i finished it. Once Brian \\"arrived\\" into the wilderness he had to make a quick shelter and camp site to warn off other animals. While he was there, all sorts of animals threatened his existance and made it more difficult for him but that was just more reason to try harder and accomplish things faster.The Hatchet was an original story with an exciting plot, setting and characters. There are not many books about testing the minds of teenagers in the wilderness making The Hatchet to be one that is much different from all others. With the original plot came the original setting and character which were the Canadian woods and a shy thirteen year old boy that hasn't a clue on anything about surviving.The plot of the novel focuses on a traditional man vs. nature theme. Although the outlook was grim, Brian managed to emerge triumphant in the face of adversity. Brian's internal growth and newly aquired survival skills enable him to survive. This book is interesting and inspiratational.-K. Hurdle"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy: Gary Paulsen(Book Review)Survival! Brian Robenson had encountered it face to face. Surving a deadly plane crash was the least of Brian's worries. Stuck in the wilderness Brian must develop survival skills or face death. With nothing but a hatchet that his mom gave him before he got on the plane. When his pilot dies in the middle of flight Brian doesn't know what to do. After the crash he built himself a home and tries to survive until somebody finds him. This is a really good suspense as well as adventure story. I would recommend this to people who like action and survival stories.One of the reasons I like this book is because of some of the suspense contained in it. When Brian is struggling to get out of the water was one of them. When you were reading it you were thinking that he wasn't going to make it out. Instead he just barely made it out with throbbing pain from the crash! After he woke up the next morning he had mosquitoes just viciously biting at his skin. I was wondering how he would get out of the situation. The resolution to that was building shelter and building a fire. The most suspenseful was when Brian found the new berries instead of those old awful ones and a bear was right there in front of his face. Most surprisingly the bear didn't attack. It just minded its own business and didn't even touch Brian!The book was also exciting because of some of the action. The part with the most action definitely was when Brian was crashing the plane. When Brian kept going up and down in the plane was the start of the action. The main part is when Brian runs out of fuel and has to crash into an L-shaped lake. Brian endured a really strong tornado that tore his house and took his supplies away. When the mosquitoes came back Brian decided to build his shelter and fire back. Then he noticed the tail of the plane was sticking out. It was then he remembered, \\"The survival pack is still in there!\\" He swam out and made a hole in the plane. He made it through the hole and he pulled the survival pack out of the plane. One other one that I really liked was the battle between the moose and Brian. The moose just constantly kept attacking him but Brian showed perseverance and bravery by getting up after every blow.Last but not least the author used really descriptive sentences. At times you probably thought you were Brian because it was so descriptive. One of those occasions for me was when Brian was escaping from the plane. You could feel the pain that he was going through. Like his lungs burning for air and the throbbing pain all over his body. Especially on his forehead. When the mosquitoes bit at him you could feel his agony. It's almost like you know Brian and he's your friend. Pain and agony wasn't the only thing that the author described in this book. For instance when Brian caught his first fish and had his first successful hunt you could feel the happiness and relief go through him. Brian's mother cheated on his father and Brian witnessed it. His father doesn't know and Brian just can't seem to tell him about it. The author made you feel sorry for his plight even though it wasn't real. It was like he was playing with your mind.This book is an adventure and survival story wrapped into one. I would recommend it to anyone who likes those types of stories. This book had plenty of action and kept you guessing. It was suspenseful until the point where I couldn't put down the book Hatchet has really descriptive sentences. It had so much of them that at a point I could have thought that I was Brian! All of these in Hatchet blended into one makes it one of the best books I have ever read.By: D. Bennett"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If I could I would give this book 100 STARS .I like how it starts. A regular boy in a regular day. At first you would think it's going to be an amazing adventure ,but then you discover it's not. Brian \`the main character' doesn't know if he is going to stay alive or not, because he is by himself.

He crashes in the woods of Canada and learns to survive.Brian's Pilot is flying Brian to Canada to see his father but he has a heart attack and crashes.Brian's mother lives alone with Brian during the school year.Brian's father lives alone in Canada with Brian only during the summer and spring break.Plot: Hatchet is a story of a boy about 14 years old. Brian is on his way to his father's house in Canada for the summer. While flying over a forest in Canada the pilot has a heart attack. Before the pilot suffered his heart attack he taught Brian the basics of how to fly the plane. Brian was going to fly in the same direction and try to contact someone over the headset. Brian tried contacting someone over the headset, but no one responded.Hours passed, still no one had answered Brian's cries for help. He then looked to see how much fuel he left. The fuel tank was almost empty, so he needed a new plan. He was thinking of a way to crash land in the forests of Canada. Since he was running out of fuel, he needed to decide to either, run the fuel until he landed or push the throttle to down quickly.He decided to look for a lake to land on, since the bush plane had landing gear for water. Brian found the perfect lake, it was \\"L\\" shaped so he could land along the longer part. He took the plane down and on his way down, trees cut off the wings of the plane which messed up Brian's landing.Brian barely survived the landing. All he had was his hatchet and the medicine kit. Now that he was out of the sky, he needed to find shelter. That wasn't the worst thing on his mind. His worst worry was where and how long he would live, what could he eat and how to get the mosquitoes away. Brian needed to find some place to go.For days Brian looked for a cave, and finally he found one. Now he was able to fall asleep. Something in the back of the cave woke him up. In defense, he threw his hatchet at what ever was back there. He missed and when the hatchet hit the wall, he saw a shower of sparks. He figured out how to make a fire to keep the mosquitoes away and cook food when he found it. He set out to search for food. Brian told himself that he would make it out alive he just had to survive in the wild for a while. Now that Brian had food and shelter, his main objective, was to survive.Comments: Hatchet is an extremely well written book. Gary Paulsen has written one of his best books yet. He was very descriptive when it came to Brian's thoughts and what was going on in the story. Once you really get into about the third chapter, this book really gets exciting. It is a classic tale about a boy vs. nature filled with plenty of action but not to a gory point. It is about how a boy survived the wilderness and the courage a person would need to endure. I would recommend this book for all ages and give it a 9 out of 10 scale rating.Touchy Areas: NoneRelated Titles:Books:Brian's Winter, The River, and Brian's Hunt by Gary PaulsenFilms:Far From Home (1994) Hatchet (1990)"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I remembered this book fondly from my pre-teen days, and looking at it once again from a teacher's point-of-view, my original judgment was accurate. Paulsen is always a joy and a quick read, and this is no exception. The book is simply and concisely written; it won't expand a teen's vocabulary, but that makes it an excellent introduction to the wonderful world of realistic fiction for reluctant readers.Boys and girls will be thrilled at this up-close and personal view of the natural world, and at the book's end, readers are left wanting more. Since Paulsen has several sequels published, that desire can now be satisfied. For many, it may awaken a curiousity about the outdoors that is sorely lacking in the \\"digital\\" generation. The book also deals very effectively with the topic of divorce, which many children can benefit from and identify with as the main character comes to terms with his family situation.Paulsen describes his setting and plot conflicts in greatly convincing detail as an expert on the wilderness, and his well-devleoped themes are relevant to today's young reader. There are many teachable moments in this book, and no parent, child, or teacher can go wrong by adding Hatchet to their collection."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read the entire brian seriers and i am a HUGE fan of it.i think that the best book from the seires is hatchet it is amazing.ONE review i saw talked horribly about it horribly,but i can garentee that he is lying this book was spectcularPS:this book is a newbary honor book and over 2,000,000 copies were sold!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think this is a great book because it is a adventure book.

This book is the beginning of a good series which I have already read. I think that is why i like this book the most.

When the pilot of the plane has a heart-attack Brian is forced to crash the plane in a lake and survive there for weeks by himself. The only thing he has is the clothes he is wearing and a hatchet that his mother gave him before he left. He has to go through attacks from animals, a big cloud of mosquitos, and days without food.Like I said this is a great book.

As he headed for his father, who lived in the Canadian wilderness, the pilot of the single engined plane had a heart attack. Brian vaguely knew how to fly the plane and landed it in an l-shaped lake. He survives the crash and is able to swim to shore. He then, builds himself a shelter and makes a fishing spear. To survive he used his hatchet and birch bark to make fire. To keep from starving, he ate gut berries, berries that made him sick, raspberries, and he eventually learned how to fish and hunt with spears. While fishing, he had an encounter with a moose that left him with broken ribs. To make matters worse, a tornado destroys his shelter and scatters his weapons. Right after the tornado, he realizes that the plane's tail end was sticking out of the water and the survival pack was still inside. He retrieved the survival pack and enjoyed the food, weapons and sleeping bag. There was also an emergency transmitter that, he believed, was broken.

He is difficult and frustrated with the adults in his life.His father has moved north, and in order for him to spend time with him, Brian must embark on trip over the Canadian wilderness in a two seater plane.The talkative pilot annoys Brian until the overweight, smoking man has a heart attack and the plane crashes into a lake in the heart of the Canadian Wilderness.

When Brian is overwelmed by the elements, he goes back to the crashed plane and retrieves the only tool he can find: the hatchet he had received as a gift. This fortunate possession is the source of growing ability and resourcefulness that helps Brian determine that he can make the necessary changes that will help him survive and thrive in the face of life's challenges."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I remember reading \\"Hatchet\\" in school and rereading it as an adult makes me appreciate Gary Paulsen's classic novel all the more. It grapples with some very difficult and very adult issues in a realistic and logical manner that will appeal to young readers and adult readers as well. In a day and age of \\"reality\\" shows based on surviving difficult situations, \\"Hatchet\\" is a true test of survival and skill and the human spirit.Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson finds himself torn for the first time between his recently divorced parents. He is flying into nothern Canada to spend the summer with his father, armed with a secret he intends on telling him about his mother. Yet before Brian gets a chance to do so, his plane crashes into the wilderness, the pilot is dead, and he is forced to survive on his own with his few meager possessions - the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mother gave him before his trip. Being a slightly pudgy, suburban raised boy, Brian doesn't know the first thing about the wilderness, but learns quickly through trial-and-error. He has many successes - learning how to make fire, fashioning a bow and arrows and spear to hunt - as well as failures that help him perservere. While there are times when adversity seems too tough, Brian keeps a cool head to find a way to keep hope alive.\\"Hatchet\\" is a modern classic that is sure to stand the test of time. Brian is a likeable character and the ordeals he overcomes are amazing. The ending, while a logcial conclusion, still seems a bit rushed after everything that Brian has been through. Paulsen doesn't offer easy resolutions or simple platitudes which forgives the somewhat hasty ending."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Few books for young adults have the potential to capture the attention of the young male reader. \\"Hatchet\\" is defenitely one of those books. Like watching a good movie, I often found myself on the edge of my seat as I waited for a scene to come to its logical end. Even when I foresaw what would happen next, I found this to be an exciting book.Paulsen perfectly captures the psyche of a 14 year old boy in this book. Passed between parents after their divorce, Brian is going to see his father for the summer. But when his plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, Brian is made to fend for himself. Through trial-and-error and reasoning, he learns about his environment and learns to survive. More importantly, he learns about himself.As the story evolves, the author shows the development of Brian's character in evident ways. As he faces his demons, both physical and emotional, his actions are that of a 14 year old boy who is growing up fast. Though hardly subliminal, these lessons will leave an impact with young readers.Though the ending is easy to anticipate based on the sequels to this book that are now available, the way in which the ending occurred was well presented. The author chose not to make a simple happy ending. Instead, the ending was somwhat awkward but realistic.Generations of middle school students are certain to enjoy this book. As a Newberry Honor winner, it has already received recognition. Time will make it a classic."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a fantastic book. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it, read it every chance I got, and was sad when it was done. Hatchet is thought provoking and powerful. Gary Paulsen is turning into a favorite author."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a novel written en 1987 by Gary Paulsen, it is the first part of a series of four novels which I will also be reviewing.The story is about a 13 year old boy named Brian, who is going to visit his father in Canada because his parents have recently been divorced and he has to split time with them. He is traveling in a two person plane, just him and the pilot. As he is traveling and feeling grief about his situation with his parents, the pilot suffers a massive heart attack and dies, leaving Brian to fend for himself. Unable to fly the plane he manages to emergency land it in a lake in the middle of the Canadian wilderness.Now, hopeless and lost, Brian must learn to survive in the forest on his own, his only tool is something that his mother gave him before he left on the plane, a hatchet. At first he has no idea what to do, but little by little he learns to make shelter, find berries, build a fire, catch fish, build a bow and arrow and shoot big game, among other things.As time passes in the forest Brian turns from a regular pampered teenager into a young adult with a sense of survival as he loses hope that he will ever be found. He faces major problems while living in the wilderness such as swarms of mosquitos, bears, being attacked by a moose, and being in the middle of a tornado...scary stuff!As a kid I loved this book, I always loved to play in the woods or dream of running away as a child and this book talks about whats its like out there, I'll remember all this stuff in case I do actually get stranded. The book is very well written and even as an adult I still love it, it has a major nostalgic value for me.So in conclusion, I'd say this is definitely deserving of the 3 Newberry Honors that it one, and by the way it also was made into a movie, A Cry In The Wild. The sequel to this book is called \\"Brian's Winter\\" which I will also be reviewing in the future."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy Gary PaulsenReview by Ms Perkins' ClassHatchet is about surviving in the wild.

Not only did I thoroughly enjoy this story for myself but was further rewarded with wonderful discussions and further book talks between my son and I. We have since read and discussed other books of a similar genre and beyond. Hatchet has opened up another avenue for our father son time together.

I also like when he gets saved because I thought he would die. It is not just funny but it is also serious because he has to survive with out food. All he has is a hatchet.

This book has too many gross descriptions. For example, when Brian shoots the animals and when the dead pilot is mentioned, the author gives overly gory details. But, perhaps this is what living in the wilderness is like. Because of this, boys might like this book better than girls might. I did feel bad for Brian, since his parents are divorced and he was all alone. Besides being gory, The Hatchet is also a little depressing and a bit boring. I also read the sequel, Brian's Winter, and it too is not one of my favorites. I had to read these two books for school and I would not recommend them since I did not enjoy them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetI think other readers should read this book because it has lots of adventures and it is very interesting.

His parents divorce is weighing heavily on his mind, especially when he knows the secret that split them apart. Boarding a small engine plane in which he is the only passenger, Brian questions the gift his mother has just given him, a hatchet. With the new hatchet attached to his belt, Brian sits next to the pilot and waits on the plane as it flies swiftly over the Canadian wilderness. Suddenly the pilot begins to groan and clench his chest in extreme pain. The pilot suffers from what appears to be a severe heart attack and Brian is the only other person left to land the plane. With a great amount of luck, Brian crashes the plane into a pond and emerges from the wreckage bruised by alive. With only the clothes on his back and the hatchet his mother has given him Brian must find a way to survive in the Canadian wilderness until help arrives.For readers who have never read Gary Paulsen this is a must read. This novel is the utter definition of an adventure tale that is loaded with constant action and suspense. In true Paulsen fashion this novel captures every intricacy of the Canadian wilderness from the plant and animal life to the always pesky insects. This book can be utilized with upper elementary students all the way to eighth grade, and with its high level of interest and low readability this book is perfect for struggling readers."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson finds himself in a predicament! As he is on his way to see his father for the summer, the pilot of the plane has a heart attack and dies. He crash lands the plane in a lake in the Canadian wilderness. Instead of feeling sorry for himself he remembers what his English teacher once told him: \\"You are your most valuable asset\\". Brian learns how to survive in the wilderness...he has no other choice. Brian is a character who is full of hope; not to be rescued...just hope about life and survival. It is this hope that changes Brian forever into a person who sees the world now in a different way.Paulsen has done a great job in portraying realistic fiction in this story. He parallels the divorce of Brian's parents to life in the wilderness. Brian will get through both of these situations through his perserverance and determination. The tone of the story is serious and the character of Brian is believable. This kind of survival story would be great for upper elementary, middle school and high school age children. When done reading this story, it makes the reader think about what could have possibly happened to Brian if he was not rescued. Since many readers felt this way, it is no wonder why Paulsen continued this series with the many adventures of Brian."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, who is 13, is the only survivor of a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness.

Brian finds out he can learn to do new things in order to survive and take care of himself. He learns to make fire with a hatchet, catch fish with a spear, and hunt animals for food.The author wrote Hatchet in a way that made it very suspenseful. He described the setting with a lot of detail that made the reader feel like they were there in the wildnerness. He also helped the reader understand what Brian was thinking and how he was feeling about his situation. This made it easy for the reader to picture the story in their mind and kept them interested in the book.There was nothing that I didn't like about this book. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure story. This is a book you can read again and again if you want. I definitely will. Hatchet is one of the best books I have ever read.

That is exactly what Brian faces in Hatchet and how he over comes all these challenges.Gary Paulsen portrays Brian as a regular thirteen year old boy with divorcing parents. Brian is just a regular kid living in New York with his mom. He embarks on a journey to go stay with his dad for a while. On the way there in a small plane his pilot has a heart attack.

During his survival he pushes through swarms of mosquitoes, an attacking moose, tornado, and learns what it means to really survive.After reading this book I was really surprised that I liked it so much. \\"Almost overcome with self-pity. He was dirty and starving and bitten and hurt and lonely and ugly and afraid and so completely miserable that it was like being in a pit, a dark, deep pit with no way out.\\" page 67.

A few things I didn't like about the book are that he kept \`starting over,' and that the first half of the book was pretty much all about him starting his life in the woods. One thing I did like was that he met (and killed) many different animals. And still, the book is interesting and it makes you wonder what will happen next, although there are MANY slow bits.

His parents have recently divorced and he is on his way from his mother's in New York to his father's in Canada. Before he reaches his destination, though, the pilot of his plane has a massive heart attack and dies, before he can even get a message asking for help over the radio. Brian is left all alone in an airplane close to Canada, with no idea where he is going or how to land. He is not even sure he is on the right track toward civilization.With some difficulty, Brian manages to safely crash the plane in a small lake surrounded by woods. He crawls out before the plane sinks into the water. Now he is completely alone with nothing except the clothes on his back and the hatchet his mother gave to him before he left, which he was wearing strapped to his belt. Using common sense and experimentation, Brian must learn how to survive in the wilderness. The wilderness has food and a place for him to create a shelter, but it also has wild animals and bad weather. Brian must face up to the possibility that he may not be rescued for a very long time. Will he be able to survive?I liked the detailed description of how Brian managed to do things--how he created a shelter, how he built tools, and how he got his food. It seemed plausible that he really could have survived out there using those resources and thinking like he did.I would have liked to have gotten to know Brian better. This book focused mainly on what he did, and didn't talk much about what he was thinking."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I did my book report on Hatchet. This book is realistic fiction.

As the pilot had a heart attack, the plane crashed, leaving Bryan all alone.Having only a hatchet to survive with, Brian started out on the rough side.

The stories in this collection (the \\"Puffin Classics\\" series) are an excellent sampling of his craft. It's not always easy reading - in fact many of these stories would be too dense even for older children. His vocabulary is extensive, and sentences structure verbose and lengthy - a style rather unlike that employed by contemporary writers. But despite this, Irving demonstrates a wonderful command of the English language, and has the ability to create a vivid picture of his setting, characters and events. Particularly delightful is the attention he devotes to describing his characters. And yet his stories are far from mere character portraits - they are exciting and enchanting tales that make the reader eager to find out the outcome.\\"Rip Van Winkle\\" has gained the status of a classic, and is familiar to most children, but likely few have read Irving's original. It breathes an authenticity and air not found in the contemporary abridged versions of the story. Irving presents his tale as the alleged discovered manuscript (complete with postscript) of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker. The delightful story of Rip Van Winkle - who fell asleep in the Catskill mountains after drinking a mysterious brew acquired from some strange little men, and then awoke 20 years later - will continue to please readers old and new. In the course of the story, Irving makes a profound social comment about the changes happening in his America. \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is renowned for its chilling tale of the Headless Horseman, and is a Halloween favorite. Actually, however, it is much more than that. It is not so much a spooky tale of a legendary village ghost as it is a colourful tale about two rival suitors. Ichabod Crane is a simple school teacher who is in love with Katrina Van Tassel, and equally in love with the estates of her father, a wealthy Dutch farmer. His counter-part is the powerful local hero Bram Bones, whose affections for Katrina mirror those of Ichabod Crane, and who is determined to put an end to the affections of underdog Crane by a mysterious and elaborate trickery. As is evident also in his other stories, it is particularly fascinating how Irving exploits the supernatural superstitions of the popular mind to create a sense of mystery and fear, but himself gives a naturalist explanation that rises above such popular notions by explaining the supernatural with natural events.Though lesser known, the other three stories in the \\"Puffin Classics\\" collection are equally enjoyable. \\"The Spectre Bridegroom\\" is one of the most fascinating tales in the collection. A young man is mistaken for a bridegroom and received into the castle of a wealthy baron as the husband of the baron's daughter. But before the marriage can be consummated, the bridegroom dashes off, and the baron's family hears shortly afterwards that he's been killed. But then who appears again except the bridegroom - or is it his ghost? - to steal his bride and vanish once more! In the end, it is a satisfying tale more of brilliant scheming than of ghosts - although the fearful superstitions of the general public about the supernatural play an important role in the effective execution of these schemes. \\"The Pride of the Village\\" is the tragic tale of a young lady whose heart pines in love for an army officer who has deserted her, only to die at his feet when he returns. \\"Mountjoy\\" is a wonderful study of an apparently incurable romantic, described by Irving as a \\"Castle-Builder\\". When Mr. Mountjoy discovers a delicate footprint on a sandy shore, his passion for metaphysics, creativity and romance leads him to dream up an imaginary beautiful young maiden, and he promptly fall passionately in love with the nymph of his dreams. The air castle he builds and its accompanying romanticism is crushed numerous times, even drowned, but each time is renewed and revived, just when it seems that \\"the cobweb romance I had been spinning\\" would be demolished completely. In the end Mr. Mountjoy meets the girl of his dreams, only to discover that his air castles need to be reshaped once more, and in the end, destroyed completely.Readers used to the easy diet of modern fiction will find the pioneering work of Washington Irving rather tough to chew on. But those who delight in tasting words, biting on imaginative characters and settings, with a few sips of suspense and supernatural in the process, will discover that Washington Irving's stories are just the literary serving they are renowned to be: a classic. Irving won't please all children of the modern era. But children of literature who have acquired a fine literary taste will find that despite the heightened language of his time, Irving is still digestible and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Rip Van Winkle and Other Stories","review":"Rip Van Winkle is a story of an regular man that came in contact with some irregular people that would change his life forever. It all started out one day when Rip decided to go hunting with his dog. Up to this point in his search for freedom, he had lived a sleepy and uneventfull life with two kids and a wife. He was always trying to get out of work and find a way out of doing everything. One day he gets fed up with his life and finds himself out in the woods hunting;There he gets asked by a strange man to carry a keg to a nine pin party. Also during this party he ends up getting drunk and finds himself dosing off to sleep. When he finally wakes up he has a long white beard and twenty years older! He had fallen asleep for twenty years and found that he was now old, grey and still alive. At this point in the story he goes back to the village where he had lived for so long and finds that his wife and friends had all passed away and had left him. He also finds that his daughter got married and was raising a family. She sees him one day and recognizes him to be the man that was once her father. At this point in Rip's life, all he wants to do is settle down and he is satisified to become the village story teller to all who would hear his tales. This is a tale of suspense and just plain old good reading for all ages. It was written many years ago and could speak to all people of all ages and races. I would recomend this book to anyone from my Grandfather to the Queen of England."},{"Title":"Rip Van Winkle and Other Stories","review":"While I enjoyed re-reading classics like \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", the new stories were difficult to get a grasp for. The language in all of Irving's stories is rich and very heavy in description. Like any other classics writer, he lives up to his name of being a wonderful writer. The difference being is that Irving decided to write short stories where the reader does not have nearly as much time to dive into the book as other authors allow. Maybe I'm not a short stories reader. I am by no means saying that this book is not a wonderful piece of literature; but what I am trying to get across is though great, was difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Rip Van Winkle and Other Stories","review":"What can I say, Washington Irving was a great writer of short stories. I thoroughly enjoyed his use of words and imagery. I highly recommend him."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Once again, Mary Lennox presents the thinking women of the 21st century with an opulent bodice-ripping period piece, while simultaneously removing the guilt from this guilty pleasure. Her Beauty is a forward-thinking, feisty foil for this version of the Beast, a hero long on animal sensuality and short on the mindless banalities usually reserved for fairy-tale princes. Both characters are plagued by doubts and the dark secrets of intrigue which bring to mind the great victorian novels of Dickens and Bronte. The relationship depicted in this, Lennox's third novel, marks a maturation of her work, presenting multiple dimensions and complexities, allowing the characters to be truly human and at times, riotously funny in their very authenticity. Lennox never skimps on her trademark sensuality, generating vividly lush landscapes and drawing us into her world with authentic period langauage and detail, displaying her scholarship and command of her topic. Always an escapist pleasure, Lennox's work again earns its place next to the best of literature, the crowd-pleasing classics of the 19th century."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Aubrey Drelincourte, Earl of Breme racing towards his home after recovering from a bullet wound, a mauling by a leopard, and the effects of a full-blown case of malaria looked out the coach window to view a young woman blocking the middle of the road and halting his progress. Lilias Merrit had stopped the racing coach to avert a potential disaster - warning them of children who were sledding down the side of the hill into the road around the bend. Admiring her spunk in scolding his drivers, he watched her ride away, and casually mentioned to his companions that she should be considered as a possible candidate as his prospective bride but then thought better of it - he didn't want a bride he might care for.In an effort to protect the people of Breme from his cousin and heir Rupert Hindley, Aubrey's needed time - time before Rupert returned and notified the House of Lords to try Aubrey for the murder of his wife - a murder Aubrey, unfortunately, could not remember. His cousin was fast spreading venomous lies in an effort to prove him guilty of the murder of his unfaithful wife. Before Aubrey would let that happen, he planned to marry and sire an heir in order to keep Castle Breme safe from his cousin's grasp.At around the same time, Lilias had discovered that her father was planning her betrothal to a man she knew was sadistic and cruel. Running to her friends in the nearby gypsy camp, Lilias begged them to let her travel with them to Castle Breme where she was hired as a nurse/companion to the ailing earl.Fearing that the reason his loss of memory was that he was guilty of murdering his unfaithful wife, Aubrey fought his growing attraction to Lilias by being thoroughly disagreeable during the worst of his malarial symptoms. He raged against the improprieties of a young woman being alone with him in a bachelor household all the while trying to distance himself from her. Frightened yet intrigued by Aubrey, Lilias' main concern was to care for and relieve Aubrey of his suffering, never expecting to fall in love. Eventually, she came to see the beauty of the man behind the disfiguring scars and tortured soul.*** This was a totally spellbinding and gripping story that I hated to put down. The concept of the \`beauty' who didn't see herself as attractive, and the man whose loss of memory and rare flashbacks made him think of himself as only a \`beast' and monster was intriguing. Lilias was an absolutely wonderful heroine, intelligent, brave, and strong with a totally non-existent sense of direction that will make you smile. Aubrey was that tortured hero that simply takes your breath away and I look forward to seeing his friend Ram Dass featured next with his very own story. This romantic action packed tale should wind up on your keeper shelf as an extraordinarily wonderful and absolutely riveting read! --- Marilyn (...)"},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Mary Lennox, author of the spellbinding \\"The Moon Runners\\", has just outdone herself with this fast-paced and complex Victorian thriller.

Lilias meets her new employer Aubrey Drelincourte, but shocks him as the repulsive scars on his face do not frighten her. Instead she expects his dark brooding will lead to rages that goes contrary to her feeling attracted to this depressing lord.Still suffering from Malaria he caught in India, Aubrey also feels guilty over his wife's death though he remembers nothing about it except awakening holding the murder weapon while a leopard stood near her corpse. He fears that remembering what happened will affirm that he is a murdering beast. Though Aubrey expects to be tried as a killer, this does not scare him, but his odious cousin inheriting Breme does. He wants to marry quickly and beget an heir before the law comes for him. With little time available he chooses Lilias as his bride, but expects she will refuse to wed a killer.This nineteenth century gothic romantic mystery hooks the audience from the moment that Lilias decides the unknown \\"evil\\" is safer than the known \\"evil\\". All the evidence cleverly points to Aubrey as a spousal murderer leaving fans to wonder how the male love interest could be the killer. Aubrey has doubts about his innocence and as he begins falling in love with Lilias, worries about her safety especially from him, his biggest fear. He insures MY LORD BEAST is a fine historical romantic suspense.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"I loved this gothic-style interpretation of the beauty and the beast story. Lilias doesn't consider herself a beauty, nor does she consider Aubrey a beast. Lilias is strong and works hard to help herself and the man she loves. I hope Ram Dass has his own follow-up story."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"I admit that I am always intrigued by the reworking of fairy tales for adults since the layered nuance and the symbolism of fairy tales are as important to adult psychological development as they are to that of children. Robin McKinley's work in this area stands out for me (including her adaptation of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", called \\"Beauty.\\") Therefore, I was delighted to discover Mary Lennox and hope that \\"My Lord Beast\\" is not her sole attempt at the genre.In this instance, the setting and time frame Lennox chooses (19th century England) allow for some social commentary that is as applicable to the 21st century as it is to that era. The characters are nicely developed and considerably more real than the norm for romances (and fairy tales, for that matter). The addition of some understated elements from \\"Bluebeard\\" add to the richness of the characters and the plot. Without giving away too much, it can be said that Lennox has added some intriguing twists to the original characters from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and adds two (the \\"Indian\\" Ram Dass, and Lord Beast's cousin). Both choices work well.If you would like a good read for the beach, a vacation, a plane ride, or an evening in front of the fire, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"As romance books go, this 1 is both literate & charming. Mixing -Beauty & the Beast-, -Rebecca-, &-Kim- [at the very least], Lennox creates many charming people in this tale of a man mauled by a tiger & the pretty maid who rescues him when he returns from India. From their first meeting, Lord Aubrey is captivated by Miss Lilas Merrit, a non-traditional Englishwoman w/non-traditional beauty. Forced to marry & breed an heir, he quickly discovers the charm of her musicial, Gypsy-loving free spirit.Nothing outstanding, but i *did* enjoy identifying the sources!"},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"This was my first book to read by Ms Lennox and it won't be the last. It was such a pleasurable read! Besides the hotness between the characters, there was a great story going on. I truly enjoyed it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Aubrey Drelincourte, Earl of Breme, is a man in trouble. He has returned to England from India sick with fevers (Malaria), scarred by a leopard, wounded by a gunshot. His wife was murdered and he can't remember if he did it or not, but he is about to be accused of her murder by the heir to his title who also has tried to kill him and who has conspired with his wife, who was also his lover. That he is in a beastly mood may be forgiven him.Lilias Merrit is the daughter of a merchant who has lost his funds and needs to marry her off to the highest bidder to try and recoup his fortune. The interested man is a handsome but brutish well-off farmer. Lilias prefers a life of service rather than marry such a man. She applies for a position with Lord Breme, whose servant and doctor from India, Ram Dass, needs help in nursing him (and guarding him from Hindley, the murderous heir). Lilias is a spirited girl, but Aubrey's sometimes beastial behavior puts her off, even while she is also attracted. Aubrey is trying hard to tame the beast, which is very attracted to Lilias, while he frets that he is indeed a murderer (and therefore a threat to her) and worried that his involvement with Lilias will bring her into the danger than surrounds him. While fighting his feelings, he needs to go back into society as they will be crucial in finding him guilty or not during his trial, also to try to remember what happened, and find proof of his innocence, even while guarding from attacks on his life... and now Lilias's life.Lennox knows how to create complex characters and relationships and plots that are intriguing, moving, romantic, sexy and full of adventure and mystery. The historical details are nice; the writing strong. It is so refreshing to encounter a good historical romance such as this after all the formulaic, unmemorable books currently on the market."},{"Title":"My Lord Beast (Five Star Expressions)","review":"It's been a very long time since I've encountered a heroine like Lilas Merrit. Thankfully! She's quite obviously a complete and utter idiot and a twit to boot, but some how all the other characters in the novel are convinced that she is intelligent when her actions signal otherwise. I will mention 3 examples. (1) Realizing that children are sledding down a hill that runs into a road, she stops to say \\"hello\\" and then continues on her way. Does she warn them to watch for traffic? No. Does she, I don't know, put up a \\"children at play\\" warning sign? No. Does she stay to keep an eye on the situation? No. She does nothing. But on her way back in the evening, when she spies a carriage speeding along the road, she stops it and is indignant at the driver because there are children ahead. Excuse me? How was the carriage driver to know this? (2) She hies off the gypsies (again) because the brute her father wants her to marry kisses her hard enough to bruise her lips. Huhn?! Landham didn't grope her. He didn't threaten her with rape or bodily harm. All he said was that he planned to marry her. Granted, the kiss was interrupted, and he let go of her, but seriously? They were barely any distance from the doctor and his daughter, it wasn't as if he had her in some isolated spot. Nonetheless, in Lilas' mind, this means she has to abandon her house for a month until her father returns. (3) Once at Lord Breme's, she sits around for 3 days before being told in the morning that she can read to his lordship that night. So what does Lilas do? Does she ask about Aubrey's interests? No. Does she go through his library and pick out things that might be suitable? Not really. She decides on 2 books of poetry, goes to Aubrey, and randomly selects poems for him that she hadn't ever read. She doesn't even list a few poems to see if there are any he is interested in hearing. Of course both poems she picks are completely inappropriate but it doesn't stop her from thinking, 'Wow, I'd really wish he let me finish reading... it's great!' What in the world is wrong with this woman?! Oh, that's right, she's TSTL.No, I didn't finish the book. It was too infuriating. In addition to Lilas' mental deficiency, the descriptions of her looking at Aubrey with 'great big eyes' filled with fear when they weren't filled with lust were tiresome as well. Mary Lennox is not a good writer. She relies on cliches and her sentences are wooden. Her structure also leaves much to be desired. Example, there is zero mention in the book that Lilas has any musical ability at all until she finds a Guaneri violin on page 100, and voila it turns out she is an accomplished violinist. Really? I mean, really??So, why 2 stars instead of 1? Because I have a fondness for fairy tales and because the author loves books. Unfortunately, neither translates into Mary Lennox being a good writer.

Covers: history of chocolate, cocoa harvesting and varieties, chocolate manufacturing, tempering, making chocolate designs, chocolate decorations, cake making, chocolate fillings and coverings. Recipes include tortes, small pastries (like petit 4's and cookies), a big candy section. Also individual desserts like charlottes, mousses, souffles, and icecreams, as well as chocolate drinks. Lists equipment manfacturers in the back.The book is beautiful and would be great for the coffee table even if you didn't use the recipes. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but they look sound from my experience. I feel it's different enough from other chocolate books to warrant buying. Compared to its peers that I own (Cocolat, the International chocolate cookbook, and Death by Chocolate) I would say this book excells in the presentation category for sure. It gives info on chocolate history that some of the other books don't. There are a LOT of recipes in this book. I would not recommend this book (or any of the other chocolate books I own, actually except for maybe Cocolat) for the absolute beginner unless he or she has another complementary book about cakes or pastries. The reason is while a lot of techniques are shown here, not a lot of &quot;this is what can go wrong, and why&quot; statements are included. So, if you goof, you might not know why. It doesn't go into which chocolate brands are the best, or talk about other ingredients (eggs, flour, etc) at all. In other words, the strengths of this book are presentation, showing techniques, history, recipe variety, but not recipe understanding. Probably my 2nd favorite chocolate book that I own (behind Cocolat).

Hays Town","review":"Town, a South Louisiana native and student of the South, offers a subtle salute to the region's heritage in the 25 homes featured in &quot;The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town.&quot; Photographs by Philip Gould capture the subtle design and recurring patterns in Hays' design. The text by Cyril E. Vetter and a tribute by Andres Duany is reverential...It is tempting to pause over Gould's photographs of Town's work, treat them like Ken Burns treats Civil War photographs and follow the lines. An alley of crepe myrtles frames the brick archway entrance to a richly detailed courtyard...A weathered fence serves as foreground detail for a shot of a deep, brick-floored porch...These are elements of Town's style. His residences wear it well."},{"Title":"The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town","review":"&quot;The Louisiana Houses of A.

I know as a local resident that any home that he has had a personal touch in building is a true showcase. Many younger architects are now trying to copy or learn from his style. Unfortunately, there are as yet no equals to his expertise. This book is a lovely treatise of some of his best work. It is, however, incomplete. How sad. We will miss him."},{"Title":"The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town","review":"&quot;The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town&quot; combines text by Cyril E. Vetter with photographs by Philip Gould. Together, they celebrate the classic houses designed by Town. The book is full of superb photos of both interiors and exteriors. The book ends with a short essay by Andres Duany, in which he declares, &quot;The long, long career of A. Hays Town is like a bridge that brings forth the traditional architecture of Louisiana to the present generation of builders.&quot;Many picturesque elements recur throughout the book: classical statuary, brick floors, exteriors with a look of natural weathering, 2-level exterior galleries, etc. Some particularly memorable images include the following: Hamilton House's interior courtyard overlooked by a second floor balcony; Westerman House's charming lily pond, made from an old sugar kettle; the rustic wood posts on the porch of the Bonnecaze House; the elegant white pillars of the Godchaux House; and more.My only disappointment is that floor plans for the homes are not included; they would have, in my opinion, given readers a better sense of these houses. Still, if you love great American architecture, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Louisiana Houses of A.

Anyone lucky enough to live in a house designed by Mr. Town is a lucky person indeed.

Hays Town, born in 1903, was building Acadian cottages, Creole villas and Spanish courtyards in his native Louisiana. After retiring from his commercial practice in the 1960's, he designed even more of these houses, which are beloved by Southerners. Now everyone can visit 25 of the 500 he built in &quot;The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town&quot; (Louisiana State University Press; $39.95). The sparse text is by Cyril E.

However author completely missed the mark on the REAL RICHEST PEOPLE - which are The Crown and The Bankers. Although mentioned in the book, the author dismissed JP Morgan as \\"small bank\\". However, JP Morgan owns a largest share of a private Federal Reserve Bank, and therefore has a license to print DOLLAR. That is besided owning huge shares of american railroad, steel and other industries. Also not mentioned were Kuhn Loeb, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and several more. Warburg is mentioned once, and not a single mention of Schiff or Rothschild. A shame, MISSED A MARK BIG TIME THERE.Also, too much \\"jews are not allowed anywhere\\" \\"anti-semitism\\" type of cry.

Power seeks power incestuously and the web of power isn't just wealth. It is boards of corporations, memberships in clubs, and the bonds of marriages. This isn't just a screed against money; it is an anthropological study of the rulers of this country. They seldom seek publicity. That would be so nouveau riche. Even though this is a snapshot taken in the middle of the last century, the social structures revealed had been established since the beginning of the Republic and there is no reason to doubt that they persist today. Read and learn."},{"Title":"The Rich and The Super-Rich by Ferdinand Lundberg","review":"Loaded with facts and figures, this gigantic book seems at firstintimidating -- but it is really quite easy to read and under-stand. Being able to \\"swallow\\" what's there is a different thing, however -- one is horrified to learn that our US Democracy isn't truly a democracy at all....that it's ruled bya powerful ogliarcy that keeps its power -- and most of the identities of its members, truly secret.Since this book was published in the 1960s, there is infothat is absent....but also some secret info that isn't inmore modern books, as the power elite have since covered someof the tracks herein listed.For me, the most valuable part of the book is the description of the \\"common (mass) man\\" vs. the elite. (See the wonderfully annotated index -- as the page numbers are different between the paperback and hard-cover.) The rich really AREdifferent from you and I -- but Mr. Lundberg's reasonings whyare 1000 times more accurate, (and 1000 times more frightening),than F. Scott Fitzgerald's! The reasons given make terrible,logical sense -- and make one not only appreciate their accuracy,but also appreciate, greatly, such \\"traitors to their class\\" asRobert Kennedy and (to me, anyway), John Kerry -- people who,despite their wealth, see \\"mass men\\", (and women), as nothingmore, (and nothing less), than fellow human-beings! It's toobad there are not more of them!Mr. Lundberg died a few years ago. I found this outsearching the New York Times database. I did not find hisobituary -- but I did find that of his wife, who died evenmore recently. Sadly -- and tellingly -- hers was NOT a\\"feature\\" obituary -- but one which, instead, had to beinserted, (and paid for), by her family. Although it ispossible that Mrs. Lundberg preferred it this way -- wantingto be one of the \\"mass\\" of humanity to the end, it is alsoquite possible that the \\"powers that be\\" wanted to \\"bury\\"the name of Lundberg, (and Ferdinand Lundberg's crusadingbooks!), as much as possible! As long as his books remainbuyable -- and especially if this wonderful classic issomeday soon reprinted -- I will know we haven't fallen intoa dictatorship, (yet!)

Incredible new fortunes are being made today, but what happened to all the old money?"},{"Title":"The Rich and The Super-Rich by Ferdinand Lundberg","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, The Rich and Superrich is a very readable book despite its size. It is very edifying to see the money power structure in the US. Ferdinand Lundberg was a brilliant scholar and writer, living from 1905 to 1995.I would also recommend his previous book, written in 1937, but reissued in 2007--America's 60 Families. From this one can see that the concentration of power is nothing new.I would recommend two more books that show how democratization of the US economy can be achieved.I would also recommend Thom Hartmann's books on the constitution, which explain all the obstacles to a true democracy put in place by our founders. The US constitution was a compromise between those who wanted a plutocracy (Adams and Hamilton, for example) and those who wanted a true people's democracy (Franklin, Jefferson, Thomas Paine). We must remember that the US was the first modern democracy. Unfortunately, the compromises our founders made has led to a plutocracy, rather than a democracy.I also recommend: SHARING THE PIE by Stephen Brouwer, Owl Books.Sharing The Pie \\"Offers a far more lucid presentation of economic trs than you are likely to find anywhere.\\"--Barbara EhrenreichEven though it was published in 1998, the material is still relevant since it analyzes the structure of the economy, rather than the current picture of who owns what.As one reviewer noted about Sharing The Pie, it is an invaluable resource for those who want to make sense of the economy, Sharing the Pie is also a passionate plea for greater economic equality and a revitalization of American democracy.As recently as 2004, a reviewer noted Sharing The Pie \\"gives a good history of how America's economy has gotten to the point it is now and where it may be going in the future.\\""},{"Title":"The Rich and The Super-Rich by Ferdinand Lundberg","review":"Lemmings,Listen to your gurus of b s (limbodomy; hasn'tany; beck; levine; etc, etc.)Then.

When you start asking \\"where's the money\\" you invariably end up reading books like Mr. Lundburg's.

Charles has a very healthy rhythm which carries him through his struggles, deepening his reach to his inner self and the humanity which surrounds him.

He is sent from the Teddy Bear Planet to report on - and alleviate - conditions under which bears on earth live. While the book is filled with magic (bears travel magically between the Teddy Bear Planet and earth; bears communicate telepathically with each other and with their humans and with other animals and members of the fairy kingdom, etc.) it is also filled with messages for human readers about what modern life is doing to our planet and what we are doing to each other. Charles and his friends and associates show by example solutions to many problems - solutions all based in love. The book is illustrated with delightful pictures of Charles (who has a tendency to be just a bit pompous), his lovely wife and all the other bears we encounter in the book. This is Volume 1 - I am certainly looking foward to Volume 2 and whatever further adventures befall our bear Charles!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Charles The Well Traveled Bear","review":"Charles the Well Traveled Bear...written by...Esmerelda Little Flame. Esmerelda is a sensitive and loving person, her personality coming through loudly in the portrayl of Charles the Bear.

He enlists the help of other bears to ease the burden of the mundane humans while always remaining a well hidden mystery from humans that would to put a stop to his noble pursuit. The book handles such issues as abuse, and loneliness sensitively, from a child's point of view.

Rio is not your average hustler, he has goals to escape the block that he works part time, but because of his record his job hunts never end well. Then you have Prince who can see the potential in young Rio and is secretly grooming him to take over his empire one day. Add Trinity the young lady who holds Rio heart but has her own drama at home. Even with Rio's knowledge is there really a such thing as being part time when you are involved in the streets???? This book started off very slow to me, I put it down a couple times, but once I got past the first few chapters, I was hooked and couldn't wait to see what happens with Rio and Trinity.

But when Prince's oldest son, Truck is released from prison all hell breaks loose out of jealousy.I instantly fell in love with Trinity(Rio's girlfriend), Shamel(his longtime childhood friend), Sally(his Mom) and Cutty(another one of his friends).

The bold, vivid cover is literally just scratching the surface of what is sure to become an urban classic. As Rio and Trinity are trying to make their dreams come true in the streets, those same streets threaten to tear them apart. Their love for each other is undeniable. But as we all know - the streets don't love no one! Rio and Trinity's story is one of snatched innocence, true friendship, betrayal, loyalty, and the power of love.

K'wan covered all the bases with this one, and I am most definately looking forward to his next release."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"So far, I'm feeling this K'won book best.

I have read all of K'wan's books and I must say, he just gets better. The author has jokes!!! (in this book)...There times that I laughed out loud caught by the graftiness of the author.Overall, the book was intricate in detail and characterization of misfortune in life and in the ghetto. The cover says it all about the story, but you won't guess the story as you read - don't even try. I love the way the element of surprise is written throughout this book. I recommend this book for all to read and enjoy. It's a HOT book all...get it!!"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"First, let me give dabs to K'wan. You did yo' thing, my brotha.

It grabbed my interest in the first chapter and held on to it until the end. I really connected with the main characters, Rio and Trinity, to the point where when they felt pain it felt like I could their pain. The boy K'Wan out did himself on this one. It's so many shocking parts in this books. If you read it there's gonna be a lot of \\"damns\\" and \\"did this fool just do that.\\" It was bananas!!!"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"***************************SPOILER ALERT**************************Man this book was awful. For one it was a repeat of Rio not being a punk, but being a punk was all I received from Rio.Trunk didn't like Rio and Rio said that he will at Trunk. Now from all the hate wouldn't you think that one of them would kill the other or even fight? Well no, that wasn't the case. I felt like the drama between them was just plain out STUPID.This book is called STREET DREAMS right? Okay so where in the world did the dreams come in at? The only dream that was had was by Trinity and that was about Rio being killed. WHAT?And the way it ended was just stupid. Trunk ends up in \\"jail\\" for protection, Rio killed Trinity thinking it was Baron. Once he saw that it was Trinity he then kills Baron and himself.Cutty was snitched on by Trunk. While in jail the guard ended up putting in the cell with Truck and of course he kills Truck. Now, it should have been Rio killing Truck or vice versa, being as how that had so much \\"hate/beef\\" with each other.Oh, I almost forgot...Rio's ass was getting his penis wet by everybody but Trinity. He love her so much but he cheated on her twice. And the first time he cheated he told the girl that they had to do that more often. I'm like what!The second time it was with Joyce(Trinity's so called friend). He ended up at Joyce's house, She slip's an E pill in his liquor now he's saying how drunk he is, how much the room was spinning and whatnot. But after she went down on him, all of a sudden he's able to get up and walk out. Now what type of stuff is that? Mind you before he got there he was already drunk. Him being drunk already and more drink plus an E pill on top of that he should have been on his ass.This book made no sense to me at all. I will never ever by another book from this author again. Seeing how most of the reviewer's gave this book five stars is telling me this is how he's books are. Plus after seeing all of the hood-rat novels I know I will not be buy anymore of his books. Sorry, but I pass."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"Love the characters in this book. Rio and Trinity's characters are real. Gotta love how Rio runs things.

My favorite book was The Coldest Winter ever...yes I said was...this book definetly took its place. K'wan's writing is crazy. He makes you feel like you're truly there.

Damn!!!You have out done yourself with the fine detailing displayed in Street Dreams. Now other urban writers have to ante up and sharpen their swords......I need not say anything else, you are one of the elite in this area of authorship......I would say keep up the good work but you are already doing that, your next book is right around the corner and I'm on that same block, hustling my own book.

I could not get into the girl being molested continuosly by her dad once her momma died & then the boyfriend offing him. It was too much to stomach. Too many graphic details of sexual abuse & incest. After about three quarters through I had to stop. Gave it to a co-worker who was bored & looking for something to read. I've never read another book from this author since. Too scared."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"I was getting scared for a minute there. I'm a big fan of Urban Lit but my game was off with the titles I had chosen to read in the past few months. My losing streak came to an end when I picked up \\"Street Dreams\\".In my eyes this book was a love story with the projects as the setting. Rio and Trinity are two people from the projects in love and trying hard not to let their surroundings define them. Although Rio tries to live the life of the straight and narrow, circumstances lead him to the streets. He vows to protect Trinity by any means necessary. Shamel, Rio's childhood friend, exhibits his loyalty to both Rio and Trinity to the end.This book had a good pace, the characters were fully developed. I can't say enough good things about it and could see it on the big screen if done right. Thanks again K'wan. You never disappoint."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"To me Gangsta was much more intense. Street Dreams was slower, but written better. So which one is my favorite? Both! K'wan is a great writer with cool storylines. My only problem with Street Dreams is that it had a lot of characters that didn't really make or break the story. So why were they mentioned? I hated the way Joyce's character was portrayed. The scene when she gave him the bl*^ job was straight wack! You could tell the book was written from a male's point of view. I would still have to say this book was still good. Road Dawgs is next on my list to critique."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"OH MY GOD. THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW FAST I GOT FINISHED WITH IT. IT MADE ME CRY AND IT WAS A VERY TOUCHING STORY. THEY REALLY DID HAVE ALOT OF LOVE FOR EACH OTHER. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ. AND IT IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST BOOK OUT OF THEM ALL THAT ACTUALLY MADE ME CRY. DO YA THANG K'WAN."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"Where do I start??? This book was it....K'wan is it, this book was so profound, the depth between Trinity and Rio is so real. The love between them is indescribable. The bond that these two shared with each other and with the streets was loyalty to the end.The action in this book, is raw and K'wan is a master at painting a vivid picture of that. I dont want to say to much and give it away, but this book is a must read.....I felt like I was in the book with them, thats how poignant this novel is."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"I read a lot of books and I must say that Street Dreams has become one of my top 5.

And the ending, I really didn't see that one coming."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"Without giving to much information for those that did not read this good book. The character Trinity and Rio both felt trapped in their ways of life that they were use to. Although Rio had the proper credentials behind his name; his past was haunting him. Trinity also had a goal. The only people that kept them focused were each other. \\"Street Dreams\\" is about someone with a goal to better themselves, but having someone or something trying to stop you from getting where you trying to get at."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"With some many author's glamorizing the life of a hustler it was refreshing to read Kwan's latest book Street Dreams. His characters were honest people put in difficult situations that were forced to make difficult, life altering choices. I loved the way he didn't glorify the drug game. His characters weren't flossing in expensive cars they were just surviving their day to day struggles. Which is much far more realistic image of people involved in drug dealing. This book is a MUST read for anyone who loves reading \\"realistic\\" urban fiction. And the ending is mind blowing, I'm still in shock. Excellent work Kwan you never dissapoint!"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"this was book was slow and boring. i am from harlem and a lot of his landmarks was cool but that's it. and i didn't like Trinity. she was stupid. how can a teenager let her father rape her year after year and not say nothing. i'm a teenager and i can't relate to street dreams AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"This book is what's up. I almost got fired messing with Kwan. I couldn't wait until lunch to see what was next, so I would sneak and read this book at my desk. (Yes it was that serious) The book had me glued. I loved Trinity and Rio. They are the ghetto Romeo and Juliet. The other characters were just as serious. Once things start happening in this book it never stops, which made me not want to stop reading. I did read Gangsta and Kwan is just like a fine wine that gets better with time. He is offically the man now. If you don't have this book get it. Winter is here and it's a good read."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"Street Dreams was off the hook. I am a fan of Shannon Holmes' urban fiction books and I thought that the reviews of the other authors were just because they are affiliated with Triple Crown. But I was wrong. This book is all that and some more. The next morning I was still thinking about the ending of the book. Rio and Trinity were like the 2004 Bonnie and Clyde. She was sticking with her baby through whatever!! The book is gangsta. The storyline is multi-dimentional. There are plenty of twists and turns and this is not a book that you can guess what will happen next. Kwan has outdone himself with this one. Now I have to read Road Dawgs. Good work Kwan!!"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"It ended. The book itself was good. I have to admit it took me a while to get into in the begining but i made it through.

Rio has dreams of leaving the ghetto. He has served time in prison and wants to walk the straight and narrow path, but he can't catch a break. He receives a two-year degree while being a part-time hustler, believing that life has more to offer than the ghetto. Because of his felony conviction, no one wants to hire him, so he reluctantly heeds the persuasive call of the streets.Trinity Baker has had a hard life since her mother died. She is left to be the woman of the house, left to be caretaker and provider for her little brother Billy, and left to fulfill a role a daughter should never fill for her father. She too has dreams of having more and looks to Rio to rescue her from her despair.Prince, the local drug lord, has his eye on Rio and wants to groom him to be his successor, but his oldest son Truck wants that position for himself and will stop at nothing to receive what he believes is rightfully his. Shamel and Cutty are Rios right and left hand men, but one will prove to be his best ally and the other will be his weakest link. Will Rio and Trinity make it out of the ghetto, or will they fall victim to the streets?STREET DREAMS is not for the faint of heart, it is a graphic and often gruesome depiction of the streets. K'wan really takes his readers into the street life through his characters. His novel is not predictable and you will not be able to foretell the ending. It kept me interested from beginning to end.

This is my first time reading a book by this author, but i will definitely be buying all the other ones. K'wan presents Rio who is very smart kid who's loyalty put him on the wrong track. Still he tries to do right and find an honest job, but how many criminals really find decent jobs. Tired of all the turn-downs he turns to the street but only part-time until unexpected circumstances gets himself into a situation he cant get out of. So he calls on the only person he knows that can help him. But favors dont come cheap. In the beginning being a full-time Capo for Prince seemed sweet with all the money that was rolling in finally he thought his dreams would come true and he would be able to provide a better life for him and Trinity. But of course it never works out that way. Snitches will bring down your whole empire, and the price to pay is death!!!!........EXCELLENT READ I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ONE"},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"Street Dreams was the first book I read by K'wan and it won't be the last. Rio is trying to leave the street life behind but it won't let him. He finds love in Trinity but it's destroyed when he finds out the terrible secret she's been keeping from him. Just when you think it's over, Trinity get's kidnapped and all hell breaks loose. The story ends in a way that you are unprepared for. Street Dreams is a must-read!!

I was drawn to the book in the beginning, b/c I am from Douglass projects in NYC to. But after reading the book, it was exaggerated alittle to much for me. Trust me save your money. Although Trinity and Rico was a ghetto romeo and juliet. Their love story was great. But the other gangsta stuff that was going on was wack."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"I've never read a K'wan book, after coming away from it I was very impressed with his storytelling and development of his characters. I will say after reading tons of street fictions, I can't say there were no big surprises in terms of its climactic ending. Yet again the story itself is enjoyable to keep yourself hooked and entertained."},{"Title":"Street Dreams","review":"I bought this book twice and read it about 8 times.

Drawing on resources, Dr. Fowler has writtemng in an excelelnt and easy to read prose.Dr Fowler researched extensively for this book from little known and altogether scares resources of material. However, all the resources that were available about the Buffalo Soldiers were used and cited accurately in this book. But, the MOST important plus about this book is the interesting stories about the Buffalo Soldiers daily life is told. From the dreary and wretched living conditions the soldier had to endure on a daily basis, to the evident discrimination that the African-American Buffalo Soldier had to endure, to the loyalty and bravery that the Buffalo soldier displayed from guarding a stagecoach run, laying miles of telegraph line, fighting fierce Indians, all these accounts and more are in this book.I highly recommend this book to all who enjoy a great story and documentation about the little known Buffalo Soldier, the American West and fighting the Native Americans. A Great Read!"},{"Title":"The Black Infantry in the West, 1869-1891.","review":"This book succeeds in two ways: first, and most importantly, it addresses the history of the two black infantry regiments formed in the aftermath of the Civil War during their years on the western frontier. On another level it's interesting because so much of the literature focuses on the history of the US cavalry, but Fowler's book also addresses how infantry was used in the west, obviously with a focus on these two regiments.Despite the book's short length, compared to its subject, Arlen Fowler has done a remarkable job addressing the key issues you would expect on the subject of \\"The Black Infantry in the West, 1869-1891.\\" First it provides a narrative on how the regiments were formed and then it discusses the 24th and 25th infantry regiments' duty in Texas, the Dakotas and Montana, the Indian Territory, and Arizona. Of interest is not only does Fowler include comments about the many skirmishes these soldiers fought, but also details of what life was like on the isolated western posts. Woven throughout is a history of how these black soldiers were treated by their white counterparts and Washington; essentially these regiments had to deal with all the problems other soldiers dealt with, but also had to deal with the deep set prejudices of the time. Yet despite this these regiments, like their cavalry counterparts the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, maintained some of the highest standards as reflected by having the lowest desertion and alcohol rates.At the same time Fowler addresses the issue of prejudice against these regiments head on in the last chapter, \\"The Attitude of the Army Toward the Black Infantrymen.\\" In this chapter he moves away from the regiments' narrative and focuses on the politicians and senior military leaders of the time. No surprises here; the military and political leadership of the time would have preferred to eliminate the regiments, although more enlightened heads, relatively speaking for the time, prevailed."},{"Title":"The Black Infantry in the West, 1869-1891.","review":"Brought this book as a gift for my husband. He read it in a couple days and seemed to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper's language in this novel is elegant, a product of the era in which it was written. His description of the Native American characters is also a sign of his time. He describes them at times as beautiful creatures amazingly in touch with nature, while at other times making them appear as savages. However, overall I felt the contrast was well done for he also does not always paint a perfect picture of the white settlers. The story has action but it's purpose is not necessarily to exite the reader in that way. It is more character driven and well defines the interaction between characters who come from completely different cultural backgrounds. It does have it's moments of good excitment though. A good book for those who can handle the diction and writing style of the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was a very boring book. Then, I figured if I was going to be reading this book for at least another two weeks or so, I should go ahead and pay attention to the book. I like it when they start fighting to get Cora back from Magua. It gets pretty grotesque and detailed once they start fighting. I also think this book gives you a good idea of the French and Indian War. But, I don't really like the plot to it. I think it has a little too much detail to get to the main part of some chapters. This book did not have a lot of dialogue, but it still had a little too much unnecessary detail in some parts if the book. If I read a book, I like reading biographies and mystery type books."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I can't deny the importance of this novel, but in the end this book became more and more difficult to read. Cooper is EXCEPTIONALLY wordy and has a heavy storytelling hand. I can't say it was always boring but it just became sluggish in so many spots, with events dragged out and dialogue often unfit for the characters. Some think Cooper is torturous to read and I can see why. Make sure you have a lot of patience before you start this tale. You will be rewarded though. There are many undeniably exciting action scenes, however Cooper could have made this brisker and just as valid."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The definitive tale of the American frontier in 1757, Cooper's masterwork captures the essence of this corner of American history. A vivid tale of honour, courage and love set against the backdrop of the French-British war, this book will be read and re-read for as long as people still print books"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"While this book deserves some place in history for being an early work of American fiction and it's rich descriptions of early American geography, it is intensely hard to enjoy. The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper is a narrative told in the thirdperson. It has many action, fighting scenes, and times when the characters do nothing.The story follows a group of English around the wilderness while encountering manyobstacles.The story is set during the French and Indian War in northern America. Thesetting is important because the frontier gives a sense of danger to the story. Also, thewar brings an atmosphere of kill or be killed. The characters have to be careful who theytrust.The characters in the novel are not very believable. The characters are eithertotally good or totally evil, there are none in between. Cooper provides a stereotype whenportraying the Indians. The only good Indians in this story are the Mohicans which aredying out. The rest of the Indians are portrayed as savages.Cooper's characterization is indirect. The Characters are developed throughactions, not background. When a new character is being introduced, they are describedwith out a name. Then, after they have been left out for a while, the characters arereferred to by name. This along with the fact that many characters have more than onname often causes confusion.The language of The Last of the Mohicans is very out dated. The book waswritten in the 1500s. This makes the language very difficult. Also, this time period usedmore words to explain a scene than it would today. This makes the slower scenes dragon. The action scenes move faster but still are slow going due to language.The Last of the Mohicans is a good book, although it is difficult to read.Language and Cooper's style of writing make the book difficult to read, and at timesboring. Despite this, the novel was still a good book. The book is appropriate for aperson at the college level."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I hear the word boring used often when reviewing a book. In an age where we are bombarded with so much sensory stimulation of all kinds, reading classic literature can seem rather dull. The key is to put the book in the context in which it was written and avoid critiquing it to death. Read this book with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper's Prose at times seems designed to hide his meaning from the reader. It is florid, overblown, and full of circumlocution.Some of the plot twists can only be described as bone-headed. Two examples: The protagonists engage in a song fest while trying to hide in woods crawling with hostile Indians. They search for a fort by following the rut plowed by a cannonball.Notwithstanding its flaws, &quot;Mohicans&quot; is an engaging tale about remarkable people whom the reader comes to care about.In the Leatherstocking Saga, Cooper anticipates Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan stories. Both Tarzan and Hawk-eye are noble men from &quot;civilized&quot; stock thriving in a wilderness among &quot;savages.&quot; Cooper and Burroughs both do violence to the English language, both write contrived plots with improbable twists, but both nevertheless spin tales of wondrous adventure.One scarcely noted aspect of the story is the undercurrent of racism and tribalism that permeates the tale. Every Indian tribe seems to hate every other tribe; whites hate Indians; Indians hate whites; and so on ad nauseum.Magua tells Cora he hates her because she is white like the man who sold him whiskey and caused him to disgrace himself. Cora defends herself: &quot;And am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose shade of countenance may resemble mine?&quot; Ironically, Cora, on her mother's side, is &quot;descended ... from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administer the wants of a luxurious people.&quot;When Munro accuses Heyward of preferring his (Munro's) daughter Alice to her half-sister Cora because of Cora's Black ancestry, Heyward replies: &quot;Heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!&quot; No sooner does he express this noble sentiment than he shows great relief to learn that Alice's mother is Scottish on both sides of her family.Then there is the trans-racial partnership between Hawk-eye and Chingachgook, in which some critics see the prototype for the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover partnership in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series. And finally there is the trans-racial love between Cora and Uncas.The story, although a swashbuckling adventure, has a distinct subplot of racial prejudice. We see the characters nobly overcoming it at times but basely succumbing to it at others."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I thought the Last of the Mohicans was a good book and a bad book. I thought it was agood book because of all the suspense throughtout the book. I also liked the book because of how James Cooper described the characters and there surroundings.I didn't like the book because of how James Cooper phrased things. If you don't read well it would be hard to understand. If you were going to read the Last of the Mohicans you would want to have a old dictionary with you to understand some of the words. One more good thing is that he uses no profanity in this book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I'm a junior in high school and recently read lotm for an advanced english 3 class. I found it some what wordy and very drawn out. Some where buried underneath a mound of words that I struggled to understand was an interesting and historical plot. I really liked the plot and time setting, but I don't think Cooper's style of writing was intended for my generation. I would definately mention the reading of this book to an adult who appreciates american classics, but I wouldn't even admitt reading it to a younger person."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I am a High School student and have read &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans&#8221; for my American Studies Class. We just finished studying the Native Nations and I have read a few articles on the Native Americans. The Last of the Mohicans, written by James Fenimore Cooper, is the paramount of American Literature. Unlike other books of its time, it ignores the stereotypes and common misconceptions of the Native Americans, concentrating only on reality. Throughout the book Cooper outlines his views on race, love and hatred between individuals from different groups within the American society of that time.The story is set in the French and Indian War. The two daughters of Colonel Munro set off into the wilderness to meet their father in Fort William Henry. They are accompanied by Major Heyward, and are guided by Magua, an Indian. They meet the scout Hawkeye and his companions Chingachgook and Uncas in the forest. The last of the Mohicans is about the treachery, loyalty, challenges, and allegiances that this group encounters during this perilous journey through the wilderness.This book might be a challenge for many readers, since the language used is not common in present-day literature. However once the reader overcomes this barrier, the true power and complexity of this story reveals itself. Cooper does not label Indians as savages in this story; instead, he shows the honorable side of them, such as the bravery and determination of Uncas, or the wit and intelligence of Chingachgook. He also presented the interaction between races, for example the doomed relationship between Uncas and Cora. Cooper&#8217;s writing style is extremely detailed and vivid. His description of fighting scenes and the emotions of individuals lets the reader experience the incident as if they were watching the event personally.The Last of the Mohicans is an extremely well written master piece by James Fenimore Cooper. In the book Cooper illustrates the greatness of Native Americans. He also outlines his views on race, love and hatred between certain groups of individuals during the French and Indian War. This book is great for people interested in understanding Native American culture, but be prepared for a fairly challenging read."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Since there are already over 100 reviews of this book and probably thousands have been written over the years, I'll do this one without benefit of book in hand, from memory and without a lot of details. It took me many years to get over the antiquated language barrier and to finally read the book. The classics are always harder to read than contemporary fiction, but sometimes it's worth the effort.What tipped the scales for me and piqued my curiosity was watching the recent movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, and Eric Schweig, and realizing that this was a good story. Also, I'm very familiar with the setting in upstate NY: Lake George, Balston Spa, Glenns Falls, Scroon Lake, and surrounding area--at least as it is now, and it was fun imagining what it would have been like in those days, when the land was virgin, settlers could lose their scalps if they weren't careful, and the France contested with Britain for supremacy of the land.The book wasn't a romance--at least not in the modern sense of the word--with love scenes and the like. But it was a romance in the old sense in that the three main characters; Hawk-eye, and the two Mohicans, were larger than life heroes; in the moral, physical, and spiritual meanings of the term. The elder sister Cora was also a well developed, strong willed and heroic character, which surprised me a little considering the age in which the book was written.For me the most interesting character of the novel was Chingachgook's son, Uncas, who was the \\"last of the Mohicans,\\" a noble race of American Indians, which formerly occupied the lands by the \\"salt lake,\\" (i.e., the Atlantic Ocean), and were dispossessed and robbed of their lands and heritage by the original Dutch settlers and others. Uncas was a tracker extraordinaire, even better than the indomitable Hawk-eye in this respect. But he was young, inexperienced, and impetuous, which was eventually his undoing when he came up against the evil, and formidable Magua. But before he died, he was recognized as a king or great chief of his people, an heir apparent. So decreed the venerable Tamenund, a 100 year old patriarch and judge of the Delaware peoples, a related tribe to the Mohicans. This episode would have been difficult to write into an action movie, but it would have been great if it had been.Another interesting character completely eliminated from both the 1934 and 1992 movies was David Gamut, a preacher psalmist, whose moral presence and as a comic relief, was an integral part of the novel.All in all, this is still a book worth reading, if only to get a glimse of the way things were then and might be again."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Nathanial Bumppo, otherwise known as Leatherstocking, Deerslayer, and Long Rifle, is without a doubt the quintessential American version of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan. To be sure, Cooper's frontier character saw print long before Burrough's creation did in 1912. This in no way invalidates the creation of ERB, but it does give more literary impact to a wholly American character who appears in what can only be defined, if one is truthful, as wholly flawed novels.The five novels which feature Bumppo were written by Cooper out of sequence. This doesn't necessarily impair the fictive underpinnings of the stories themselves, but it does give rise to certain elements which writhe like a murky thread throughout the main arc.We will, as expected, consider the best known, at least as far as the general public goes, work of Cooper, that being \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and examine just what makes this novel tick, and why you should read it.Cooper believed that Indian culture must needs be crushed by the Anglo Saxon wheels of religion and technology. He saw no other way around this inevitability. Though he wasn't himself racist by the definitions which we adhere to today, he did have certain beliefs of superiority of his own culture which \\"dark-skinned\\" individuals had to bow down to. \\"Mohicans\\", with its poignant idea that there will come a time the \\"last\\" of this noble race will pass from the ken of men (that is to say the ken of White Men), has through this very self-same literary device carved for itself a spot of prominence withing American literature.Not everyone liked Cooper's work. He was always viewed much more favorably in Europe than by home-grown American authors. Mark Twain famously savaged Cooper's work and the savagery resonates even to this day. Yet, something about the novels, especially \\"Mohicans\\" endures. Perhaps it is the idea of a race of men passing, the thread of virgin forests and pure lakes, the savagery of life on the frontier, the fog of war, the blood-curdling violence. Whatever the reason for its longevity, and Twain notwithstanding, this book endures. Thank God.As one might expect there is very little of this book that is recognizable in the 1992 film remake of the same name. In fact, the film stole much of the story line which was rewritten in the 1920 silent film. In the modern film Hawk-eye, at the height of his powers, is taciturn to a fault but still capable of a normal sexual relationship. In the novel Natty Bumppo is not only naive sexually, he won't shut up, period. He discourses on everything, even to the halt of the action being described around him. Leaning on his rifle he has no problem detailing, to exhaustion, his opinion on events around him.Another big difference, aside from the often awkward descriptions, stereotypes of women and just plain ignorance of Native American ethnicities, is the fact a major character dies in the novel yet is allowed to survive in film. I suppose this would come as a shock to someone who saw the movie first, but there it is. Cooper has no problem dispatching that which, if allowed to live, would intercede in the future life of Hawk-eye. Natty Bumppo must remain pure. He must be allowed to view and accept nature as a powerful motivation than the love of another human being. It is his past, it is his destiny. He is akin to the figure of Greek tragedy in this way. He has a duty to perform and he will accomplish it, but he himself cannot lose the connection he has to the pristine land he loves and calls home.I highly recommend this book, though the new reader must approach it with a few caveats and not a little caution. Cooper is simply not that great a writer. I am not the first to say that nor will I be the last. Many of the passages go on far too long and the long-winded philosophies of Bumppo grate. Nevertheless, there is power here, along with pathos, grandeur, and yes, love -- though it's love on Bumppo's, and Cooper's, own terms.Despite its many flaws this is a major American novel by any definition. If you like adventure, and don't mind a little (okay, a lot) lagging, I think you will enjoy reading \\"The Last of the Mohicans.\\""},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper is recognized as the father of American literature and for firmly placing America at the forefront of the literary world.His classic tale takes place in New York state in the late 1700's set against the backdrop of it's beautiful idyllic terrain which he so vividly describes and contrasts with the complex conflicts erupting within it.French against English. Indians against English. Indians against Indians.The story has a simple plot consisting of a repetition of capture and escape with frequent role reversals punctuated by brief reprieves serving to build tension.Although truly an action story, complete with a mythic hero ( Hawkeye ) who will serve as the foundation for the modern day cowboy, the tale touches on deeper issues in a subtle way.The friction of interracial amour is personified in Uncas and Cora. Their demise perhaps reflecting the authors views on transcultural relationships.The stereotyping of blonde women is brought into sharp focus in Alice's helplessness which seems never to leave her. Her character undergoes little development beyond a cardboard cutout set on a richly detailed stage adding to the effect. In contrast the dark haired Cora is seen to be a courageous practical woman embodying the frontierswoman.The struggle between civilization and savagery in the frontier is continually brought out in the conflicts with Magua, although Cooper is careful to balance his character avoiding simple dichotomous categorization into evil and good . Magua is cruel spiteful and villainous from the protagonist's perspective yet we are allowed access to Magua's thoughts and realize he wishes to live a good life in his own way and earn the respect of his people. His unslaked vengeance is his ultimate downfall.I wasnt particularly fond of the movie which is two dimensional ( literally and figuratively ) and strongly suggest reading the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"My initial reaction to the novel The Last of the Mohicans was, \\"wow! I am reading one of the greatest classic novels ever written.\\" When I began to read, my expectations were high, but were quickly extinguished by what I read. From what I understood, the book was quite exciting, but very wordy. It seemed to make me think very hard; perhaps harder than what I care to when I am reading. I do, however, think the book lived up to its reputation as a classic.In the book, Major Duncan Heyward is ordered to lead the Monro sisters, Cora and Alice, from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry where their father is stationed during the French and Indian War. An Indian named Magua who is supposed to know shortcut to Fort William Henry leads the group.During their travels, they come across a woodsman named Hawkeye who is accompanied by a Mohican named Chingachgook. Hawkeye explains to Duncan that Chingachgook is the last of the Mohicans.Duncan quickly explains that their guide, Magua, has become lost and cannot show them the way to Fort William Henry. Hawkeye asks Duncan of his guide's Indian background and is outraged when he learns that Magua is of the Huron tribe. Magua over hears the conversation and slips away into the forest unnoticed. He now knows that his plan to lead the group into a trap is foiled.Hawkeye, Chingachgook, and Uncas agree to lead the small group to Fort William Henry since they sense the group is in danger of being attacked by the Huron Indian tribe. The group spends the night in a cave behind a waterfall but is found by the Huron Indians. The group is attacked and Cora convinces Hawkeye and the two Mohicans to escape by swimming underwater downriver.The group is captured, and Magua leads Cora and Alice deep in the forest. He tells them of his plan to marry Cora as part of his revenge on Colonel Monro. Colonel Monro ordered Magua publicly beaten after getting drunk and not handling himself properly.Cora refused to marry Magua. This angered him greatly and was about to kill the whole group, when Hawkeye and the Mohicans rushed in to the camp, killing all the Hurons except Magua.At dawn the next day, the group drew near Fort William Henry. As they closed in, they realized that the fort was under attack by French troops and Iroquois Indians. The group moved slowly to the fort and entered uninjured, reuniting the girls with their father.I thought James Fenimore Cooper's book is an exciting, borderline thriller. What you just read is a small sample of what the book has in store for you. The best parts are yet to come. You just have to read the book to understand what I am talking about. The setting, plot, and the characters make it seem like it was a real true story that keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.I loved the story, but sometimes, it seemed so hard to get to the point Mr. Cooper was trying to make. His use of multiple adjectives to describe absolutely everything was quite repetitive and bothersome. I think the book would have been fifty pages shorter if he would have just got right down to the point instead of over describing the simplest of things.All of the characters in the book are quite realistic. They all seem as though they lived the time period instead of just being part of the author's imagination. The whole story is believable and realistic. I loved the book.I would recommend the book to anyone who likes this type of novel. I would even recommend this book to people who are not overly impressed by the time period, setting or plot. It is a great classic novel and it did not get to be that way by being terrible. It is complicated reading but very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Having seen and enjoyed Last of the Mohicans movies, I knew I wanted to read the novel someday. The book, as many have noted, is challenging due to its wordy old English style, the many different characters, places and events, often referred to by different names, etc. But, if you just go with it and get the gist, and not worry about not understanding some words or phrases, it is a thoroughly engrossing read. As much as I loved the great Daniel Day Lewis LotM movie, it is only loosely related to the book. More like pieces/scenes from the book are recreated, but following a very different screenplay. For example: there is no love story, at all, between Hawkeye and Cora (and no cheesy, \\"Stay alive- I will find you!!!\\"). No murder of Munro by Magua. Duncan actually loves Alice, who both survive, while Cora is brutally murdered by Magua. And so on. While reading the book I was very aware that it would be almost impossible to make a coherent movie following the book. And, as is always true, the book provides so much more interesting detail than can be covered in a 2-3 hour movie. For example, the description of how Chingotchgook, Uncas and Hawkeye became separated from their tribe many years before, and then are emotionally reunited with their descendant tribe-a turtle tattoo figures prominently (read the book!:)- is very touching and deep. I would have loved to have seen that, somehow, in the movie.If you like early American history, Native American history at the time of the revolution, etc. this original novel of the genre is a must read. Just know that there will be sections that are kind of hard to follow. The book, despite its age and flaws, is emotionally powerful and thrilling."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This is a flat-out great book. A classic of American adventure, it holds its own today. Granted, you have to settle into the writing style, but once you do you are invested in an adventure that is well worth the time and attention it requires."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"As a young reader who in the past had not been able to experience the glory of James Fenimore Cooper's writing, I was immensely impressed with his amazing depictions of the scenes. Armed with the biased view of the first inhabitants of this country developed through study in school, my view of the ancestors of this land changed dramatically with each page of this book. The character of Uncas, the young warrior of the Mohican race, captured my heart and I followed his tracks through the book breathlessly. I had endless confidence in the scout Hawkeye and the father of Uncas, Chingachgook. Duncan and David forever added to the flavor of the book. Every character will take on life and dance about the plot, thickening it and twirling through the words chosen by the great author Cooper. Each time I thought that I knew what would happen next, a twist would hit me unexpectedly and cause me to commend the author once again. The trials of the beautiful sisters, the fatal accuracy of &quot;Killdeer,&quot; the calm resolution of Indian warriors, and the treachery of the Huron Magua will force you to continue reading. To miss out on the unforgettable journey James Fenimore Cooper takes you through in The Last of the Mohicans would only be your loss. This classic piece of literature will not fail to enthrall you and will take your mind through a torrent of emotions invoked by the unrivaled story-telling ability of one who is called the first great American author. Grounded in the resolution of nobility, the steadfastness of a warrior, and the basis of revenge, I guarantee that this book will take hold of your senses and not let go until you've read every last word. For your own sake, give yourself a treat and grant Cooper yet another reader."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Any book illustrated by N.C. Wyeth is worth having.

And while I'm glad I did, it must be stated matter-of-factly that James Fenimore Cooper's writing style is not very kind to the reader. He tended to write some long-winded passages and descriptions, with sometimes a little too much detail, and his use of multiple names for the same character became annoying after a while. \\"Hawkeye,\\" one of the main characters in the story, might also be called \\"the scout,\\" \\"the Long Rifle,\\" \\"pale-face\\" and some other names, all in the same paragraph! And Cooper did this with many of his characters. It's not the most effective story-telling device.As for the story itself, I liked it very much. Set in 1757, during the Seven Years' War in America (or the French and Indian War, as it is also known), it follows the fortunes of a group of misfits caught up in the struggles between the British and French empires, as well as various Native American tribes. Strongest among these characters is Hawkeye, a white man who has nevertheless shunned living the \\"civilized life,\\" and instead lives off the land, like the Native Americans. Indeed, some of his closest friends are Mohicans, probably a novel concept when this book was written in the 1820s. Whenever I was reading about Hawkeye, I couldn't help thinking of the \\"real\\" early pioneer heroes Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett; his actions and deeds evoked images of a coonskin-capped hero \\"saving the day\\" time and again, whenever duty called. Finally, although I will not mention the ending of the story, I will say it did not have the typical \\"Hollywood Ending,\\" which, frankly, I was expecting. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Cooper did not fall prey to the \\"feel-good\\" story.It was for these reasons that I give this a favorable rating, despite the random difficulties with Cooper's writing style. \\"Mohicans\\" is worth your time, but be aware you must also be patient; for long stretches this is not a page-turner.Four stars."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Have you ever seen a movie and wondered if the book it was based on was as good as the movie? Well, that's pretty much why I read \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" by James Fenimore Cooper.This novel is a classic, true; but it is written in the overly turgid, stilted language that was popular at the time it was first released, and may be somewhat burdensome to contemporary readers.Need an example? Here, try to decipher this: \\"At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the former raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this matter, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and diminishings of the stature as baffled every conjecture that might be made as to his dimensions.\\" That sentence, from Chapter II, describes the character David Gamut, a psalmodist, as he rode a horse, attempting to catch up with the party of Cora and Alice Munro. No, he was not featured in the movie, at least not in the 1992 version which starred Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Wes Studi. And if you want to know what a psalmodist was, you'll just have to read the book (or look it up). Gamut was actually one of my favorite characters, and the source of most of the humor contained in the text.In fact, the novel, first published in 1826, is a good bit different in plot and characters from the 1992 film. It has been noted elsewhere that the 1992 film was based heavily on an earlier film released in 1936, and not so much on the book. Most movie critics which I have read found the film to be more entertaining than the book.As an exercise in reading an American classic, however, the book is worth the time it takes to read it. Although the language is, at times, difficult to follow, it does give the reader an appreciation of what our ancestors found to be \\"can't-put-it-down\\" reading. The book is also a window, of sorts, through which we may look to a time in our nation's earliest years. Although it may be subject to some historical criticism, it is at least a popular (at the time) rendition of how American culture viewed its recent conflicts with the French and Native Americans.If you have to read this book as a school assignment, you should not watch the movie (any of them) first. Your appreciation of the book will be keener for waiting on the film, and you will enjoy the film more for the waiting.Note: This review was originally posted to the Penguin Classics edition of this work, but for some reason, the review did not include the correct title. I have reposted to this edition in order that my review might be more helpful (can't help if can't be found). The Penguin Popular Classics version included an informative forward and footnotes which helped in putting this novel into somewhat better context.As a final note, the fictional Chingachgook was not actually the \\"last of the Mohicans.\\" There are Mohican bands in existence today, and the Tribe is federally recognized. Chingachgook can more accurately be characterized as the last in an old line of Mohican nobility, as envisioned by the author."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Once you read this it is with you forever.

Strong characters with good basis of historical fact mixed in, well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"\\"The Last of The Mohicans\\" is the second in the Leatherstocking series by America's first professional novelist, James Fenimore Cooper. Set in upstate New York during the French and Indian War, it introduces the reader to the Eighteenth Century world inhabited by settlers and Indians. This work contains both continuations and similarities to \\"The Deerlsayer\\" (see my Amazon reivew). The Deerlsayer is now known as Hawkeye and seems to be more a man of action and less a man of words. Chingachgook remains his loyal friend, although the Indian nature is more presented by his son, Unca. As in \\"Deerslayer\\", much of the story revolves around two sisters, in this case Cora and Alice, who are making their way in the wilderness with the aid of their companions. Like in \\"Deerlsayer\\" the saga finds its action in war and chase scenes involving American settlers and their Indian allies against Indians opposed to them. This series is rare among early American literature in that the Indians display characters of their own. A bit of comedy is introduced into the narrative by the character of David Gamut, the professional psalmodist who, despite having gifts so ill-suited to the environment of the story, still manages to play a helpful role in the conflict running throughout the book.I read this for \\"mood setting\\" during a trip to Cooperstown and other areas in which the book is set and in which the author lived. I was also interested in a familiarity with this classic of American literature. As a reader of my Amazon reviews is aware, I tend much more toward history than to novels and, generally, enjoy them much more. That being said, this novel is a keeper. It is an enjoyable and edifying read, even if classical novels are not your forte."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I never really had any intention of ever reading this booking, having assumed that it was romanticized nonesense, but after watching the movie, and, for some reason, enjoying it, I decided that the time had come: I had to read the book.So I did. At first, I'll admit, the going was a little slow, as the writing is somewhat fanciful and the dialogue stilted, but this awkwardness became less of an issue the more I became enthralled by the story.Having seen the movie in advance, it was interesting to see how much the movie had in fact diverged from the story. Actually, aside from many of the characters, the setting, and the general premise of the story, the movie is quite different from the book. So much so, that it is safe to say that the movie has totally failed to capture the true spirit of the novel, and is little more than the typical Hollywood historical romance. The most unfortunate aspect of the movie, however, is how the &quot;patriotic&quot; element was incorporated--this is simply not in the book. I do have to say that the movie in its own right is good, but it utterly fails as an adaptation.The is no doubt that Last of the Mohicans is a classic. It is a book that I know will be reread a number of times before my time comes, and I'm sure with each reading, new meaning and insight will be found in its pages."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I read The Last of the Mohicans for my English class. I found the first few chapters difficult to read, but as the book progressed I became accustomed to the 1800s style of writing. Once used to Cooper's writing, I cruised through the book with keen interest. Survival in the forest with hostile Indians is the idea, fighting through a few skirmishes. I am impressed with the skills Cooper bestows his characters, and enjoy learning of the Indians. The characters become well-known as reading progresses, and near the end of the novel I knew I had chosen a good book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting writing style and a good outdoor adventure. The only bad part in the book is in the end, which I wouldn't be mean enough to relate as of yet. Stick with the first few chapters, and surely you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book is wonderful. The movie is equally wonderful. This is one of the rare cases when a movie and a book are BOTH enjoyable. If you enjoyed the movie, then reading the book is a necessity.The movie portrays an entirely different main character than does the book, and it is important to understand that Old Leather Stockings is a man the age of 70. The Last of the Mohicans is the last story in a collection of tales, and if one loses sight of that, then all is lost.This story is a wonderful tale about love and war--two of human natures most powerful forces. We are led on a sad journey where a man's seed dies with him, and the impact that has on the psyche.I loved this book, and could not stop reading it. Perhaps it takes a more mature eye to understand and/or appreciate the meaning in this novel. I also am a major in English, and I feel that this book has more to offer than meets the eye, you need only have the key to open the treasure chest."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"If familiarity does indeed breed contempt, then perhaps that explains why my opinion of Cooper's most famous novel has weakened over time. I recently reread the book after an interval of many years; not only was I disappointed (and somewhat bored), but I realized that it has become my least favorite of the five Leatherstocking novels.In \\"Last of the Mohicans,\\" Cooper aimed brazenly for a melodramatic adventure story in the Romantic tradition of the novels of Walter Scott. Reading it as an adult, the farcical caricatures that delighted me as a boy made me cringe at times, almost with embarrassment. (In particular, the psalmist named David Gamut is Cooper's Jar Jar Binks.) And the overwrought dialogue can be cumbersome and even unintentionally comical; only Natty (\\"Hawk-eye\\") Bumppo would deliver a 300-word speech to hush his compatriots in order to avoid the imminent risk of a possible ambush.Several things save the novel from its maudlin prose, and they alone justify its status as a \\"classic.\\" First is the unexpected depth of the portrayal of Cora. By modern standards, her character is stereotypically feminine, but she is a pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception of the era. A second aspect is the unhesitant and (for its time) graphic horror with which Cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat; the shocking episode that opens the massacre of the garrison still has the ability to give me nightmares. And, finally, there is Cooper's decidedly \\"unromantic\\" willingness to surprise the reader by killing off major characters with startling (and believable) twists in the plot. Set aside the cartoonish characters, the overstylized prose, the speechifying dialogue--the story alone is worth the read.So it's not a bad book by any means, and opinions will depend on taste. I prefer the character-driven narratives and the almost pastoral mood of \\"The Pioneers\\" or \\"The Prairie,\\" which at times seem to anticipate the survivalist novels of Willa Cather. For those who prefer the swashbuckling action of \\"Ivanhoe,\\" however, this is the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters, themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.As historical fiction, this is very accurate. And though the Indians are generally depicted,at their worst, as inhuman savages, and, at their best, as surprisingly bright and sensitive savages, for the time in which it was written, it was probably rather daring, and the most one could expect toward bridging the gap between the races.I would definitely recommend that those who think of this as one of those classics they were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I do not know if I have too much to add to the outstanding reviews of this book on 'Amazon'. by Peter Reeve and B. Mirsky.However my thought is about the mythic element of the story, the creation of the type of the American hero, strong and silent, and of the 'noble savage.'What most effected me was the story of the noble savage, of Uncas, of the 'Last of the Mohicans' of the individual's dying meaning the dying of a people . In one sense this perhaps symbolizes the triumph of 'civilization'. But in another it suggests a great crime and loss.Cooper as Mark Twain perhaps too hilariously taught us writes awkwardly. But he also has a kind of strength of invention, a freshness of beginning. And that perhaps draws readers to these works in spite of their stylistic and literary defects."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I first read The Last of the Mohicans in 1973 and have reread it periodically over the years. Although Mark Twain is often given credit for being the first quintessential American author, I would vote for James Fenimore Cooper. This is a magnificent book that captures the ruggedness of the American wilderness and creates the American Hero, Hawkeye- the loner who rejects the institutions and the relationships that most men need and who stand alone for what is right. This motif has been picked up in countless American heros ranging from Hammetts Sam Spade to John Wayne.Although written in a style that may be difficult for the contemporary reader to grasp, it is, nevertheless, a beautifully written novel. Cooper has a way of describing the savage beauty of the American wilderness that is unequaled in literature. An example of this is his description of the forest swallowing up the European armies only to spit them out in ragged pieces- armies larger than those that often dispose of the scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these forest, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat. Raised in western Oregon and spending much of my youth in the Oregon wilderness, I know exactly what Cooper describes. There is a terrible beauty about the wilderness that both invites and destroys. It is a beauty that draws on into its inner recesses can quickly turn into terror as the weather turns foul, ones sense of direction is lost and the forest seems to close in around one fights off the feeling of terror and loneliness. It gives an rush that city folks cannot even imagine.The story is set in the geo-political struggle between the France and England for control of colonial empires both in the Americans and India. It is a story of savagery, slaughter, betrayal and courage. Of course, this book would offend the sensibilities of politically correct. Yes, Indians are describes as savages and yes, they massacre innocent women and children. Yes, Europeans get better press; but Cooper, like Melville, addresses the race issue. Hero's and villains are been on both sides of the conflict. This is a great book and should be on your must read list of American literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"It's hard to imagine that this novel was written over a hundred years ago, because its daring message of anti-imperialism and its detailed and sensitive study of the Native American culture. Apparently, a hundred years later, the interracial romance was still too taboo for Hollywood, so this theme was white-washed. The movie also reduced the complex Indian characters to cardboard cartoons. Read the original literary masterpiece when your brain is active, and watch the movie when your brain is near-dead."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which has become the archetypical protagonist in our own American westerns. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's own words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. -- Stuart W.

Cooper's writing style is so difficult to read and there were many times that I would read and reread sections and still have no idea what Cooper was trying to say. However, I was basically able to follow the plot, and even though the book is way too long, the story is really good.I saw the movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and was completely disgusted. Cooper's book deserved so much better than it got in that movie. I can understand the movie-makers wanting to have Hawkeye be a hunky young man instead of a middle-aged man who has a tendency to talk all the time, but come on, couldn't they have stayed more true to the basic plot of the book than they did? All that crap about the Colonial Militia and Hawkeye being imprisoned for helping some of the colonists escape the fort was just irritating and stupid."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist.

It stands up well in its non-Indian history of the French and Indian War. However, on the Indian side Cooper tends to get his nations a little mixed up. Also, it is important to point out that the Mohicans today are a federally recognized tribe, so the title is, shall we say, a little misleading. And, of course, the major criticism from those of us who have studied American Indian history is the creation of that seemingly invincible stereotype--The Noble Savage.However, novels must be read in the context of their times and with regard for what the author meant to achieve. In this case Cooper wanted to write a truly American novel as opposed to the English novels so popular at the time, and in that sense I think he succeeded.In this edition, the N.C.Wyeth illustrations were a real asset. I wish we could go back to the days when books were beautifully bound and contained artistically rendered illustrations. It really adds to the total reading experience.If you are one of those who simply remembers this as a classic you were forced to read in school, give it a second try.

If you want your children to experience a classic classic, this is one!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This review pertains to the Penguin Classic edition, which has a fascinating introductory essay by Professor Richard Slatkin. But I would save the essay for last; it's so pedagogic in nature, it almost strips Cooper's French & Indian War masterpiece of the fundamental magnetism that has drawn countless readers to it for over 150 years.For this reader, that \\"magnetism\\" is the sheer awe-inspiring beauty and terror of the North American primal forest. Slatkin's essay is rather bloodless, but I can assure you that this novel is not. And the idea of constantly running and hiding from an archetypical villain, like Magua, and his band of warrior Hurons, who feel quite comfortable with the act of cleaving one's skull with a hatchet, is quite unsettling.Of course, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is not a depiction of Native Americans through the lens of 21st Century sensibilities. Unquestionably, the modern day reader should be at least a little horrified at the near extinction of the Native American population. But no matter how sensitive one is about their tragic, inexorable decline, it is still an unalterable fact that -- under the alliance they entered into with the French -- several Eastern tribes struck abject terror into the hearts of 18th Century British Colonials. (May I suggest a casual inquiry into the colonial history of Deerfield, Massachusetts? The hatchet marks can still be seen on the wooden doors.)The setting for \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the great waterway formed by Lake Champlain, Lake George and the Hudson River. The last glacial retreat laid down a perfect invasion route for the French moving south from Quebec, or the British moving north from Albany. That is why the area is studded with old colonial forts at strategic choke points. It is on the way to Ft. William Henry that the heroines, Cora and Alice Munro, are betrayed by Magua, who was charged with guiding the defenseless daughters to their beloved father -- an old Scottish warhorse, who serves as commander of the fort. How the daughters are captured, escape, nearly massacred and recaptured occupy the first half of the book. Their eventual rescue forms the second half.Cooper's action-packed narrative is an artful blend of history and fiction. There was, indeed, a siege of Ft. William Henry by the French General, the Marquis de Montcalm. And there was some sort of trouble with Montcalm's Indian allies, but there is now serious doubt about a full-scale massacre of the fort's inhabitants. Indeed, Cooper has been criticized for botching numerous historical facts, but the \\"massacre myth\\" cannot be laid solely at his door. No less than the preeminent American historian, Francis Parkman, devoted several pages to the supposed incident.What is outright fiction is Cooper's heroic protagonist, Hawk-eye. He is the central character throughout Cooper's 5-book Leatherstocking Series of which \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the second installment. Hawk-eye (better known as \\"Natty Bumppo\\" in the other 4 volumes) is one of the most enduring figures in all of American Literature. The honest-speaking, self-reliant, nature-loving, chaste woodsman/warrior is indelibly etched in our national psyche. It's no exaggeration to say he has influenced generations of Americans. Surely our military has taken to the man -- the Hawkeye missile is just one explicit manifestation.Juxtaposed to Hawk-eye is the Huron Chieftain, Magua, who wreaks havoc on everyone, including himself. Trust me -- he's not the sort of fellow you'd want over for a weekend barbecue. His descent into darkness began with a fondness for the bottle, which led to the expulsion from his own tribe. And his kidnapping of Colonel Munro's daughters stems from a humiliating whipping ordered by their father. Magua lives in the obscure half-world betwixt the tribe that abandoned him and the British Army that he betrayed.Cooper has seemingly placed Hawk-eye and Magua at opposite ends on the continuum of good and evil. But perhaps they are not quite that far apart. There's something a bit unsettling about the heroic Hawk-eye. Like Magua, he occupies a strange middle ground, shunning white civilization (into which he was born), but hardly embracing Native American culture (with the exception of his friendship with Chingachgook and his son, Uncas.) And while I would not lable Hawk-eye an outright racist, he does ridicule and dehumanize his Indian foes. And as for exterminating them, he has no scruple about that. He'd shoot every one of them given the chance.Say this for Magua -- he is no racist. He offers his wigwam (albeit in forced circumstances) to Colonel Munro's eldest daughter, Cora, whose dark hair and dusky complexion are traceable to her Caribbean slave ancestry. As Slatkin points out in his essay, the commingling of their blood would unite the three great races of our nation's history. Such an amalgamation is unthinkable to Hawk-eye. In the final scene of the book, Colonel Monroe asks Hawk-eye to translate for the Delaware maidens the hope that one day all of God's children, regardless of color, will assemble around his throne. What is Hawk-eye's response? \\"To tell them this, would be to tell them that the snows come not in winter...\\"Perhaps Hawk-eye's response is his cold calculus that our country could never become part white/part red, and that the latter must inevitably fade away. Magua understands this all too well. Native Americans are playing a losing hand, especially when they end up fighting one another. Afterall, notwithstanding the honor of saving Cora and Alice, what's really in it for Hawk-eye's Mohican allies in their battle with the Hurons? In a word, extinction. In some ways, Magua is spiritually akin to the real-life Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawa Nation, who asked his tribesmen if they knew what happened to the Great Narragansett? I'll tell the reader. More than one hundred years before Cooper's haunting tale, the Puritans exterminated the Rhode Island tribe, and the Iroquois hunted down the few ragged survivors."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The Last of the Mohicans takes place during the French and Indian War, and it covers the fall of Ft. William Henry in 1757 to the French. In the vast woods travel Chingachgook, his son Uncas, and Hawkeye, a white man who is more comfortable with Indians. Chingachgook and Uncas are the last of the Mohicans, an Indian tribe. Although Hawkeye's niche is clearly with the Mohicans, he constantly asserts throughout the book that he is white and does not have Indian blood.One day, this group meets with travelers heading to the fort. In this group are Cora and Alice Munro, Major Duncan Heyward, their Indian guide Magua, and later a minstrel named David Gamut. The girls want to meet with their father, British Colonel Munro at the fort. Magua has deliberately led them astray, but when confronted, he escapes. Magua is a Huron whose loyalities lie with the French, and he harbors deep resentment to Colonel Munro. The group arrives at the fort, but the fort falls to the French. The French and British have terms of peace, but the Indian allies of the French do not heed these terms, causing much bloodshed. Alice, Cora, and Gamut are captured, and the rest of the book covers the wild \\"rescue\\" of these three. Action and adventure depict the wild frontier, and there are also hints of love. Heyward and Alice are kind but \\"delicate\\" while Uncas and Cora are bold and courageous.Great book. The plot moves quickly, although sometimes it is a little stagnant. However, the need to know what happens next drives the reader to continue reading. In addition, Cooper does a good job describing each character. One can imagine courageous Hawkeye standing there on the hills, a white man in deerskin, with his rifle, or the laconic but admirable Uncas emanating with courage and skill. Cooper describes the setting well--the wild frontier, complete with the sound effects of nature. The Indian skirmishes are described graphically, which is all the better for forming mental images.Although this book is wonderful, I do have some complaints. In the beginning, there are long footnotes, and they distracted me. Also, there is some conversation in French but no translation! As one person pointed out, yes, a lot of characters have more than one name in the book. For example, Major Heyward is called Heyward, Duncan (his first name), the major, etc... It is not bad for Heyward, but for others, it can get a little confusing, especially in dialogue, if there are just titles (ie: \\"the Indian\\", \\"the latter,\\" \\"the scout\\"). Also, there are tons of Indian tribes mentioned--Mohawk, Delawares, Huron, Mingo, Yengeese, Maquas--some of them are one in the same, but especially in the earlier parts, it can be hard to discern who's who.I am glad I picked up The Last of the Mohicans. I am impressed by the first great American novelist, James Fenimore Cooper, and he deserves that title 100%."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This is a book that captures the imagination of young and old. Mr. Cooper's descriptions of the wilderness and his familiarity with Indian lore are captivating. Cooper's plotting skills which manifest themselves in his stories, is incredible! This is a rip-roaring read that will keep you turning pages well into the night. His characters are also unforgettable. The relationship that develops between Hawkeye and his Indian friend Chingachgook is wonderfully told. This is an action story that could arguably be the first of the modern-day adventure story genre. It's hard to believe that this one was written in 1826."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cora and Alice are damsels in distress. They've had a hard day. Captured by Injuns, tied to stakes to be burned alive, set free only to be recaptured later. In the 18th Century they didn't have aspirin for headaches.This may not be the most realistic book on the shelf, nor the most psychologically deep, but it is a good enough adventure story to have me reading the last 150 pages in one day.The heroes are white hunter Hawkeye with supernatural accuracy using that rifle of his, Mohican Indian chief Chingachgook, and his son Uncas. You want these guys on your side if you ever get in trouble in a bar.I learned so much from this book. I learned that the Delaware Indians, also known as Lenni-Lenape and Mohican, are all noble and brave. I learned that the Mingo Indians, also known as Maqua or Iroquois, are all lying and treacherous. Oh-kay.My guess is that at the time the book was written, the Delawares had already been defeated and dislocated off the eastern seaboard, so it was safe to glorify them. The Iroquois were probably still a threat.The folly in leading Cora and Alice through Indian territory during time of war, behind a treacherous Indian guide named Le Renard Subtil, reminds me of the folly of Friar Lawrence in Romeo And Juliet, coming up with his foolish scheme of drugging Juliet into a zombie state instead of just coming clean and telling her parents that she was married to Romeo.Anyway, good book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"A famous classic written in a style that would confound most writers today. The use of language, vocabulary etc. shows a grasp of the English language that is unheard of today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The second instalment to the five novel \`Leatherstocking Tales' collection, Cooper tells the tale of a daring search and rescue mission led by uber-naturalist and Loyalist hero, Hawk-eye, in colonial America during the French and Indian War. Attended by his various sidekicks (aboriginal or otherwise), our gallant hero seeks to recover General Munro's two daughters, apparently for no other reason than it gives him something to do.The text liberally borrows from the worst tendencies of 18th century English Literature (haughty oratorical tone, frequent character soliloquies, ridiculous emotional and romantic characterizations, constant quotations from important English writers - in this case Shakespeare). This makes for a tough read. The plot is rather lumbering at times, as well. Cooper really has no time for any significant character development; what we see from the characters in the book's early pages is what we get at the end. Some characters seemingly have little or no purpose i.e. General Munro after his daughters have been abducted; a formerly confident and assertive person instantaneously becomes a doddering old fool whose sole contribution is to infrequently mewl about the loss of his \`babes.'The exception to the book's poor use of characterization is Magua, the villainous Huron Indian. Cooper's paradoxical characterizations of this \`wily Indian' often combine hatred with admiration. Cooper is never really sure what to make of him; while Magua embodies the \`savage' excesses of his race, he is also extremely charismatic, and a born leader.As this book is 180-years old, uncomfortable stereotypes and lingering racism are scattered throughout the text. Cooper's respect for aboriginal peoples really depends on which tribe he is describing. For example, when describing the eyes of Uncas, a Mohican, the narrator seemingly exclaims without irony they were beaming \\"with a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices, of his nation.\\" Cooper also demonstrates discomfort with interracial relations, particularly of the aboriginal/Caucasian kind, preferring to change the racial backgrounds of some of his characters that may catch the fancy of the culturally inferior Indians.If nothing else, the book is a fascinating historical document that demonstrates the struggle for the formation of a unique American identity in early post-colonial times. Tendering Hawk-eye as a prototype, for Cooper, the new American is a composite of Native American, English, and colonial cultural values: brave, resourceful, judicious and cultured. While what comprises \`Americanism' is certainly more complex and ambiguous, this book comprises an early contribution to the canon of American literature and unique American experiences."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I would have to say that I expected more from this book than I got in the final analysis. Still, I am glad I read it. Wonder why they had to change the movie so much from the book?And, of course, it was much too long-winded for a reader, like myself, that does not &quot;skim&quot;.I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt, especially when considering the marathon pace of the rest of the book. Perhaps Cooper meant this to be taken so...Also, The insight into racism was astonishing for something that was written in the 1800's (NOT the 1500's like another reviewer mentions)."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"i have never read this book but i have to and i must admit that after reading what others' people opinions were of it i don't want to read it. thank you!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"In the book The Last of the Mohicans, by Fenimore Cooper, the climax of the story is when Uncas and Hawkeye drop their rifles and try to catch up to Magua and Cora, and one of the Hurons stab ora in the heart and kill her was really ironic because you do not expect her to die. Also, when Uncas kills the Huron that killed Cora, but Mugua stabs Uncas three times and kills him is also really ironic. Magua's death was not very suspenseful. Rather than him just falling off the cliff, it would have been better if he died in a battle. The end of the story was very tragic since Chingachogook's son Uncas died and so did Colonel munro's daughter cora died. Alice and Duncan Heyward live happily ever after. Coooper shows how inter racial mixing can lead to bad consequences. From the Beginning Magua shows characteristics of an antagonist and his evil intentions that are to get revenge on Colonel Munro is one of the main things that lead to the death of Uncas, Cora, and to his own death. The main theme that Cooper is trying to get across in this book would be how the coming of the Europeans and how they brought such a different way of life that the Indians were not accustomed to, had destructed the way that the Indians in North America lived."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Reading this book is like walking through a landscape painting of 1770s America. The detail of leaf, feather, shadows and reflection are rendered as exquisitely as by the paintbrush of the master artist who is skilled in the use of light.To read this book, one must have the patience that is required to step into a painting and examine it layer by layer. But if one can, as Cooper puts it, take on \\"Indian eyes\\", a way of seeing that makes the forest read like a book, then one can enjoy a book that reads like a forest.Camouflaged within the panorama of Cooper's epic canvas is the classic story of a quest, with heroes and villains, of a heroine to be rescued, of blood and sacrifice. Although there is criticism that Cooper took liberties with history, the reader will come away more aware of history, how it was, how it might have been.--Debra Anne Wintsmith, author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga and voracious reader of other people's books."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Very different from the movies, but very good in its own right"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This novel by James Cooper turned out surprisingly well. There are only two downfalls to this novel. The first is that I watched the movie. I kept expecting what happened in the movie to happen in the novel. I have to tell you, the book is much different from the movie, and the book is better. The only other negative is that I was raised and taught English in the 1990's and had some difficulty reading Cooper's style of writing. However, the imagery and detail Cooper uses far out weigh the difficulties in understanding his style. Being written in English, I could understand everything he wrote, it just took me longer to read.As I alluded to, Cooper did a tremendous job of painting a picture in mind. I want to visit the Northeastern United States after reading about its beauty. I immediately noticed the attention he paid to detail compared to more modern authors I have read. Additionally, I feel Cooper portrayed Native Americans in positive light uncommon to his era. Rather than berating Native Americans in ignorance, he explained there ways of thinking and ceremonies. More importantly, he showed that every race has common values. Foremost of these is love. The love shared by the chief for his son, the white scout with his Indian friend, the Indian for Cora, all demonstrate that love can touch everyone. The last pages of this novel had more emotion than any I can recall.I enjoyed reading this novel, and encourage all those who liked the movie or are looking for a good novel to read The Last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a classic novel that stands the test of time. The unforgettable characters, Hawkeye Uncas, Magua, and others all tie together for a climactic ending. The novel is sort of a romeo and juliet of sorts, and the romance between Uncas and Cora is a major plot line in the story. It also deals with themes of racism and Indian relations with white men. A good book that should be read by anyone who enjoys American literature or frontier novels."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"With the possible exception of Moby Dick, this book tested my stamina as a reader more than any other. Yes, it is a great adventure story but it is written in a convoluted prose style that was outdated in even Cooper's time. I was inspired to read this book by watching the Michael Mann film. If you go into this story expecting it to be sort of a novelization of the film, you'll probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Perhaps it is because I had such high expectations for this book, but I was extremely disappointed. Cooper demonstrates good charatcer development, but the characters themselves are unbelievable. The characters perform fantastic feats, such as tricking a hostile group of indians into thinking that one character is a bear, that we now recognize as being totally ridiculous. At the time it was written it was most likely commonplace for authors to prey upon the ignorance of their readers and I'm afraid Cooper did just that with this novel. The novel would be much more enjoyable if the reader had absolutely no knowledge of the eastern tribes of native americans or of the colonial lifestyle. In a nutshell, the good guys are too good and the bad guys are too bad, but it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"What a joy to re-read this book again after over 40 years. The last time I read it was back in college as part of an American Lit assignment and it was not one of my favorites. Now, having lived in the same area where the narrative takes place, and having hiked in and around the Lake George/Adirondack Mountains, as well as having spent some time at Cooperstown, the tale has become much more real to me.

The protagonist, Hawkeye, and his Mohican friends are portrayed in a heroic, idealistic manner. The French and most of the Native Americans are described in less romantic terms. Cooper's writing is detailed, almost to the point of being tedious which can make the reading a bit laborious. Even so, I wholeheartedly recommend reading this great American classic.

I won't even deny that I enjoyed it, because I most certainly did. However, it's Cooper's style with which I take issue. Much of his language is superfluous, and renders the text more difficult to read. And, no, it's not simply the problem of an old-fashioned writing style. The text is so riddled with repetition and passive voice that it becomes tedious and boring (even during otherwise thrilling scenes).The only other major problem I have with this book is the lack of direction. Even at the very end, it fails to arrive anywhere. I consider \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" a sometimes intriguing, sometimes lagging description of random people wandering around in the woods with no particular reason."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book is an American classic.

A troop of British colonials, led by the young Major Duncan Hayward, travels through the wilderness on their way to Fort William Henry. Accompanying the soldiers are Cora and Alice Munro, the daughters of the general who presides at the fort. By happenstance they encounter the frontiersman known as Hawkeye, his Indian companion Chingachgook, and the latter's son Uncas. Hawkeye informs the party that their Indian guide, Magua, has been leading them astray, and that he is a member of the Huron tribe who is friendly with the French. Magua escapes, but later returns with a band of Indians who take the two women captive, along with Hayward and David Gamut, a teacher of religious singing who seems to exist in the book only to serve as the Christian antithesis of the stoic Hawkeye. The only hope these four prisoners have for salvation is that Hawkeye and his Indian companions will rescue them from the clutches of their hostile captors.The settlement and founding of America is such a fascinating period in history, and James Fenimore Cooper brings it vividly to life. Like his idol Sir Walter Scott, Cooper combined his own experiences of the region and its inhabitants with extensive historical research to create a romanticized version of his country's past. I have read other works by Cooper (The Spy, The Deerslayer), and found his plotting to be too meandering and haphazard in its construction. The Last of the Mohicans, on the contrary, is expertly paced, with frequent moments of intense action and suspense punctuated by interludes of more quiet contemplation. The story is captivating from beginning to end, with the exception of a couple incongruous scenes in which characters don disguises that challenge the reader's belief. Despite these low points, Cooper's writing is beautiful throughout. He describes the Adirondack wilderness with the keen observation and lyrical expression of a Thoreau. His depiction of the Native Americans in the book may not be entirely accurate, but he is always very respectful toward them. He has a tendency to portray the Indians as being too cold in their demeanor and too reliant on superstition, though never so much as to the point where his characterizations become insulting. He exhibits great reverence for the land and the traditions of its native inhabitants.If there's an obstacle preventing today's readers from tackling The Last of the Mohicans, it's the language. While the text does not contain a great deal of archaic words, the sentences are constructed with the complex, convoluted syntax of a bygone era. Everyone in the book, from the highest general to the lowliest fur trapper, speaks with the poetic voice of a Lord Byron. A dictionary is not required, but every sentence does require some thought. After a while Cooper's narrative voice grows on you, and you'll come to enjoy the antiquated cadence of his prose. There is a dignity and a gravitas to the language that no longer exists in contemporary literature. Reading The Last of the Mohicans takes you back to a now forgotten time when those who wrote books were smarter than you, and they intended every work to be a masterpiece. To that end Cooper was largely successful. Almost two centuries after its publication this novel still provides a vital and invigorating reading experience."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Having read this years ago and finding it again for my Kindle is a treat. James Fenimore Cooper delivers a great story that allows the reader to understand the era, people, geography and lives they led. As one of the first classic American writers Cooper drew on his many experiences from his youth from the area around Cooperstown,New York. This lends credibility to the story that allows one to enjoy the characters and identify with their drama as the story unfolds. I enjoyed reading this as a freshman in college and it has been great rediscovering again as one of the great pieces in the American literature lexicon."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"There are several great movies of The Last of the Mohicans especially a silent version and the Daniel Day Lewis film that came out several years ago. I've always loved the story and knew I needed to read the book. I found it a very difficult read however. The story is great but I am bogged down by James Fenimore Cooper's writing style and ponderous wording. He obviously had a good understanding of the area in which he lived and the native peoples but I found his book hard going. So I can say I read it, appreciate the story but didn't enjoy the book. Sometimes the movies are better than the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I liked the book, Last of the Mohicans. I notice that many reviewers who gave it one or two stars are kids who had to read the book for an advanced English class or who saw the movie and decided to read the book. It is NOT an easy read (which is probably why many kids did not like the book), but I thought it was worth the effort. It was a little difficult keeping the characters straight at first because Cooper has several names for the key characters and switches between them freely.My favorite character was actually one that I would guess is an outlier - David Gamut. His manhood is often insulted by Hawkeye, (Hawkeye calls David's pitch pipe his \\"tooting weapon\\" and he pokes fun of his useless profession of psalmody) yet David's bravery is no less than the heroes of the tale. Sure he can't shoot a gun (it would be against his principles anyway), but he sticks with the sisters when they are kidnapped by Magua and is able to come and go freely among the Indians as he is viewed by them as not having all of his mental faculties. He saves Uncas' life by secretly switching places with him and tells Hawkeye not to avenge his death should he die for the ruse. His moral character is higher, I believe, than the vengeful Indians and Hawkeye. While Hawkeye tolerates or even disdains David at the beginning of the book, I think he grows to like and even admire David by the end.The plot was interesting to me and sure some of the language is convoluted and Cooper's vocabulary is admittedly far superior to mine. However, if you keep a dictionary nearby, you'll learn several new words and enjoy an exciting tale."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a novel for the ages and its hero Hawkeye is a man who teaches life lessons with each page you turn. Many people believe that this novel has outlived its worthiness but once turn of the pages will reveal to the reader a world that is both savage and young, characters that are both civilized and savage, and a story that harkens back to the beginnings of the new world. Cooper's language is hard to swallow sometimes, and the movie is easier to watch, but the reader who settles into the pages of Hawkeye's life and world is rewarded with lessons about friendship, love, survival and the rite of passage that all people go through. It is a definite must read for both English and History classes as it explores the beginnings of this great country in which we live."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"it is a very good book but the english that it is written in is different from the way we speak today.

That is to say, fewer people than even the usual canon of classics. That's too bad, as this truly is an exceptional novel.Cooper's overly-formal language that he invokes for the dialogue of his characters is likely to appear stilted to the modern reader. Also, the occasions of &quot;conversation&quot; that he shares with his readers is bound to seem a bit awkward. However, the epoch in which the author lived was far different than that of today. The style of this novel is somewhat foreign, but it is a style that Cooper inherited from Europeon novels of the period.The narrative passages in the book are colorful and impressively descriptive. One cannot read this tale for long without getting the feeling that he / she is out in the forest (which is, of course, precisely the point). As a matter of fact, the novel has inspired me to someday visit the Hudson River, Lake George &amp; some other key locales described in its pages.One of the aspects of the story that surprised me was just how complicated the politics were between the Indian tribes. In truth, I knew very little about the Huron and Delaware tribes before I began reading. Since I finished the novel, I've found that Cooper's portrayal of the various races to be historically accurate. That's always a plus in any novel.For those who would like to learn more about Indian history, this book is a must-read. As the definitive novel of the French &amp; Indian war, the book would also be of interest to those who are intrigued by military history. In fact, one of the central scenes in the book details the horrifying massacre of the poor denizens of Fort William Henry, which is an actual historical event. Aside from these considerations, tho, it's just a good story - period."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book is an excellent read. Anyone who enjoys stories of Indian wars will love this novel. With romance and action-packed suspense with story line fits this book perfectly. James Fenimore Cooper's does a great job with the book and entices anyone who has reads it. Hawkeye acurate aim, Chingachgook's nativity, Uncas's daring thoughts, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength in mind and spirit, and Duncan's courage and love for Alice makes the book extremely breathtaking. Magua, is the evil Huron warrior who is a great enemy. His unusual love for Cora makes him extremely eery. Maguas is determined to destroy the last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"There are a vast amount of differences among the cultures and societies of different races. But what of the differences among peoples of the same race? Take for example the peoples of the United States. What are the differences between a person from California and a person from Louisiana? When looked at under a microscope, there are a great many comparisons to be made about a person from the south and a person from the west-coast. James Fenimore Cooper makes a like comparison in his classic The Last of the Mohicans. Cooper looks at the differences between white Europeans (primarily British and French) and two tribes of North American Indians: the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper compares the two tribes of Indians as well. Cooper sets his novel in eastern North America during the French and Indian War. His characters are of two different races: white Europeans, British and French; and North American Indians, the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper's description of the characters, the scenery, the sounds, the ways of the Indians-this author gives such vivid descriptions of everything that the reader gets a very clear picture of it all; almost like a movie playing inside the mind. Packed with some kind of action or adventure in every chapter, The Last of the Mohicans is a classic piece of literature that is recommended to anyone. The plot begins with the two daughters of a British general attempting to travel from the military station they are at presently to the station of their father. Accompanied by attendants and an Indian guide, they set out on the journey to their father. Not long after the party commenced travelling, they are met by three people; two Mohicans and a white scout, who is friend to the Mohicans and is well-accustomed to the ways of Indians and the wilderness. The British party's Indian guide leaves them, and they turn to the scout and the Mohicans for help. The scout and his friends agree to help them get to the station. Much action and adventure begins at this point in the novel, and continues to the very last page. The Last of the Mohicans is not only interesting to read because the plot flows and moves smoothly, but it provides historical insight as well. Cooper's look at two different tribes of Indians makes comparisons the reader may not have seen before. The author may even change the reader's mind about the opinions he may have had about Indians based on what he knew about them prior to reading the novel. The Last of the Mohicans is not exactly a short book; it has thirty-three chapters. And the action does not begin on page one, but the plot does flow smoothly and logically into it. Once action appears for the first time, it does elevate and decline throughout the novel, but not in a way that seems jumpy. The increase and decrease of action flows logically, as the plot moves from event to event. And as Cooper gives a multitude of details and description, one may find a particular chapter difficult to get through; but even so, the reader always has a mental picture of everything he is reading. The parts that one may find difficult aren't too hard, and it is well worth it when one comes to the last page. Cooper tells the story eloquently and smoothly, and in a way that the reader does not lose interest. His use of description and imagery make the plot clear and easy to follow. The plot in itself is intriguing and keeps the reader interested from the first chapter all the way through chapter thirty-three."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This is a masterpiece that not only narrates action but explores minds and motives. If you have never read and enjoyed Dickens and Melville; don't bother with this one; it requires a reader with a brain. I was shocked by the first reviews here, and thought: &quot;Are these readers so egotistical as to think that people prior to the baby boom and going back 200 years didn't really talk like that, reason fluently in a crisis, or have deep thoughts about the meaning of life?&quot; People facing death do actually THINK (a lot) during the calm moments. This book is not always politically correct, but it is honest to a fault. It is not designed to be a romance novel; rather a novel in which romance (not sex) occurs. I HATED the movie because it tried to do a lot of anti-war, anti-imperialist moralizing.(Hollywood has no sense of history.) Did you ever read a story and think:&quot;This story is not believable. Like--when did these characters ever go to the toilet?&quot; This story is not like that. Yes it does slow down sometimes but so does life!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"While \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" by James Fennimore Cooper is considered to be a classic novel that everyone should read, I suggest otherwise. Granted, once I finally became adapted to reading Cooper's overly exaggerated descriptive scenes, and could sift through the endless lines of details, I grew to enjoy the story.In \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" a group of travelers consisting of a singer, a Major of the British army, two general's daughters, and an Indian guide decide to take a shortcut to meet up with the girl's fathers at a distant British camp. The Indian guide leads them off trial and they wander around the wilderness until two other Indians, Uncas and Chicangook, as well as their white companion Hawk -Eye, decide to guide them to their destination. Along the way the travelers go through everything from a battle to two separate kidnappings. Overall the story was enjoyable but It dragged on several hundred pages longer than it had to be.In short, I recommend \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" to a true fan of 1800 era war and Native stories who have enough time on their hands to read the 430 page novel and enjoy the language used some 200 years ago."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I know this book is a classic, and James Fenimore Cooper sought to fatten these pages with epic sagas of Indian and White-Men wars, placing special emphasis on the pride of every Indian tribe and their greatly diverse natures. He succeeded. The proud and somewhat glorious adventures of these doomed warriors is on every page. The Indian tribes are richly described in their bravery and cunning at war, their knowledge of the land they love and know so much better than the White Man. In the wilderness of the 16th century, we have the Mohicans and the Mingos at war with each other and the white man. It is significant to the author to point out the last of the great Mohican tribe as a symbolic reference that, during this time frame, one tribe at least was near extinction, an omen and future yet to befall the rest of the \\"owners\\" of a country much loved and revered by the Indian. What becomes tough for the reader to sort out is this: Some tribes are referred to by three different names - or more, and within these tribes, some Indians themselves by many names. Adventure and fighting are abundant of course, and James Fenimore Cooper even adds a bit of romance and intrigue as a quest for two loved ones underlies much of the story. I am sorry to say I was lost in trying to keep it all straight, and the book put me to sleep more often than not. Still, if you are an adventure lover and particularly interested in 16th century sagas, you may thrill to these pages. If not, it's a pretty good sleeping pill."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"When I was a senior I decided to use this book for my AP English class report becuase I had loved the movie...&quot;and books are always better then the movies made after them...it must be wonderful!&quot; I thought. Ha ha. When I chose the book the teacher read a quote by Mark Twain criticising it ALOUD in class. I thought it was sort of rude at the time...then I started reading it and realized he had been trying to warn me. The book is AWFUL! Cooper can't keep his characterization straight. One line one character says something and the next, if it hadn't said &quot;so and so said&quot; I would have thought it was someone else talking, and these aren't supposed to be colonialists with muctiple personality disorder. I week before my paper was due I changed my book to Hamlet just so I wouldn't have to read the rest of that thing...and I love reading literature--I'm now an English major. But just becuase it's a &quot;classic&quot; doesn't make it good reading."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Okay, I gave this book two tries. Not one, but two. A friend of mine in high school recommended it, so I bought it. Tried reading it, didn't get very far, and back onto the shelf it went.Fast forward about eight or so years, find me sorting through my books, and Last of the Mohicans was rediscovered. I believe I got about 200 pages into it over the course of 2 1/2 weeks, and bleh, I just can't force myself to read this any more. It is very seldom that I won't finish a book, even one I don't like, but I just can't get through this one.For the first 200 pages, the characters are shallow and uninteresting. The women are gentle and reserved and know their places, and the men are violent and love to shoot things. The plot can basically be summarized this way:-- Hack through forest.-- Make racist statements.-- Kill some people.-- Repeat.Maybe it gets better on page 201. I don't know. But this one is going in the Goodwill box."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I wanted to like this book so badly, I did, but I must admit that reading it was like being dragged naked by wild horses across a rocky terrain. I've seen the movie a dozen times. Daniel Day Lewis was the essence of every woman's idea of a hero, practically dripping with romance. Granted, I knew the book would not reflect the movie perfectly, but geez louise, Hawkeye was about as romantic as a block of stale cheese in the book. He's still loyal to the Mohawks and he's still a sure shot with his rifle, but if you're looking for the &quot;I'd-die-for-Cora-and-cut-down-anyone-in-my-way-to-save-her&quot; Hawkeye, you ain't gonna get it in the book. The book at least doled out a little action here and there, but overall it was an endurance test to finish the book. I wouldn't recommend the book simply because you loved the movie. It's totally different, with the exception that Magua is still the quintessential evil son of a *bleep*. I'm glad I read it in terms of its value as one of the first American literary classics, but for classic entertainment in general, I'd much rather read Robert Louis Stephenson or Mark Twain. Cooper's writing comes across as choppy and rough as the lives his characters lead."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Everyone knows the story of 'Last of the Mohicans', presumably from watching the Daniel Day-Lewis film. But what surprised me is how poor the novel by James Fenimore Cooper is. Two-dimensional characterisation (eg Duncan Heyward - gallant hero?) worsens a tale which seems to lack any proper structure apart from shoving in as many scenes of fighting and dramatic escape as possible. There are positive elements, such as the cunning but subtle personage of Magua and the basic premise of battles in the forested wilderness of North America. Perhaps that is why the recent film version is so much better - it takes all the good parts of the book, adds some new ideas and mixes them together."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book not only made me groan every time I picked it up, but discouraged me from reading other books by the same author. For anybody reading this and saying that I am wrong, I disagree. The Last of the Mohicans was not a book I would recommend, especially because of all the confusing characters , sights, and places. This book was something I might read again, but definately not until I can understand it better. James Fenimore Cooper, I give you credit, but I still did not enjoy reading you're book. I guess it's just not my style."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I am compelled to comment because of a previous review that called this book a \\"study\\" and believed it to be an accurate representation of people, place, and time. This is a novel, nothing more. Cooper represents his own time period's thought process within the writing of a Gothic novel. If you want to know more about the Mohawk, Oneida, and Mahican people please read a more recent history and do NOT rely on fiction."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book is not quite what I expected. I expected a book I could UNDERSTAND. It may have a nice adventurous plot, but it is just way too hard to read. It was more of a burden to read than a joy. I see it as similar to a majic eye. You can't figure out what it is saying unless you cross your eyes. If you like to read books at night to make you go to sleep this one is ideal. Also, I found that I had to stop and think about what I just read because it was so hard to read and understand. I lost my excitement for reading it on the first page."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I expected more from a classic of American literature. In contrast to some of the other reviewers, I thought that the Indian characters were stereotyped as either &quot;noble savages&quot; or bloodthirsty brutes. The actions of the English characters are sometimes incomprehensible and the females are of course particularly helpless. Somehow when I read other period literature I can relate a woman's actions to the society of her time, but I couldn't do that here. The Hawkeye character was interesting, but often came off as eccentric rather than heroic and I'm not sure that was the intent. Well, I can say I read it. My copy is going to the used book store."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This is my most beloved adventure/romance; however, it took me about the first 50 pages to \\"catch the groove\\" of Fenimore Cooper's writing style. In that way, the writing style is much like Henry James. If you can \\"acclimate\\" to the style, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper's second book of the Leatherstocking Tales, in which the young chief Uncas joins his father Chingachgook and Nathaniel Bumppo in battling the French and their Huron allies, is quite possibly one of the best pieces of fiction ever written. The reader can almost feel the leafy canopy closing upon them and hear the rustle of the forest floor as the intrepid woodsmen range throughout the northeastern lakes region of upstate New York. Armed conflict, the pathos of human drama, exquisitely wrought characters, and Cooper's singular ability to bring the environment to bear on the reader's sensibilities equals a reading experience rarely paralleled regardless of the 150+ years that have passed since it's creation.I can always measure my level of involvement with a historically-based novel when I am compelled to employ the atlas to find the exact locations in which the story takes place. James Fenimore Cooper had me tracing the path of Bumppo and company by index finger as I was easily transported to an age when England, France, and their Native American allies confronted each other in the backwoods of a new world to determine the ultimate mastery of a continent. It is a mark of historical irony that none of the chief competitors were ultimately successful as a fledgling United States of America emerged. Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales provide latter-day Americans a fine opportunity to relive America's early past and see it for the uncertain and exciting period it was. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book has a powerful tale. It is just difficult for modern readers to read. Once I got used to his style of writing I liked Cooper's plot and characterization. I fell in love with Scout and Chingagook. I didn't want anything to happen to them. This book is a classic because it puts a story in the context of a time period and does it well. Again, its only downfall is its language, but that goes with the territory."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This was a good story. It was completly different from the film. At first the language is a little challenging, I found myself re-reading passages to understand them better. After about 50 pages the reader understands it and the book comes to life. I enjoyed this story about Hawk Eye and his companions. It makes me want to buy the other books in the Leatherstocking Tales and read them as well."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a classic novel that stands the test of time. The unforgettable characters, Hawkeye Uncas, Magua, and others all tie together for a climactic ending. It is sort of confusing though, and hard to follow at times. The novel like a romeo and juliet of sorts, and the romance between Uncas and Cora is a major plot line in the story. It also deals with themes of racism and Indian relations with white men. An ok book that should be read by anyone who enjoys American literature or frontier novels. In my opinion, watch the movie, it's a lot better."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"well, as I said, if you have watched the film and then read the book, you will probably be disappointed... I am not saying this is a bad book...I enjoyed reading it, but I watched the film first, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the book...the book itself is classic and I would reconmand you to read it. :)"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book is a must read. Anyone who enjoys stories of the old days would love this novel. With romance and action tied into the story line perfectly this book is a riveting read. James Fenimore Cooper's great writing enchants anyone who has read this book. there werent really any gory scenes and the romance wasnt too thick.(actually it wasnt thick enough) Emotions are very deep and well put. Hawkeyes overly acurate aim, Chingachgook's native prescence, Uncas's daring ways and tender heart, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength, and Duncan's love for Alice all make the story exciting and eventful. But because of its complicated plot and length the book does seem to drag on a bit. Magua, the evil Huron warrior makes a great enemy. He will fight to the death to avenge his lost warriors. his unusual liking for Cora makes him even more eery. Maguas determination to destroy the last of the Mohicans is even more scary."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book greatly renewed my interest in colonial history. Within two days of reading it I got into my car and drove to the Fort William Henry historical site (which is now bordered by an amusement park and hotel, but that is another story). Standing there at the Fort, it was a wonderful feeling trying to picture some of the scenes from the book. Or, of Fenimore Cooper being there in the early 1820's, looking for inspiration for the text. Forget the movie, it doesn't do the story justice!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"For those who didn't like the novel, you should look for a very old and humorous review of Cooper's work by none other than Mark Twain. I found it surprisingly in the preface pages of another paperback I own by the author."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"After reading all the one star rewievs I decided to state my opinion on this brilliant novel. I saw the movie and I saw it again and again and again... Then I decided to read the novel. The only thing that I was dissapointed in was the brief characterization. The novel is great, I read it twice, but it does fall short on characters. I would have loved to see/read more about Uncas and his father."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I was assigned this book for summer reading this year since I am about to enter the Gifted English program. I was very excited to read it at first, because i loved watching those old cowboy movies as a little kid. After about the first 100 pages I realized the challenge that faced me, getting through the long gaps between the good parts. I do hope some day to even finish the darn thing (it's nearly 400 pages long, I'm on page 102). I did give it two stars because the action scenes are so well written. If your thinking about reading this for fun don't bother, the movie is much better, or so I hear."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I had a really hard time with this \\"classic\\" of American literature, but then, I've never been really thrilled with early 19th century American writers. The style of the period is over-wordy by today's standards, with a great deal of what is essentially sermonizing both on the part of the author and the characters and very little real dialogue or character development. I'm a person who can generally consume any 400 page novel in a day or so, but I found I could not read more than about a chapter of LOTM at a time, and my attention wandered a lot.The story by itself it a pretty good one, dealing with the middle part of the French and Indian War. There is a great deal of fighting, striving with the wilderness, being exposed to alien cultures, and a dash of romance thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, the story suffers from the over-abundance of words. Every encounter is melodramatized to the point of boredom, and the actual events get lost. Hawkeye, that redoubtable woodsman, never shuts up, and after a while everything he says is the same. Likewise for the other characters. There isn't any growth or development.I became increasingly offended by the portrayal of the Indians, both hostile and friendly, as either noble savages or just savages, obviously inferior to the white man. I also became increasingly offended with the portrayal of the two women, both of whom represented stereotypes of femininity popular at the time. I realise that Cooper was writing at a time when it was not much the practice to see value in native cultures and the memory, if not the actual experience, of the real violence between the American aborigines and the European immigrants was still close to the surface, but that didn't keep me from being disgusted at his overbearing and superior attitude.I'm glad I read this book, because it is held a classic. But that's the only thing that kept me going."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Excuse me, but I have read Melville and Dickens(I adore Dickens)and I would please like to ask one reviewer(and if they're reading this they know who they are) what is so intellectual about The Last of the Mohicans?

Im sure that if it was a modern book you wouldn't be so enthusiastic! I've saw modern melodramatic crap like this on the best sellers rack at Krogers.

This book is a novel about a Native American tribe called the mohicans and their dying population. I didnt like this book at all. It wasn't that exciting, there wasn't that much fighting, and it never really grabed my attention. The plot never really appeared in the book untill a 1/3 of the way in. this book is like me because the Mohicans fought for what they belived in. i'd relate this book to the Cherokee Indians becaus they were forced out of their homes in the east coast and ended the trail in Oklahoma. In the Last of the Mohicans the Mohicans fought for their land and to survive. I would recommed this book to people who like history and peace between humans.

How could a novel be worse????"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

After reading this book,I read all of Cooper's five books on Bumppo. It was inspiring to read books from a time when honesty and virtue were highly honored in a character. It's also fun to learn a little history from the stories.Important note: The book is different than the movie, and in my opinion is much better than the movie. Hollywood had to warp the story and even changed the nature of Natty Bumppo, who is supposed to be a homely man whose charm really is his impeccable honesty and strength. The movie folks even changed who falls in love with whom, but it still was a good movie, even though it's not this story."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Some of you readers of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; might be interestested in knowing a juicy little tidbit. I just happened to be browsing through books in the library and came across a book by Sara Donati entitled &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;. What caught my attention was a review by my absolutely all time favorite author, Diana Gabaldon. She has a review on the cover of this book that states &quot;One of those rare stories that let you breathe the air of another time, and leave your footprints on the snow of a wild, strange place&quot;. So I checked it out figuring if Diana Gabaldon endorses this book I have to read it. And as I begin this book, imagine my surprise as I'm introduced to the stories characters... a much older Hawkeye and his very elderly adoptive father...Chingachgook! This story, &quot;Into the wilderness&quot; is the sequel to last of the Mohicans and is the story of Hawkeye's and Cora's son Nathaniel. I'm only a quarter of the way through it and enjoying it very much. I can not compare to the book &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot; because I only saw the movie but in my opinion, Sara is a good writer and I am enjoying the continuation of a great story and interesting characters. I understand Nathaniel's and Elizabeth's story continues in a third book entitled &quot;Dawn on a distant shore&quot; coming out in March of 2000. Just thought some of you might be interested. Also if any of you are interested in the best series of books of all time...read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager and The Drums of Autumn. I can promise one and all, You WILL NOT be dissappointed. I couldn't put them down and eagerly await the 5th book in the series."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The Last of the Mohicans ranks on the lower tier of classics I have read. Cooper's style is tedious, and the captivating action scenes that are so abundant in the movie are few and far between in the novel. I will admit, I enjoy excerpts of Cooper's works, and the plot, if it wasn't so drawn out, would be engaging. You can spare yourself from 400 pages of monotony and excruciating discernment by just reading a couple of pages from the climactic scenes. Although I rarely do this, I can unhesitantly say that in this instance, the movie is far better than the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is an adventure story set in the frontier wilderness of New York during the French and Indian War (1756-1763). The war is fought between the British and the French. The latter make alliances with several Native American tribes.The main characters of the novel are Hawkeye, Magua, Duncan Heyward, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro and General Montcalm. Hawkeye is a scout and woodsman. Magua is a rogue member of the Huron tribe and the villain of the story. Duncan Heyward is a young major in the British Army. Uncas is the last member of the Mohican tribe and a protege of Hawkeye. Cora Munro is the daughter of Colonel Munro who is the commander of the British Army at Fort William Henry. Cora is partly of African descent. Alice Munro is Cora's younger half-sister. General Montcalm is a famous French general.THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is mostly a tale of adventure but it is also a love story which explores the challenges of interracial friendship and romance. The book's writing style is typical of an early nineteenth century novel and for that reason it is not always easy to understand. THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is a classic which raises questions that still remain relevant today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"James Fenimore Cooper's novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Narrative of 1757&quot;), is a remarkable book for many reasons. First published in 1826, the book represents an early attempt to create substantial literary art from the material of North American history and geography. Although the book has its flaws, it is for the most part a success.In the novel, the white woodsman Hawk-eye and his Mohican Indian comrade Chingachgook join forces to help the daughters of a white military officer through hostile territory. The story takes place in a colonial American setting marked by conflict between French and English forces -- a conflict that also involves various Indian nations.There are a number of exciting (and often graphically violent) scenes of battle and chase. Hawk-eye, a white man who, to a large degree, rejects European-American values, is a fascinating figure -- indeed, he is one of the most enduring fictional creations in all of United States literature. Through the mouths of Hawk-eye and the various Indian characters, Cooper offers some intriguing criticisms of white culture.As I said, the book is not without flaws. The momentum of the book lags for a brief stretch, and some of Cooper's characters (in particular, his women) at times sound a bit stereotypical. But the overall power and intelligence of Cooper's work is undeniable. Particularly impressive is his re-creation of a multilingual world of complex cultural and personal conflict. Also noteworthy is his evocation of the American landscape. A tale of death and survival, of betrayal and loyalty, and, above all, of the extraordinary bond between a white man and an Indian, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is one classic that deserves to be read and reevaluated by each generation."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I thought that this was an excellent study of the European-Indian relationships and intertribal relationships among the Americam Indians. There are some gruesome scenes; I feel it is probably a fairly accurate account of practices at that time amongst those tribes. At times the narrative gets wordy because of the details of the history and traditions. I can't believe this book was taught in the 5-8 grades in this country 30 years ago. I don't think the majority of 12th graders could read this book with ease."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Like the Star Wars movies, Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales were written out of sequence. In their chronological order, with their order of publication in parentheses, they are: The Deerslayer (5), The Last of the Mohicans (2), The Pathfinder (4), The Pioneers (1) and The Prairie (3). So if you want to read them in either chronological or published order, you should read Mohicans second. But each novel is self-contained, so if you want to try just one, to decide if the rest are worth reading, then Mohicans is the one to start with, as it is his most famous work and generally acknowledged to be his best.The hero of these tales, the improbably named Nathaniel Bumppo (or Natty, or Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, or The Long Rifle, or...etc, etc) was the first, and remains the quintessential, all-American fictional hero; brave, noble, honest and more at home in the wilderness than the town. He is not however, the strong, silent type. He has a habit of launching into long, rambling streams of homespun philosophy at the drop of a coonskin cap. Never mind that lead shot is flying thick and fast around his ears, he will lean on his rifle and expound on the different natures of Indians and whites, or the evils of literacy.The plot of Mohicans is action-packed, but is linear - no surprise twists, and no sub-plots - and contains some highly improbable elements. Well, would you be fooled by an enemy disguised as a beaver? Michael Mann's excellent 1992 screen version reworked the plot extensively, to its advantage.Cooper was the first distinctively American novelist and was inspired by Walter Scott, the inventor of the historical novel. He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism. And his characters, specially the women, are resiliently two-dimensional. But he did capture the spirit of the frontier, the pride and pain of a new and growing country, and in doing so created myths out of America's past that have survived, evolved, and have sustained the nation, ever since."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I first read \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" many years ago. Recently, I was doing research on the Beaver Wars of the 17th century and learned a great deal about the history of the early colonies and the relationships between the various Native American nations and tribal groups. It's fascinating stuff, to say the least.After completing the research (which resulted in a two volume set of books entitled \\"Iroquois Wars\\" available on Amazon.com), I re-read Cooper's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" with a more careful eye. Clearly, Cooper knew his stuff. He captures the true spirit of the American frontier spot on. He retains a mournful sensitivity toward the plight of the dwindling eastern woodland tribes while offering none of the absurd modern political correctness that makes every Indian wise, generous, and kind, and every European colonist vicious, greedy, and ignorant. While subject to the occasional novelist's hyperbole, Cooper also draws an accurate picture of Native military tactics and rituals. The various harangues and conversations he creates could have been lifted directly from the pages of the Jesuit Relations or other primary sources in which actual conversations were recorded by those who understood the various Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues.In short, I highly recommend \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" to anyone who enjoys historical novels or those with a particular interest in frontier history, the American colonial wars, or the native tribes of the eastern woodlands. The book truly is an American classic. (P.S., don't bother with the recent movie of the same name--it bears only passing resemblance to this book)."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this particular novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which was to become the archetypical protagonist of the American western. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. The book is a bit short on characterization and plotting and the prose is heavy for modern tastes, but the action is richly visualized in the flow of the narrative and the images are compelling. In the end, despite its flaws, this book of Cooper's is, in fact, the classic we have been told it is. -- S. W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"It is easy to see that the modern action hero owes everything to Natty Bumppo. This is the best of the Leatherstocking Tales, though \\"Pathfinder\\" and \\"Deerslayer\\" are good too. \\"The Prairie\\" has its merits, but Natty is very old in that one, and \\"The Pioneers\\", the first to be published, deals only with Bumppo as a supporting character.\\"Last of the Mohicans\\", however, is a masterpiece of romantic fiction, and the birth of the American action novel. Cooper's knowledge of the American Indian is not always accurate, but it is easy to see the genesis of many legends that surrounded Native Americans in American lore into the 20th century in this and other books from the Leatherstocking Tales. The language is antiquated and may be a bit difficult for younger readers, but it is worth it.Also, a note on the film: The Daniel Day-Lewis movie is good--I enjoy that too, but it is incredibly different from the book. It is only VERY loosely based on Cooper's work, and Cooper's is unquestionably better.If you are curious as to why this book is regarded as a \\"classic\\", pick it up. I hope you get as much from it as I did."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Difficult to read as it is wordy in description and the phrasing is old. The storyline of the wars in NY and the decline of the American Indian is excellent though."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I read and thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is dubbed a classic for good reason. This story will captivate anyone interested in the French and Indian War period, Colonial America and the origins of American Warfare. Although not nearly the same experience, I recommend the Major Motion Picture as well. The cinematography and soundtrack are amazing."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Mark Twain took great pleasure in ridiculing Cooper's novel, gleefully pointing out plot inconsistencies, unbelievable events that led often to harder to believe conclusions, and the wooden dialog and petty philosophizing of the novel's principle character - all in an effort to prove that any way you might look at it, Copper could not, for his life, tell a tale. I think that Twain might be guilty of a bit of jealousy. Many of the faults that Twain found with Cooper can be found in his own writings, from Tom Sawyer to Huckleberry Finn; moreover, in none of Twain's work can you find the dramatic action that Cooper was able to create. Also, Twain was looking backward some fifty years and American English had undergone some major transformations, becoming less structured thus making earlier American literature, by contrast, seem formal, wordy and, to some, unreadable.Cooper's work must be evaluated from within its own time frame to prove just how revolutionary his writings were. Shaped by the traditions of the eighteenth century English novel and influenced by his contemporary, Sir Walter Scott, Cooper continued this tradition of the romance novel - with a peculiarly unique American twist: three of the major characters of this novel were not European whites (the almost universal character model of the literature with which Cooper was acquainted), but American Indians. Althought this was quite unique, Cooper was not free from the prejudices that was prevalent at the time of the novel's writing, and despite being associated with the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", created many more ignoble Indians than he did noble ones.The strengths of the novel are the descriptive prose that Cooper employs to paint his picture of frontier America - descriptions which, in fact, compare with some of the best nature descriptions in American literature - and the fine character development of two of his supporting characters, Magua and Cora. Twain was correct about Cooper's hero, Hawkeye - he is wooden, ignorant, and despite his close association with his two Mohican buddies, Chingachgook and Uncas, is openly santimonious about his pure \\"un-crossed\\" white blood and rails at anything that smacks of learnedness. Magua and Cora are much more complex characters.Magua is one of the best crafted characters in early American literature. He is not the stoical Indian character type represented by Chingachgook and Uncas, but combines the bravery of the Huron warrior witht the worse habits of the white man; he is ravaged by rage and hatred, having been cast out by his own tribe and used by both the French and English for their own colonial pursuits. He comes across as a sort of native American Ahab and is not without his sympathetic side. Cora is the antithesis of her fainthearted sister, the blond Alice. She is brave, resourceful and feminine; yet never could be considered (although Hawkeye does) a member of the \\"gentle sex\\". That there is a hidden aspect to her character, that her \\"charged color\\" hints at some dark mystery only makes her more appealing as a character.In short, Cooper did know how to tell a story, and if the contemporary reader will abate some of his biases and give the novel a chance, that reader will be not only captured by the action of the book but will realize that Cooper deserves his place as America's first novelist. Do not confuse the recent movie of the novel, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, as an honest portrayal. The screenplay, when compared to Cooper's text, seems to have been based on an entirely different novel."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the tale of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism arises almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls.

If you give this book a chance and bear with some of the heavy nineteenth century prose, it will prove out in the end. An exciting and worthwhile read.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I disagree with anybody who found this book boring or tedious reading. At the tender age of 13 I picked up this book. Of course, at that age I would have had a right to dislike it ,but it turned out to be the highlight of my reading life. Ever since then I have compare every book to this one ,and in my mind's eye all have taken a backseat. I've read the whole series of Leatherstocking tales since then ,and they now hold the best seat in my library. Besides the Bible, I surely do consider the Leatherstocking tales my favorite books. In this fast paced world I can understand how people can grow weary of this book. It's much more than Indians and Pale faces running through the forest though. The reader must put as much thought and emotion into it as the author has done to develop his characters. As in the words of my English teacher ,&quot;Cooper reads like a smooth glass of lemonade--let him sit on your tongue for a moment.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I've read five chapters so far and the story is about the French & Indian war. Cora is a lady and is intimate with a major and goes along with her sister Alice on a trip guided by an indian who didn't adhere to the likings of a scout and a hunter whom were Canadians. I like the part where the mohicans have to venture out and kill a wild colt and all this so they could find shelter and the Iroquois won't get them by sunrise."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"In the old fashioned manner, each chapter of this novel written in 1825 is introduced with a quotation from another work, often by Shakespeare. In general, the writing style is quite formal and flowery, actually outright verbose. This makes it rather laborious to read and strikes a vivid contrast with the relative simplicity of the plot and of the characters. These, in a very confusing way, are often given many names. For example, the same person is called Natty Bumppo, Hawkeye, Oeil de Faucon and La Longue Carabine, all within a few paragraphs.There are definite incongruities in the plot. Beaver huts for instance are mistaken for a human settlement and a man disguised as a bear actually fools Indians who of course have lived in the woods all their lives! There are also anachronisms, such as referring constantly to the Canadas in the plural, whereas in 1757, when the novel is set, before the British Conquest, there was of course only one.This book's interest lies mainly with its North American setting and the fact it was one of the earliest novels to be written here. To the author's credit, it must be pointed out that he displays much respect for the Indians' wisdom and way of life, in marked contrast with general opinion later in the 19th century.Still, its qualities are not enough to make this work truly of major interest today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"Classic American stories are part of our lives. We read books on them, references in television series, and watch movies on them. But when we read the actual classic, we find that what we thought it was about is slightly different. The Last of the Mohicans is no different.James Fenimore Cooper wrote a classic that is read in most schools across the country. It's the story of 2 young English women on a journey to see their father who is a leader in the British Army. With an escort of British military and one native scout they find themselves ambushed. They are saved by a scout and 2 other natives. The fighting amongst the French, English, and native tribes gives Cooper a plethora of material for an intricate plot.This proved to more difficult of a read than I remember from high school when I read it. Maybe it is because I've read so many more contemporary versions and watched movies. There are several scenes were the dialogue is only in French. Sorry, I know about three words in that language. Also, so much description was placed that I'd forget what was happening in the scene.Now, I have to admit how movies ruined Cooper's book for me. The movie with Daniel Daye Lewis was great. I loved it. When I just reread the book, I was so disappointed because the storyline is so different. The book has Alice and Duncan in love. The move has Hawkeye and Cora. There are many other differences, but I would be spoiling the reading experience.If you have not read the book yet, try not to see any movies on it first. It will make the experience so much more enjoyable.Note: This book was free as a public domain piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) is sometimes called the \\"American Scott\\". Like Sir Walter Scott who romanticized the Scottish past, Cooper focused readers attentions to the the American frontier. His most famous works are the Leatherstocking tales featuring Natty Bumpo. The novels in the series include: The Deerslayer; \\"The Pathfinder\\"; \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\"; \\"The Pioneers\\" and \\"The Prarie.\\" The most famous of these novels is \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" set during the French and Indian War in North America. Natty Bumpo the hero of the tale is said to be 40 years old; he is an experienced woodsman knowledgable in fieldcraft; Indian fighting and how to survive in a brutal frontier setting in upstate New York.The novel includes exciting fights with Indians; escapes from Indian captivity; word paintings of nature; a love story and a tale lamenting the passing of the last of the Mohicans.The characters are:Natty Bumpo-the intrepid scout for the British who rescues damsels in distress while escaping Indian capture. He is the hero of the novel and the Leatherstocking series.Duncan Heyward-A brave but inexperienced British major who is love with the inspidly portrayed Alice Murno. Alice is a stick figure with no depth or character development.Cora Munro is the sister of Alice. Both of these siblings are the daughters of British soldier Munro who is the commander at Fort William H enry. The fort is captured by the French and their Indian allies. Alice and Cora are captured and taken to an Indian village.Chingachgook and his son Uncas. Good friends of Hawk-eye (a nickname for Natty Bumpo). Uncas is the last of the Mohicans. He is love with the dark skinned Cora.Mauga. The evil Indian who is the major foe of the English and the friends of Hawkeye.The novel is written in an old fashioned literary style which lends itself to slow reading for moderns. The language does not, however, get in the way of the nonstop action. The book is one of the first novels written by an American author assisting at the birth of our literary heritage. Cooper's views on Indians is not politically correct. It is worth your time and effort to become acquainted with this literary milestone."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"I have been enjoying Steinbeck, Dickens, Plato, Shakespeare and just about everything else since I was small enough to listen to daddy read. Huck Fin, Buck, Kino...they are all my heroes. I read this one out loud to my parents - all of it unabriged - and did not have any trouble despite my fourteen year old mind. The manner Cooper uses to draw you into the story is fascinating...and strange in a world where no one has the patience to enjoy the manner of man that through his writings was discribing himself and trying to earn bread for his table that night. (Which is better than a lot of people can say.)Cooper's heroes are full of themselves. They are truly \\"men without a cross\\" as he, and they, say of themselves. Through the beautiful, melodius eloquence Cooper discribes the men that are much the same as Jonathan Seagull, Jesus Christ, Legolas and even Don Quixote. I respect him for the way that his characters DO what they believe and not wait for someone to back them up. Uncas prooved that well enough - in love or not.Most of us love The Lord Of The Rings movies, they too kill for the same reason. To save something they believe to be of worth (Read the book, they butchered the movie)I think that everyone would like to have the words honestly said over you that were said over Le Cerf Agile and Cora.TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHO THE MAN BEHIND THE COOPER MASK REALLY IS. you will then enjoy the adventure of a man's mind greater than any other."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This book reads quickly, and really draws you in; Cooper paints each scene vividly. It's certainly romanticized, and by modern standards it's racist and sexist (which is understandable considering when Cooper wrote this book). Despite that, it's a great book. Uncas, the young Mohican warrior, is awesome and honorable. Cora, the main female character, has great attitude and stands up for herself. As a small warning, this book is actually more graphic than the movie version--I had to literally put the book down and focus my mind on something else to calm down after a certain part. I don't know, maybe other people aren't as bothered by that kind of thing. I definitely recommend this book, though. It is exciting to read!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"To be honest a story about the early frontier days is not the type of story that generally draws my attention, but since this book was on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written I gave it a chance. Unlike others on these types of lists which did not live up to the hype, this one succeeded.You are brought into another world and given a perspective of another culture. I couldn't believe a book written at that time would contain so much graphic images. I had read books before who had characters in them which they called savages, but it was not until this book that I actually saw what savagery really was. The aftermath of the attack on Fort William Henry contains some very shocking descriptions. Indians have different morals and superstitions, and Cooper does a good job of explaining the differences while at the same time differentiating between good and evil. Bravery as always is still highly respected by all.The story was wonderful, and the characters were memorable. There is a lot of character development. Even the villain's character of Magua grows and grows, from a mer scout to a formidable opposing chief. Cora, is a very strong female character, which to me is unique for a story written during that time period. The character of David Gamut adds some humor and an image of a free spirit who stays true to his religion, but Hawkeye the scout, Uncas the warrior and his father Chingachgook are the powerful characters that anyone would want to emulate. Heyward the young British officer comes off a little stiff, but he is very honorable.I liked the fact that Cooper incorporated some actual real life characters into his story and gave us all a little history lesson. For instance Washington is mentioned briefly and Cooper insinuates that Washington probably learned his guerilla tactics for fighting the British during his days in the French and Indian Wars. He also mentions two other real life generals in a way which adds to the story without being accused of character defamation.I'm not sure if I would call this a love story since it was mostly filled with battle scenes and war tactics, but there was a lot of love to go around. Even with the differences in culture there is still a similarity between the love shown between the father Munro and his daughters, (as a father of two daughters myself I felt his anguish Munro felt in worrying about the safety of his girls), and the love shown between and the Indian father Chingachgook and his son Uncas. You have a special bond of brothers between Hawkeye and Uncas, and you also have the love story between Heyward and one of Munro's daughters as well.While I found the book to be excellent, there are three minor criticisms I will make. Every character seems to have at least three names which is confusing at times. One which is their real name, another their friends call them, and yet a third which their enemies may bestow upon them. Also I do not speak French, and there are a few discussions throughout the book in French which are not interpreted. It didn't ruin the story since I could guess what was probably said, but it was slightly annoying. Finally the book title itself gives away more of the story than I would have liked with it's foreboding.The character Alan Alda played on the old T.V. show M.A.S.H. had always said that his favorite book was \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and his favorite character was Hawkeye. Now I know why."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"The Last of the Mohicans was a great book in sense of adventure and intrigue. It got down to the raw life of the people back in its time and really was detailed to where you could have a vivid picture in your mind. The writing was intelligent and crafty, but shall I say, CONFUSING due to the fact that the language within it was unlike that of the language we use today. I had to re-read a lot of sections for the reason that the wording had me confused and I had to try to take in what Cooper really meant. I am not in to this sort of book for pleasurable reading (it was a class assignment) and I would not recommend it for the non-rustic teenage girl, but it does display a valuable piece of history. I really enjoyed the love-related aspect of the book because I enjoy romantics and I liked how put that in. Otherwise, I might have disliked the majority of the book. All in all, this book was written very well and is a valuable piece of literature, but I do not consider it a favorite and would not wish to recommend it to others of my generation for it is sort of out of date, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"My book review is on Last of the Mohicans .I thought it was a GREAT book.

They meet when Sophia throws her arms aruond Marcus at a ball, thinking he is the cousin she has not seen for many years. Their second meeting is just as embarrassing for him and leaves Marcus sure in his mind that she is nothing more then a shatterbrained hysteric. And when she happens to over hear his comments, her indignation for his slurs on her character prompt her to concoct a plan to teach him a lesson when she and her grandmother, along with a handful of other guests, are invited to his estate by his mother.It is to be a celebration as her son is soon to be married to a docile miss he considers just the sort of woman a man should marry. Definately, not like the disastrous Miss Sophia. As evidenced by her catching fire to his property and causing him(quite inadvertantly) bodily injury. But feelings soon change and the sparks fly.The resulting story is a witty, humorous, and quite entertaining romp into the world of Regency England. The two protaganist are true to their characters. The plot moved the story continually forward making one eager to see what was going to happen next.I thoroughly enjoyed her book and have read it three times already. It has never failed to make me laugh despite the familiarity. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Regency Match","review":"First of all, thank you to Berkley/Jove for continuing to release the wonderful, older books by Elizabeth Mansfield, as well as bringing out the occasional new one. This book dates to May, 1980 in its original version, but it is still a delight to read. The authors tell-tale skill with witty dialogue is present in abundance in this tale of a spirited young woman and the quiet young man she encounters. Each encounter is more hilarious than the last, as Sophie Edgerton creates disturbances without even trying. Of course, when she does try-sparks fly all over the place.Unable to live with her father and step-mother, Sophie has come to live with her widowed grandmother, Lady Alicia, in London. But Sophie's escapades begin to wear thin when she enthusiastically greets a gentleman at a ball. Truly, she thought she was greeting her cousin Bertie, who has just returned from several years away. Unfortunately, she guessed wrong, and the unsuspecting gentleman who received the hugs was the retiring Earl of Wynwood, Marcus Harvey.As is usually the case, after this first meeting, subsequent ones also tend toward disaster, leaving Sophie determined to take a repairing lease to the country, even if it has to be at her own home. But then Lady Alicia shows the girl an invitation she's just received. It's for a two-week house party, from Lady Alicia's dearest friend. Not until later does Sophie discover that the dearest friend is also the Mama of Marcus.Unsettled by the growing attraction Sophie feels towards Marcus, she still also has the inclination for mischief, especially when Marcus announces his engagement to the eminently suitable Miss Iris Bethune. Unable to appreciate the impending marriage, Sophie runs away to her father's house, and the religious step-mother.Rescued by Marcus, who neglects to tell her that his betrothal has been called off by Iris, Sophie is distant and cold to him, causing more misunderstandings. Eventually, however, all things turnabout, and the resulting Regency Match is more satisfying than most. Great fun!"},{"Title":"Regency Match","review":"I highly recommend this one.

At a ball, Miss Sophia hugs the Earl of Wynwood believing it is her cousin whom she hasn't seen in almost 11 years. He is rude to her and she ends up creating other mishaps in his presence increasing his dislike of her. She is invited to the earl's country estate since Lady Alicia is close friend's with his mother and Miss Sophia begins to make havoc there.

It is a fine book to use in a classroom."},{"Title":"Studying the Jewish Future (Samuel and Althea Stroum Lectures in Jewish Studies)","review":"In his book, Calvin Goldscheider does an excellent job of exploring the central issues associated with studying the Jewish future. Goldschider acknowledges standard concerns (such as intermarriage and the fading Jewish majority in Israel) and uses extremely compelling, yet easy to follow, arguments to reevaluate their actual importance. Goldscheider's methods are both diverse and interesting: he expertly combines general discussions with individual biographies. This book may have been written by a demographer, but it can be read by anyone."},{"Title":"Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction","review":"Jack, just because somebody doesn't happen to agree with your personal perspective doesn't make them \\"ignorant\\". Your perspective on the Chan and Moto films isn't the only valid view. The great Keye Luke's perspective was that the Chan films were not racist and many agree with him. That doesn't make Chan supporters \\"racist\\" or \\"ignorant\\". Their perspective is every bit as valid as yours. Chan is a symbol of justice and wisdom to many people. You should take note of the fact that he is portrayed as being superior to the white characters in HIS movies. The same is true of the Moto films. Individuals who truly love and respect Chan and Moto as cinematic heroes are in no way attempting to be \\"ignorant\\" or \\"racist\\"."},{"Title":"Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction","review":"As an Asian American not-yet-published writer myself, I find this to be a incredibly valuable collection of some of the most talented Asian American authors today. As Jessica Hagedorn wrote in her introduction, for too long has America seen Asian Americans with this Charlie Chan/Mr. Moto image in their minds, all with bad foreign accents, and goof-ball social ettiquette, spouting out fortune cookie wisdom and acting in some subservient role to another stronger, non-Asian character. Well, we're not. And it's about time that the Asian community steps up to dispel these stereotypes.This anthology is such a refreshing composite of different writing styles and stories, depicting Asian Americans in as many unique ways as can fit onto 569 pages. I recommend this book to anyone who was ever tired of being trapped in the immigrant image (or locked in any steretype), and is ready to help break the silence."},{"Title":"Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction","review":"The previous reviewer of this book said: Chan/Moto movies....''all with bad foreign accents, and goof-ball social ettiquette, spouting out fortune cookie wisdom and acting in some subservient role to another stronger, non-Asian character.&quot; Clearly she's never seen the movies. Though Moto and Chan were not played by Asian actors, true, the Asian characters they played NEVER were 'subservient' to non-Asian characters. Their police/secret service colleagues - on their level, always treated them with respect. Lesser policement displayed prejudices - but they were used for comic relief and were always shown up. Chan was always unfailingly polite - which made the ill-mannered non-Asians around him seem like the boors they were, and Moto of course beat up on everybody who deserved it. There is nothing denigrating in the Chan/Moto movies for any Asian/Asian-American who is not obsessed with political correctness. (Treatment of the subservient black characters for comic relief is another matter entirely)."},{"Title":"Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction","review":"Lol, it's ridiculous, Moto and Charlie Chan are degrading depictions of Asians...pure and simple; it's racist. Anybody who says otherwise is trully ignorant on the subject (i.e. the previous reviewer..no wonder he/she kept him/herself anonymous). Anyway, I liked the book, but I wouldn't say it's the bible for Asian American literature. Why? Well, some of the authors featured here in are not representive of Asian American literature (i.e. Elaine Kim, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Amy Tan). There's only one book that I know that is trully Asian American, and that would be THE BIG AIIIEEEEE! But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't get this book.

While the book could be taught in a classroom, it is far from dry or academic, and would hold the interest of the lay reader. People with gender issues or those affected by another person's gender issues will find some useful information in these pages for coming to terms with the topic. Personally speaking, this book led to my own ephiphany in 1985. Highly recommended. It's a good thing used copies are available."},{"Title":"Chicken ten thousand","review":"This is a great book! They need to reprint it - the illustrations are PERFECT - my daughter loved this book!"},{"Title":"Blue Ridge Billy","review":"Blue Ridge Billy by Lois Lenski is an old fashioned Smokey Mountain story that speaks to a host of values that modern day parents want to teach their children, too. Ten year old Billy obeys his father without question, serves his mother with devotion, cares for neighbors with loyalty, yet persues his own dreams of owning a musical instrument, a true luxury in his time and place. Hardworking, loyal, happy, Billy meet his everydays with many a song learned from his fellow mountain people. His daddy has too many pressures of life on his mind to appreciate Billy's love of music and tries to squash that love out of the boy. His mother understands, but is weighed down by life's cares and has no money of her own to help Billy. The farm chores are burdensome, but Billy loyally performs them though they take all his time and energy. He wants to earn money to save for a banjo, but who would ever have money to buy his homemade goods? His neighbors are just as poor as his own family. Suspicion, poverty, and dishonest gain are all around Billy, yet his neighbor, Sarey Sue, who has even less than Billy, has a dream that encourages him on. This book is filled with the words of folk songs, unfortunately no music accompanies them. While reading this book aloud to our children, we realized what luxury we have with some kind of music available in almost every room of our small house from bedroom to living room to kitchen. CD and cassette players, piano and recorder and guitars present a feast for our ears and spirits everyday. Read this book to appreciate your own life, reinforce the values of hard work and loyalty to family, and enjoy the rich heritage of the mountain people's contribution to our United States."},{"Title":"Blue Ridge Billy","review":"Fantastic! I am a K-5 teacher. I haven't seen the book since I was a young girl. I would like to have all of Lois Lenski's books for my library. I love the morals, and life principles they teach.

He liked to hurry with his evening chores so he could scramble up the mountainside to watch the sun go down. He dreamed of the day when he might own a fiddle and play it at the neighborhood music-frolics.Billy was a very lively boy and the story of his adventures, from riding the mule to mill and fighting the Buckwheat Hollow boys, to his discovery - on a panther hunt one dark night - of the mystery of the hideout at No Man's Cove, will bring a warm response from every boy and girl. In the book the reader meets many delightful mountain people: Sarey Sue Trivett and her Granny who are in the \\"yarbing\\" business; old Uncle Pozy who teaches Billy a secret; Jeb Dotson who keeps the general store at Solitude, and Billy's own lovable family, including a stern Pappy, a very wise mother and a lively small brother and sister.Lois Lenski is performing a great service for American literature for boys and girls through her regional stories and the sympathetic, first-hand study that goes into their writing and illustrating. She brings out the beauty and character that are to be found in sections of our country which have developed a certain regional individuality.\\""},{"Title":"Beyond The Checkride: What Your Flight Instructor Never Taught You","review":"Beyond The Checkride (What your instructor never taught you) Once I began reading.

As a low-time private I know that there are many golden nuggets of knowledge that experienced pilots have to share that can save me a hard learning experience. With this in mind, I purchased Beyond the Checkride.I did learn a few things from this book, mainly that Fried disdains the FAA and wants the flying public to share his feelings. The book is filled with stories of the FAA abusing its power.In addition to its lack of content, this book is poorly written. Fried continually repeats himself and uses unclear phrases. It's amazing that any editor would allow this book to be published.If you are interested in reading a real aviation book, buy Stick and Rudder. I guarantee you'll learn from Stick and Rudder. The only thing to be learned from Beyond the Checkride is that the very same agency that issued your pilot certificate will soon try to take it back, an idea not helpful to your skills."},{"Title":"Beyond The Checkride: What Your Flight Instructor Never Taught You","review":"I am a pretty new private pilot and the title grabbed my attention.

The tone is whiny at times which gets annoying. Also the author sometimes complains that most CFI's don't fully explain items, but then doesn't explain them himself. For example why it's bad to load the aircraft outside the CG range... and then the author goes to to say that being out of CG both forward and aft are bad, but he doesn't explain _why_. Bummer, a simple drawing of a plane with the up lift vector, the down CG vector and the tail down vector, and then moving the CG vector forward and aft goes a long way to show _why_ the plane gets uncontrollable in different ways when the CG is beyond forward or aft limits.Some of the book reads like weekly magazine articles munged together with no flow.Overall a worthwhile read, but could have used another review and draft cycle."},{"Title":"Beyond The Checkride: What Your Flight Instructor Never Taught You","review":"This book is really nice and is worth the price.

His debates and fights with Donatism, Pelagianism and Manicheanism shaped him significantly. Moreover, his own perception of sinfulness penetrates many of his pages. Combined, these factors have led him to emphasize certain points of theology that many or most Eastern fathers find excessive or just wrong. Obviously he is still one of the Church's great fathers, but not a normative father for the East.This book demonstrates that the major point of departure for the Paris theologians from Augustine was over the notions of freedom and grace. Of course, students of Church history will not find this surprising, but what is useful about this book is that it is to my mind the only systematic treatment of Augustine by Orthodox thinkers of such standing and influence. Moreover, it demolishes the argument that the Orthodox in the 20th century were unfamiliar with Augustine's works. They nearly all read and understood him in the original Latin and were conversant with the background of his writings and opponents. They are also quite sympathetic with many of his points. Moreover, it shows that Orthodoxy is not \\"a monolith\\". Bulgakov in particular had a strong grasp of Augustine's work. Unfortunately, his sophiological speculations have made his own works suspect and thus it would be too easy for many modern scholars who favor the disparagement of Augustine to pile it on and condemn Bulgakov at the same time. If you read French or Russian, you will be able to study this aspect of Bulgakov, however. Not yet in English.A final useful feature of this book is its appendix of Russian Orthodox thinkers/theologians of the 19th and 20th centuries, briefly outlining their life and thought.This is a great book and I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"El Palacio de Los Placeres Celestiales (Spanish Edition)","review":"La historia de amor de Henry Manners y Frances Delamere, la labor misionera de la familia Airton, las ambiciones personales del mandar&iacute;n de la ficticia ciudada de Shishan y las intrigas del burdel de la cruel madre Liu y su s&aacute;dico hijo forman la trama de esta novela donde las historias individuales se van entrelazando a medida que la rebeli&oacute;n de los Boxers se va fraguando y donde todos y cada uno de los personajes de esta trama son afectados directamente sufriendo las consecuencias de las represalias de ambos bandos.Esta novela est&aacute; enmarcada en la China Imperial de principios de siglo, en un momento hist&oacute;rico en el que el imperio esta en franca decadencia, la corte de la Ciudad Prohibida en Pekin vive aferrada a las tradiciones milenarias, m&aacute;s aislados que nunca de sus s&uacute;bditos y las potencias occidentales - Francia, Inglaterra, Estados Unidos, Alemania y Rusia - con la colaboraci&oacute;n del Imperio del Jap&oacute;n estan disput&aacute;ndose el pastel chino dividiendo el pa&iacute;s en zonas de influencia econ&oacute;mica e introduciendo la civilizaci&oacute;n, tecnolog&iacute;a, costumbres y religiones en la atrasada China.

It is an excellent book for 1) pastors to review their doctrine 2) for interested laypeople 3) for lay level study groups who want to systematically study Christian doctrine 4) university students 5) non-Lutherans who want to learn more about traditional conservative Lutheran theology from a reliable source. The book makes conservative, confessional Lutheran theology accessible to the average layperson and non-Lutherans because is clearly explains Lutheran theology without having to know Greek, Latin, German or \\"Lutheranise\\". The book has a very useful glossary of theological terms. Also at the end of each chapter there are questions for study and review, key terms, a bibliography for further reading that includes sections of the Book of Concord that are relevant to the topic. The only drawback is that it is a little pricey for a paperback, but since the content is excellent and uniquely written, you will find it worth every cent.If you want a more academic/scholarly treatment of Lutheran doctrine I would recommend \\"Christian Dogmatics\\" (4 vols.) by Francis Pieper and the \\"Book of Concord\\"."},{"Title":"Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess: An Introduction to Doctrinal Theology (Called by the Gospel, Introductions to Christian History and)","review":"I had the honor of being Rev.

I am not someone who grasps theological concepts readily, but I found this text to be very informative, interesting, and easy to comprehend. I highly recommend it.-------------------------------------------------------------Review from publisher website:Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess offers an overview of the major doctrines of Christianity in a comprehensive, but accessible way. Written from a Lutheran perspective, this book is a helpful resource to those within that tradition and to others who seek a deeper theological understanding. Firmly rooted in Scripture, this book emphasizes the interrelatedness of all Christian teaching, with its central teaching being the doctrine of justification by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.This book is ideal as a text for university students and other educated Christian adults who seek to expand their knowledge of God's revelation and its application in human lives. It introduces and uses classical theological vocabulary and terminology, while offering clear definitions and application. Key terms, study questions, glossary, and sidebars help make this a valuable resource. Suggested readings from Scripture, the Lutheran Confessions and other secondary sources guide the reader into deeper study.This valuable resource achieves faithful accuracy and commendable clarity. Students of doctrine need both. This book supplies both. Following the traditional order of the ecumenical Creeds, the authors deftly place each locus in biblical context and connect each with Christian life today. This volume fills a need for an accessible undergraduate text and could also enrich congregational study groups. Anyone seeking a ready resource for exploring the foundations of orthodox Christian teaching will welcome this book.--James V. Bachman, Dean, School of Theology, Concordia University Irvine(Steven P.

It covers the the whole of Lutheran doctrine in a clear and concise manner that makes the work a useful book in any Lutheran's library. Unlike other scholarly works that tend to be dry, and boring, Dr. Mueller has done an excellent job at making his book readable; no easy task given either the material or the depth that Dr. Mueller covers the subject. This work has an audience that is not limited solely to pastors, but extends to the laity as well. We will be using this text as a basis of a series of doctrinal reviews for our congregation over the next two years and I personally would not have a problem with quoting sections to an adult study group. Pastors will find it useful for directing congregational members who have questions they wish to research on their own.

I hope I can explain it well enough to be helpful to you.I think your response to this book will depend on your goals. Although it is subtitled \\"An introduction to doctrinal theology,\\" it would be less confusing to view it as an \\"introduction to doctrine.\\" It does not present theology in the modern academic sense of systematic engagement with the intellectual work of theology (epistemology, metaphysics, theory of ethics, etc.)For instance, the book does not reference Karl Barth, probably the most important theologian of the 20th century. Nor Schleiermacher, perhaps most important in the 19th century. Kant: a trivial and irrelevant mention in a footnote. Aquinas: one mention, concerning his view of extraterrestrial life(!). Moltmann, Tillich, Rahner, Hegel? No, no, no, no. If you're looking for an introduction that places Lutheran thought in the context of the larger theological literature, or that engages with those traditions, this is definitely not the book.It presents an LCMS perspective (Lutheran Church Missouri Synod). There is no mention of the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church) nor engagement with the ways that it differs from LCMS (for instance, that LCMS does not allow women to be pastors, while ELCA does). So it probably won't be of as much use for ELCA folk.What it presents very well is didactic explanation of conservative Lutheran beliefs on a comprehensive range of topics, from creation to the end times that are said to come soon. The approach in general is, \\"here is a question ... what does the Bible say about it, and especially what did Jesus say?\\" The topics are primarily \\"applied,\\" in the sense of being questions that ordinary church attendees might pose: what is sin? what is grace? faith? the eucharist? can women be pastors? is homosexuality OK? what are the end times? what should one think about the popes? is the rapture biblical? what is the antichrist? If you're looking to find a conservative Lutheran answer to those kinds of questions, with reference to scripture, then it's the place to go.The book is used in LCMS colleges and seminaries and reflects this in its structure: there are lots of helpful definitions of theological terms, outlines of each chapter, and helpful self-study questions to review each chapter. It would be a good reference for someone with conservative beliefs in that tradition. It covers many theological terms, doctrines, various heresies, and the like, in a simple expository style rather than historical exegesis. Finally, although it is an \\"edited\\" work, there is no specific attribution of authorship other than a list of contributors.Personally I was looking for more emphasis on the intellectual history or \\"modern theology\\" aspects, so it didn't work for me. But I hope my review helps you decide whether it is the right book for you.

After Joe Pike leaves his congregation during the Sunday service and roars away on his motorcycle, the bishop sends him to the small church in his hometown. Both the church and the town were built by his grandfather. In Moseley, Ga., Joe Pike is forced to confront the demons of his past. Trout, too, struggles, as he fights to be his own person while constantly being reminded to &quot;remember who you are.&quot;Readers will laugh out loud when Joe Pike Moseley stuns his congregation by comparing Jesus to Elvis Presley, and sympathize with the son, who learns the difficulties of living in a town that bears one's last name.It's a coming of age story, for both father and son. Joe Pike Moseley must stop running from his past; Trout Moseley must piece together the family puzzle pieces to understand it.Both father and son find solace in the Dairy Queen, in the forms of chili dogs, ice cream, large chocolate shakes and a summer job.Readers who enjoy the Southern genre will savor this delicious summer treat.&quot;Yea, verily,&quot; as Joe Pike would say."},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"I was given this book by my mother, who had randomly bought it at a bookstore while on vacation.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am thinking of sending a copy to our pastor(who had a motorcyle for a while when younger) I would recommend it to friends and relatives who grew up with me and have some of the same memories, and a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"This is one of the most hilarious books I have read in years. Yet it is delightfully touching, and extremely clever. It is a wonderful addition to the genre of southern literature."},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"Dairy Queen Days is the southern tale of Joe Pike Mosley and his son Trout who both are struggling to find themselves. Joe Pike Mosley comes from Mosley, Georgia, named after his family. As an adult he became a minister and fled the ways of Mosley Georgia and had a life with his wife Irene and son Trout. When the novel begins, Irene has been sent of to an institution in Atlanta, and Joe Pike and Trout are fending for themselves.Circumstances arise, causing Joe Pike and Trout to return to Mosley, where they both begin a search for truth in life. The novel is a coming of age story for both father and son, and their small town life. The book did have me craving Dairy Queen and there are a lot of funny, laugh out loud moments. The ending did leave me somewhat unsatisfied, with some abrubt endings and loose ends. I would have liked to understand the characters and why they did certain things a bit better."},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"What a delightful read! Being from the South, I love all things Southern and this book was no exception. I grew up in a small southern town with a Dairy Queen and spent many happy hours there. The characters in the book are eccentric and engaging. If you want a taste of the south, &quot;Dairy Queen Days&quot; is delicious!"},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"Excellent! But does this book come in audio cassette?"},{"Title":"Dairy Queen Days","review":"This novel reminds me of my own small textile town youth and my craving for banana splits and chili dogs from Dairy Queen.

It's a wonderful collection of essays which harken back to a time when things were different in America. Not for liberals, this book will thrill conservatives of whatever age."},{"Title":"Forgive Us Our Senior Moments","review":"Walter A. Atkinson is brilliant. Not only does he compare the simple life of the 30's, 40's and 50's with wit and the comedic wisdom of a Will Rogers, he makes the comparison with today's society and drives a conservative knive into the heart of the misguided liberal agenda. I loved this book! Atkinson had me rolling on the floor with laughter only to make me stop, reflect and realize that, yes by golly, he's right. How in the world DID we get from there to here? How did it happen in such a short period of time? Even if you can't remember what it was like during a time of elderly respect, manners, REAL movie stars, true heroes, and a grand life style even without credit cards and cell phones, you'll be transported back to those days with many a smile and an occasional grumble. There's another reason I cherish these recollections; BECAUSE I'M IN THEM!"},{"Title":"Forgive Us Our Senior Moments","review":"&#65533;In the [19]40s we were raised on B flicks about war, espionage and westerns . . .didn&#65533;t care about dialogue or structure. . . . A sub-plot . . . was either a German U-boatmovie, or subsidence at the cemetery. We didn&#65533;t know from subtle emotions topie-in-the-face. Every spy movie . . . used . . . the same actors to play the same characters.We never got enough of them.&#65533; Thus writes Walter A. Atkinson railing against the demiseof yet another sub-culture from &#65533;his good old days of yore.&#65533; Forgive Us Our SeniorMoments is Atkinson&#65533;s first book and he has fun with it. It&#65533;s one man&#65533;s interpretation ofAmerica--how it used to be and how it is today. The writing is droll and delightfullysardonic, with a touch of nostalgic, old-fashioned patriotism thrown in for good measure.One can almost feel Atkinson&#65533;s perverse glee as he takes his forty year supply of &#65533;privategripes and wisdom pearls&#65533; and just &#65533;lets it rip.&#65533; Truly a volume on senior reflection andopinionated thought, these essays connect practically every social problem in Americatoday to a self-proclaimed &#65533;cultural revolution&#65533; of the mid-1960s.Chapters cover ancestors, retirement, sex, music, sports, religion and lots ofpolitics. On retirement, and a riveting sense of impending doom, Atkinson states, &#65533;. . . if Ihad my druthers, I&#65533;d be shouting the line Anita O&#65533;Day was singing with Gene Krupa&#65533;sband in 1941, &#65533;. . . just let me off uptown.&#65533;&#65533; He talks of family and friends, and adventureswhile growing up in a small Pennsylvania community. A whimsical essay on religion looksforward to year 3001 and the evolved theology of Presleyanity amid the pomp of a worldclass event celebrating the 1,024th anniversary of Elvis Presley&#65533;s death. The religiosity ofall humanity is literally absorbed there in a ceremony of August 16th and a holy pilgrimageto the sacred city of Graceland, diocese of the Most Holy Apostolic Presleyan HeartbreakHotel & Church of America, for the annual observation of Rockabilly Requiem. Thischapter, alone, is worth the price of the book.The writing is an &#65533;enlightened&#65533; citizen&#65533;s wistful return to the Great Depression,World War II, and the early Fifties--a journey with roots, so to speak--critiquing now . . .today, relative to more traditional times when America as a different place made adifference. Atkinson&#65533;s message will hit home with thousands of seniors who are living outfinal days balancing sacred moments of joy and sorrow from the author&#65533;s aptly describedblue ribbon years, against his &#65533;inane, do as you please, liberal tripe&#65533; of the last severaldecades. Most will relate to Atkinson&#65533;s throwback passion for family, country and God,and his repetitive query, &#65533;How did America ever get from there to here?&#65533;Naturally, as any thesis with a political slant will do, folks of another viewpointwill be totally bent out of shape by much of the author&#65533;s intended wisdom. Liberals will beparticularly upset as Atkinson hammers away with gleeful redundancy on foibles at theheart of their core beliefs--the first and foremost being: Scare the hell out of old folks, andkeep doing it year after year, after year, after year, ad nauseam. He takes certain notable,liberal politicians to task, citing, where apropos, their public, decadent personal lifestyles,as well as their innate inability to fool the people-at-large if ever they should be of a moodto posture as statesmen in public. As Atkinson states in his preface, &#65533;Where convictionsdiffer feel at liberty to consider my view a senior moment.&#65533;"},{"Title":"Susquehanna, River of Dreams","review":"I've spent the last 23 years enjoying the beauty of this river; not quite understanding how it has been tried and tortured over the last 400 years.

Since we have driven over the river numerous times, I was curious to learn more about it. The author was a journalist for the Philadelphia Enquirer. I was quite impressed with all of the work and research which went into writing this book. It is organized into chapters on various aspects of the history, such as settling the towns, floods, and shad restoration.

Ben Ali's diversity of topics which include love, sex, death and everyday experiences, are expressed in the most beautiful metaphors.

There were many good things about the book, I liked that it took place as close as the 7 train in Queens... and as far away as Bali and India...But I dont want to make it sound like travel poetry...it isnt...but the versatility in locations was a breath of fresh air. I would like to see the next collection maybe focusing on lets say Bali or Rishikesh or maybe just in one location in NYC... but I understand with this collection it was essential. As for entertainment, it was great, I loved the brevity, the musicality, the rhythm and the total surrealness of some of the poems. The poems were succinct, sharp and at the same time they were totally ethereal. I understand the book was devoted to his gal that passed away but alot of the work is not about that, which as bad as it may seem, I kind of liked. He made his loss into a work of art...he didnt write some boring confessional, prosaic poetry.... this stuff took work. A great first book that truly takes you all over the world and in different dimensions...theres even a poem devoted to Venus...strange... My favorite was the erotic stuff in the beginning in Miami and love poems on the Lower East Side of NYC...just my taste.

I saw him interviewed on cable TV recently where he told of his travel to India and Nepal and of his first girlfriend's sudden death in Greece which moved him to write poetry. In as much as this is dedicated to her and some of the poems are a tribute to Themis, the collection is about Ben's journey and experiences.

There are just no words to describe what a wonderful collection of poetry this book contains. From beginning to end you will be so captivated that you will definitely not want to put this book down.

(paid full price) I am a ballroom dancer and thought it would be a fun read. Granted, the dance world is described accurately, but the story could have been cut by at least 75 pages or more. I agree with other reviewers in that there were way too many characters that you didn't care about. I think the tactic here is to get so many people in the mix you have a large pool to pull out the bad guy. But I knew the book \\"jumped the shark\\" when the homeless girl living the one the main character's yard was welcomed with open arms to live in the house and also began instruction as a teacher. That was stretching it a bit for me. The sex scenes were a bit forced I thought. The two characters were in a boat and they started looking pretty good to each other. The rest of the time, there was a lot of distrust between them. I think the author had a hard time deciding whether or not this was a mystery or action romance. Neither view took off very successfully. If I read another one of Ms. Graham's books, it will be at a used bookstore price or from the library."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"When beautiful dancer Lara Trudeau dies while dancing of a drug overdose, the police are quick to write it off as another tragic accident of perscription drug abuse. But one cop isn't so sure--and he gets his brother, ex-FBI profiler and private investigator Quinn O'Casey to look into the case. The obvious suspect is another dancer, Shannon Mackay. Shannon has lost her partner and her lover to Lara several years earlier and an 'accident' on the dance floor had cost her her competitive career. But Quinn likes Shannon--likes her a lot. Of course, there's really only one thing he's sure of--his own judgment is fatally flawed.Quinn puts Lara's case together with several other drug-related deaths that seem connected to the dance studio where Lara and Shannon worked. It could be coincidence, but Quinn doesn't believe in coincidence. He signs up for dance lessons, starts to fall for Shannon, and learns that she is chased by her own demons--or maybe by something far more real than mythical demons. It's tough enough solving a case, but both Shannon and Quinn have major issues they need to work for before they can deal with the attraction that flows between them like, well, like a dance.Author Heather Graham writes convincingly of the world of ballroom dance and of sultry southern Florida. Damaged but hunky Quinn makes a great foil for frightened but spunky Shannon. Their issues parallel and they find that working through together gives each of them strength to admit their true goals. Of course, before any kind of long-term romance can develop, they'll have to stay alive. And someone seems intent on making sure that doesn't happen.DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR is an enjoyable romance."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"Heather Graham is one of my favorite authors. I read a great deal and some authors I buy because of their name.Dead on the Dance Floor, is a good book. If you like the world of dance you will probably like it. It has alot about dances and dancers.While I find it hard to tell a tango from a cha-cha, The murder mystery was well written. I liked the main characters but somehow there was little doubt who the murderer was. I figured out who, early. It was only near the end I figured out why and how. When the author gave us alittle more information.As far as the secondary characters, I found it hard to care about people who had nothing better to do than spend a great deal of time and money on dancing contests, bars, and flashy costumes.These were some of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read about. Somehow the Dr. and his wife were the worst.Frankly, by the end I didn't care who killed her.For the best read by Heather Graham, I recommend DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS or PICTURE ME DEAD."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"Though this book was better than the last few I've read by Heather Graham, I'm still wondering how on earth she could ever have earned the distinction of \\"New York Times Best-Selling Author.\\"I don't know what her obsession is with the words \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" that she feels the need to insert them at least once a paragraph. It comes off sounding as if her characters are a bunch of kindergardeners who just learned a new word that their parents told them not to say, so they overuse it to the point of ridiculousness. It's not a speech pattern in a character -- it's every single character in every single book she writes. I'm not sure if it's meant to make her books more \\"mature,\\" or to make her characters sound tough, but it's distracting and makes her dialogue annoying to read.I'm also not sure why she feels the need to fill her books with so many characters. I've finally learned that when reading a Heather Graham novel, it's impossible to keep track of everyone, so I no longer try. And don't even try to figure out why the culprit killed anyone, because he and his reasons get so lost in the shuffle of all the characters and their roles in the story that it'll take you an extra week to try to figure it all out."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"A long time fan of Ms. Graham I'm always amazed by her creativity and the setting that she has chosen for this read is not only original but fun. I admit to not knowing a Samba from a rumba except that they are indeed dances that sound like a lot of fun. As a result the reader is introduced to a lifestyle that is rather popular but unfamiliar to many and the perfect setting for this fast-paced romantic suspense.Shannon McKay runs a dance studio that has been not having the best of luck as far as it clients goes, two different woman fall dead from an overdose of drugs. Are they related or two different problems with the same sad outcome? She is warned at a dance competition \\"she's next.\\" Next for what though?Quinn O'Casey as been asked by his brother to investigate the death of dance star Lara Trudeau. He has had a personal relationship with her and doesn't think that she would kill herself. Doug knows in his brother will be able to get to the bottom of it...especially when he introduces the fact that one of Quinn's last cases may have had a connection to Lara's death. Quinn reluctantly agrees and finds himself taking dance lessons with Shannon being his teacher. He is attracted to her and doesn't know if he should act on his feelings or shelve them until he can cross her off of his list of suspects. It's a race against time before a killer strikes again. Will he be able to figure out who is killing the dancers before Shannon becomes the next victim?This was a real fast-paced read that was entertaining and different. Although there are quiet a few secondary characters I don't think that it's so many that the reader can't keep track. Plenty of personalities is what keeps this from being too technical or bogged down. Ms. Graham is an author that always delivers and this is a read that you won't want to miss!"},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"As the final confrontation came down on the floor of the dance studio, I thought: \\"Please, not the pooper-scooper. That is too lame.\\" Aghhhh, it was the pooper-scooper and it was too pat a climax. I cannot count the characters in this book. I kept having to flip back to see who was who. Actually, the book was fairly interesting, but it was kind of muddled and hard to keep track of everyone in it. Quinn and Shannon were okay, but I find it hard to believe that after 8 years of not dancing comepetitively anyone could just 'waltz' onto a floor and win a competition. Could Sarah Hughes just decide to re-enter amatuer skating and with the U.S. championships without first competing in some (any) other events? Oh well, the book was okay even if confusing and kind of cliched. Not great but maybe if you're a fan of Heather Graham, this is what you like. This is the first book I've read by her and will probably be the last. It was not suspenseful enough for me, and the mystery just was not there. The first bad guy was pretty obvious. The second not so obvious, but not really that menacing either. And in the end, everybody ended up happy with nothing but expectations of future lifelong happiness. sigh. Disapointed. But that final pooper-scooper. What a let down."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"Dead on the Dance Floor tries too hard to have a wide pool of suspects to the murder. The subplot of the homeless girl, while sweet, is too convenient-- she's homeless because her stepfather was trying to molest her and her mother wouldn't defend her, not because she was a bad kid; she just happens to set up camp in the yard of a sympathetic person; she just happens to be a natural dancer loaded with talent, and the sympathetic person works at a dance studio.But what really yanked me out of the story was the ballroom dance move called... The Pooper-Scooper.Every time I read that phrase, all romance & grace fled my mind while picturing baggies of doggie doo.I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but the attempt fell flat.The Pooper-Scooper."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"I enjoy reading Heather Graham mystery novels. They have unique situations, characters and plots. There is humor and human interest and \\"Dead on the Dance Floor\\" is no exception. It was very interesting to enter the world of professional ballroom dancing and to meet various personalities as you might expect in the real world. Ms. Graham did a great job on research and making the story come to life. I enjoyed the character development on both primary and secondary characters in the book and wish there could be a sequel/follow-up book on them! A fun read and wonderful surprises!"},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"I have enjoyed some --but not all --of Heather Graham's works. Dead on the Dance Floor had a promising premise, especially since I'm a dancer myself. However, I couldn't even get through this one. I finally gave up. Graham often has too many minor characters in her books which muddle the story. This one had a lot of those with all of the teachers and dancers at the school. It was difficult keeping track of who was who."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"Having attained first prize in every ballroom competition that she competed in, everyone agrees that Lara Trudeau is the dancing queen though all agree that the Prima Donna is a detestable nasty egomaniac. Currently, she is expected to triumph again as she vies for the trophy of the Universe of Champions event. However, this time during one of her classy moves Lara abruptly dies fittingly on the floor where she reigned as the monarch of dance.Quinn O'Casey heads the investigation into the ballroom dance queen death that seems so suspicious. However, he goes undercover to learn what he can about the regulars, employees and owner of the Moonlight Sonata Dance Studio. His deepest interest is in the owner Shannon MacKay, but he is not sure if he wants to handcuff her as a criminal or as the woman he is falling in love with.Police procedural romance readers will take great delight with the terrific DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR. The story line hooks the audience from the first step until the final pirouette. Because Lara is universally loathed, Quinn has too many suspects to contend with, but Shannon is the most obvious of all. Adding to his tension is he wants to not only believe in her innocence he wants to dance with her preferably in the bedroom not the ballroom. Shannon is his ideal partner so that the audience obtains a fine story that in many ways feels like a modernization of the classic film Laura.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"I love Heather Graham.

There were some moments of suspense, but over all left me thinking, I wish this would end so I can read a book I will enjoy."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"Lara Trudeau, one of the top ballroom dancers, dances her last dance, a spectacular performance, only to wind up dead on the dance floor. Cause: cardiac arrest due to a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol. Most believe it to be an accident, but Shannon doesn't. Sure, Lara was known to take a pill or two right before a dance to calm her nerves, but she never mixed with alcohol. To Shannon, it doesn't add up, but everyone else is convinced... all except for Doug O'Casey.Doug had been sleeping with Lara and doesn't believe that Lara would have done that to herself either. Being a cop, and everyone at Moonlight Sonata dance studio knows that, he asks his brother, Quinn, to investigate. Quinn, a P.I., doesn't really want the job - he's supposed to be on vacation, sees the distress in Doug and reluctantly agrees.Quinn begins asking questions, seeming innocent, but Shannon is suspicious of him, just as he is suspicious of her. Shannon was previously Ben's dance partner, but after a broken ankle, Ben had moved on to Lara, eventually marrying her, then divorcing. If anyone would be a suspect of murder, it would be Shannon. But Quinn spends more time with Shannon, becoming convinced it isn't her, and getting closer to her all the time. He's falling for her, just as she is for him, and neither are really liking the idea.I would have never guessed who it was. There were too many possibilities, and at one point, it didn't make sense. You do get the point at the end, but it still leaves a bad taste. It was like the book was hastily written without any real thought. Surprising just the same.Enough details of ballroom dancing so that you get the idea of what's going on. If you watch Dancing with the Stars, you'll catch on really quick. I do think, however, that the ballroom dancing angle was played just a little bit overboard.Shannon and Quinn start off hot and heavy and remain that way. Other than the sparks between them, I didn't feel much spark in the rest of the novel, which would be disappointing for me. I've always given Graham's novels at least a 4-star rating if not a 5 - this one doesn't deserve that much from me. But I won't give up on her."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"I really enjoyed this book and the story moved fast. This is the first book that I read by this lady but I do agree with one reviewer about the pooper scooper stuff. That was a little much but I enjoyed all the other characters and the story. A really good murder mystery in the world of dance."},{"Title":"DEAD ON THE DANCE FLOOR","review":"This is book number 2 in a series and one of Heather Graham's better mystery romances. Quinn is great and can laugh at himself when he is trying to learn to dance and is truly a good big brother to Doug. Shannon, Quinn's love interest is a bit stiffer and tends to be somewhat dense at times but still is likeable. People who inhabit the dance studio are interesting, not only the instructors but also the students. While there is too much gossip and fussing among the dancers, it is still an entertaining book that I recommend."},{"Title":"Wrestling with God and Cancer: A Personal Journey","review":"I have always had my doubts about God, but feared my skepticism and thought it shameful. After reading this book though, I realized, more than ever, that my fears were not so unusual or wrong. Beverly Sinke's words took my most sought-out questions and gave them new hope and light. She is truly inspirational -- she has been through so much pain, and yet, looks to life and God with outstretched arms. And not only do we read her inspirational words, but many other great thinkers interwoven into the novel. We all have something to learn from Beverly's autobiography; foremost, that our relationship to God is too precious to be cast aside because of tragedy. If you have any doubts about your faith, make yourself acquainted with this story."},{"Title":"The McIntyres of Rose Hill","review":"Wait until you read this wonderfully and character rich book by Shannon Dixon Smith.

People in love are doing foolish things, they embed their love into reality and then reality is no longer compatible with their world.\\" L. PapadopoulosPrologue to a review:It was a delightful surprise to me in the early 1990's that the author of 'The Christian Tradition, 'Christianity and Classical Culture' and editor of 'the World Treasury of Modern Religious Thought' has started his rigorous career in 1955 with 'Fools for Christ'. Although Pelikan's theme in his study of six characters was a reflection on three concepts of truth, goodness, and beauty, yet mystical theology showed up early in his Lutheran mind.Folly as Virtue:The concept of foolish wisdom, first fully articulated in [the West during] the Renaissance, has an ancient history. The archetypal wise fool is Socrates who explicitly claimed that his wisdom derived from his awareness of his ignorance and whose distinctive teaching method consisted in exposing the foolishness of the wise. Jesus, whom Christian tradition proclaims as the Logos and the Wisdom of God, was regarded during his lifetime as \\"insane\\" by his family and was deemed by his opponents as being possessed by Beelzebub. Not only was his behavior scandalous to the religious establishment, but also his teaching, from his \\"beatitudes\\" to his parables, challenged the Sacred Text and offended traditional wisdom. Even Peter, who should have known better, was shocked by Jesus' prediction of his passion and death and had to be reminded that he was judging \\"not by God's standards but by human standards (Mk 8:33), an anticipation of Paul's contrast between \\"God's folly\\" and the \\"wisdom of this world.\\" Jesus' words to those who wish to follow him represent the height of folly: \\"If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up the cross and begin to follow in my footsteps. Nickolas Pappas, Theological Studies 62(2001)Fools for Christ:Jaroslav Pelikan, who appears to have had little time for the considering of literature and music, has pioneered building bridges to the arts. An early example of this were his essays on Dostoevsky and Bach in addition to kierkegaard, Paul, Luther, and Nietzche in his early book \\"Fools for Christ,\\" published in 1955. Bach appeared again in a monograph titled \\"Bach Among the Theologians,\\" a further testimony to Pelikan's stature in bridging theology with the arts was made by Yo-Yo Ma, who appeared together with Pelikan at \\"Musical and Theological Reflections on Bach,\\" in 1992. The John Kluge Center, which I partially quoted, stated that\\"By relating Bach's work to the heritage of the Lutheran Reformation -- musical as well as theological -- Pelikan places Bach within the context of the theological currents of his time.\\" Pelikan also demonstrates how Bach's sacred music complements and illustrates Lutheran theological trends.In Conclusion:It has been claimed that storytelling and reason are no longer the way to wisdom. Recently, but there remains another path to wisdom, namely, that of the holy fools (mrosophia).\\"By taking negative theology as an example of \\"foolish Wisdom\\" I do not intend to mean that the former is to be equated with the latter but only that there is in negative theology a conscious recognition, akin to wise foolishness, that human reason and discourse are ultimately incapable of knowing and speaking about God as God is.\\" On negative theology"},{"Title":"Mathematics on the Internet: A Resource for K-12 Teachers","review":"I read this one month ago and have already begun to use various websites with my 7th grade math classes.

Many of the games are well-known childhood classics, but many of them are either foreign or totally new.The book offers lots of ways to play versions of popular games with a make-your-own version. Naturally, it doesn't tell you explicitly, \\"Don't buy game X, you can make your own!\\", but it does give great instructions on how to make paper playing boards for games like Shut the Box, Beetle (like a drawing version of Cootie), and also how to get the most out of a game like Checkers.As far as outside games, it can't be beat, there are dozens of variations on classics like hopscotch, hide-and-seek, and that eternal favorite: tag!This book is a great gift idea for Moms, Teachers, Daycare Providers, and it's a great one to leave around for the teenaged babysitter if you're going out and you don't want the kids to spend the evening in front of the TV.

All of the illustrations are Van Gogh's famous paintings. We see the exterior of the building he rented, the interior of his rented room, sights he saw as he walked, on and on throughout his day. Woven amongst the daily events are facts about this famous artist and explanations as to why he used his unique technique and signature bright colors.The style of writing makes this suitable for reading aloud to children aged 3 and up. The story is easy to read but is not patronizing in tone. It is perfect for a first biography about Van Gogh for young children. It is also interesting to hear what children have to say in reaction to Van Gogh's unique artwork. My sons loved hearing this book, at ages 3 and 6."},{"Title":"Flying's Strangest Moments: Extraordinary But True Stories from Over 1100 years of Aviation History (Strangest series)","review":"FLYING'S STRANGEST MOMENTS is part of a series put out by England's Robson Books (CRICKET'S STRANGEST MOMENTS, GOLF'S STRANGEST ROUNDS, POLITICS' STRANGEST CHARACTERS, etc.), some two dozen titles being published to date. Like the others in the series, John Hardings' 2006 volume relates 'extraordinary but true' anecdotes, in this case drawn from 1,000+ years of aviation history.Harding's book is chronologically arranged, the first entry dating from 875 A.D. when Abbas Ibn Firnas, a young astronomer/poet/daredevil, made mankind's inaugural glider flight. (One of Baghdad's airports is named after Firnas). The closing anecdote dates from June 2005 when three Brits broke the world's record for highest dinner party(!) by dining on poached salmon, duck a l'orange, etc. in a balloon at 24,262 feet before skydiving back to earth.In between those two incidents, Harding presents stories, usually 2-3 pages in length, on: the first and only(!) test of the Conical Parachute in 1817; the famous 'Mystery Airship' that appeared in American skies in 1896; the various failed aircraft invented by 'Colonel' Samuel Franklin Cody; Harry Houdini's flights in Australia circa 1910; career highlights of Hollywood stuntmen Ormer Locklear and Dick Grace; Amelia Earhart; the Hindenburg tragedy; Rudolf Hess' 1941 flight to England; the 'Lady be Good' saga; the 1945 B-25 Empire State Building crash; Buddy Holly's death; various crashes attributed to bombs/hijacking/mechanical failures; unbelievable survival stories; Dick Rutan and Jeanna Yaeger's 1986 round-the-world flight; Matthias Rust landing in Red Square; etc.Overall I found FLYING'S STRANGEST MOMENTS an interesting read. Some stories were well-known to me; others less so. One quibble: I question the extraordinary but true subtitle since Harding includes stories dealing with ghost planes, ghost crews, etc. but that's just me.Considering the price tag of $13.00, you can't go wrong picking up a copy of Harding's book. It's a real smorgasbord of aviation history: try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Chitin-Chitosan: The Choice Food Supplement for over 10,000 Physicians in Japan","review":"I read health and nutrition books for pleasure and this was one I could barely get through.

Shortly thereafter, it takes you through the experiences of those who have taken chitin-chitosan as a supplement for their illness and how their health had improved within a short period of time. Then starts another chapter on another disease following the same outline. For those who are unfamiliar with medical terminologies, this book may be hard to follow at times.

Indexed in the back is a 'phrase finder' that highlights the major word in the clich&eacute;/proverb.In the introduction, the editor notes that proverbs are defined as expressions that \\"sum up situations and give advice in short, terse phrases.\\" Clich&eacute;s, on the other hand, are often condemned, overused proverbs that indicate a speaker's or writer's complete lack of originality. What's more, the editor disagrees with those who contend that sayings are supposed to \\"embody the values of the culture that uses them,\\" and proves the point by offering a variety of contradictory proverbs that are used by the same culture. For example \\"too many cooks spoil the broth\\" and \\"many hands make light work.\\"I would strongly recommend this book to those who do not speak English as a first language and for the rest of us, too, who just like language in general.-- Regina McMenamin"},{"Title":"William James's \\"Springs of Delight\\": The Return to Life (The Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)","review":"This delightful book, for which Oliver took the time to paginate references to the more generally accessible Library of America two-volume set of WJ's work, reaches out to a broad audience in the early 21st century.

I am also in full time ministry as a youth pastor, which anyone knows who is in the ministry, you don't have a whole lot of time.

I personally disagree with the negative reviews and subscribe instead to the positive ones, as this book has been a most influential read. (have read it 3x and will do so again.) The author puts forth the premise that the family is one of God's gifts, and that the family unit is one of the most influential means for learning God's love/initiating a relationship with Jesus Christ that covers multiple generations/ensuring the continuity of faith. So where is Satan's most effective battle...the family. And how to most effectively neutralize the family...eliminate the point man (i.e-eliminate the Godly effectiveness of the man; destroy the bond between husband and wife/father and child...) I recently took this book to China with me (along with my Bible) for a 3rd reading on the 14 hour flight. Showed it to my Chinese national guide who was about to become a father for the 1st time.

It describes the importance of leading as fathers and husbands as it relates to sexual identity, fidelity in marriage, training children, and spiritual disciplines. It discusses the need for men to be physically present in the home in order to influence their family. He concludes by stressing the needs for men to be solid \\"rocks\\" as the foundation of their homes as well as role models for their family members.To begin, Farrar identifies the attack points that Satan uses to destroy men - their marriages and their parenting. Satan attempts to divide and conquer families as a means to destroy individuals. So Farrar stresses the importance of staying faithful in marriage. He does not hold back when he describes the seriousness of adultery. He notes that every man is susceptible to abandoning his wife and betraying her by having sex with another person. Especially relevant was his observation that, among Christian leadership, God often requires a \\"character test\\" of sexual integrity that will continue to surface until a man passes the test. Until then, God cannot use him as a leader or bless his ministry.He proceeds to discuss the need for leaders to be spiritually \\"fit\\" men. He emphasizes the need for men who are not \\"anorexic\\" by not feeding on the Word of God or \\"bulimic\\" by never applying the Bible to their lives. He continues by emphasizing the need for men to engage in regular prayer. These two components - prayer and Bible study/application - are the core values for men who aspire to be leaders in their homes. All need some form of spiritual exercise.Farrar then talks about the teamwork needed between a husband and a wife as they juggle the responsibilities of keeping the 747 of their family aloft. As pilot and co-pilot, they must practice mutual understanding, accountability, and submission. He distinguishes between a complementarian view of spiritual leadership in the home and male authoritarianism. Ultimately, the husband is charged to model the type of understanding, accountability, and submission he has to Jesus in order to make it easy for the wife to be understanding, accountable, and submitted to him.Regarding parenting, he then examines Eph 6:4 as a structure for how fathers can treat their children in a way that positively affects their sexual identities. By balancing fairness, tenderness, firmness with the ways of the Lord, fathers can point the compass to direct their children to find their identity in who God made them as male or female. Farrar then spends an entire chapter with a very personal story encouraging fathers to take the initiative to talk to their children about sex.This book is a useful introductory book that sets the foundation for the need of male leadership in the home. Point Man is not a comprehensive book on men's issues, nor is it an in-depth study on marriage or parenting \\"how-to.\\" It strongly emphasizes the need for faithfulness in marriage, the need for Bible study and prayer, and a complementarian framework of the family. As such, it does provide the beginnings of its subtitle, \\"How a Man Can Lead His Family.\\" A man reading this would conclude, \\"To lead my family, I need to be faithfully committed to my wife, I need to study my Bible and pray regularly, and I need to parent my child according to Eph 6:4.\\" Now, there are more detailed applications of how to do these things, but it is very basic material. For example, on how to not embitter your children, he briefly describes each in this list, \\"By over-protection, by favoritism, by discouragement, by forgetting that the child is growing up, by neglect, and by bitter words and outright physical cruelty\\" (188-190). Again, there is only so much Farrar can do in this 235 page book.The strengths of this book are many. Its gripping introduction of leading an ambushed patrol in the jungles of Vietnam and its frequent analogies to concrete images (flying a 747 with your wife, giving your kids a compass) make this a book that men might actually read! It is not too academic or theoretical to be grasped and enjoyed. Further, the personal stories by Farrar about how he told his own son about sex or his descriptions about how to avoid lusting over porn at the airport take specific imperatives (\\"Be faithful to your wife; don't even lust.\\") and give it a step-by-step, real-life flavor. I could see and identify with the scenarios Farrar described, and I imagine other men would be able to as well.The biggest weakness of this book is its conclusion. How is one supposed to implement these ideals? What should a reader do next to begin? In the study guide edition, Point Man does provide some good discussion questions for a small group setting. But if one does not have the study guide edition or a small group to discuss with, then the reader is left with only a vague sense of direction.This book would be best suited for a men's small group, although it would have limited application for singles. But amongst married men and/or fathers, Point Man is good for initiating a discussion and flushing out what male leadership looks like at home."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"If you are looking for a book that will guide and teach you in the areas of being a better father or husband, I would highly recommend this book.

For any man who is starting his trip down the road to establishing a truly Christian family, this is a book that lays down a good foundation."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"There are a lot of great books for Christian men on the market today, but this is definitely one of the best. My husband attended a seminar where Steve Farrar was the guest speaker, and that seminar changed my husband's life. My husband came home with a whole new concept of what it means to be the spiritual leader of a family. It helped him shape a whole new identity that he'd never been able to conceptualize before. Steve Farrar has a very powerful message for men. My husband and I highly recommend all of his books. I even bought a copy of this book for my brother-in-law for Christmas. Steve's wife Mary has also written a similar book for women called Choices."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"This book is an absolute must for young and old men. In todays society of homosexuality, rebellion, sleeping around before (and during) marriage, all of the &quot;socially acceptable&quot; things we watch on TV, Farrar points out how to give up the heathen and live like a MAN, not a mouse. This book should be read by MEN who want to make a difference and return this country to what it was - a worldwide leader in morals, ethics, standars, values, and best of all FREEDOM from the garbage that holds mice back from being MEN!"},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"I read this book twice: once after going to a seminar conducted by the author, and the second time in preparation for leading my own men's study many years later. My recollection was that it was a powerful and helpful book, but I was greatly disappointed the second time around. On the second reading I realized that while the author trumpets God vision for men throughout the book, he doesn't back it up with Scripture. He just simply asserts Biblical truths (maybe?) without grounding you in God's word as a way to get there. By all means read it, if you are trying to understand Biblical manhood, but ask questions to yourself as you read, and supplement this book with your own studies of Scripture. You might want to go to somebody like Wayne Grudem to get fully grounded Scriptural answers on these topics."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"This book should be required reading for all married men. It gives practical advice for men to step up as leaders in their family. It can be used individually or for a small group. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"If you are a newly married man, Read it. If you are a new father, Read it. If you are a new christian with a family, Read it. If you want a better understanding of of what it means to be a provider a leader from a real mans point of view, Read it. Steve Farrar has an honest way with word. You this book is not what you are expecting."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Point Man is a must read for ALL men. It is timeless and to the point. It is a book on not just being a leader, but being a leader of the family. We need to have more men be accountable for their actions. This book will lead you in your roles as a husband and father. It will help you understand just how important you are to the family. Real men read this book."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"He uses too many military and sports illustrations. He tends to generalize about culture. He uses some Christian Psychological and sociological studies. I mean, who cares? If you don't know how the surveys are taken and what questions they ask, what can you tell from them? Anyway, my biggest beef is that he does not talk about about how Christians should function within the Church. Raising a family should be done within the family of families, which is the church. It should not solely be the duty of the lone point man on patrol. I have these same criticisms about \\"Finishing Strong.\\" However, this book is not as gimicky or poorly written as finishing strong. He gives some interesting advice about \\"habits of the heart.\\" He makes me look at my own walk with God and how I can do better, which is the purpose of this book. Christians need to be encourage on how to pass on their faith to the next generation. I might even read this book again. I would never do that with \\"Finishing Strong.\\"I marginally recommend this book to young fathers. We read this in our small group and everybody else liked it so I am bumping it up to four stars."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Ultimately, Point Man may help many men lead their families toward safe terrain. But I had numerous problems with this book. Farrar seems to underestimate the importance of investing in daughters. He argues that men should focus more on their sons than their daughters. He also lightly suggests that white families may follow in the destructuve footsteps of African American families: with no father in the home and all. This did not seem an appropriate suggestion to me.My third problem is that the first fifty or so pages of Farrars book (which are poorly written) are tainted with dooms-day propoganda intended to scare we men into action. I realize that this book was written many years ago, but despite Farrars claims that the family is going to hell, and so is society, crime is now down for the eighth year in a row, abortion rates are down, teen pregnancy is down, violence and drug use are down as well. Where's the doom Steve? I am tired of Christian writers failing to be objective in their literature. I can hardly trust the Christian writer to tell me the plain truth.This book is not all bad. Farrar encourages men to take charge, lead, love, protect and strengthen the home through staying on track with God. Get off your buts, seems to be the battle cry. And so Steve's voice is important.But the writing is so poor that I can only muster up two stars for this book. By the way, every other book I have reviewed I have given five stars. I'm an easy sell. But I'm not buying this. The message is important, but the messenger is cliche."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Better yet, turn on one-click. You will want to get this book as soon as possible. I have (as my son likes to joke) 972 books on being a dad. Many are good, some are excellent, but I wish I had bought this one first. It's that good. It will motivate you to be the dad all the other 972 books tell you how to be.How? Quite simply, Farrar writes like he knows exactly where you are. You may anywhere from what he describes as being spiritually anorexic or bulimic, or you may be a \\"point man\\" - it doesn't matter. He will help you along to the next level. He is realistic enough to recognize that after 25 years of bad habits, you most likely won't be reformed overnight. However, he offers good encouragement to keep at it, do what you know God created you to do.Chapter like \\"Real Men Don't\\" and \\"A One-Woman Kind of Man\\" will leave many men uncomfortable. Guys, I think too many of us are a \\"husband of one wife\\" physically but are cheating mentally or even emotionally, or at least are just not dedicated enough to living our lives God's way. Farrar will encourage you to not just be a husband of one wife, but to be the kind of guy God wants you to be as a matter of total lifestyle. As the book of James points out, \\"when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin.\\" I think many of us can relate.Although it does have some material on being a father (such as chapters 2, 9, and 10), it's not primarily a book on being a dad. I think Farrar has his priorities in the right place: you can't be a Good Dad until you are a Good and Godly Man. Then come back and read Farrar's \\"King Me\\" or one of the 972 other good books on being a dad.Really, the book will probably not really give you any new information. So why get it? Because it will reinforce what you knew to be true, and will (perhaps, with God's help) help you to not just be a hearer of the word, but a doer as well."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"This book full of practical advice that can be easily applied in today's separated world. The man, as husband, father and head of the family unit is divinely responsible for the leadership, love, protection and mentoring of our family and is further responsible to other men in the body of Christ for the example he sets. This non-condemning book speaks from understanding and love about the unique sins men face; and, about how accountability and fellowship provide a valuable tool for all Christian men seeking to lead a healthy, happy and blessed life according to the Lord's word. I recommend this book for any man, regardless of his personal maturity in Christ, as a guidebook for saving himself, his family and his soul."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Men, God has called you to be the leaders of your home. Don't take this calling lightly. Steve will help you understand the importance of your calling. He helps equip you to be the man God wants you to be. Steve's other books Standing Tall and Finishing Strong will add more insight to help you win. Point Man is a must read."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Great book every man needs to read. We as men are losing the war in the homefront and our families are suffering for it. This book shows us what it means to take the the point and how to lead our families into the battle of this failing world. What an encourager to step up to be a Godly man."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"I have been using this book from the beginning ofpublication. Had given away my last copy and purchased to use some materials out of the book ona series of sermons on Fathers.

I first read this book back in the 1990s when Promise Keepers was getting started. I recently reread it, and found it full of reminders about what I should be doing as a Christian husband and father. I like the fact that Farrar does not pull any punches, but uses a direct style that does not leave much room for interpretation.Overall it is a great read, but I would not label it a classic. It has some really strong chapters about marriage, spiritual disciplines, raising godly children. But, it has a few segways that are distracting. I definitely recommend Point Man for any young man who is wondering what to do as a man of God. It is also useful for older men who may be struggling, or remain clueless about what masculine Christianity is all about. This book will help point you in the right direction."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Farrar lays it on the line for men. A no nonsense look at the hard facts that face fathers, and guidelines to use to weather the storm of life. A must read for all men, even the ones who think everything is already in order."},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"Point Man by Steve Farrar is an excellent book aimed at helping men navigate parenthood, marriage, and spiritual fitness, amidst a culture increasingly rejecting biblical views of being a husband and father. In a direct and clear way, \\"Point Man\\" addresses what it really means to be a husband and father. Farrar describes his purpose: \\"This is a book for men. It's a book for men that talks about *how* to become an effective leader in your home. After years of research and study, it's my conclusion that effective male leadership in the homes of America is going the way of the dinosaur.\\" He talks heart-to-heart to \\"men who love their families, who care for their families, and who would die for their families.\\" The book is devoid of fluff, focusing on hard principles, real-world examples, and spiritual fitness.

However there is also the pernicious subtext that, 'Don't worry if your son is greedy, materialistic and unGodly, just so long as he's straight, gets and stays married, holds down a decent job, and doesn't touch drugs, phew, you've won the war.'"},{"Title":"Point Man","review":"&quot;What is a real man?

Roy is used to being the new kid. Roy's father's work keeps the Eberhardts family from living in one place. After moving from Montana to Florida Roy longs to return to the tall mountains of Montana. Roy perceives that Florida is flat and boring. He goes to school only to be beat up by Dana Matherson. One day when his face is forcefully pushed up against the school bus window he sees a young boy his age running down the street with no shoes on his feet. The boy runs past the bus stop and into the distance leaving Roy with a mystery.Roy searches for the mystery boy. When Roy sees him running down the street again he chases him in hot pursuit, only to lose him in a golf course. When he is back in school he is confronted by Beatrice. Beatrice is a strong soccer player who for some reason doesn't want Roy to have anything to do with the mystery boy, making herself very clear with force. But Roy will not give up and what he ends up uncovering is something he never dreamed of. A series of accidents are occurring at the construction site of Mother Paula's American Pancake House; alligators in the port-o-potties, Snakes let lose on the site, and the seats to the vehicles being stolen. All of the numerous accidents are set to stop the company before they complete their ground breaking ceremony. The reason, Owls.The mystery boy, Mullet Fingers, must stop Mother Paula's at all costs. The ground breaking ceremony will bury a family of rare owls alive. Mullet Fingers ran away from home to care for the natural beauty of Florida. But there is little land untouched by man and Mullet Fingers will do anything to keep what's left natural. Mullet fingers doesn't want anyone else to get involved with his troubles but when Roy finds out, he is bent on finding out more. He discovers that the owls are endangered and that the company doesn't have permission to build. Their E.I.S or Environmental Impact Statement has disappeared from the construction site file and the company's workers will not admit that there are owls on the site. Roy, Beatrice, and Mullet Fingers do everything to stop the Pancake house. But will they stop them in time to save the owls.Carl Hiaasen shows you how important the natural beauty of our country is. We should not bury it alive. We should not cover it with concrete and pancake houses. We should enjoy it and take care of our natural surroundings.This book slowly gives you the mystery and it makes you care for the owls as much as Mullet Fingers does in the book. It keeps you interested and makes you angry at the president of Mother Paula's for such heartlessness. This book made me want to go to Florida and enjoy the natural beauty it has to enjoy."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I would recommend the book because I thought the book Hoot was pretty good. Some of the parts of the book were really interesting like when Beatrice told Roy that the running boy was her step brother. Some people called him Mullet Fingers, so he ran away. Another funny thing in the book Hoot is when Beatrice bit a hole in the bike tire. In the book Hoot there are also some confusing parts. One confusing part is everybody's nicknames. I thought all the nicknames were new people coming into the story. Roy is a good friend and he loves animals and that what makes Hoot so interesting."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I would recommend this book to people who love animals and care about saving them to construction. Yes I learned something. Fight for what you believe in and there will always be people who will support you.

I really like this book and I will definitely read another book by Carl Hiaasen."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was an excellent book. It had me hanging on its every word. When I was reading it I could not put it down even to go to bed. This book taught me that if you are creative enough you can accomplish anything you want to do.

I think it's a wonderful novel for middle school kids, because it shows that no matter who you are or what age you are you can save the wildlife that is right in front of us that we never take the time to appriciate. It's also good fopr Middle Schoolers because there are a lot of characters and situations thatkids can relate to like the Dana Matherson Situation or being the new kid. Anyways, to conclude this review, BUY HOOT NOW!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I recently read the book Hoot by Carl Hiaasen. This story took place in the fall in a town called Coconut Cove Florida. This book is an adventure that kept me reading it. There were a few main characters: Roy Eberhart, who was a new kid at Trace Middle School; Beatrice Leep, who was a blonde haired girl that played soccer and was not very nice; Mullet Fingers (Napoleon Bridger Leep) and lastly Dana Matherson, who was a bully at their school.This story is about 3 kids that try to save miniature owls from their home being taken over by a new Pancake House. They do many things, most of them funny to help save these Owls. Roy keeps chasing Mullet Fingers to try to figure out what he was doing and while he is chasing him, Beatrice is trying to keep Roy away from her brother. Once Roy figures out what Mullet Fingers is trying to accomplish, he and Beatrice help Mullet Fingers. There are many funny chapters in this book that kept me reading. It never lost my attention. Roy, Beatrice and Mullet Fingers become great friends.Roy shares with is class what is going to happen to these miniture owls if the pancake house is built in their town. They would all be destroyed. He finally tells his parents what is going on and they let him leave school early the day of the ribbon cutting ceremony and be at the ground breaking ceremony. Beatrice attends as well. While they are waiting; a lot of their friends at school show up to support them. The night before the demolition Roy gives Mullet Fingers a camera so he can take a picture of the owls. He does just that, and at the ribbon cutting ceremony, Roy speaks up and show the town the pictures and saves the owls! He is a hero! There will be no new pancake house in their town, at least on this property!This book shows me that no matter what your age is, you can make a difference! These kids knew this was wrong and did not stop until they saved these owls. I do feel if they got their parents involved they would have also helped and maybe would have saved the owls in an easier manner. But I was very proud of them because they did not give up! I would recommend this book to my friends, especially if they needed a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Title: HootBy: Carl HiaasenThe book I am reviewing is Hoot, here is my review. Hoot is an adventure full of mystery and it is set in a school bus and in the woods of Florida in fall. The main characters of the story are Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice. In this story there is a family of owls who are going to be killed if a restaurant is built on their nest. So Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice try save them and try not to be caught on private property. They decided to sabotage the construction site in order to save the owls. My favorite character is Beatrice because she is good at fooling grown ups. My favorite scene is when Roy is chasing Mullet Fingers, Beatrice's brother, and Roy got hit with a golf ball and kept running.

Sanford"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Book Reviews:Hiaasen, Carl. Hoot (2002) and Flush (2005). N.Y: Alfred A. Knopf.It's thrilling to see a novelist and journalist like Carl Hiaasen spin tales of adventure and humor that motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources in their hometowns.My sister Barbara, a master teacher, and my friend Helen the Librarian recently introduced me to Hoot. Helen and I attended a free movie premier for families here in Tucson. It was a hoot, for sure! I ran right out and bought the soundtrack. It features original recordings by Jimmy Buffet who also produced the movie.Seems like the Florida boys are teaming up to help youth act to save a disappearing legacy.Florida like no other place has overdeveloped critical habitat-from coral reefs to mangroves. The youth of Florida are being handed a paltry version of Florida's original beauty. Critical decisions about land and water management go the way of backroom deals allowing slime polluters to ooze through regulations and laws, but with books like Hoot and Flush, we might be saved at the precipice.HootSet in the seaside town of Coconut Cove, the plot revolves around Mother Paula's Pancake House, a fictitious restaurant chain in Florida, which is about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. The developers know it and removed the legal evidence of the owls from public records. Unwary citizens applaud Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove.A local Florida son, barefoot, blond and nicknamed Mullet Fingers, lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers and acting as a one-man crusader for the owls. He pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to spell development. His step sister, Beatrice (middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the guys) and Roy (level-headed kid who moves to Coconut Cove from Montana, earning the dubious title of Cowgirl) join with Mullet Fingers to save the owls.The plot thickens nicely with ingredients like Roy's father being a Department of Justice agent who advises his son that working through the laws can accomplish as much as clandestine actions. This spurs Roy to search the Internet where he learns the owls are a protected species. That sets in motion a series of steps that illustrates for readers how the laws can work even when citizens try to manipulate them for their own selfish motives.Throw in a zany cop, a redneck construction boss, a Snidely Whiplash businessman, a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash Roy are foiled in evermore creative ways throughout the book...and you've got a great read!FlushFlush takes place in the Florida Keys. Noah and Abbey have put up with their father's impulsive behavior for too long. The book opens at the local jail where their father waits prosecution for sinking the Coral Queen, a floating casino that is illegally dumping raw sewage into the bay. A popular swimming beach, sea turtle nursery and sensitive coral reef have all been affected but no one has been able to identify the source of the toxic pollution. When Noah and Abbey's father ran amuck trying to get local authorities to act on it, he decided to take matters into his own hands.Thus the intrigue begins. Mix in Jasper, Jr., pusillanimous son of the perpetrator; Lice Peeking, a greasy ex-employee of the Coral Queen and his more-than-buff girlfriend, Sheila, and you've got hot and spicy. Sheila proves her worth by conniving with Noah and Abbey on an ingenious method to expose the point of pollution in the bay. It involves a lot of flushing!Hiaasen shows readers the complexities of exposing environmental polluters and how character and odd-ball alliances can play into a solution when driven by the right intent.These two books offer young readers adventure, great humor and an opportunity to sort out what's right and wrong in a complex scenario. Are Mussel Fingers and Noah's Dad bad guys for violating property rights? Does a higher law prevail? What can kids do about it?In each story, at least one adult helps kids right a wrong. Roy uses the Endangered Species Act to finally protect the owls; Noah and Abbey use an inventive technique to reveal the point of pollution - both valid ways to work within the law. Yet, like Edward Abbey's Monkey Wrench Gang, sometimes it takes a bold action to bring attention to the public's eye. Perhaps it takes both kinds of action.Hiaasen's love for Florida, where he has lived his entire life, comes through brilliantly in the shimmering descriptions of the flora, fauna, land and sea-scapes in a state long misunderstood by most Americans.In this sense, too, Hoot and Flush are treasured records of the real Florida that still exists in backwoods and the rare town where balance has been struck between human need and natural communities. These books offer young readers an entertaining chance to examine what we can do to save our priceless natural inheritance all across America.[...]"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book \\"Hoot\\" is very exciting. I never wanted to put it down. In the book, Roy Eberdhart is the new kid in school... again. But in one second, his life changes dramatically. The school bully, Dana Materson, is just like all of the bullies Roy has faced. But if it weren't for cigarette smoking Dana, Roy would have never looked out the window of the school bus to see \\"the running boy\\". After that Roy meets Beatrice, otherwise known as Beatrice the Bear. Then he learns The Running Boy's (aka Mullet Fingers) story and wants to help him save the owls. The owls aren't just any owls though. They're endagered. A company called Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House wants to build their 469th pancake house on the plot where the owls live. They know they're there, and they know it's illegal, so why are they doing it anyways? Just to sell a couple of pancakes.

Roy Eberhardt, a boy who has just moved to Florida from Montana becomes Mullet Finger's friend and feels it is his job to help Mullet Fingers save the owls.

This boy who is called \\"Mullet Fingers\\" shows him these burrowing owls that are going to get bulldozed by these people that work for a pancake company. they know about the owls, but they tell everyone that they are gone. It's up to these three kids to save the owls. I like this book because it is really exiting and when it is fun[which is always] it makes you not want to put it down. Especially for me because I'm a big book worm."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Less than 700 burrowing owls are on the face of the earth today, and they are now considered an endangered species. This number decreases every day. In the book, Hoot, by Carl Hiaasen, a young boy named Roy is out to help these birds. He isn't interested just by the birds, but by a shady character who is trying to help the birds, but won't reveal his name, whereabouts, or anything other than that he is trying to save some owls on the corner of East Oriole and Woodbury.Mother Paula's Pancake House is one of the largest and fastest growing pancake houses in America. They were now building a new location right where Roy lives, on the corner of East Oriole and Woodbury. One sunny day, Roy walks to his bus stop. He is always the first one there. His mother allows enough time for him to forget his homework, drive back, forget to get a test signed, drive back, and forget to eat breakfast, drive back. He waits patiently, reading his comic books. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots a moving figure. He glances over in the direction but all he sees are a forest of trees and house. He goes back to reading his comic book, unperturbed. He sees this every time he goes to the bus stop. He begins to concoct a plan to find this moving object and put it to justice. The next day, the minute he sees something moving, he jumps off from off a bench, and blindly runs in the direction of the shadowed figure. He manages to keep him in sight, but quickly gets tired. He begins to lose sight of him, but keeps running, determined to know whom it is. He crosses a golf course in the middle of a game. Golfers begin cursing and spitting at the two boys, but the shadow keeps on moving. Roy tries to keep up, but all of the sudden he hears a big bang on his head and falls to the ground unconscious. A golf ball hit him. Days go by, and Roy becomes more and more suspicious. He finally figures out who he is. He is the little brother of the biggest, meanest bully around. A girl named Beatrice Leep.Roy teams up with him and fights for his cause. Roy isn't quite sure what his cause is, so one night he and the mysterious boy sneak out to the corner of East Oriole and Woodbury. The mysterious boy lays out a round ball of hamburger by several holes. Roy watches and waits patiently. Ten minutes later, the tiniest owls Roy had ever seen peaked out from there safe home. They were burrowing owls. Roy from then on helps the boy delay Mother Paula's Pancake project. They pull a series of pranks to help save the owls. The manager in charge will have nothing of this. He sets out guard dogs, booby traps, and policemen to try and stop the hooligans. Nothing works, and finally the groundbreaking ceremony day arrives. Roy and the boy fight back and stand in front of the ground they are bulldozing. Several other children from there school make a circle around the owls, and eventually, they win!This book relates to my life because it shows everyone that little things can make a big difference, even save lives! If you just try your best and fight for a good cause, you just might win. Roy stood up for what he believed was right, and he ended up saving some very precious creatures. The only thing I may have done differently was get some background knowledge and find out if what I was doing was legal or illegal. I might have approached the situation in a logical way, rather than risk getting in trouble with the police. If I have a good cause that may be in danger of any way, shape, or form, I can stand up and try and stop it. I connected to Beatrice, because she was known as a bully at school, but was a caring person inside. I don't think I am known as a bully, but I fell like I can connect of her feelings of hatred, caring, and love towards her brother. It gives many people courage to go out into the world and do well. It influenced me in a very positive way, and I'm sure it will influence any readers of all ages.I would give this book four and a half out of five stars because it kept me on the edge, and I never wanted to put it down. The only let down I had about it been that I had imagined it to be a lot funnier and make me laugh out loud. The title \\"Hoot\\" made me think I would think it was a hoot, and find more to relate to. \\"Hoot\\" also had a double meaning. It meant \`hoot', as in the sound an owl makes, but it also meant \`hoot', as in funny. It was very quirky in some respects, but some of the jokes I did not understand. I think Carl Hiaasen is writing for ages ten to one hundred. I think that anyone would enjoy this book though, no matter what age!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is an excellent book. The characters Roy, Beatrice, \\"Mullet Fingers\\", and several others add humor and excitement. Roy, the new kid in town is the young hero who isn't expected to do much. No one would imagine him with Beatrice Leep, the intimidating, superstar soccer player. Beatrice's brother, \\"Mullet Fingers\\", is the shady character who starts all the mischief in the book. Dana Matherson is the average big, mean bully who tortures Roy. Officer Delinko and Curly are the men who keep watch on Mother Paula's All American Pancake house, where the story is set. They are the recievers of all the pranks and mischief that the kids put together. Conclusively, Hoot is a fabulous book with characters that make the book an entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"It's time for a new school again and it's the same old story for Roy Eberhardt. Gettting bullied, eating lunch by himself. Nothing is different for little helpless Roy, until one day while Dana Matherson was beating him up he smashed him into a window and he saw the boy. The boy helped him to grow to know Beatrice, and together that's what saved the burrowing owls.I think that Hoot is a very brave and courageous story. It's a story that will stain your heart and will teach you how important wildlife really is and how one person can make a huge difference. Whether in a household, a county, a state or even a country.The author Carl Hiaasen has an interesting style of writing, he really does a good job of not telling you what's going to happen or in other words he's not very predictable. Which is a good thing.I definitely recommend that you read the book Hoot to all middle schoolers ready for a thrilling story. After you read it you'll like it so much that you'll want to read it again and again. You have to read this awesome book!!~ Greta Jochmmann"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is an excellent book not only for Young Adult readers but for everyone.

The writing is superb and I will certainly check out your other books (since I'm an adult who also happens to adore reading kids books! ;-) You have to get people to make this into a movie...it would be a smash hit like Holes. I would love to see these characters on the screen so my family can also see what I'm laughing about! I think your trip into kids books territory was a hit...and I hope you keep on writing them.

I was so sad when I finished because my adventure was over. Hoot is a must read this summer!book review by: Sarah"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"'Hoot' could be considered on its surface as just a story for young teens, but it resonates with adults and anyone who cares about our environment too. By focusing on the triumph of an unlikely team of middle-school misfits, Hiaasen gets across his points about the worth of friendships and the value of one person's actions. His picture of suburban-sprawl Florida as seen thru the eyes of a newcomer is spot-on, as the kids fight to save a tiny owl from one of the ever-spreading commercial projects which have taken over much of the Sunshine State."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read this book because I am a big Hiaasen fan. I did not know what to expect from a book written by him for young readers, but I was delighted. It didn't have a lot of crazy plot twists like his regular books, but it had a good message."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Let me start by saying I love Carl Hiaasen books. They're just a touch crude with a whole lot of clever mixed in. I think I've read every book of his with the exception of Hoot and his other kids book. They're the best.With Hoot, I was expecting some of the language to be toned down. And it was. But it was still typical of what I'd expect to read in a Hiaasen novel, just for kids. He did a great job with the kids and painting a picture of Florida.If I had to fault the book, I'd say that the overall message of anti-corporation / conservation is a little bit strong in this book. It's been present in every one of his other books. Maybe because it was for kids I noticed it more? Still a good read."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"By Carl Hiaasen, Copyright 2002Written By DustinThis is a great book written by Carl Hiaasen. It's a great book for boys, ages 10-20 because it is an action packed book. Carl has just won a Newberry Award for the most outstanding contribution to children's literature. The setting takes place in Coconut Cove Florida. The problem in the story is that Mother Paula is trying to crush many owls just for some pancakes. The main characters in the story are Roy, Mullet Fingers and Beatrice. My favorite part is when Dana goes to jail. My least favorite part is when a dog bites Mullet Fingers. I love Hoot because I love owls. Many things happened in the book, like when Mullet Fingers buried himself in the dirt. Many kids were there at the opening. Many people protested against the construction site. Carl Hiaasen is a great writer because he has written so many books in the past. I would read more books that Carl Hiaasen wrote because he writes so well. To me I would rate these book five stares out of five stars. To me I love this book and I know you will too.

But then it's the only book I've ever read besides The Power of UN. This book is about a boy named Roy Eberhardt. He is always moving with his family because of his dads work. He goes to a new school called Trace Middle and is always getting bullied by a boy on the bus named Dana Matherson. Roy tries to avoid trouble but one day he sees a boy just, flat out running. He doesn't really pay attention to it though. The next day he sees him again but can't follow the boy because Dana is choking Roy. So Roy punches Dana right in the nose. Roy follows the boy but gets knocked out cold with a golf ball. Roy gets to finally meet the boy, to find out he is related to Beatrice leap. She is a big, tall, mean looking gal. They try to help the running boy by making a petition to save some owls that lived in the burrows on the Mother Paula's Property. They, and some kids from school form a wall and stop the Mother Paula's Pancake Company from bulldozing over the property. I think that this book is a very good book and I encourage everyone to read it. The main characters of the story are Roy, Beatrice, the Running Boy, Curly, and Officer Delinko.If you have already read this book please tell other people about it.

Mullet Fingers stands up for the helpless baby-borrowing owls at the construction site. He does break the law but it is for a good cause. Well Roy one of Mullet Fingers friends gets his class to protest against building the pancake house on the owls dens. Burying the owl's dens that would kill their babies. They do all they can to save the owls from getting killed. They put snakes out to scare the dogs and put sparkles on their tail so that they where noticeable. They put tape around their mouths so they could not bite the dogs. They just wanted to get the dogs to stay away so Mullet Fingers could get back into the construction site. That had to take courage to do what he did knowing that if he got caught he would go to jail. Well he did not go to school so he was breaking another law. It is called truancy when you don't go to school. They really had to stand up for what they believe because if they didn't they would have lost hope and the baby borrowing owls would have died. I recommend this to all people that can read because I thought it was a great book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is about a young boy who moves to Coconut Cove, Florida from Montana. Being the new kid Roy doesn't fit in well. Riding a new bus just means more teasing especially from Dana Matherson, who's the schools, biggest and meanest bully. One day while riding the bus Roy spots a young boy running towards the bus. At first Roy thought the boy was trying to catch it but as the bus came to a stop. Roy noticed that the boy wasn't wearing shoes nor carrying books. A couple days later as the bus was nearing the spot where he saw the running boy Dana grabbed Roy's throat. As Roy's trying to get loose from the grip, he spots the running boy and this time his curiosity got the best of him. He decides to follow him, so he punches Dana in the face. As Roy runs off the bus, he knocks into a girl names Beatrice but keeps going. He follows the boy all the way to a golf course where the boy disappears into the woods. All of a sudden Roy hears screams and falls to the ground, because he was hit in the head by a golf ball. Roy ended up being suspended from the bus. The next day at lunch the same girl Beatrice, whom he ran into confronted him; she pushed him into the wall and asked why he was in such a hurry to get off the bus. He didn't answer and she shoved harder and asked whom he was chasing. Roy's is suspicious if she knows who the running boy is, but she just tells him to mind his own business. Later on in the book Beatrice who is a tall brunette soccer player becomes friends with Roy. Roy learns many secrets about her and the running boy whom she calls Mullet Fingers. Mullet fingers was around the same height as Roy, but a lot tanner and he has blonde hair. As the story entwines he learns that Beatrice and Mullet Fingers are actually siblings. The three try to help save the owls that live on Mother Paula's House of Pancakes lot. I can't give away the whole story so you'll just have to read it for yourself. My favorite part was when Roy went to the creek to try and catch a Mullet fish, though fails and Mullet Fingers caught one for him in Roy's shoe. Although the book had a lot of good details, the book was not the best that I've read, because it was too predictable. Though I enjoyed reading it and can't wait for the movie to come out. This book would fit the ages of 8-12 year olds because it's not difficult to read. As I was looking at other reviews for other books by this author they all seemed grown up and all about protecting the environment. I personally wouldn't read any other books by this author because the fact he entwines saving the environment in them, and they're uninteresting."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book I just read is called Hoot by Carl Hiaason.

Illustrating that he is much more than a shock-novelist, Hiassen turned his American wit towards writing a children's book, HOOT. In this pro-environmental tale, Roy Eberhardt moves with his family to Florida from Montana. Roy has a difficult time of adjusting to the new place: he hasn't made any friends, the school bully picks on him and calls him \\"cowgirl\\", and suburban Florida just isn't as an exciting place to be as Montana. That's before Roy sees the barefooted boy running alongside the bus. Where is he going? Why was he running? Why was he barefoot? Roy can't get the kid out of his head. So, he attempts to find out. What begins as a simple matter of curiosity turns into an exciting adventure, full of quirky characters, and a message that one person can make a difference in the world, not matter how large the problem might be.I discovered this book after reading parts of it to a 5th grade class I was subbing for. Though the ending can be guessed early on, the book is full of suspenseful scenes broken up by moments of slapstick comedy. Unlike the humor in many children's book, Hiassen doesn't talk down to his prime audience and gives them credit for being thinking, logical creatures. This is a great book to read to kids or to have them read in order to introduce them to environmental issues. But don't let the prime audience fool you, HOOT is just enjoyable for adults to read and is just as witty as his more mature fare."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This an awesome book. This kid named Roy Eberheart had just moved from Bozeman, Montana to Coconut Cove, Fl. Coconut Cove is an area near Miami. The future home of Mother Paula's Pancake House was being vandalized by Beatrice Leap's (Beatrice the Bear's) step brother. Offiser Delinco was on aptrol of the construction site when he dozed off and all the windows of his squad car were painted black. Wile he was dozing the stakes at the construction site were pulled up for the third time. Roy stumbled upon the camp of beatrice the bears step brother were he was rummaging through some old trash bags wheen he found one that contained nine cotton mouth moccasins. The construction site manager put up a security camera and that stopped that problem. However, what happened to the owls?

He attempts to make the best of things, and yet somehow he finds out he can no longer sit back and let the balance of nature take its course, especially when a thinly disguised IHOP is about to move into town and a nest of burrowing owls is threatened with extinction by bulldozer. He meets an unusual girl, Beatrice, and an unusual boy, Mullet Fingers, who teach him that eco-activism is better than lying down and submitting to getting your butt kicked in by Coconut Cove's #1 bully, Dana Matherson.Listening to the audiotape I realized that not only is Carl Hiassen an ace children's book writer, but the tape shows off assets in Chad Lowe I had never noticed before. Chad Lowe is really the ideal narrator for HOOT, for with his own outsider status he brings an additional sympathy to the part of Roy, as well as being able to illuminate facets of Roy's growing affection for the tomboyish, sometimes violent Beatrice, who reminds me very much of the young Hilary Swank. Can't you just picture Hilary Swank biting a chunk out of the rubber tire on a Schwinn bicycle, as Beatrice does here almost without thinking? I guess some guys just like that alpha type of woman."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a very exciting book. It starts with Roy being the new kid again, this time in Florida. If it weren't for Dana, the bully, Roy would never have seen the bare-footed running boy. If he never saw the running boy he would have never met Beatrice. These three friends go on many adventures to save little burrowing owls. Don't get confused when the story changes point of view, it will all make since at the end. I can't tell you anymore, you will have to read the book to find out!!

One of the first main characters is Roy is a boy who moved from Montana to Florida and thinks Florida is not going to be as cool as Montana.The next two are Roy's mom and dad you will see them talking about Roy all the time .Next is Dana a bully at Roy's school but just wait Dana \`s going to get it from Roy.Then their is Beatrice she always handles Dana for Roy when they because friends.Then their is the boy I can't give to much away about the him or you will know everything about book.Next is a cop by the name of officer Delnko he's the one who handled the things that have been going wrong at the construction site.Then their is a guy who is working on the construction his name is Curly.Someone is trashing a construction site and no one knows who.The person does all kinds of things to the construction site.Dana gets punched in the nose.Roy gets hits by a golf ball.Roy seen a boy running as he was going to school.I will give you a hint its someone's brother. I think anyone who likes a page turner then I say this is for you,or if you like realistic books because it could happen in real life,I know I liked it you should too."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I liked Hoot because 3 kids Roy, Beartice, and Mullet Finger wanted the people that owned the pancake house to stop building. They wanted them to stop because there were burrowing owls on the property. Finally Roy, Beartice, and Mullet Finger stopped them from building the pancake house and saved the owls.I think that you should read this book because it is hillarious and you would get a kick out of it. I think that the book is better then the movie."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"What a great way to introduce your child to the world of non-absolute ethics.

The book was 297 pages including the epilogue. Hoot was exciting and mysterious. It also had plot twists along with a touch of humor.Roy (the main character) is a thirteen year old boy who has moved from place to place in his life. He is now living in Florida. Roy loves his parents and they were very understanding about his situation about moving all of the time. It all began on the bus in his second week of school when as usual the bully in the school was picking on him and the other kids. Dana shoved his face into the window and he saw a boy that was running. In the mean time the construction sight had be being vandalized. He chased after the boy the next time but couldn't keep up with him because the boy was extremely fast; Roy thought that he was fast enough to be an Olympic sprinter. Later that day a girl at school named Beatrice pinned him to the wall at school and screamed into his face,\\"Don't ever follow him again or else. Mined your own business\\"Roy later found out that the boy that was running and ditching school was the one who was committing the crimes at the construction site. He didn't know the connections between the running boy at school and Beatrice, but he did know that he had to find out what was going on and why.Characters in the book Hoot were believable and funny. They developed a strong personality and it felt like even though you weren't in the story you knew the characters. Such as the running boy would stay stubborn and always, every time, had a plan.The setting was in Florida. I enjoyed how descriptive the author was and how he described all of the places he had lived and what Florida was like. I also loved how the author also made you want to read onto the next chapter.Parts of the story unfolded as you read and I liked how he only gave little by little so it made you keep on wondering. I would give this book a nine out of ten; this is a must-read book of the year."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book I read was Hoot by Carl Hiaasen. This book was 297 pages long and was a realistic fiction book. Some of the other books he's written are Sick Puppy and Basket Case which are more adult books.

One day on the way to school he sees a kid run past a bus stop on the way to school with no shoes on. The next day the kid runs by again at the same stop and Roy gets suspicious. That night Roy plans to follow the kid wherever he is going. So on the way to school when he sees the boy he darts to the door of the bus bumping into Beatrice Leep (The captain of the school soccer team) on the way out. Roy chases the boy through a golf course and into some woods were he finds a camp made. He goes up to one of the bags and dumps whatever is in it out and finds five copper mouth snakes. A voice from be hind calls move slowly backwards and do not look at the snakes. Roy does as told and is all of a sudden blindfolded. The kid drags him out of the woods and says \\"I am going to take of the blind fold and you are never to return here\\". When the blind fold was taken of and Roy had turned around the boy was gone.Waking over the golf course he is suddenly hit by a golf ball in the head and knocked out. The next day at school Beatrice Leep comes up to him and grabs him by the neck and asks him what he running after when he bumped into her.He answers \\"I was running after a boy\\".\\"You know who the kid was; that was my step-brother that's who. Never chase him again\\".I liked how the author named the characters because I feel they really fit into the situation. Also I like what the goal of the characters was and I rarely find that in books I read. The whole thing about saving nature is what gets me because I love the outdoors animals, plants ext. that's why I like the goal of saving the owls.There are some funny parts in the book too. One of them was when the runaway boy put the alligators in the portable toilets. Also when he pulled out the stakes that marked were water pipes and electrical wires were. The kid also spray painted the police car while the police man was asleep.This book was fairly good. The goal of the character was good because it's about saving nature. Also this book had some funny parts in it to. This book is not a mystery book. I would only recommend this to people who like the outdoors, wildlife and the whole thing about saving them."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is a great book about a boy named Roy Eberhardt who sees a strange running boy outside a window while a school bully was 'attacking' him.

He does everything he can to stop the Mother Paula's Pancake Company from building a Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove (their city) because of the owls living there. It tells the story of a boy's persistence, three strong friends, and a vice president that you will love to hate!

He is average size and he is sick and tired of people pushing him around. We are not much alike because he is a smaller kid not active in sports and I am a biger kid and I play sportsI found this book rather elementary. I liked this book though it is a very nice book.

His first few days of school were a blur. Until one day on the bus Dana Matherson had Roy's head up against the window when he spotted a boy, running without any shoes, running as fast as he could past the bus stop way on down the street, not stopping for anything. Roy was very curios so after Dana let him go he ran off the bus at the next bus stop to follow the boy. Meanwhile a construction foreman was extremely puzzled as to what was happening. Read Hoot by Carl Hiaasen to find out what happens next!Hoot is a wonderful book to read, especially for people that like something besides love stories. This is a very adventurous book.

My favorite part was when Roy told all of his classmates about Mothers Paulas groundbreaking and that they were going to kill some owls. Then Beatrice told all of her soccer friends about the owls too and they all came. Then while Chuck E. Muckle was talking the kids started protesting and sayind to save the owls. Another of my favorite characters was Mullet Fingers because he never quit tring to save the owls. He would vandalize the property,he would do life threating things like give big dogs something and give them snakes, and do other things like mess with allegators.I think that Roy's most important part was when Dana slamed him against the glass and he saw Mullet Fingers.This book taught me to choose what is best from the heart and from the brain.I really liked the book HOOT!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Dear Carl Hiaason,i have just finished reading your book \\"hoot\\" and i loved it!

But as soon as i read the first word i couldnt stop readng.It is so funny and i love the way how you used sarcasm a lot in your story. What i also liked about your book is that you used a lot of similes and metaphors. I think that what makes your book the best is that the plot of the story is so original than all of the other books i've ever read.My favorite part of the story is the ending when roy and beatrice stopped the construction of Mother Paula's because of the owls. I love the way how you made each character in the book different. My favorite character is Nepolian Leep a.k.a Mullet Fingers. He's my favorite because he is so adventerus and isnt afraid of taking risks.

Once at his new school he is immediately the target of bullying by a punk named Dana. Hoot refers to a species of pigmy owls who live in the ground in a lot that is destined to become a pancake house. While being bullied on the bus by Dana, Roy sees a barefoot wild-boy who does not go to school. Roy ends up befriending the boy and his gawky sister, who are sabotaging the pancake house work-site in an effort to save the owls.Though there is some commendable problem solving on the part of Roy from the perspective of a 12 year old, the reader can't shake the feeling that there is a 50 year old man in his head pulling the strings. Roy always seems to have an answer and know exactly what to do, with a confidence you don't see in kids that age.Hoot is really an environmentalist story, instructing children on how to slow progress and defeat evil corporations. How nice. I was a little disappointed how many of the story-lines; bullying and child abuse, were swept conveniently aside to make way for the saving of the owls.Not immediately apparent is that this book is a Newberry Award winner. It's intended for children. Hiaasen usually writes adult crime fiction.Worth a look, but really nothing all that special."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":". . . and he is not an avid reader.

Unfortunatly the boy doesn't like her one bit, not even as a friend! In the end with a little jelously, and a planting of a tree, the boy ends up likeing the girl! It only took a few years!

When twelve year old Roy Eberhart is on the local school bus, he is intrigued by a mysterious bare footed running boy. He investigates the mysterious boy and teams up with him and his sister \\"Beatrice The Bear\\"in a heroic adventure to save a few burrowing owls from the local pancake parlor.Hoot is an extraordinarily good book for many reasons, but my favorite reason is how Hiaasen builds up a ton of suspense and then has one of the characters do something hilariously funny to end all the suspense. For example, one time in the book, one of the main characters, a construction worker, believes there is a snake in his bathroom. By the way, he is terrified of snakes. The writer then builds up a ton of suspense, but when the guy walks in he, fires his big old 45 Calibur revolver at a puny little field mouse, and ends up missing, blowing the crud out of that nasty old toilet. That relieves all the suspense in a funny way.If you love books that are both hilarious and suspenseful YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT.

But, things have already been happening at the pancake house construction site. First the survey stakes were taken out, then baby alligators were put in the porta potties, a cop car's windows were spray painted, the seats of the bulldozers were taken, etc. These acts of vandalisms just keep delaying the building and were upsetting the Pancake Company, the builders, and the police.

There could have been a few more female characters, but atleast the main female protaganist (the jock) was very positive.

This review is specifically in reference to the audio book, which is read by actor Chad Lowe. My daughters and I listen to audio books daily, and we've listened to some truly gifted readers.

The new kid in town. Again. And he has new kid syndome bad -- eating lunch by himself, no friends, and the subject of the school bully's free time enjoyment. Things leap from ordinary to extra-O one day when Dana Matherson is beating the loose change out of him on the bus. Roy happens to look out the window and see a strange boy running almost as fast as the bus.Why isn't the boy going to school? Why is he barefoot? And how is he running so fast?Roy's quest to find out the identity of this mysterious boy leads him to cross paths with several interesting characters in the process, many of which are adults -- A few police officers, security guards for Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House, the tallest, toughest girl at school, Beatrice, and a nest of burrowing owls at the corner of East Oriole Avenue. This intersection of characters drops Roy into the center of a plot to keep Mother Paula's from building their new restaurant on the site at East Oriole. We can't have them burrying those owls now, can we? Uprooted survey stakes, baby alligators in the portapotties, spraypainted and jawtied cottonmouth snakes on the site, and spraypainted cop car windows are just the start. Something has to be done to defend the owls, and somebody has to do it.Carl Hiassen's first book for young adults, HOOT seems it will be around for a long time. It's environmental focus and clear prose make it easy to recommend to young readers. And with the movie having already hit the theaters a while back, I wouldn't be surprised if this book makes its way into school classrooms at some point.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The reviews are numerous on this tale, but I'll add my brief thoughts.My 12 year old son read the novel first and he thoroughly enjoyed the novel. Then he asked me to read it. I have to say at first I was skeptical, but I value Carl Hiaasen commitment to the environmental efforts in Florida. Development along our coastal shores has often been allowed to flourish without restraints, allowing degradation of our already fragile ecology.Hiaasen in his own small way is trying to preserve that wonderful state of Florida for future generations of people and of course the owl. So, to honor my son's request and Hiaasen's nature role, I read it over the course of the next two days.Overall, I thought the novel was an excellent read, of course not on an adult level but it still kept my interest as I followed Roy, the boy from Montana as he discovers the vast beauty of Florida and also the invasion of those nasty developers. No need at this point to recap the story again. It's a super book for young adults and worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I really liked this book it was funny and interesting.

Roy is a very couragous person taking on Dana and helping the running boy. But if it wasn't for Dana Matherson smashing his face against the school bus window that day, he might never have seen the running boy. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never have met Beatrice. And if he had never met Beatrice, he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in the lot on the corner of East Oriole Avenue. And if he had never discovered the owls, he probably would have missed out on the adventure of a lifetime.First all the survey markers are pulled up and all the stake holes are filled in.The air is let out of the construction vehiciles tires. Alligators (small ones) are put in the out house toilets. No work is being done. The date for a grand opening is approaching. Who is doing this and why are no mystery to the reader, but they are a serious question to the construction foreman, Curly, police officer Delinko and Curly's boss at headquarters, Chuck Muckle. Of course, Mother Paula's is about to be constructed on land on which there a bunch of burrowing owls.My favorite part of this book is when Officer Delinko's patrol car gets spray painted by the vandal, which is Mullet Fingers or should I say Napoleon Bridger Leep. It was funny when Officer Delinko falls asleep and when he wakes up sees his patrol car windows are spray painted black. Officer Delinko thought it was early in the morning, but it was really nine thirty. I laughed my head off in this part. Another part I liked was the part that Roy mooned Dana and Dana got real mad and chased Roy about three blocks."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK. IT WAS VERY FUNNY.

The book alsotaught me alot of vocabulary words that I did not know. Forexample three words are toupec,miffed,and improbable. I likedon how the book kept me interested.Next,the book I think can be the best book for kids in thewhole United States of America. I also liked on how CarlHiaasen described the characters in a visual way throughoutthe whole entire. Last but not least, my favorite characterwas Mullet Fingers. The reason why I liked Mullet Fingers wasbecause he is different from other kids because he does thingsthat you would not usually see a kid do.

They are going against Mother Paula's Pancake House in which are notfilling out an important paper. (...).My favorite character is Mullet Fingers. The reason why I likeMullet Fingers a.k.a.

I thought that it was a great book. My favorite scene in this amazing book is when Roy ticks Dana to going into the trailer to find non-existing cigarettes. As Dana try's to find these cigarettes he is caught by Curly. My favorite character in the book is \\"mullet fingers\\" or Napoleon. Carl Hiaasen has the perfect ingredient of characters. One reason why I really thought that this was a great book is because it has a sense of humor. I am sure when you read this book you will laugh as much as a hyena. For example, there is a part of the book when Roy moons Dana. There was many great characters in this book, Dana: fat boy who is very hard headed, Mullet fingers\\" incredibly brave boy who helps the owls, Beatrice: mullet fingers sister (she also helps the owls), Roy: the new kid (helps with owls). My favorite character in this book is mullet fingers. The reason why he is my favorite character is because; no matter what gets in the way he will always be brave enough to save the owls. I think that this is a book for kids, but all ages can read it. How I read it, was with my whole class room at school. I could tell that every one liked it, because they would all giggle at funny parts of the book. They would all also participate when our teacher would ask us questions, for example, she would ask \\"what do you think is going to happen next\\" or \\"who do you think it was\\". If you like to read awesome books then you should definitely read this book. It is so far one of the best book I have ever read in my life before. So like I said when I first started, If I was to rate this book from 1-5 stars, I would automatically give it 5 stars. I do recommend this book for kids or like my teacher, read it to your students. Go and get it!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The site of Coconut Cove's future Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House is experiencing a slight problem: documents removed, alligators in the port-a-potties, and painted-over patrol cars. But who's behind the clever vandalism and pranks?New Florida resident Roy Eberhardt isn't aware of this going on, but he has often noticed a barefoot boy running down the street faster than anything. Roy was curious; he starts to search around and even follows the boy once, only to be told by Beatrice Leep, a.k.a. Beatrice the Bear, to mind his own business. Despite Beatrice's warning and plenty of bullying from the jerk Dana Matherson, Roy follows the boy, whose name is Mullet Fingers, one day and ends up in the middle of an environmental mission to save a society of burrowing owls from being bulldozed.Full of colorful characters, Hoot is a quick-witted adventure that will keep readers hooked. With down-to-earth Roy, dumbfounded Officer Delinko, and construction site manager Curly. The author delivers an appealing cast of characters that keep the plot twisting and turning until the highly charged ending.This book was great because the plot was some what a reality in a lot of places. Also,friendships,courage and comedy put this story together to make one outstanding novel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"To me Hoot is the greatest book I've read in my whole life. It was very inspireing and captivating how Carl Hiaasen vividly explained the world that we mentally ventured through.

Of course, Mother Paula's is about to be constructed on land on which there a bunch of burrowing owls."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I didn't know the book was for teens when I started it. The hero is a teen, maybe around 14 or 15, as are his allies and enemies, except for one chief bad guy: Chuck E. Muckle, vice president of Mother Paula's Pancake Houses.The other adults who originally start on the pro-Mother Paula team eventually switch over to the pro-burrowing owl team, the one headed by the teens. But this sorry Chuck E. Muckle just seems to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. In the epilogue, we learn that he is first demoted within, then let go from Mother Paula's. He takes a \\"cruise director\\" job in Miami instead. The poor guy had so few people skills, it's hard to see how he could possibly make it as a cruise director.Anyway, it is kind of sad to see how the big corporation might have, in the past, tried to hide an Environmental Impact Report that showed a protected species on their property. But I don't think this could actually happen today, at least not in California. In California, the environmental watchdogs are very diligent and they usually do question EIRs and ask for further studies, and so forth. Maybe in Florida, or other places where environmentalists may not be as active, a corporation could still hide an EIR from public view and get away with it.Roy Eberhardt, the young hero, learns all about the EIR during his endeavor to protect the little owls. Readers will, too, if they know nothing about these important requirements for all developments nowadays. Putting down one Mother Paula's Pancake House (they already have 468, according to the book), is obviously no big deal. The real battle comes when you have one team crying out for low- and middle-income housing, because of perverse shortages, and the other team crying out for environmental protection and slow growth.This is what happens usually in Southern California. Clearly, there's not always an either/or response. It's a living issue, and this little book will you help to focus on that issue in your own mind. Diximus."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is about a young boy named Roy. Roy moves from Montana to Coconut Cove, Florida. Where Roy has a tough time fitting in at first at his new school. A boy named Dana Matherson bullies Roy and Dana just so happens to be a big boy. Roy's just a skinny and scrawny little boy. One day Roy sees a boy out of his bus window, this boy was running towards the bus. This boy had no shoes, dirty clothes, and was carrying no book bag. It wasn't till the blonde headed, tan boy ran pass the bus that Roy realized that he wasn't getting on. Then one time while Roy was on the bus getting strangled by Dana. He sees the boy again and he punches Dana in the face. Then he barges off the bus and accidentally runs into a girl named Beatrice. He ends up running after the boy, but loses him at a golf course because he got hit in the head with a golf ball. Later on Roy finds out that the girl he ran into wasn't very happy with him. She told him to mind his own business when it comes to the running boy. This girl Beatrice was a tall, strong soccer player, and she could easily beat Roy up. Soon after they become friends because Roy cared so much about that running boy. Soon enough he finds out that the running boy's name is Mullet Fingers and that it's Beatrice's stepbrother. Then through out the whole story Mullet Finger's try's to save the owls in a lot where a Mother Paula's House of Pancakes is suppose to go. Mullet Finger's ends up getting Roy to care about the owls. Let's just put it this way you can read the book to find out the rest. The whole setting of this story takes place in Coconut Cove, Florida. My least favorite part of this book is the beginning. The book took a long time to get the story going. My favorite part would have to be when Roy found out that the snakes that Mullet Finger's put on the construction site had their mouths taped and weren't dangerous. I thought that was funny. Despite, my one favorite thing that I like about this book. I personally don't like this book; I think it's a very childish book. I prefer books with a lot of suspense and crazy turns that you would have never thought would happen. This book is pretty much predictable and had very little suspense. I would recommend that kids between the ages of 9-12 read this book. Because, it would fit kids of those ages better and it's not a very challenging book to read. I don't think I would ever read another book by this author. I find his writing very uninteresting and don't enjoy it very much. It's more for kids."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"My eyes are a little bit moist after having just finished HOOT by Carl Hiaasen. As I write this, I'm perched upon the royal blue carpeting between two of the dividers that stretch the length of a football field and herd us slowly in the direction of Jean Auel. Jean is sitting on a stool behind a table just beyond the goal line. I arrived here at the Javits Convention Center around 6:15 this morning--that's 3:15 A.M. California time, my body reminds me--in order to obtain one of the relatively limited tickets that allow entrance to this line for the purpose of receiving a smile and a signed copy of the new book from Ms. Auel. David Halberstam's line will be my next stop. But at the moment I am feeling like my best literary score of the day is the additional advance copy of HOOT that my friends at Random House are graciously permitting me to take back to California. Now, I can lend out a copy (first to my faithful webmaster) and keep another to eventually put away in my collection of the really good ones.Yes, HOOT is one that you'll want for your collection, too.I was just about to say that I can't wait to get home and start reading HOOT to my kids and Shari, but that wouldn't be particularly true. Thanks to another publisher friend, I am going to see Dee Dee Ramone and the Tom Tom Club perform at a party tonight, so frankly I CAN wait a little while to get back to California. But when I DO get there, you can be sure that I'm immediately sitting everyone down to share this great tale.First, you have the owls:\\"Walking back toward the patrol car, the policeman stumbled and fell down. Curley grabbed him under one arm and hoisted him to his feet.'Stupid owls,' said Curley.The policeman brushed the dirt and grass burrs off his uniform. 'You say owls?'Curley gestured at a hole in the ground. It was as big around as one of Mother Paula's famous buttermilk flapjacks. A mound of loose white sand was visible at the entrance.'That's what you tripped over,' Curley informed Officer Delinko.'An owl lives down there?' The policeman bent down and studied the hole. 'How big are they?'''Bout as tall as a beer can.''No kidding?' said Officer Delinko.'But I ain't never seen one, officially speakin.'\\"Then, you've got the bully:\\"The grip on his throat tightened. He felt Dana's ashtray breath on his right ear: 'How come you ain't got your boots on today? Who ever heard of a cowgirl wearing Air Jordans?''They're Rebocks,' Roy squeaked.\\"Now, throw in the mystery kid (whose first appearances are reminiscent of Maniac Magee):\\"The boy was straw-blond and wiry, and his skin was nut-brown from the sun. The expression on his face was intent and serious. He wore a faded Miami Heat basketball jersey and dirty khaki shorts, and here was the odd part: no shoes. The soles of his bare feet looked as black as barbecue coals...Because the boy kept running--past the corner, past the line of students waiting to get on the bus; past the bus itself. Roy wanted to shout, 'Hey look at that guy!' but his mouth wasn't working so well. Dana Matherson still had him from behind, pushing his face against the window.\\"Add in the seriously evil PR guy from the pancake house chain, the tough girl soccer star, the assortment of parents with widely varying skill levels, and the bumbling young cop. Then drop Roy, the new kid in town, into the middle of everything and you have the recipe for a book that will enchant kids of all ages. There is humor, sadness, and a touch of suspense.What WILL happen to the owls in those holes?In HOOT, Carl Hiaasen does an incredible job of showing the different styles of activism that different people resort to. He presents the reader with the contemporary clash of free enterprise versus global ecological issues. He has a lot to say between the lines about parenting, and he has some great insights into the methods of dealing with bullies.I've never read his adult books, but I sure hope Hiaasen writes more children's books for my kids. HOOT is a heck of a first step into the world of children's literature.Richie Partingtonhttp://richiespicks.comBudNotBuddy@aol.com"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book-on-tape was damaged when I received it.

The other reason I liked about the book were the characters. They were interesting. My favorite character was Beatrice. I liked this character because she was very determined to save the owls.I would recommend this book for kids 10 and over. This is my review on my favorite book, Hoot."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Once I started the book Hoot, I could not put it down. Usually I do not read more than twenty pages a day, but with this book I would read more than fifty. The main character is constantly moving houses in numerous states. He has not experienced as odd events as he does once he moves to Florida. On the first day of school he notices a boy running the opposite direction of his bus. He is very intrigued by this and wants to find out more. One event leads to another until it is too difficult to handle. I strongly suggest reading this book not only because of its exciting story line, but because of its smooth, easy reading."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt's family has just moved from Montana to Florida. Roy gets bullied often by Dana Motherson. Someone or something trespassed and vandalized the construciton site of Mother Paula's All American Pancake House. They keep up the vandalizm for the next couple of days. The police captain was worried and decided to send a patrol officer every hour to check out the construction site. Delinko is sent early morning to patrol around. It was so early in the morning that he fell asleep and someone came up and spray painted his car white. All they clues Delinko has been led to Roy, Both of them are detectives urging for the truth about the running boy who Roy saw the very first day of school and all the vandalizm going on. Roy on the other hand got in a fight and got kicked off the bus for two weeks. So he couldnt fine the boy running. Offcer Delinko does his daily routine he stops to hear the sound of cooing which turns out to be owls in which have their nests around the construction site. Delinko also notices a piece of green cloth stuck on the fence. He kept recieving clues in which kept leading him to Roy. Curley helps Delinko look out for the victim. Roy Curley and Delinko want to find out who all this vandalizm is coming from.They also want to save the owls from loosing their nests during the construction. Roy and his friends of Trace Middle School got together to make a plan to find out the real truth. So they protested to Mother Paula's Pancake House, because they knew that the executives knew the real truth. I really dont like to read, and i must admit at the beginning of this book i didnt think i would be interested, but I really liked this book, because once you got past the first couple of pages and got into the book it kept making you wonder who was doing all this vandalizm at Mother Paula's Pancake House. It was also really neat how Roy and his friends of Trace Middle School tried to save the owls and how they stood up in front executives and protested to let the real truth come out. I recomend this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Many books are just plain old fairytales, but what do you get when you cross an endangered species of owls, three young teenagers, and pancakes?

This book is about a boy named Roy Eberhardt and he is a new kid in town. Roy doesn't really have any friend's just people bullying him around stuff like that. Well one day on the bus he was sitting with a boy named Dana Matherson. Dana saw a boy running down the sidewalk and then smashed Roy's face against the window so he could see the boy. Then he met a girl named Beatrice Leap. She was a big girl and a really big bully. But not to Roy she stood up for him. Roy got very concerned about the running boy and began to look for him. One day Beatrice introduced the two boys. They became good friends and stuck up for each other. So there was a new restaurant that was being built and it was called The Mother Paula's Pancake House. They were famous for the pancakes. The property had little baby owls living on it that were only going to grow to be about 8 to 11 inches tall. Mullet fingers (the running boy), Beatrice and Roy wanted to save the owls. So when it came time for commercials to start advertising the restaurant, Roy and all his friends want to save the owls.I would recommend this book for ages of 9-12 because it is a book based on children.My favorite part is when they do end up saving the owls and my least favorite part is when the bullies mess with people.I think that you should read more books by this author. He is a really good author and he writes books very good. I liked this book because it is a book about people saving the society and not trying to kill it.

Anyway, cover aside, Hoot is about three kids in Florida that are trying to save burrowed owls from being buried alive. The owls live in holes at the site of a future Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House, but if nobody does anything about it, the owls will die.Roy Eberhardt is the new kid in town; he moves around a lot so it's no big deal to him. He witnesses a boy with no shoes running around; that day changes his life and sets the plot in motion. In addition to finding out who this boy is, Roy has to deal with a burly, stupid bully named Dana Matherson on the school bus with the oblivious bus driver. The bully's stupidity is humorous and works with Roy's clever plans. Roy also meets this tall girl named Beatrice, who rescues him from the bully with her smarts and her scary strength.Roy finds out that the boy (\\"Mullet Fingers\\"), related to Beatrice, wants to save the owls; the boy commits many acts of \\"vandalism\\" to delay the construction. Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice all bond to become an unstoppable team. In addition to these hilarious characters, there is a pompous police officer who is an absolute riot and construction manager to deal with in the project as they try to solve the mystery of the vandals.This book is very cute and the great plot teaches people about the protection of wildlife. The ending was a little corny and weak--anticlimatic to me (to my disappointment, hence, 4 stars), but overall the message to have concern about development and wildlife is great! This book is to be a movie, and I can't wait to see how they portray the quirky, memorable characters!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is a realistic fiction book. It was an ordinary day for Roy, sitting on the bus waiting for Dana Matherson to pound him. It was the same kind of day Roy has every morning, except this time, he saw a boy. What was unusual is that he didn't have shoes, a shirt, or any of the necessary things for school. While Roy is trying to track down the boy, there are some interesting crimes going on down by the Mother Paula's construction site. Survey sticks pulled, alligators in the toilets, and even snakes. Someone must have a grudge against Mother Paula. While Roy was tracking down the boy he met a girl, Beatrice, who seems to know a lot about the boy. Is this just a coincidence that Beatrice was thinking of the wrong person, or was there something Roy didn't know. While Roy is searching for answers he starts making friends with Beatrice and gets some helpful and awful information from her. The boy isn't the only thing on his mind; Dana Matherson is out to get him for breaking his nose. Mysterious things are happening at the Mother Paula's construction site, and if they don't build their pancake restaurant, the vice president of the company will get very angry. Roy has joined the boy to save the owl burrows on the construction site, but will they have enough strength to save the owls? I like how the author forms two separate stories and manages to pull them together to make a very exciting book. This book has lots of mysteries, and even near the end, there are still some mysteries unsolved. I enjoyed reading this book because it was very suspenseful and was exciting."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Man, when it comes to a book about protecting the wildlife, I'm in.

Roy finds the boy anyway and becomes his friend; Beatrice finds out and tells Roy the boy is her stepbrother. Mullet Fingers, as Beatrice calls him, tells Roy that he has been vandalizing a construction sight, where Mother Paula's Pancake House, to try to save families of burrowing owls.The boy, with Roy's and Beatrice's help, had been trying to stop the pancake house from starting construction, but after weeks, the boy gave up. Roy was insistent, he wouldn't give up that easily.The next day, Roy and Beatrice went to the construction sight, where the pancake house was going to be built, and they ended up saving the owls.Hoot is actually a good book, when I got to my library, I only chose it because I couldn't find any other book to read. At first, when I started to read Hoot, I was thinking, this is no big deal, ill just read it to get it over with. But as I got further into the book, I discovered that I actually liked it!One of my favorite parts in Hoot is when Mullet Fingers takes Roy to the sunken boat out on the ocean, and they just talked to each other. This is pretty much the one of the only times that they talk seriously together, almost like they are brothers.I would have to say that my favorite character would have to be Beatrice.

The story line was fairly easy to follow and could keep someone awake all night wondering what will happen next. While reading this book it seemed like my mind was wondering to new places. It felt like I was in the woods with Roy and Mullet Fingers and with the three of them at the construction site for Mother Paula's new pancake house.

Later in the book you find out that the blonde haired boy is the toughest girl in the schools stepbrother. Her step-mom sent him to a military school and after two days he broke out and found his way back to Coconut Cove. He lives in an old, rusted ice cream truck in the woods. He's the one who finds out about the owls and they try to save them. This book was sort of a page-turner because some of the chapters were more exciting than others. In one of the chapters that I thought was a page-turner, Roy tricks another bully at school and I kept reading because I wanted to figure out what happened to him.

What he ended up finding out was the boys name was Mullet fingers, and he was living out there to protect the owls. Mullet fingers had found out that there were owls in holes where there was a building going up. So he popped the tires on the builders truck and he was putting alligators in the bathrooms at night just to waist time until he knew what he was going to do.My favorite part off the book was when Mullet fingers and his sister (that was helping him hide out in the woods) were doing a lot off things to the people trying to build this building because it made the book more interesting.I thought this book was good but better at some parts than the rest. I liked it because at some parts it was an adventure and some parts it was comedy.

They do a series of stuff to the construction site so they couldn't build the pancake house in Coconut Cove, Florida. Mother Paula's knows they are there, but they want the pancake house anyway. I recommend this to kids who like fiction and who are very adventurous people.I liked this book because its got action, and I like action books."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources. Hoot is set in the seaside town of Coconut Cove. The plot revolves around Mother Paula's Pancake House, a fictitious restaurant chain in Florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. The developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records. Unwary citizens applaud Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove.The lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed Mullet Fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers. He pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development. Mullet Fingers enlists the help of his step sister, Beatrice and new kid, Roy. Beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys. Roy is a level-headed kid who moves to Coconut Cove from Montana, earning the dubious title of Cowgirl.When you throw in a zany cop, a redneck construction boss, a sly businessman, a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash Roy you've got a pretty good read!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"As a secondary reading teacher who deals with struggling readers I have a huge challenge finding interesting books for them to read. This book was recommended to me by a reading specialist and she was right on about this book. My students loved it! For many, it was the first book they ever read!We had a great time making predictions throughout the story as Roy Eberhardt, Beatrice Leep, Curly, and Officer Delinko are all looking for something. The plot twists and weaves but never loses the reader. The closer each character gets to finding what they are looking for, the more streamlined the plot gets. As it turns out they are all looking for the same thing and as they do, little hints are dropped to the reader along the way--hightening the reader's interest. What are they looking for? You will have to read this book to find out!Strongly recommended to any struggling reader or to any teacher dealing with struggling readers."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a great book!

I am so glad I did. It is classic Hiaasen, with zany characters, set in Florida, with an environmentalist theme running through it. I never once felt like I was reading a children's book. The main characters are middle-school age, but they are well-developed, likeable, and believeable. This story centers around a plot to save several families of burrowing owls who have the misfortune of living on a plot of land that is destined to be a new pancake restaurant."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I was walking through a used book store and picked this up not knowing what to expect. It is a fun adventure. Easy read ... Good for vacations. I will be reading more from this author. I just picked up SCAT."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I tired of the book around (well really before) p. 180. The back and forth between the storylines of Roy and what the police officers are doing on the job site gets tiresome. For me, the mystery of what's going on takes far to long to develop and tries the reader's attention. On the positive, Hiaasen does a fine job of articulating the nuanced and sophisticated emotions and thinking of preteens.Overall, I thought the storyline was too over-the-top and strained credulity. Hiaasen seems to be a clever writer trapped in a minimal plot in this book, and i didn't find the book humorous as many claim."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy, the main character of the book, is the new kid at trace middle. It was a Monday morning inside the school bus Roy was being bullied when he saw a strange running boy. Thinking of nothing but the strange boy, Roy went to school and took classes in one ear and out the other.Beatrice, Mullet fingers's step sister, after noticing Roy being interested in Mullet fingers (running boy), pins Roy down to tell him to back off. However, instead of \`keeping him off', she began to get close to him, and Roy began to learn more about the running boy.Somewhere else, Officer Delinko was assigned for a new case on the pancake house construction site's rods disappearing. At first, it was thought to be a kid's game. But after all the guard dogs being scared away by snakes, seeing a croc in the potty, and his car painted black, it wasn't thought to be a kid's game anymore.After learning that Mullet fingers was trying to protect the owls, Roy volunteered his services for the owls. After a long research, he found out that the owls were actually \\"burring owls\\" and they were protected by the law. After skimming on the state files, Roy found no files about the construction of the Mother Paula's pancake house and decided to launch the final attack on the construction. (Although I may write \\"how it was ended\\", I think I have already given enough data to spoil your reading, so, I will end it here. ^^)The title that I mentioned for my review came from the \\"butterfly effect\\", first coined by Edward Lorenz and based in chaos theory with sensitive dependence on initial conditions. It means that a single butterfly's wing beats could cause a tornado. (Reference: [...])In this book, Roy beats his wings (with others), which causes the great pankake industry to go down in a tornado.To conclude, I think we should try to do the right thing and beat our wings all the time."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"A wonderfull adventure featuring three children-Roy,Beatrice and Mullet Fingers. There goal was to save the owls from the mother Paulas new construction site, and there was nothing that could stop them. This book was a new type of book, a book that I wouldn't ussually read.

Roy(main caracter) knew somthing most other people did not. The only other people that knew were the builders of Mother Paula's All American Pancake House and Roy's friends, Beatrice and Mulletfingers. They all knew there were Burrowing Owls on the property that Mother Paula's Pancake House was going to build on. Roy and his friends thought that it was wrong to bury the owls with the bulldozers, so they made a plan to stop Mother Paula's. At the ground breaking ceremony, Roy spoke up and said, \\"What about the owls in those burrows?\\" The manager's reply was, \\"What owls?\\" although he knew they were there. Roy pointed at one of the owl burrows. \\"Them are vacant,\\" said the manager. \\"No they ain't,\\" said Roy. He held up a digital camera and showed two pictures that he thought were owls. One was a finger and one was a dirty foot. Roy felt defeated and went home. The very next morniing, before school, he looked in his father's newspaper, and there was an article titled, \\"Mother Paula's Manager Strangles Reporter.\\" The manager did not go to jail, but he was forced to take anger management classes. There would be no Mother Paula's in Cocoanut Cove, and the lot was used as a preserve for the owls."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl Hiaasen was an adventurous story.

There was no description of the boook on the back so I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Hoot is about a boy who moves from Montana, to Florida. As you can imagine, it is very different in these two places. The boy's name is Roy. He goes to Trace Middle School and doesn't really have any friends. One day on the way to school, Roy was riding the school bus. While the school bully was pesturing Roy, Roy saw a kid running down the sidewalk with no shoes. Roy figured that this boy was just on his way to a school bus stop and was running late. Since that day, Roy was very interested in this Running Kid. As he was getting off the bus one afternoon he ran right smack into a girl and almost knocked her over, he didn't realize that she was probably 2 times his size and could crush him if she really wanted to. The next day at school, the girl he knocked into went up to Roy and made it pretty clear that Roy should never bump into her again. Roy found out that her name was Beatrice. So he asked Beatrice if she knew anything about the mysterious running boy that he was seeing everyday on the school bus. Beatrice threatened him and told him to never ask about him again. This just made Roy even more curious so he followed the running boy one day. From then on, Roy made new friends, and started to learn that you shouldn't bite off more then you can chew."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is an engaging story empowering children to believe that they can have an effect on the world around them if they work within the rules that exist. There are some humorous situations, not all of which will be appreciated by less sophisticated children, a few bloodless fight scenes, and some very quirky children.Overall, this is would make a good read-aloud book for teachers or parents to share with their 2nd -4th grade aged children. The topic of conservation ties in with studies of rain forests, the environment, and animal life-cycles."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot was a ok book. The author didnt always keep my atention.

The story takes place in Coconut Cove, Florida, where Roy has just moved to. The setting, I have to admit, is a slight drawback for this book. It is one of the only drawbacks, mind, but it is a drawback nonetheless. Coconut Cove isn't the most vividly described setting I've ever witnessed. The places Roy goes aren't described very fully, either. For example, and I quote from Hoot, \\"Of all the places the Eberhardts had lived, Roy's favorite was Bozeman, Montana. The snaggle-peaked mountains, the braided green rivers, the sky so blue it seemed like a painting.....\\" Hiaasen does use some detail in describing areas, but it is usually limited to something of this nature. You can't really picture it, beyond what you have already seen. From time to time, Hiaasen does describe some areas vividly, but not in a consistent manner. Even though these areas are not the most wonderfully described, they are so familiar, and used so beautifully, that this may just counter all of the bad.The plot of the story definitely makes up for the setting. It begins with the life of many Middle School students. Roy is your average boy, who is picked on by bullies, terrorized by some teachers, and plagued by desire. After his encounter with the mysterious \\"running boy\\" also known as \\"Mullet Fingers,\\" the plot drastically shifts into a completely new gear. Roy descovers, after following and investigating Mullet Fingers for a time, that there are several burrowing owls located at the future site of a Mother Paula's All American House of Pancakes. The owls are threatened to be buried by bulldozing, and Mullet Fingers uses some clever schemes to try and stop it. He spray paints an officer's car, he lets lose snakes at the site, and he even removes the seats from the bulldozing equipment. It is a joy to see how the plot develops into completely new territory every time a new character is introduced, or a new event occurs. After some clever schemes from Roy, and some not-so-clever ones, the owls are eventually saved during the groundbreaking ceremony for the pancake house. The corporation is made a fool of after one of the higher officials almost kills Mullet Fingers in an attempt to stop the protest that Roy organized with his classmates. In short, the plot shifts from a new boy trying to fit in, to a boy trying to solve a mystery, to a boy trying to save some poor, innocent owls. It is pure joy to see Roy endure his hardships and grow in them.The characters in this exceptional story are the glue that binds everything together. Roy Eberhardt is a young middle-schooler with the hopes of returning to Montana. He is a clever, curious young man who grows throughout the course of this conspiracy. He learns to appreciate what he has in Florida instead of dwelling on what he lacks. Mullet Fingers isn't seen too much in the story, but the book would not be the phenomenal work that it is without him. He is also a clever, young boy with an interesting history. His mother dislikes him, and has tried to get rid of him numerous times by sending him to correctional facilities, only to find that he has escaped. He is known as \\"the running boy\\" in the beginning, because Roy first encounters him as he runs by the school bus barefooted. Dana Matherson is the dumb, oafish school bully who Roy must deal with numerous times. Every time he tried to harm Roy, he ended up getting hurt or busted. Roy managed to get him hauled off to juvenile detention. Officer Delinko is a youn police officer determined to prove his worth and become a detective. Throughout the course of the story, he is trying to solve a vandalism case on the Mother Paula's site. All of these characters grow and learn throughout the story, and could be an inspiration to all aspiring readers. They always stand up for what's right, (except for Dana Matherson) and teach invaluable lessons. I hope that this review allowed you to be more familiar with Carl Hiaasen's Hoot."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot was written by Carl Hiaasen. It was a novel about a boy named Roy Eberhardt, a new kid that just moved from the mountains. He meets a bully named Dana MAtherson and sees a running boy out the window of a school bus while this large \\"boy\\" Dana was smashing his head into the glass. Roy became curious about this boy and there starts his adventure. He meets this odd boy's step sister named Beatrice Leep, they soon become friends. The running boys nickname in this story is Mullet Fingers because he can catch a mullet with his bare hands. It seems that the running boy just wants to help owls buried in dens near a new construction site of a Mother Paula's Pancake House. To find out what happens to the Mother Paula's Pancake House and what happens to Roy's problems with Dana Matherson you need to read the rest of this book, which I really recommend for any middle kid.>>>>JESSE THOMPSON's REview....7C ESCS"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Owls are the important issue in this book. But most importantly it's the story of how Roy, Beatrice and Mullet Fingers try to change the minds of Mother Paula's Pancake House and learn to stand up for the little things.But Roy also has another problem. The school bully Dana Matherson. Who insists on beating up kids, but has a challenge with Roy. Carl Hiaasen has also written Flush for young adults. He wrote Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip, Stormy Weather, Lucky You and many other adult books.I recommend this book for young adults between ten and thirteen. I also recommend this book to anyone that loves environmental books and heartwarming stories. This book also teaches young readers to never give up and to persevere.-Austin K"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"It was great to read a book that was set in south Florida.

Some of the best qualitys of this book are, it has a really good plot and story line. I really like the charicters, my favorite charicters are Roy, Dana, Beetrice, and Mullet Fingers. I also liked how this book was suspenceful and filled with alot of action. I also liked the problem it reflects a problem a 7th grader might face in real life. My favorite part was when he found Mullet Fingers hideout. i also like how the book makes you want roy to succeed and oficer dilinko to succeed."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The novel Hoot is awesome because it was funny,visual,anddescriptive.It was funny because the reporter got strangled by Chuck Muckle.Also how the police man goes into the porta potty and jumps outbecause he saw alligators in the porta potty.It was visual because I could see different parts in my head like Chuck Muckle strangling the news reporter.It was descriptive because the author described the old boat towhere you could visualize it.Also the author described the construction site and what is on it to make it more visual.I think kids should read this book because it is a good book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"In the book, hoot, it was different then all of the other books that I normally read.

If you like books about saving animals and mysteries this book is for you."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot By: Carl Hiaasen\\"You're so dead it ain't even funny,\\" is one quote taken from the book Hoot. Carl Hiaasen is the author of the Hoot. The story takes place in a town in Florida known as Coconut Cove. The main character in the book is Roy Eberhardt, a middle school student. Roy's father works for the government and they have to move quite often. Roy just moved from Montana to Florida. To give a better description of how much the Eberhardts move the author writes, \\"Trace Middle was the sixth school he had attended since he'd started going to school.\\" Since Roy moves so much he's used to being the new kid and getting bullied around by other students. In fact, the book begins with Roy being bullied on a school bus.Roy was sitting on the school bus when, \\"Dana grabbed Roy's temple, as if he were squeezing a soccer ball.\\" As Dana, a bully, assaulted Roy on the bus Roy noticed something out of the window. As he leans closer towards the window he noticed a boy running barefoot. Curiosity rose in Roy as he began to become very inquisitive about the situation. Roy's growing curiosity led him to later meet the boy. When Roy finds out some discouraging news about some burrowing owls he feels obligated to help the boy known as Mullet Fingers. The only problem is that everyone isn't interested in saving these owls and Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice (Mullet Finger's sister) may have to go against the law.This book alternates from the life of Roy to that of Officer Delinko and Leroy Branitt a.k.a. Curly. Curly is the foreman of building the Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House project. Officer Delinko is interested in solving the crimes that occur at this pancake house. Eventually, the lives of all of these characters become intertwined.The author of Hoot tries to keep the reader in suspense. He writes about the life of Roy and just when you think something interesting is about to happen he switches over to the construction site and the lives of Curly and Officer Delinko. This can make the reader want to skip over that part and continue reading about Roy. However, both parts are connected with each other. One thing that I liked about Roy was hoe tenacious he was about helping his friends. I also liked that he stood up for what he believed in.Overall this book is full of mysterious occurrences in Florida that will surprise you."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I just finished reading HOOT and I really liked it.I liked the way the characters were described and how the events were sequenced from different points of view.My favorite part was the groundbreaking.I'm glad the owls were saved.I would of taken Lonna out of the camera as soon as possible if I would of been there;she's a terrible mother who just wanted to appear on tv. The idea of the vice principal in Trace Middle, Ms. Hennepin, having a big otrocious hair coming out of her lip was gross but hilarious;and even funnier was the idea of her dying it various colors! My favorite character was Beatrice the Bear.She was a tough soccer player and yet she took care of her father, mother, and stepbrother, Mullet Fingers, who needed someone he could trust in.Roy was the one who made the enormeous effort in saving the owls:and Mullet Fingers of course, or should I say Napoleon Bridge Leep.I never imagined that would be his name.In Ms.Smith's, my teacher,6th grade gifted language arts class, we had to draw Mullet Fingers how we imagined him and guess his name.I thought he was a Joshua or Joey.I believe only one person put Napoleon.The idea of his name being Napoleon didn't spring into my mind or most of my classmates mind.Anyone could read this book. I thought it was hilarious, with passion and intruiging mystery, and suspense.It would be awesome to meet you in person. It would also be cool if you decided to make a sequal to HOOT as you are still undecisive in that matter.I give this book 5 STARS!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a great book to read. I own the book myself. My teacher decided to read this wonderful book to all her language arts classes. She has read it more than five times I think. After I finished reading the book I stated telling my family about it all of them wanted to read it. My sister was the first one to read it and she almost never reads. She ended up likening it. After that she found out that reading was actually entertain.My favorite character was Mullet Fingers or Napoleon if u will. His determination to save the poor defense less owls was one of the bravest things I've ever seen (read in this case) someone do. Most of my favorite parts are when he and Roy give it their all to try and save the owls.People like Carl Hiassen have a great imagination on these type of writing. All the stuff that Mullet Finger does to save the owls can be recreated in many way in real life. Some of the stuff in the book can't.I'd recommend this book to anyone that wants a good book to read. I'd also say this book would make a great movie. The characters in this book and the plot would maybe win a golden globe or two. An Oscar would be very unlikely. Some people might like it and the person that makes it might win a big profit out off it.This book has been the best book I've read so far. Most of my class like it as well. Ms Smith (my lang. arts teacher) must of really liked it to read it to us. I bet she got tired of reading it three times a day but she got through it in record time.This book should have a sequel. Like what happened to Mullet Fingers after his escape. I would really like to read it. I bet I would be one of the first ones to buy it. It would surely be an award winning one just like the first one. Carl Hiassen would get more money than he ever expected. That's why I'm writing this review in the first place. So u should really read this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I really loved the new childrens book Hoot. It was an interesting story. At the end of every chapter it left you in suspese.

My favorite was the one about burrying the butter milks. The part of the book that I thought was really cool was how it tied in two different things together. You would read something about Roy being bullied and then all of a sudden you would read about Curly and Officer Delinko arguing and then at the end it all came together. My favorite character is Mullet Fingers because he always acted so sneaky about everything he was doing. The coolest thing about Mullet Fingers was that he was able to catch a mullet in his bare hands. I wish that I was able to do that. Overall I thought that it was a great book and I would recommend it to all of my friends. When I read it it wasso detailed that I able to picture everything that I read in my mind. I have never been able to do that with any other books I have read. That is so cool. I will read this book over and over again and I will never get tired of reading it. I am so glad that Carl Hiaasen wrote such a great book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read Carl Hiaasen's first novel for young readers called HOOT. I think that the book is real good. It made me be happy and it made me laugh a lot. I live in the state of Florida so I know what he means by hot summer days.My favorite part of this book is when Officer Delinko's patrol car gets spray painted by the vandal, which is Mullet Fingers or should I say Napoleon Bridger Leep. It was funny when Officer Delinko falls asleep and when he wakes up sees his patrol car windows are spray painted black. Officer Delinko thought it was early in the morning, but it was really nine thirty. I laughed my head off in this part. Another part I liked was the part that Roy mooned Dana and Dana got real mad and chased Roy about three blocks.My favorite character was Beatrice. She seemed so tough, but she cared about the owls. She really didn't like her step mom so I laughed when Beatrice bit the ring off Lonna's toe.With this book I learned you should take care of your environment and stick up for what you think is right! This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a wonderful book.The plot is very intruiguing. The whole idea of the book, the overall message is great.My favoritepart of the book was when Roy moons Dana, this part was very humorous.My teacher Ms.Smith read it to my class in sixth period. A chapter a day and some days two chapters. My class alays begged her to read one more chapter. So you can se how wonderful the book was.My favorite charecter is Roy. He is pure hearted and is dedicated to helping his friends and the owls. He portrays a great person.The rest of the charecters are brilliant aswell.Carl Hiaasen is a great author and I think this is one of his greatest books.I recommend this book to many of the young reders.

This book has weird animals that I never heard of before."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Dear Carl Hiaasen,I am a sixth grader at W.R. Thomas Middle School and i have just finished reading your novel \\"Hoot\\". I personally enjoyed the novel. It was filled with comedy and middle school conflicts. My favorite characters were Mullet Fingers, Roy and Beatrice. I was interested in the part where Mullet Finger explains and shows Roy how he got his nickname \\"Mullet Fingers\\". The part I disliked was when Mr. Chuck E. Muckle disagrees with Roy about the burrowing owls even though he knew they were on the property. I would definetly recommend this book to younger and older people. It was a book of conflicts, protest, and comedy. When reading the book I felt like I was part of the book. The characters came alive and actually told to story. Your descriptions and phrase's helped me understand the book. The only part that i think wasn't in the book was wether the file was with Chuck E. Muckle or Curly. I just wanted to congratulate you on an awesome novel that should be recommended to others for enjoyment, comedy and much more. Farther more, I really loved your novel and would pass on the story for years to come.Thanks,(...)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"\\"HOOT\\" was a great novel. It had comedy and some action in it. Also, it takes place in Florida, which is where I'm from.Most characters had lot of personality. Garret was funny and sarcastic. He mostly had funny remarks. Dana Matherson was the bully who picked on Roy. He's stupid and just plain wretched. Roy was very gallant. He stood up to Dana in the bus and punched him in the nose. Beatrice was tough. These are only some of the many characters in this story but, out of them all, there is one favorite. Napoleon Bridger (a.k.a Mullet Fingers) . He did not want Mother Paula's Pancake House to be constructed on top of the burrowing owls dens. He really cared about those owls. He also could catch mullets. I thought that was incredible. He never gave up to save those owls.My favorite parts of this book were mostly with Beatrice. She hanged Dana on the flag pole and most of the times Beatrice came out of nowhere to save Roy from Dana. Beatrice is also a little crazy. She bit off her stepmother's toe ring and kept it as her own and she bit on Roy's bicycle tires. The tire got flat.I probably will never forget this book. I was always eager to read the next chapter because the plot kept on getting better. I recommend this book to read."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"If it was not for Dana Matherson Roy would have never met the running boy.And if it wasn't for the running boy he would have never met tough Beatrice and if it wasn't for them he would have never known the burrowing owls.My favorite part of the book was when Roy,Mullet Fingers,and Beatrice protested about Mother Paulas site and the burrowing owls.What Iliked best of this part was that Roy brought all his friends to protest and Beatrice brought all of her friends.The character I liked best was Roy because he tried his best to save the owls. Also he was lying to save the owls.He did a good job being the new kid in town and having not so many friends and saveing the owls.This book teached me to choose what is best from what is in the heart and what is in the brain.I recommend this book to all 13 and under kids."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"What I thought about the book overall is that it was a very good book. It is a nice book to read one chapter maybe two a day. My favorite part of the whole story is when they are at the beautiful groundbreaking ceremony. They are there to save the owls' dens underground from being destroyed from the bulldozer when they start the construction. This is not only the climax of the story, but it's \\"the story,\\" the moment every reader is waiting for as they read this book.To top everything off a little burrowing owl lands quietly on Mullet Fingers head which finalizes the evidence of owls' dens existing underground in Mother Paula's Construction site. The chapter ends when Mullet Fingers says that the owls would be safe. My favorite character that I enjoyed and laughed about the most was Chuckle E. Muckle, the vice president of the Mother Paula's and his problems with narcissism. The way he thinks and talks as if he was hot shot made me laugh as I read those parts of the story. These parts were the most entertaining section of the story.It is awesome how the author vividly describes the owls and characters. The story of how there might be animals in danger due to construction is something that we as people face everyday and I believe it should be cared for. The most interesting thing about the book is that it is suitable for all ages. What I think was best is that it makes you want to continuously read the next chapters. The foreshadowing and suspense in most of the chapters keeps the reader alert. The character and how everything was planned out was terrific. I enjoyed the book a lot and I am looking forward to reading many of the author's other books of his collection."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Being a fan of Mr. Hiaasen's wonderfully twisted, weird fiction for adults, I was intrigued by the idea of him writing for a younger audience. Would there be a crazed, hulking idiot with a dead pit bull hanging off his arm? A roadkill-eating former governor? How would he present his somewhere-between-amused-and-disgusted attitude toward humanity in a manner palatable to kids?I'm happy to report that HOOT is funny, well written, and enjoyable, even for a depraved old lady like me. The plot concerns Roy Eberhardt, an intelligent, resourceful middle-school student who has just moved to Florida from Montana. He misses the mountains and wilderness of Montana. As a kid who has moved a lot, he's not surprised to be the victim of bully Dana Matherson. While being pummeled by Dana on the school bus, Roy spies a kid running along the sidewalk, a kid with no backpack and no shoes. Intrigued, he sets out to find him and gets involved up to his eyeballs in the strange kid's guerilla tactics to save a particular street corner from its fate as the future site of another Mother Paula's All-American Pancake. The adults seem to be ignoring the burrows of tiny owls that will be buried by the bulldozing equipment any day now. Roy's parents explain that it surely is a shame about the owls, but the company must have filed all of the papers and received all of the necessary permits. But Roy and his new friends --- Mullet Fingers, the outlaw boy, and Beatrice, his tough, soccer playing stepsister --- are not about to take the destruction of the owls' burrows lying down. Along the way they outwit Officer Delinko, the ambitious cop who tries to protect the site, and Curly, the foreman who's responsible for getting the job started.Roy's parents are thoughtful and very caring. Roy shields his tenderhearted Mom from the fact that Mullet Fingers lives in the woods and at the dump because his own mother doesn't want him. That's probably the most brutal aspect of the novel, unless perhaps it's the dishonesty of the Mother Paula's corporation in attempting to deny the existence of the endangered owls. Mr. and Mrs. Eberhardt worry about Roy and advise him, but ultimately, Roy figures out a successful plan on his own.The book carries us along with a pleasing suspense and steady pace. The author provides neat encapsulations of each character's motivations that are often missing from adult fiction. (Presumably we can work it out for ourselves.) While it might be missing the extreme characters and profanity of his adult novels, HOOT still reflects Mr. Hiaasen's usual indignation over the rape of his native Florida. Roy is an appealing character, one who may very well inspire young readers to question authority when necessary and act to protect the environment. How subversive is that? Kids of all ages should love it.--- Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman Nicol"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiaasen is riding the wave of adult fiction writers down-shifting their word processors to \\"Kid Lit\\" in the wake of Harry Potter. In \\"Hoot,\\" a new Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House will wipe out the habitat of cute little endangered burrowing owls who are \\"about as tall as a beer can\\" and mean no one any harm. Some Middle School kids take up the cause. The characters here aren't quite as quirky as Adult Hiaasen, but \\"Mullet Fingers\\" could be an adolescent prequel to Viet Vet/former Florida Governor Skink (*Native Tongue* etc.) Here's what this savvy kid says about his home in South Florida, which is just as applicable here in Northern Minnesota or anywhere else encroached by real estate development juggernauts: \\"Ever since I was little... I've been watchin' this place disappear - the piney woods, the scrub, the creeks, the glades. Even the beaches, man - they put up these giant hotels and only goober tourists are allowed. It really sucks.\\"\\"Hoot\\" encourages concern for the environment and social conscience. For a \\"Young Adult\\" book, there is some questionable language and a possibly non-sequitur too-detailed focus on our \\"only-child\\" hero's mother's miscarriage. As they say in the movies: \\"Parental discretion advised.\\" reviewed by TundraVision"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Being a fan of Carl Hiassen's adult mysteries, I ran out and bought this book for my children as soon as it was available. Having an 11 year old stepdaughter who reads the Harry Potter novels over and over, I was anxious to steer her somewhere closer to reality. I am not faulting the J.K. Rowling bestsellers and am glad they are getting children to read, but too many kids are starting to \\"live\\" in that world, and there needs to be interesting books that take place in a world more similar to a child's day to day life.And this one is. The unlikely \\"hero\\", Roy, is the new kid at school, and gets drawn into a plot with an even unlikelier activist, nicknamed \\"Mullet Fingers\\", to save a field full of burrowing owls from developers who intend to erect a pancake house on the site. And in the end he learns that a small group of people can make a difference.My only problem with the book is the fate of \\"Mullet Fingers\\" but I won't give away what happens here. And I hope that Hiassen resurrects these characters for another book, because I still want to know what happens to them!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is an average, unimaginative children's book. My daughter and I read it together, and she enjoyed it, but then again she enjoys almost any book we read together. Usually, I know it's good when she takes the book to bed to read on her own when we finish our nightly chapter. This one stayed on the table every night but one.It has a clear environmentalists agenda, which gets unfortunately lopsided and preachy at times. Even as a generally \\"earth-friendly\\" guy, I found the baffoonish developers to be needlessly insulting. Children are smarter than Hiaasen thinks, and a more balanced picture of the opposition would have made a much more interesting story. Like so many writers for children these days, Hiaasen seems to think filling the book with fart jokes and questionable language will keep the kids entertained. He also drags us along on several character history sidetracks, most which simply serve to slow the already plodding story. At least one (a past discovery of a dead body having nothing to do with the story) seemed pointlessly dark and gruesome.Yes, overall we enjoyed it, but I grew tired of editing out the repeated [bad words] as I read aloud, and fart jokes get old after the 15th or 20th time. I am thrilled to see more authors attempt to write for children, but I am not convinced Hiaasen fully understands or appreciates his new audience."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is telltale proof that not is only is Carl Hiaasen a great editorial columnist, writer of novels featuring the dregs of South Florida's crime wave, but is also a refreshing and talented writer of children's literature. I wish that he would write at least 19 additional books like Hoot, even if they never wander far from the Hiaasen fare of ecological revenge and sappy hoodlums and developers. Hoot turned me into a permanent fan of Carl Hiaasen.This book has all the elements of pubescent embarrassment I endured growing up. Mullet Fingers would be my hero and probably my best friend, as he escapes an abusive family and lives in the wild, surviving with the help of sister Beatrice Leep. I relate to Roy as the kid who always gets caught, beat up, and harrassed by domineering males and females. Hoot really hits home.I recommend Hoot to anyone struggling to become a reader of books, but without the maturity to sit still more than a few minutes. I couldn't put Hoot down, and finished it at 2am. Some of the characters in Hiaasen's adult level reading novels seem fabricated or introduced to fulfill missions of the main characters, but all the folks in Hoot are people I've known, are entirely realistic, and are unpredictable-the same as real folk.Carl Hiaasen has discovered his genre-children's literature, and if I have anything to do about it, purchasing every one he writes and recommending them to kids, he will be successful and in demand as long as he's alive. J.K. Who? I think the word now is HOOT!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I gave the book Hoot by Carl Hiaasen five star rating. The book is about a kid called Roy and he sees a running boy. During the novel Roy starts to hear about the vandalism at the construction site. I liked the entire book.

This is Carl Hiaasen's best book and I would read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I listened to this book and really enjoyed it. It is a 2003 Newbery Honor book. It has comedy, drama and an environmental message.I do wonder how many teens really endorse this book as much of the humor comes from three rather hapless adult characters in the book. They may enjoy the ribbing the characters receive. Ultimately, I think Hiaasen is successful in recounting the adventures of Roy Eberhardt, the new kid from Montana who has arrived at Trace Middle School in Coconut Grove, Florida.He is the target of an oafish bully and is trying to avoid being killed on the school bus when he sees a boy his own age running barefoot alongside the bus. The image of the kid stays in his head and after lots of investigation he determines that the boy is homeless by choice and the step-brother of a school mate, Beatrice.Through his new acquaintences he becomes embroiled in an effort to save a group of burrowing owls whose habitat is threatened by the construction of a Mother Paula's Pancake house. The construction site has suffered a series of pranks and light hearted sabotage which has delayed the bulldozing of the construction zone.As an adult I appreciated that Roy has two loving and supportive parents to contrast the rather bleak homelife of Beatrice and her step-brother, nicknamed Mullet Fingers. The interactions between Roy and the bully Dana Matherson are hilarious. Hiaasen's descriptions of the Everglades and natural places are mystical."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Dear Mr. Hiaasen,I have just finished reading your book, Hoot. I really enjoyed the book because it was fun to read. Every chapter led me to want to read the next one. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I learned many lessons in reading this book. Among them was that you should always stand up for what you believe in. I also learned that any changes to a town, city, street, always affects the environment around the change, the wildlife, waterways, etc. I learned about the EIS, environmental impact statement, and how important this is to any new building.My favorite character was Napoleon, \\"Mullet Fingers\\", because he was willing to take the risks of fighting for something he believed in. I think he makes a wonderful role model for kids my age. He was willing to risk going to jail, his mother's anger at his escape, and his life to save the owls. My favorite part of the book was when Napoleon took Roy to a mangrove where they sat on Molly Bell's pilothouse. Napoleon showed Roy how to catch a mullet with his bear hands. I liked this part of the book because I like to fish and could relate to what Napoleon was teaching Roy.(...)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt is the new kid in Trace Middle School in humid Coconut Grove, Florida. Roy misses Montana and his friends there, but it's not the first time his family is moving around. Being a new kid often, he is not surprised when thick-headed bully Dana Matherson gets to him on the school bus, mashing his face against the window. But what Roy is surprised about - is seeing a boy with sun bleached hair running outside, barefoot, running as fast as the school bus, and even faster.That's how it all has started for Roy - meeting a runaway, Mullet Fingers, his tough stepsister Beatrice, and discovering endangered miniature burrowing owls. Mullet Fingers knows that the birds are in big danger, since Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House is scheduled to be built over their burrows. Roy and Beatrice unite to help Mullet Fingers on his mission to save the owls. Together they carry on some of the outrageous pranks on the construction site: uprooting survey stakes, spray-painting the police car's windows black with the officer dozing off inside, filling the portable patties with alligators. The policemen and the manager of the construction site are aggravated and determined to discover who is messing up the site at night.Comic twists, suspenseful scenes, and Carl Hiaasen's humor make the story entertaining and hard to put down. Florida's setting is described in realistic details with pro-environment and anti-development message woven into the story line.

My students also enjoyed it. iwould warn therer are some minor curse words and one mooning."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"For the legion of Hiaasen fans out there, 'Hoot' is pure Hiaasen but without the raunchiness and ribald humor. It is more whimsical than funny, its plot rather obvious and ultra-wholesome, but it's a very enjoyable read nonetheless. Hiaasen transforms himself into a young teen who, with other rascals his age, fight corporate America from building upon land where nesting ground owls call home. These kids pull all sorts of tricks to defeat the wicked and inept adults. Although this book is clearly targeted to the junior high school set, and I think it makes a wonderful read for boys and girls, it's the sort of read adults can enjoy especially if they don't want to think too hard. You will never confuse 'Hoot' with works by Leo Tolstoy or Henry James.Bottom line: lighthearted and politically correct."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book is about a middle-school aged boy named Roy Eberhardt, who just moved again from Montana. His father works for the Justice Dept. so he is transferred a lot. Roy changed 6 schools so far There, the bully, Dana Matherson, presses Roy's face against a window. That was where he saw Mullet Fingers, a runaway boy running away from the bus with no shoes. The next day, he saw Mullet Fingers again and chases him. Eventually, Roy is hit with a golf ball and taken back to school. At school, he gets a 2-week bus suspension and meets the fugitive's stepsister: Beatrice Leep. After school, Roy goes to hunt Mullet Fingers and got to know him a little.At a construction site for Mother Paula's All-American Pancakes, numerous incidents of vandalism are reported: survey stakes pulled out, alligators are put in a portable toilet, a police car being painted black, bulldozer seats removed, and snakes on the construction site. The construction foreman Leroy \\"Curly\\" Branitt and his boss Chuck Muckle work with a local cop named David Delinko to find the culprit.As Roy attempts to solve the mystery, Dana Matherson tries to strangle Roy in a closet when Roy was rescued by Beatrice. Beatrice leads him to Mullet Fingers to feed burrowing owls on the pancake construction site. Beatrice tells of her violent family and why Mullet Fingers is running. Roy finds out that the endangered owls live on the proposed construction site and they're going to be crushed by the bulldozers. Roy also finds out that 1. Dana got arrested, and 2. Mullet Fingers did all the vandalism.When the bulldozing time approaches, Roy, Beatrice and Mullet Fingers has to think of something to save the owls. Can they do it?I would highly recommend this book. This book was a comedy at first but it turned serious and pro-environmental. The 3 points of this story are: 1. Kids can think big, 2. Always put the environment first, and 3. What's legal or profitable isn't always right. It keeps up suspense, and can keep you awake thinking what's going to happen next. It also tells of major companies violating environmental laws to make more profit. You have to pick up the book if you like suspense, a mystery, and/or the environment."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is my most favorite book I have ever read so far.It is so intrastingbecause it is about one of my favorite animals the burrowing owl.it is about kids who save the baby owls from a bull dozer that is going to cover all the dens.it is one of the most intrasting because it has a purpose and its not just a made up story that is what I like about it the most.my favorite caracter is Beatrice A.K.A ''Beatrice the bear''.She is the tough soccer player stronger then the biggest bully in schoolDana Matherson this is the best book I have ever read and I hope to read it again someday."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book would be a fiction book because all over the world kids are being bullied and this story uses a kid that gets bullied all the time and shows how he uses self defense to fight the bully. Hoot was a disappointing book. The reason why I thought it was not a great book was because it wasn't that interesting to me, and it was confusing at some points when it would change scene in the middle of the chapter. Throughout the book it was confusing and hard to follow along. It would be talking about Roy and his problems, being bullied, the running boy and Beatrice and then all of a sudden it would be talking about Police officer Delinko and his problems with his job, falling asleep on the job and getting his car spray painted while he slept in the patrol car. A surprise in the story is when I found out that the running boy was Beatrice's stepbrother who was kind of freaky because she and her family did nothing to try and get him back when he ran away."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is a really good book. It definely made more aware of what's going on in the world. Now I know that if something really cool is being built, there's always a bad side--like when animals get kicked out of their homes or even killed. I also want to pay more attention to saving wild animals after reading this book. I thought the book was really funny, and there was a lot going on. I enjoyed all the character's different accents--they were fun to read out loud. The only thing I didn't like was that some parts of the book were over my head (I'm going into 4th grade) and I had to go back and reread so I wouldn't be totally lost. I definitely recommend this book for kids 10 and older!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a great book, but I believe it has gotten too much praise for its content. In the book, there are three points of view- Roy, the new kid, Delinko the police officer, and Curly, the construction foreman. Roy and his friends try to stop the construction of a pancake house through seemingly random acts of vandalism while Curly and Delinko try figuring out why they want the construction to stop. Mid chapter on multiple occasions there is a sudden change in point of view, which when it happens you either feel cheated or deceived, or happy that you finally got back to the interesting part. Even with my complaints, this is still a very good book. Hiaasen makes the whole book unravel like a mystery combined with multiple ways of seeing the same event. I would recommend this book, giving it a 4 out of 5 rating."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is about three kids saving the enviroment. A boy from Texas or so, comes to a different state. Why? Because of his dad's job. They always moved around. So this guy meets Beatrice because he always had to see another guy run barefoot super fast. Beatrice told him to stay away but he couldn't. He was just so amazed by his speed, and he didn't even go to school. So this boy couldn't stay away, well he didn't until he met him. His \\"name\\" was Butterfingers because he caught these small fish with his bare hands. He was hiding from his parents because he was \\"bad,\\" he was rebellious. Beatrice & Butterfingers were brother and sister, so she helped him hide. They were trying to avoid the construction of a new pancake house in the place where baby owls lived underground. The people from the pancake house (meaning the boss) knew about these owls, but he still wanted that place. Well, I've said enough.

Hoot is just one of his amazing stories that will amaze readers of all ages! Being New York Times Bestseller, you must read this book!To start off, being the \\"new kid\\" is not something 11 year old Roy Eberhardt enjoys. He wants nothing to do with his new home down in Florida. He would rather be riding horses back up in his old home Montana.Finally, Roy meets some kids he favors. They just happen to be brothers and sisters. But can they trust Roy with there big secret? Or will never Roy never find out the true meaning to their secrecy? With the help of his new friends, Roy discovers something bad is going to happen to the construction site. Roy is okay with them building a new pancake house, but soon he finds out what they are building on, Roy's mind changes forever. Who knew something easy as looking through a fence could change how you look at things forever? But even worse than that the people that are destroying the poor creatures, they know exactly that they are there.Hence, just when they think they have the perfect plan, everything goes wrong. Between biting dogs, rat traps, alligator invested port-a-potties, and so much more. No wonder, this book is so crazy and funny! But will it be too late for Roy and his new friends? Or will it be too late for the animals?"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book gives a great understanding to how we are destroying out environment just for the sake of more restaurants.

I'm glad I read this ahead of time because I didn't agree that it should have gotten any award by any means. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a strong environmental message.

It is a quick read and I enjoyed it for what it is; however, I found that it was missing the \\"Aha\\" moment that most all Newberry award winners have. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen the Newberry seal on the cover, because my expectations wouldn't have been so high. That being said I think it will translate well into a movie."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot is a very interesting book. It is really funny and random. The genre is mostly comedy and mystery. It is the funniest book I ever read. I really like Roy, the main charecter. He is very odd butfunny. Dana Marthston is the big bully looking for fresh meat.Roy is a 7th grader who just moved from Montana to Florida. When Dana Marthston is shoving his head in the bus window, he sees a boy running with no shoes. He tries to chase him but gets hit by a golfball. His father works for the govorment so if Roy told him he would report it"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiaasen writes very funny books featuring clueless petty criminals, ruthless real estate developers, and Keystone-type cops, capping them off with a likeable underdog hero. Although \\"Hoot\\" is his first book for kids/teens, he varies not at all from this winning formula either in style or quality. Don't think of this book as \\"Hiassen lite\\" but as one of the funniest kids' books to come out in a long time, with a special but not exclusive appeal to boys. My 10-year-old ate it at one gulp.It's a hilarious story about a lonely kid named Roy, just moved to a Florida town, who discovers that a local pancake house is about to be built on the site of some endangered nesting owls.Hiaasen does not water down his dry sense of humor at all but delivers it full strength for his younger readers, and has a sympathetic ear for the kinds of problems real kids face: you'll be rooting for Roy, for example, when he outsmarts the schoolbus bully Dana Matherson, who ends up strapped to the school flagpole in his underwear."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I really liked this book since it was a mixture of comedy and mystery. my teacher read the book awsome that was what made the book more intresting since she did good voice effects. My favorite part was when Roy had to followed Mullet Fingers into the woods and then Roy got hit in the head with a golf ball. I also liked the part when Mullet Fingers was bit by the dog and they took Mullet Fingers to the hospital and Roy used Roy for Mullet Fingers name in order to be treated and Roy was lieing to the hospoital people. My favorite person in the book is Mullet Fingers since he is a very mysterious guy since he keeps everything a secret.The least favorite character in the book of mine is beatrice since she is a strong soccer player and i don't like the girls that are all strong and also since she gave Roy a hard time like hitting him against the lockers and things like that. But in the end Beatrice came through and helped Roy prove that there are Burrowing Owls in the construction site."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot: (noun) 1. To make the natural throat noise of an owl.2. To assail with contemptuous cries or other expressions of disapproval or contempt.(This definition has been brought to you courtesy of \\"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\\").A clever title for a book that is, in and of itself, pretty darn smart. Penned by a man better known for his adult detective tales, \\"Hoot\\" garnered a fair amount of praise when it was first published. It did win the 2003 Newbery Honor Award, after all. No small feat with the sheer amount of well-written children's literature out there. The book is deceptively simple, excellently written, and a great addition to the canon of kids-taking-on-corporate-monoliths-with-grassroots-intervention genre.Roy has just moved to Florida from Montana, and he hates it. No wonder too. In Montana he had mountains, and cowboys, and fresh cool seasons. In Florida he has flat flat landscapes, a bully that wants to squash Roy in a variety of different shapes, and detestable summery sticky seasons. Things start looking up, however, when Roy spots a barefooted boy running at top speed away from the school bus on a weekday. Sensing a mystery to the boy, Roy gets involved in a plot involving the local burrowing owl population. It seems as if a huge chain entitled Mother Paula's All-American Pancake Houses, Inc. has decided to build its next yummy store smack dab on top of the owls and their homes. Joining with the barefoot boy (nicknamed Mullet Fingers) and the boy's soccer playing tough-girl step-sister Beatrice, the three work to put an end to the dastardly plot to bury the burrowers.I'm coming at this book from a number of different levels. To begin with, it does my aging (albeit 26-year-old) hippy heart glad to see a book in which grassroots organization ultimately topples large competitors like Mother Paula's. What really is impressive is one of the many morals of the story. Roy is told by his parents to balance the wishes of his heart with his head. Obviously he cares for these tiny owls and their homes, but engaging in vandalism like Mullet Fingers (harmless vandalism, yes, but illegal just the same) isn't going to solve anything. What Roy has to do, ultimately, is to go the relatively boring route. Get the facts on paper. In the end, the solution to the problem is as much legal as it is moral. Hiassen does take the easy route out by having the owl be an endangered species. I would have personally enjoyed the story more if this was just a tale about a couple kids trying to save perfectly normal and common burrowing owls, but oh well. It's a tiny complaint. On another level, how many books do your read these days where a) The main character has caring parents b) The main character has caring parents that are intelligent and c) The main character has caring parents that are intelligent AND to whom the main character reveals everything when asked. When Roy's dad asks him to explain himself, he does. This is such a rarity in children's literature on a whole (usually because it's easier to write disobeying children than obeying ones) that it deserves to be commended. So well done, Mr. Author-sir. Well done indeed.The characters are particularly well drawn as well. Hats off to Carl Hiaasen for his excellent depictions of women-folk. Beatrice Leep is a soccer jock, blond, and wears glasses. Ooh! Quick quick, who can spot the character that doesn't rely on ancient stereotypes? I can I can! Beatrice ain't no one you've met before, honey. She has a horrible family life, a step-brother she must protect at all costs, and sharp pointy teeth. I was particularly taken with the moment in which Beatrice decides to knaw her mother's toe ring off her nasty stepmother's foot. Rounding out the unusual characters is an officer that's simulataneously a lummox and redeemable, a foreman that's a boor but amusing, and a bully that never really tries to become a good guy in any way, shape, or form.I could go on and on, but Amazon.com limits reviews to 1000 words, so I'll just stop here. The point I am making is that this book isn't just moral and isn't just well-written, but is also (most importantly) fun. It's amusing to read. You just want to zip through it when you start your perusal. If Hiaasen isn't satisfied with merely snatching the Newbery Honor, then I personally would like to request that he strive for the top honor again. Write another book, Mr. Hiaasen! If it's even half as good as this one, you can rest assured that I'll be reading it soon."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hi!While I was reading Hoot I loved it, it's just the bad words were kind of crazy.

The book focuses on Roy, a very dynamic character, who has just moved to Florida. One day, when going to school, he sees a boy running into the woods and he is very curious. He gets caught up with this boy who has a plan to save local owls. These owls would be killed by a new construction project in town. He then protests against the workers, and gets in mischief. Sometimes the book can get exciting and intense. One part said \\"He clenched his right fist and brought it up blindly over his shoulder, as hard as he could right into Dana's face\\".This is just one of the problems in this book.

This book is action packed with thrilling events and a lot of suspense. Hoot makes you literally laugh out loud. For instance, Roy the main character moons the school bully Dana Matherson. Also a cop, Officer Delinko, was in his slumber and some kids spray painted his police car causing him to be put on desk duty for a month.Hoot is filled with adventure that keeps you reading and reading. For example, Roy and mullet fingers, a boy that lives in the forest, had to run away from the police. Roy, Beatrice and mullet fingers get together people to protest and to save the owls. Mullet fingers gets hurt and has to go to the hospital, but he cant give away his real name because he does not want to go back to his parents house, or let anybody to find out where he lives, or that he doesn't go to school.This book is jovial with amusement throughout the book.

The main characters of the book are: Beatrice Leep, a mystery boy (I can't tell you his name because his name is revealed in the middle of the story), Roy Eberhardt, Curly, and Officer Delinko. This book is from two different perspectives. One is from Roy and the other is from Officer Delinko. This book is intriguing because you have to read one chapter from one perspective. And the next is from another. So, you will have to read the chapter in between, then you will want to continue that chapter and then you'll be excited because you can continue the chapter before then. That is what I like about this book. It all started out when Roy had his face was pushed into the bus window by the bully. He saw a boy that was running away from the school. He was curious. At almost the same time, Delinko and Curly had a problem. All of the construction stakes were pulled out of the Mother Paula's Pancake House construction site! Curly was furious but Delinko and Roy were curious. Does the mystery boy have something to do with the dillema?

Roy noticed a boy running alongside the school bus, as if trying to catch it. The bus turned a corner to let students on, but the boy just kept on running. He was the fastest runner Roy had ever seen! After school that day, Roy goes to look for the boy. He ends up meeting him everyday after school, along with the boy's stepsister, Beatrice. They end up trying to save owl nests, which are in the ground, that are going to be built over by a pancake restaurant. Hoot is a wondrous journey about friendship and courage to try to save animals!Hiaasen's writing is amazing. He uses many vigorous verbs along with many similes and metaphors. His writing flows to create a smooth story. It made me feel like the actual characters trying to save the owls. I felt like the characters were talking to me in the book.Another reason why I like this book is the plot. The storyline of this book is spectacular. When the kids do everything they can to save the owls it just makes me want to do the same in my world. It is a wonderful story, and when I read it, I found that I was being pulled into the story. I also found it very hard to put this hypnotizing book down. In conclusion, Hoot is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Have you ever read one of Carl Hiaasen's books?! If you have, you will probably agree with me that Hoot is his best novel.One of the reasons I loved this book is because the characters found something they believed in and stood up for it. They did this because the construction workers wanted to plow over the burrowing owl's homes, for a Mother Paula's Pancake House would be there soon. Even though one of the characters, Mullet Fingers, got inflamed, they still did not give up. Roy and Beatrice went around at their school and told their classmates and teachers what was happening, for they wanted to spread the word of this evil deed. Like Martin Luther King Jr. the threesome of Roy, Beatrice, and Mullet Fingers stood up for what they believed in.As well as courageous characters, this book also has suspense at the end of every chapter. I have read a million books that don't have suspense, and that makes it just plain boring. For example, \\"Yeah,\\" said Roy, but already he was thinking about a plan. He was determined to find the running boy. The end finalizes well because it has a happy ending and there isn't a sequel. Another reason why the end concludes well is for the reason that they had to stop the construction and the owls were saved. That was why I think Hoot is a must read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl HiaasenAn overly long, but well-written (style, challenging and modern vocabulary) story of a kid, Roy, newly arrived in Florida, and his friendship with bully Beatrice and her step-brother Mullet Fingers. The themes of Capitalism vs. the environment, along with a good touch of civil disobedience, are appropriate and perfect themes for young teenagers' (with those beautifully over-developed senses of justice and righteousness). It has a great message: you can believe in something, you have the power to do something about the problems in this world. Unfortunately, great themes can't really hold a book together that has flat characters and a thin plot.

Twelve year old Roy Eberhardt the main character has recently moved from Montana to Coconut Cove, Florida where he encounters strange people and things. The story begins as the school bully is crushing Roy's face into the buses window and he sees a barefooted boy running away from the school bus with no books. After several days of trying to follow and catch the shoeless boy, Roy is caught by him. Mullet Fingers is impressed by Roy's knowledge of the snakes he has, that he explains to him about the miniature burrowing owls at the construction site which are on the endangered species.There is Roy an everyday kid with a mom who cares and wants him to do the right thing. Then there is Mullet Fingers who is homeless and very mischievous, but cares for nature. Some other minor characters who add comedy and realism to the story are Beatrice \\"Bear\\", who is Mullet Fingers stepsister, the foreman, and the policeman.I would recommend this book because it is enjoyable, has mystery, and is funny. The pranks are mischievous like baby alligators in the portable potties, and spraying the police car windows black while the officer is asleep in it, just to mention a few incidents. I would suggest this book to students in fifth through eighth grade because of the bulling issues, environmental and nature, and the humor of how grown ups can sometimes act."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I think this is an amazing book. It had many twists and different characters. All the characters had there own unique personalities. Like Mullet Fingers who was always thinking up his next scheme, and Beatrice who had a mean side but was also very caring too. Hoot was definitely a page-turner that kept you guessing.

It's about a boy named Roy who moves to Florida and finds a boy who is trying to save some owls. When Roy joins in the battle against the burying of the owls' dens, he dosn't know what he's getting into. Guard dogs, cottonmouth moccasins with sparkly tails and alligators are just a few of the obstacles Roy meets up with. What I liked most about this book is how the author described how Roy felt both emotionally and physically, but what I didn't like is that I felt that the author wasn't very descriptive with the setting. One of my favorite characters in this book is a girl named Beatrice Leap because at the same time she is caring and protective of her brother, but also she is a \\"tough guy\\" girl who isn't messed with at school. A scene that meant something to me was on pages 291-292 when Roy tries to catch a mullet (small fish) barehanded like \\"Mullet Fingers\\" had said he could, but found it impossible. Then he hears a laugh and goes to find no one there, but when he starts to put on his shoe, he finds a mullet in it. This scene means something because I think that \\"Mullet Fingers\\" put the mullet in his shoe and I like how the scene finishs off the story because it makes you feel good inside. I would tell someone that this book is a great book with medium action at a medium pace. This is definitly a book I would read again. A question I have after reading this book is: are the owls mentioned in this book are really a species of owls, or if the author just made them up? My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it shows how determined people can be if they really want to do something. This book is definitly worth reading!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot introduces you to two different boys, one from a secure family and a runaway who has only a sister to trust and talk to. The boys come together because of one thing they both care about, owls. I really enjoyed the way the author wrote Hoot. In different chapters, he switches from the point of view of Roy, the main character, to the point of view of a policeman who gets involved in a complicated series of events. The nervous and frustrated policeman is on thin ice with his job and only wants to figure things out. The boys are always on the verge of getting into serious trouble but only because they want to do something good. There are several other interesting characters who add to the stress and confusion. Each chapter just keeps you hungry for more and at the same time keeps you guessing. You only find out what's going on toward the middle of the book and then you start wondering how it will all work out. Hoot may look like it will take you a long time to read but it goes by fast. It's realistic fiction set in the present time. It's pretty easy to read and has plenty of humor in it, but it also talks about some important issues. Hoot was a hoot for me to read and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot, by the creative Carl Hiaasen is one of my most favorite and well enjoyed books I've ever had the opportunity to dive into. Set in the environmentally sensitive and rich paradise of Florida- Coconut Grove to be precise, this setting is perfect for the book. Roy, a young boy is picked on to no end by the brawny Dana Matherson. Roy has only a select few friends and is the punching bag for Dana whenever he deems right. One day he deemed it right to shove Roy's face against the window of the school bus where he sees a barefooted boy jetting down the street. Roy doesn't just brush it off, like most would, the thought is lingering in his head all day of a boy with charcoal colored feet running amazingly fast- somebody he's never seen. Roy, a tall, quirky girl named Beatrice and her brother- the barefooted mystery boy nicknamed Mullet Fingers (who eventually beats up Dana) band together to stop a new Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House from being constructed after they discover a burrown of adorable endangered owls on the construction site. Mullet Fingers is extremely dedicated to saving this last piece of serenity in a tourist-bustling town \\"Ever since I was little... I've been watching this place disappear - the piney woods, the scrub, the creeks, the glades. Even the beaches, man - they put up these giant hotels and only goober tourists are allowed. It really sucks.\\" In order to stop the bulldozers the three set pranks on the site's construction supervisor- Curly including putting baby alliagtors in the portapotty and poisonous snakes all over the grounds. Curly hires a group of guard dogs to watch over the premises, but even that too is no match to the effective thinking of Mullet Fingers. After days of constant pranks, stalling of the construction, discontent with management at Mother Paula's the new building is in danger of being cancelled. What was so surprising is the fact that Mother Paula's knew about their existence. Then a string of great events happens and the three get what they want- I would elaborate, but the ending is too good. I recommend Hoot to anybody who wants a good read and a fast one chock full of humor and environmental conscience and stewardship. I wish everyone on Earth was this environmentally conscience and we wouldn't have global warming, endangered species and so on- a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot, by the creative Carl Hiaasen is one of my most favorite and well enjoyed books I've ever had the opportunity to dive into.

Everyone says these three little words at some point in their life. Most of the time people will say these words to their best friend when their kids, but a lot of friends end up not being friends forever. Different reasons keep people from being friends forever, and one of those reasons is because people move and drift apart. Roy Eberhardt knows how it feels to move and leave his friends, but he also knows how it feels to make new ones.Roy Eberhardt's family just moved to a small town in Florida from Montana, due to Mr. Eberhardt's job. Roy doesn't like Florida because it is nothing like Montana. Roy also has trouble making friends, for some reason everyone wants to pick on him. That is until he meets Beatrice Leep and her stepbrother, Mullet Fingers. Mullet Fingers seems like a troublemaker at first, until Roy finds out why he makes all the trouble. So Roy and Mullet Fingers set out to save something that know one believes can be saved.It is through Roy and Mullet Fingers experiences that Roy makes new friends, discovers new interests, and learns to care for less advantaged beings. Roy's experiences give him a new hope for a better life in Florida.Sometimes the best decisions you can make you make without even thinking about making them. Carl Hiaasen gives us a chance to think about what we could do for others to make their lives easier and to make our lives less boring and more fulfilled. Hiaasen also shows us how to deal with anything life wants to throw us.This is a great book for anyone to read. This book shows people the good and bad in this world, and it also shows us what we can do to make this world better. Plus, there is excitement, worry, and surprises in this book that will make you want to read page after page. HOOT is a great book that is written for anyone of any age to read."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"really good book got to read again and over and over and over.IT has some swers in it but there not that bad."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"It was a fun exiting adventure! I got lost in his way of keeping you on the edge!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is an enthralling tale of mystery, confusion, and adventure. It is a dizzy story of 13-year-old Roy Eberhardt finding himself obsessed with a shoeless boy, running like a lightning bolt outside his school bus every morning. Roy gets beat up by Dana Matherson and suspiciously rejected by Beatrice Leap in his mission to learn more about the running boy and give him shoes.From two perspectives, the story is told. Although all in third person, one side of the story is the life of Officer Delinko and the other, Roy Eberhardt. Roy is the new kid in the city of Miami and has not acquired many friends yet. He is a curious and adventurous young man with an ample amount of bravery, which can many times get into trouble with bullies. Officer Delinko is a lowly police officer who is constantly trying to prove himself in order to achieve his goal of someday becoming a detective.Mother Paula's Pancake house is in the works of being built, but the ground is remaining bare because there is a small obstacle. Someone keeps vandalizing the property. Officer Delinko is on the case, trying to catch the clever prankster. When Roy finally meets Beatrice's stepbrother, the nameless running boy, he realizes this is more than just a silly joke. The running boy is delaying construction to save the owls. Roy soon realizes that saving the owls who will be left homeless after their homes are extirpated is the most important thing.Hoot is told in such a way that I only knew bits and pieces of the story and had to read to the end to comprehend the whole picture. It's ironic that the book is crammed with devotion to something as simple as owls, but is incredibly touching. It is a novel filled with high-level vocabulary geared towards an eighth grade audience. It is a page turning mystery that made me realize that sometimes I jump to conclusions without knowing both sides of the story. Hoot is an adventure permeated with passion and love, along with humor and stupidity. Carl Hiaasen artistically intertwines two quirky stories to comprise one fabulous novel."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"He would not have noticed that the boy was faster then his track-star friend from Montana, nor would the new kid have noticed that the boy was running barefoot or that he wasn't getting on the bus to go to school even though he was undoubtedly of age. If it wasn't for Dana Matherson, he would never have noticed the strange boy at all. But as fate would have it, Dana Matherson chose to migrate to the middle of the bus on that particular morning so as to pick on him. So he did see the strange barefoot running boy. And he did stare after him long after the boy disappeared onto the golf course, neglecting the pain as Dana Matherson attempted to smash his face against the bus window.Roy Eberhardt was the new kid. Five feet tall, small frame, seemingly shy type of boy. He never made any real attempts to make friends, nor did he pity himself sitting at the end of the lunch table by himself. He was the new kid, he'd been the new kid six times before, and he prided himself in being an expert at being the new kid.Nobody at Trace Middle School expected much out of the new kid, especially not for him to punch the most feared bully, or to make friends with Beatrice the Bear, the incredibly built, female soccer jock. Both things sprouted from the day, the second time, Roy spotted the strange running boy. There was something about the boy that struck a deep curiosity in Roy, a curiosity that was never quite satisfied. But on that morning, he chose to try to quench that curiosity by running off the bus and chasing after the strange running boy. Only two things got in his way; Dana Matherson, the bully, and Beatrice the Bear, the soccer jock, both of which he disregarded with a forceful punch to the face, and a determined shove, respectively.From there Roy began skimming the edge of the running boy's world, the patience of Dana Matherson, and the law. He quickly learned the reason for Beatrice's protectiveness over the running boy. The boy had no name, he went by Mullet Fingers, and he had no home, he ran-away from the military school his unloving mother shipped him off to, but he did have his stepsister, and his mission. His stepsister was none other than Beatrice the Bear. His mission was to save the owls, the delicate, innocent burrowing owls, from being smothered under Mother Paula and her pancake house. From their Roy learned of the boy's scheme to save the owls, and the difference you can make when you follow your heart.Hoot is one of those rare books that strike you as totally fictitious, but at the same time completely feasible. Even though the language may prove to be slightly juvenile for some, the style in which Hoot portrays its' messages - to follow your heart, stand up for yourself and never give up even when the odds are against you - are memorable. When the average person would never attempt to submerge live, four foot alligators in a port-a-potty single-handedly or tape the mouth's shut on nine highly venomous cotton-mouth snakes to save a couple of owls, Mullet Fingers did. Hoot is a miraculously story of a runaway with a mission and a heart; one frail, homeless boy against a large coalition of wealthy, middle-aged men. While his tactics prove to be extreme and illegal, Mullet Finger's determination, even through a high fever and a severe dog-wound, is nothing less than enticing. Hoot is a brilliant novel for those of us out there who often forget the impact one person, no matter how rich, poor, big, or small, can have when you put your heart into it, and give it your all."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot was a really fun and creative book about a new boy who just moved to Florida. He has a lot of crazy new experiences. Meeting new people and seeing new things. His first odd experience is meeting the school bully and on the way he sees a very strange boy running outside. This was the first of a long sring of odd experiences in Florida. This boy was my favorite character in the book. He is very free spirited and he enjoys himself. He is a very believable character.

In the story Roy Eberhardt moves to Coconut Cove, Florida from the rolling mountains of Montana.

Mother Paula's House of Pancakes is coming to Coconut Cove, and right on top of a field of burrowing owls!

In front of the Mother Paula's stake house, stakes were torn out of the ground, and large sized alligators were put in the guest latrines, leaving it up to officer Delinko to solve.

This makes me feel good because it tells that you can do anything you want if you are determined and if you have friends to support you."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The nutmeg book I read would definitely be 4 stars because it was a very good read to me. I love stories about people who try to save animals and actually taking their own time to help and care for the animals. If you like to read about animals, I know the perfect book!!!!!!!!!!!!!Hoot is a nutmeg book by Carl Hiaasen. I would recommend this book to only kids ages 10 and older because it talks about life situations and it has about 300 pages.Hoot's genre is realistic fiction because this story could happen in real life. This book reminds me of another book I once read called Saving Lilly, which was about kids that were trying to save an elephant from the circus. In both books kids from ages 10-15 help animals even though they could get in trouble. This shows how much kids really care for animals.Hoot is about a boy named Roy who was on the bus one morning and looks out the window to see the strangest thing. A boy was running as fast as he could without shoes on. Roy became curious about what the boy was doing. He decided to let it go and not say anything to anyone about it. The next day he sees the boy again and without any warning runs off the bus and had to struggle out of Dana's grip of his neck. Dana was a bully that had been hurting Roy by choking him on the bus. This left Roy no choice but to punch Dana Matherson in the nose and break it to leave his grip wrapped on his neck. When Roy reached the door a girl named Beatrice Leep tried to stop him but he ran past her too. Roy ran as fast as he could all the way to a golf course where he was hit with a golf ball. The running boy ran into a forest and Roy lost sight. Roy was knocked out by the golf ball and had mark on his neck from Dana. Roy began wondering why Beatrice had tried to stop Roy in the doorway. He had got the feeling that some how Beatrice knew who the running boy was. Roy decides to go to the golf course where he last spotted the running boy. There were garbage bags and one containing 9 rattlesnakes!!!!!! The running boy tied up Roy and ran away. The running boy had captured the snakes but Roy never got to see his face. Roy had escaped and left to see that it was raining and his bike was missing. Beatrice had taken Roy&iexcl;s bike and told Roy to stay away from the boy. Roy had just been told something incredible and that&iexcl;s when Roy slowly finds clues that lead to one thing and that&iexcl;s trouble! He begins to read articles in the newspaper of alligators in toilets at a construction site that was near the street where Roy first saw the running boy. What really made Roy suspicious was that the paper said that someone had spray painted a cop car that was on duty to watch the property and that some mysterious person had placed 9 rattlesnakes on the property! Why was someone trying to stop a company from making Mother Paula's Pancake House on that property? I'll tell you one thing to think about is the word is hoot.In my opinion I think that this book is very interesting and suspenseful. I think this because Hoot is a book that makes 2 different situations connects slowly. In the end they are all one story that contains descriptive words and problems that reflect every detail. I love books that have animals in it and have people that try to save species in danger.My favorite part of this story is when Roy, Beatrice, and the running boy work together to save the endangered species. By making the great team a whole mystery is solved and someone can get in trouble for creating such a big problem. With the help of Roy and his friends the situation is figured out in the end!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I had to read this book for school the other day & boy am I glad I got assigned this book!

On the first day at Trace Middle School, Roy encounters a bully named Dana Matherson, an eighth grader who smoked and liked to pick on the new kids. On that same day while Dana was pushing Roy's head into the bus window, Roy sees a shoeless boy running at full speed next to the bus. Roy was so fascinated by this boy. One day when Roy was being choked by Dana, he saw the boy again. Then Roy gets free from Dana's grasp and runs off the bus after the shoeless boy. On the way off the bus Roy bumps into a girl that was getting onto the bus. When Roy caught up with the boy he falls into a ditch. When he got up he was pulled out of the ditch and had a sack put over his head. Someone took off the sack and then disappeared in a flash. One day, Roy missed the bus and walked home. While he was walking he spots a small harmless owl by a burrow. Roy had never seen something so delicate and small in his life. In the middle of the book, Roy is told that there is a Mother Paula's Pancake house being built by the site of where the owls lived. Roy starts to get very sad for the owls in their burrows. At the end of the book, Roy and his two best friends are Beatrice and the running boy stand up for the owls and help them from being buried.

That been done many times already.What I will write here was that this book turned out to be pleasant and an entertaining reading experience. Its a fantastic page turner as you followed story of these three kids doing their \\"save the owls\\" bit. I thought the writing was clear and pacing was smooth. This is probably a book that may have been written for youngsters but easily be read by any adult who will probably enjoyed it as much as I did.There will be a movie based on this book coming out on 21 April if their website is correct which might be worth a look if you enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The runaway kid, Mullet Fingers, and the new kid, Roy, have a great time saving owl families and their homes from the pancake mogul.

Some of my favorite charters are Dana Matherson and Mullet fingers.IF I had any kids I surely would get them to take time out of their busy day to read Hoot.I like Dana because he is a bully who learns his lesson by getting a taste of his own medicine. I like Mullet fingers because he is a kind animal lover.He is also very mysterious person. As soon as I get my allowence I'm buying this book which is next week."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"* Hoot, Carl Hiassen, Knopf books. *Hoot by Carl Hiassen is about a famous pancake company that plans on building a large pancake house in a small Florida town. What this company knows is that there are a lot of pancake lovers and they will get a lot of business in this town. What they don't know or say that they don't know is that there are many helpless families of tiny owls burrowed under the construction site on which they plan on building the pancake house. This book is a book about one boy who loves these owls. He does everything he can to delay the process of building the pancake house. His sister (Beatrice) and his friend (the main character, Roy) help him to fulfill his goal in saving the owls. These characters face many obstacles along the way, but they don't give up and they are very persistent until they get what they want. Roy and Beatrice end up doing more than this boy expects. Hoot by Carl Hiassen full of exciting adventure and hilarious humor.The main character in this book is Roy. Roy is an ordinary boy, a kind boy, and he has a clever touch to him. He is not very popular because he is the new boy. He only has one friend who is the class clown. He makes friends with Beatrice and the running boy as the story goes on. The boy who delays the work at the construction site to save the owls has no name. He is sometimes called the running boy because of his incredible speed and he is also called mullet fingers because he can grab a mullet (fish) out of the water with his bare hands. Mullet fingers does not go to school although his mother thinks he dose. She doesn't like him and she tries to send him off to a boarding school far away. He runs away and lives in an abandoned ice cream truck. Beatrice is the running boy's sister. She is very athletic and an amazing soccer player. Even though all of these characters have many differences, they all love the owls, which eventually makes them all friends.I strongly recommend the book Hoot to boys and girls. If you like books with action and humor you will most likely like the book Hoot. It is very hard to stop reading this book once you start reading it. When I was reading Hoot I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, it held my attention fast because it was so unpredictable what was going to happen next. There were many exiting surprises in this realistic fiction book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"MY class read this book. We thought it was great.

There are some people that want to build a pancake house on a piece of property that is inhabited a group of owls that are almost extinct. When the people try to build the resturant, funny things keep happening that delay the construction. All I can tell you is that what happens from there is down right funny. I think the book is appealing for students between ages of ten and fourteen. I thnik that older students might think it was dumb. I think the book is awesome.

My eyes were glued to this book, it was exciting and fun, but you never know what was going to happen next. This book also captivates a young audience; I would recommend it to anyone ages 11-14. It also had so many surprises in it. You could read it casually and then all of the sudden your eyes would widen with thrill. I also loved Carl Hiaasen's style of writing. It really draws you in, because he uses realistic language that thirteen year old actually use today. Not to mention the plot was also realistic, and could happen in everyday life. I would also unquestionably recommend his next book, Flush, to anyone out there. This New York Times Bestseller is certainly worth the trip to the library."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I would recommend this book because it is a very interesting book.

Enjoy the satisfaction when the the tables are turned and Dana finally is on the receiving end and gets what's coming to him. Humor is a staple throughout Carl Hiassen's books and Hoot is no exception. Sometimes you just have to laugh out loud!Given as a Christmas gift along with Hiaasen'sFlushto our oldest granddaughter, she has told us she enjoyed both books enormously.

While it's not the most horrible thing in the world, I guess, teachers and parents should be aware it's in there. I'm puzzled as to why a children's book, and one that's apparently won awards, has swear words in it. Also, the synopsis on the book jacket described the story of a boy who moves to a new school and finds an unusual person to be friends with. However, my son told me the main points of the story were environmentalist in nature, coming out against a company developing land in Florida. While that kind of thing is something that should be discussed, I wish the synopsis had been more truthful. It's disappointing to see that there's some deception on the story description and then swear words once you get into it. Full disclosure is a good thing."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought that Hoot wasn't the best book that I've ever read.

What happened to the old adage: Two wrongs don't make a right???"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I have not read the book. I just want to comment on the name of the book and the trailer I saw on television for the movie that is now being advertised. I have been a birder for 32+ years and I have seen and heard Burrowing Owl in the wild. They are wonderful animals. It is strange that the main habitats in which they are found are the great plains of North America and the flat sandy desert islands of the Caribbean. The \\"save the owls\\" theme for the story is very good and I don't have a problem with that. But I immediately knew someone had not done their research when I heard the hoot of a Great Horned Owl dubbed over images of the Burrowing Owl. These two species are not closely related although they are both in the family Strigidae. Great Horned Owls are \\"Eagle Owls\\" with close relatives in other parts of the world. The Burrowing Owl is very unique with no close relatives. These owls make a sound that I would probably call a chatter; definitely not a hoot. I think it is sad that someone would write a book about saving a species but the author and his readers didn't even care enough about the real animal to know what it was REALLY like. They are more unique than the name of the book/movie would imply. I would rather see a real Burrowing Owl in the wild than watch some fabricated falsehoods about it just to feel the warm fuzzies many get from being fed a manufactured public's view of conservation."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Dont read Hoot.

The End"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"If you would like to read a book about hap- hazardous Florida, about mysterious identities, and about the environment versus construction, then \\"Hoot\\" by Carl Hiassen is the book you need. This book contains events that will just crack you up: Crocodiles placed in portable toilets, 120 pound dogs becoming scared of a 2 pound snake; and some that will make you not want to put down the book: The main character, Roy, getting trapped in a closet with an angry bully, A boy running away with no shoes, and much more. I give this book a 5 on a scale of 5.In this story, a boy named Roy who just moved into Florida from Montana, has not made very many friends. He is not very sociable and likes Montana better than Florida. He is always running from a bully who despises Roy. Then, one day, Roy was pressed against a bus window and saw a boy running for what looked like no good reason. Roy was naturally curious and chased the boy to his lair. He met this boy and joined his cause: to stop some people from building a pancake house on top of multiple burrowing owl nests. Meanwhile, Police Officer Delinko is charged with the job of guarding the estate from vandalism, which the mysterious boy is doing. The officer gets put on desk duty for sleeping on the job, and from there he tries to work his way back into the police chief's \\"preferred\\" list. Officer Delinko and Roy may be on different sides of this issue, but they meet up in some of the most random ways, including in a hospital.One scene that really sticks out is the one when Beatrice Leep bites a flap into Roy's bike tire to give him an excuse for being late for dinner. They were visiting the site of the construction and checking on how the mysterious boy was doing. They were making sure nobody caught him. Roy got picked up and driven home by none other than Officer Delinko, who tries to get Roy's dad to write a letter to the chief about how helpful the Officer was to them.Well, this wacky story is a great read for people of all ages, but it was actually targeted towards teenagers. Definitely, this book gets a 5 out of 5 from me due to its plot, humor, and truth about the environment. Hopefully, this book will change or solidify your position on destroying animal habitats. You'll just hoot with laughter when you read \\"Hoot\\" by Carl Hiassen."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hey, today I&iexcl;m going to talk about a great tale about a group of people trying to save owls. This book is called Hoot, Carl Hiaasen is the ingenious author of the book. I give this interesting book four stars. In the following paragraphs I will be giving you an idea of what all this book is about. Its not just about saving owls there is a lot more to the story.This book is hilariously marvelous, it all starts out with this boy from Montana. He is a new kid named Roy. Roy gets bullied a lot but also tries to stand up. One day he sees this boy running without shoes, he tries to follow him the next day but the bully was beating him up so he would not let him get off. So Roy sticks out his fist and actually breaks the bully&iexcl;s nose. The boy was to fast for Roy to keep up with and he lost him. That&iexcl;s not all to that though, the bully wants to get back. Roy gets stopped somehow at a golf course when trying to catch the mysterious kid. He went back to the place he saw him last and finds 3 bags and one had snakes which of course knowing Roy he opened and let them out.Meanwhile the police of the city that Roy lives in is embarrassed by pranks played by this mischievous boy that nobody knows. There is a girl at school named Beatrice Leep. She goes up to Roy and tells him to mind his own business. It turns out Beatrice was the mysterious boy&iexcl;s sister and that she gave him a nickname, Mullet Fingers, because he can catch mullets in the lake. Mullet Fingers is the cause of all the pranks played on the police because he wants to save the burrowing owls dens. He has some crazy plans that he comes up with every night and Roy gets involved. Roy could not find out Mullet Finger&iexcl;s name because Mullet Fingers is actually a runaway kid from some camp that he got sent to. He was living in an old Jo Jo&iexcl;s ice cream truck in the dump. Read this book to see how Roy, Beatrice, and Mullet Fingers team up against the Mother Paula&iexcl;s Pancake House construction site to save owls in this laughable comedy. In the end the truth is revealed about paperwork, the police getting embarrassed, and for the whole fraud. Roy finally finds out his name&iexcl;KThis is my conclusion to the book review Hoot. The Harry Potter series or The White Mountains series are all good books to read. They both have some similar plots to Hoot. I am a person that loves to read adventurous books just like Hoot."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"How would you feel if your house was going to be bulldozed, but you wern't allowed to leave? You would be stuck there while your house got demolished, and you would be demolished with it. This is what one young boy realizes will happen to the burrowing owls living in the construction site of the \\"Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House\\" if he does not help them. Roy and Beatrice, students at Trace Middle School, help this mysterious boy, Mullet Fingers, while trying to realize that just because you are doing the right thing, your plan won't always succeed. 'Mullet Fingers' is a young boy who is living in the woods only one block from his home. He got his nickname from his step-sister.Hoot is a story about young people standing up to adults for someone or something else's rights. Beatrice and Roy help the boy from the woods since all of the adults from the building corporation are lying, and have many secrets. Mullet Fingers has secrets of his own. When weird things start happening, an explanation is needed. Since nobody will admit the truth, it is up to Roy to explain the truth and reveal the answers to the everyne's questions.The story of Hoot is a wonderful story for anyone who likes animals. It is a great book about young kids standing up to adults, which is really cool. Hoot is a little slow at first, but it really picks up speed. This is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I don't agree with the adults whining about how this book isn't any good or isn't as good as Hiaasen's previous work because it lacks that \\"freaky\\" character. I frankly think those readers just want more of the same, and that Hiaasen was carefully writing to a different audience and had different effects intended. It's something to get a Newberry Honor for your first effort that would qualify for the award."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book is terrible. The first time the owls are mentioned you know where the whole story is going. There are no characters with good qualitites. Main character lies to everyone and frames a kid who gets arrested. But that's okay. The boy who gets arrested already has a record so he would probably end up in juvie anyway. We learn that from a school counselor who tells her son, who promises not to tell but does. The story involves verbally and physically abusive parents as if this is common and less of a concern than owls. There is an instance of swearing. Also one kid moons another. I wish the author had just written a sign saying \\"Save the Owls\\" and saved me a lot of time."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book is an awesome book. You can't compare it to any book.

BUT READ IT FIRST."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read the book Hoot. It was a good book because it was funny, mystifying and daring at the same time. The main characters were Roy, Mullet Fingers, Beatrice, and Dana. It all started when Roy moved to Florida from Montana. He was on the bus when Dana started to beat him up after he turned Roy's head to the window. That was when he saw the boy. Before Dana could hurt him really bad Roy punched him and ran. He was running after that boy he saw running down the street. Roy thought the boy he saw was trying to catch the bus but he was not. The plot of the story was the boy Roy saw was doing something bad. Something to save an animal. I thought it was good that the boy did that and I wasn't surprised. I really liked the part when Roy mooned Dana. I think that every one should read Hoot."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is one of my favorite Hiaasen books. It's deadly funny. I really enjoyed the way each pont of veiw was as if it was the beginning of the book. For example, if a character was indroduced in one perseptive, it wouldn't be in the next. Hiaasen really struck gold with this book. As you can see from the title of this reveiw, there are many magical things in this book.:)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I have to admit that I chose to read this book on the cardinal sin of choosing a book: I liked the cover.What was inside the cover was even better.I had never read Carl Hiaasen before and I truly enjoyed Hoot. The characters were well developed and yet mysterious at the same time. I found myself \\"talking back\\" to the book during some parts. I was captivated and I was taken into the story. Realistic fiction is supposed to provide a sense of hope, and this book definitely did. For me, it was a sliding door into the story and I stepped into the world of Roy and Beatrice.As an educator in the elementary school system, I feel that this book is an excellent choice for kids. Many kids are sympathetic with animals and they become enchanted by characters that stick up for what they believe in. This book provides an excellent opportunity for children to see how fictional characters in a story can relate to the readers. It's just a great encouraging book for both kids and adults.If you're looking for a great extra-curriculum read, Hoot is a great page-turner and I look forward to reading Hiassen's works in the future."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was a great book. What I liked most about it was how it kept making you think, like when you thought you had all of the clues and everything put together and you thought you knew what was going to happen next you thought wrong and it was something else. The character I liked most was Roy he had a lot of spunk and was a really bold and yet timid boy, he was almost like every other boy, but he was a little different for a child his size and age and everything he was put through he always seemed to be real brave. Roy was a boy who thought before he took action. When Roy was out with Beatrice's stepbrother at the lake he made me remind of something about my self that we all have a soft spot. His new friends began to show him different ways to open up to life, and to try new things. Not only did I learn something new but also this book showed me an unusual way to reason with my brain and heart. This was a book I would suggest to someone if they are interested in books that deal with little adventures along with a little trouble and mischief to them.-SrS-"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"You MUST read this book. Not many books are filled with tons of witty remarks &amp; cleverness, yet can still keep a steady flow of a dang diddly-darned good plot.My favorite punchline of the whole book has to be:&quot;My dad works for the government.&quot; &quot;That's swell. My dad eats 'Hot Pockets' &amp; stares at ESPN.&quot;Amongst all of that, I choose to give this book four and a half stars because the ending could've been a little better...They should've completely tipped off the bad guys. Something better than holding hands, please! (It'll make sense when you read it)Overall, I have to say this: the kid's fiction world is largely dominated by a boy magician &amp; some guy named Snicket, but Hiaasen beats both of them out with &quot;Hoot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was a fun book to read but I didn't like some of the language.

Have you ever felt left out, or have you felt like your not where you're supposed to be? This is how Roy Eberhardt, a teenage boy from Montana, feels after moving to Florida. Roy investigates a mystery of the boy running with no shoes on, while he tries to save an owl species. Will life in Florida be looking up for Roy?The theme or lesson of this book I think was to not let things get in your way. Hoot was very inspiring and it makes you want to help animals in your community. Also, you can literally feel yourself as if you were a character in the setting. I'd advise you to read Hoot because I know you'll love it."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"What would you do if you were on the school bus and you saw a boy running aimlessly with no shoes? Would you chase after him at the next stop and give him your shoes? Probably not, but that's exactly what Roy Eberhardt does in the adventure story Hoot by Carl Hiassen. Roy, with the help of this running boy, finds himself doing things he wouldn't ordinarily do. Some of these things could get him in real trouble with the law.Roy is a middle school boy who has recently moved to Florida and struggles to find his place in the town. Dana, the school bully, doesn't make it any easier for Roy to fit in. After an accidentally rough encounter between the two, Dana is out to get Roy. Fortunately, Roy finds himself being helped by Beatrice, a tough girl who happens to be the sister of the running boy. Roy joins Beatrice and her brother in their attempts to save innocent owls from being kicked out of their burrows so that Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House can build a new location.This book is a story of determination, curiosity, and bravery. Because Roy gets involved in the \\"save the owl\\" plan, he naturally becomes a leader with all the qualities that come along with it. The subtle humor, character development, and dual narrative set the book apart from the rest. You get to see two sides of every story which helps you understand the characters' personalities and problems. You'll even find yourself chuckling at the small jokes that make this book entertaining and interesting.People who liked The Thief Lord will love the in-depth character analysis and adventure that this book brings out. This book is so well-written that the characters' personalities come alive and you'll want to know what will happen to them in the end."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Amazing book with so much adventure!

Also I think the book was very mysterious and a little bit scary but that kept me engaged really well. A lot of the time the author surprised me but in a good way,about how the characters acted.I recommend this book to people who care about animals and people who stand up in what they believe in and care about."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is not the best book that I have ever read, but it is quite good. I feel that because it relates to teen problems that it is a book geared more towards teenagers than adults. The plot of the book kept me interested enough to continue reading. The main character kept surprising me with his actions, especially for how young he is. He is truly a responsible person from the beginning of the story. Even though he moved a lot he is still strong and quite good at adjusting to new environments. Overall I found this book to be a good read, but I would not read it a second time. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5 and I would recommend this Book to students, especially students who do not like to read big books."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy is starting school in middle school at trace middle school he and his friends beatrice and mullet fingers figure out that people are building a pancake house on top of ground owls dens.Ifthey proceed with the plan the owls will die.roy and his friends fight for the owl.Read this book its amazing"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I love the action and stunts in the book I saw the movie an loved it just about everything matched up with the book"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt is a normal middle-schooler, who just moved from Bozeman, Montana, to Coconut Cove, Florida. He doesn't like it, but he is trying to fit in. It had all started when Dana Matherson, the school bully, pounced on Roy and smudged his face against the school bus window. Being the new kid, there really wasn't much Roy could do, except patiently wait. But then, through the smudged glass, Roy saw the running boy. The running boy had no backpack, shoes, and was running by, pass the school bus. Only Roy had seen him. Roy gets lead headfirst into trouble and motivation when he spots endangered burrowing owls on the empty lot on East Orale Avenue. Roy's curiosity had introduced him to some very sparkly snakes, slippery fish and a case of vandalism on East Orale Avenue, the future home to Mother Paula's all American Pancake House as the sighting blooms into an adventure!Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is an adventure thrill ride. Because of all the humor, suspense and inspiring plot, I recommend it to all kids 9 - 11. A great book for humorous realistic fiction fans!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read this book many years ago when it first came out to my newborn son. we just got done reading it again and I still love it just as much. There is something magical about the way Carl Hiaasen writes. He can capture the minds and hearts of people of all ages. Of all of his books, this one is hands down, my favorite. The important message of conservation he delivers is not delivered in a boring run of the mill way. The characters are vibrant and fun to learn about and you can watch the face of your child change from happy to worried to thrilled right along with the events in this book. I think this is an excellent book for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"By Jayson DanielsI read Hoot by Carl Hiaasen and this review will be about my opinion of the book. Hoot is not part of a series. I found Hoot a great book and after this I hope you will agree. Hoot is about a boy Named Roy Eberhardt who moves to Coconut Cove , Florida, and a construction site is going to ruin an owl home and Roy and his friends have to find a way to stop them and save the owls.The part I liked the most was when Roy meets \\"mullet fingers\\" since that is a good part in the book since \\"mullet fingers\\" is a main character and he is a big influence. He helps Roy a lot.In hoot Roy gets help from friends to help try to stop the destroying of the owl home and to stop the construction site and he does that by delaying the building by doing things to it. He was very determined but he is not a trouble maker and he is shy.The author is trying to tell us that we should use all of our ability to help the world and nature. He also wants to show us what it can do if you help the world so I think it is a good lesson. I am not going to tell you the outcome but I recommend this book to you.I think this book was outstanding and it was very unpredictable for me. I also thought it had great detail and action. I really liked what they are trying to do and I agree with it. I would do the same thing if I was Roy. He is helping the world.Please read hoot and it is great. Thanks for reading"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Book Review of HootI think other kids would enjoy this book. It is about a boy named Roy that moved from Montana to Florida. There was a bully named Dana who beat him up on the bus. One day on the bus, Roy was smashed against the window by Dana, he saw a boy running. That boy was trouble from the start. That is how it all begins...Characters: Roy, Dana, Beatrice, the running boy, Kimberly Lou Dixon, Curly, Chuckle Muckle, Officer Delinko, and Garrett.I thought the characters were believable. That is a good thing because that made it easier to compare to my normal life. I liked the way the author changed who and where the people were talking. For example, in one text it would end with Roy talking at his house and then begin a new paragraph with Officer Delinko talking at the police department. I also liked the way the story ended. It was an ending but really a new beginning. I loved Hoot a lot and I think that you would too. There is another fantastic book that Carl Hiaasen wrote called Flush. This is a great author that you would probably love just like I do. Don't miss another adventure with Roy and Beatrice! Hope you read the book! GO READING!By,Eve (age 10)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was a delightful book! I read it in two sittings and enjoyed every page. I will definitely put this on the shortlist of books to read with my kids.This story had it all, a boy, bullies, golf, cops, a runaway, and of course owls.There is some mild swearing, but nothing worse than you would read in the bible. The book also deals with deadbeat dads, fighting with parents, suspension from school, and runaways. Just keep that in mind if you are reading this to really young kids. I think anyone over third grade would be able to handle the ideas talked about in this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"If you read Flush or Scat YOU HAVE TO READ Hoot . Hoot is a hoot.

With the trauma of a change in schools and therefore new classmates and trouble with the school bully the characters are truly believable. This is the age when the girls are physically advanced of the boys and you'll cheer when she bests the beast. Throw in a resolution of city's zoning snafu and you have a book to be read aloud to a class. Hilarious and outrageous at times, the pre-teen boys will beg for more. Great job Carl Hiassan. Bring on more tales of schools, boys and girls in Florida."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Have not yet read a book of Carls I didn't like!Easy read, with laughter throughout and a great story to boot!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I have heard that Hiaasen is a great mystery/humor writer and was eager to read one of his books. I picked up \\"Hoot\\" because it looked good and, guess what, it was really really good.Roy has just moved to Florida from Montana, he is the new kid at school...again. He's used to it though, he moves around a lot. Then on the bus he sees a boy running without shoes and senses a mystery to be solved. Thus starts a story about mysteries, practical jokes, outwitting bullies, and saving endangered species.I really loved this book. All the characters were wonderful and believable. Hiaasen creates an excellent mystery, with great humor, while tackling a number of social issues that kids and adults can both relate too. A great description for this novel is eco-thriller. Between trying to find a place for himself in Florida, Roy gets caught up in a mystery surrounding burrowing owls and the huge corporation trying to take out their home. It was hard to put this book down, I basically read the whole thing in one sitting while at the airport.I really have no complaints with this book. Hiassen's writing is very readable and the dialogue between characters is well done and very natural sounding. I was impressed that not only did he create a great mystery but he also dealt with issues like bullies, bad home life, the things companies will do to make money, endangered species, and how one person can make a huge difference if they put their mind to it. It was also nice to read a young adult book where the parents were actual realistic and decent people. Roy's parents are good people, who help out their son the best they can...too often in young adult books the adults are inept and it was nice to see adults portrayed more realistically.This was a great book. I am going to get Hiaasen's other young adult books \\"Flush\\" and \\"Scat\\" to read as soon as I can. I would also like to check out his adult books. I recommend this book to people of all ages and people with all different sorts of interests. If you like mysteries and eco-thrillers than this book will definitely be right up your alley. If you don't...well you should read it anyway. It is one that I am keeping to read again."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I enjoyed reading Hoot even after seeing the movie first. It is a feel good book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was a quick and fun read to do for my book report. An action-packed adventure with an enviromnetal message. Write on, Hiaasen!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"If the old saying is true - imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - then J.K. Rowling must be very flattered indeed. Since the success of the Harry Potter novels, there has been a boatload of other books that have been targeted to the same general audience of \\"young adults.\\" Besides the obvious Harry Potter knock-offs, a number of big name writers have also opted to tap this market, with mixed success; Michael Chabon may be a Pulitzer Prize winner for his adult fiction, but his excursion into juvenile literature (Summerland) leaves much to be desired. On the other hand, Carl Hiaasen, master of the comic crime novel, shows with his book, Hoot, that he is also comfortably adept at young adult fiction.Hoot follows Roy Eberhardt, a middle school student who has recently moved to Florida from Montana. One day, Roy spies through his school bus window a boy around his age running barefoot to an unknown destination. Eventually, he finds out that this kid goes by the name Mullet Fingers and lives on his own outside of town.Meanwhile, Office David Delinko is investigating a series of rather sophisticated acts of vandalism at the site of a future pancake house. When one of these acts winds up embarrassing Delinko, he becomes even more motivated to catch the culprit. Roy is able to piece together that Mullet is behind the vandalism, but his reasons are not simple mischief. Instead, the kid is out to save some burrowing owls who live at the site and are threatened by the development. Roy decides to assist Mullet and his step-sister Beatrice in saving the owls while also avoiding slow-witted bully Dana Matherson.Although Hiaasen's books always have humor, they also deal a lot with environmental issues, particularly the negative impact of developers in Florida. But like the best of authors, he gets the message across without having it interfere with the story. Although technically a kids' book, like the Harry Potter series, it can cross-over and appeal to adults as well, particularly Hiaasen fans. Hoot is a fast, fun read."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is now my favorite book! If you're wondering why, it's because this book is full of suspense, humor, and adventure. Roy Eebrhardt is from Montana. Shortly he moves to Coconut Cove, Florida. Roy is the \\"new kid\\" at Trace Middle School. On the bus, while the big and somewhat chubby Dana Matherson starts beating Roy, he shoves his face into the window. While his face was shoved in the window, he saw a boy with blond hair and very tan skin. This boy had caught Roy's eye right away. The boy was running at the speed of light with no shoes on!Later on in the book Roy soon meets Beatrice Leep, A.K.A. Beatrice the Bear. Beatrice is a very tuff girl who sticks up for herself and others. One day while Dana was beating Roy up for the second time Roy saw the boy who was running. Once again, he was running as fast as he could. He soon gets of the bus, gets away from Dana, and starts chasing after him. After Roy caught up with him, he starts to make friends with him, yet he doesn't even know his name! Subsequent to the rest of the book Roy finds out about owls and he tries to stop Mother Paula's Construction Site from building a pancake house on top of the burring owls. Roy, Beatrice, and Running Boy try to sort of start a protest to help save them. In conclusion you can probably see why I enjoyed this book so much!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Would you read a book about owls? But what if it was about a boy named Roy who teamed up with two people named Mullet Fingers and Beatrice, risking their lives trying to save an owls nest that's about to be destroyed because of a new company settling in on top of it? Well, that's what Hoot is about. It is truly the best because of so many things. One, the author writes in a certain mood and tone that makes you want to continue reading like an addicting drug. Second, this book is suspenseful. You have no idea who commited what crime. The only way to find out is to keep reading. Third, the characters are well detailed. For example, a character named Mullet Fingers is a talented and unwealthy boy who gets his name by catching mullets with his hands, however, his real name isn't revealed until the end. I enjoyed this novel to the fullest extent and I'm 100% sure that you will too."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I got Hoot for Christmas a few years ago but never read it, it just didn't seem like my type of book. Last year my 10 (now 11)year old brother read it and loved it, but not sharing his taste in books, I didn't bother reading it. I was finally swayed when I saw a preview on TV for the new movie of Hoot coming soon. It actually looked really good, and being a person who prefers to read the book before seeing the movie, I decided maybe I should try reading it, even if it didn't seem like a book for a 15-year-old. I read the first chapter yesterday, and this morning I continued, getting so caught up in it that I read it straight for 4 hours and finished it!! IT WAS AMAZING!!! It's really cool how none of the characters are perfect and you kind of can't decide who to root for. The ending was slightly corny but I CANT WAIT to see the movie!! I LOVE HOOT!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Would you fight for baby owls from being squashed into the dirt? Would you maybe trespass and potentially go to jail to save them? Or would you rather eat pancakes? Carl Hiaasen answers these questions in his novel Hoot.Mullet Fingers is trying to save those owls. The owls are in danger because a pancake house is trying to open a restaurant right over the owl burrows. Roy, the main character, gets hooked into helping the owls with Mullet Fingers. They need to get proof that the pancake house can't build their restaurant over the owls. The only way to get proof is to trespass in the fenced area, which is, were the owls are.To find out if the baby owls are saved and Roy and Mullet Fingers go to jail or not read the book Hoot, it's a hoot! I strongly recommend this book to both boys and girls. If you like realistic fiction and action read Hoot, as Carl Hiaasen takes you on a wonderful adventure!(...)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"That introduces to young readers the concepts of graft, corruption and courage. Not a bad read for grownups who enjoy the author. Does one kid character remind you of the governor living in a swamp in Hiaasen's other books?"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a book I would give 5 stars.This is a unique book because of it's comedic diolauge. I myself as a reader do not see many books that funny. Well the story starts out about a boy named Roy who has just moved to a new town in Florida, but is homesick from his home town in Montana. He has everything in his new town. The typical bullies Dana Matherson) and even a strange boy running from his bus stop every day. One day he decides to give chase to the boy. What he finds is not a boy but a camp sight, and inside it a bag full of cotton mouth moccassins. Roy being Roy drops the bag and they spill all over. Then he hears a voice saying dont move. Out of nowhere a hand garbs him and bags him. The voice says that he can walk 50 feet then you can take the bag off. After 50 feet he tears the bag off. \\"NO ONE\\" The next day at school a large girl walks up to Roy and shoves him against a table. She yells \\"MIND YOUR OWN BUSSINES\\" It all snowballs from there.This book is an adventure story about perservering through anything if you know what you are doing is right. It's more of a middle school book becuse of some bad language,and some diffucult vocabulary. Although anyone who reads this book will love it because it is a lighhearted story about friendship, courage, and just a little bit of mishtief. Koot is packed with detail, it makes you feel like you are actually there. Another thing the author brings to the story is he tells th story through about three different people's eyes. They all manage to intertwine somehow...Other titles I would recomend if you like this story is \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" It is packed with thrilling detail and halarious diolauge. You may have seen the first three books in the major motion picture.My name is Kyle I am in the sixth grade and I am a straight A student. I like reading book's with a good plot and vigouros detail.

As I was reading it, time just flew by because it was filled with dynamic characters and events. I really enjoyed how the author gave the book such realistic problems like bullying and being in a family where parents don't care that much about their kids. I have friends like that and it's sad. I'm glad that kids like that have books to read that are similar to their own life.The best part of the story was all of the pranks that Mullet Fingers pulled on the construction foreman. They were kind of mean but they didn't really hurt anyone. He did it mostly to help the owls and I think that sometimes it's ok to bend the rules a little if you're trying to help out someone else.I would definitely recommend this book to someone else and I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author!D.BanksWoodbridge, VA"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhart, a middle-schooler, has just moved with his family from Montana to Florida and isn't fitting in: he has unwittingly drawn the attention of a serious bully. But one day he sees a strange boy running extraordinarily fast and follows him into a whole set of adventures, ultimately getting involved in environmental activism.This story has a strong, often exciting plot. Hiaasen includes a fair amount of humor along the way. About halfway through, it felt as if we were coming to the climax, but Hiaasen managed to shift gears and string us along for a bit longer to good effect.Roy is a good kid but not a goody-two-shoes; I'd be happy for my kids to read a story with him as the hero. In the course of the book, we also meet a very badly behaved kid, and we realistically see him as the product of his unsupportive home environment. This book is about families as much as anything else; we see how some parents love and support their kids and others are more self-serving.My wife and I listened to this together and both enjoyed it.

As a teacher, I could see all the wonderful teaching opportunites in it!

I did not realize it was a kid book until I got it and started. You can't put it down. I read it in 2 days, only because I started it at night and fell asleep. It could be his best, I think. It is a wonderful novel with everything in it. I have to admit it was nice to read a book with no profanity and sex like so many of them have now. But Hoot did everything it was supposed to do. A well strucured novel with a great plot and hero to boot. I would give it to my kid. They should make a movie if they have not already.Of course, you need to agree with Hiasson's feelings about the destruction of South Florida (I do). The little Owls won.I just loved the book and highly recommend it to anyoneSome guy said he did not like it. Who are you?It's a good one - especially if you like Carl."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is the story of Roy. He is the new kid at the school and is constantly being picked on by the notoriously mean Dana Matherson. It is actually Dana's wrong doing that led to Roy seeing the person who later makes him a star by helping save an endangered species of owl. It is while Dana is shoving Roy's face against the bus window when Roy suddenly sees a blond haired boy named Mullet Fingers running as fast as humanly possible away from the bus. Of course Roy doesn't know that the boy name is Mullet Fingers and he doesn't know why the boy is running, all he knows is that he wants to follow him for some reason.

Hoot is persuasive and teaches you to always look at everybody's point of view because there is no ending at how good the author makes the ending so surprising!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt is the new kid on the block. Dana Matherson is constantly bullying him on the school bus and at school. One day Dana mashes Roy's face into the bus window, which results in Roy seeing a kid running. Roy became intrigued by the fact that he had never seen the running boy before and how weird the boy looked. He decides to find out more about the running boy. Everyday that week Roy watches for the running boy and one day he sees him run by the bus. Roy goes to get off the bus but Dana wants to choke him first. Roy shocks Dana in the nose and barrels off the bus but not before he almost knocks rough, tough, soccer playing Beatrice off the bus. Roy tries his best to catch up with the running boy but all he can do is keep him within his sight. The running boy runs across yards and through hedges and leads Roy through a golf course, which results in Roy getting hit in the head by a golf ball. Roy is taken to school where he is interrogated by the principal about the incident on the bus. Roy has to write an apology letter to Dana. Roy finds out later that he broke Dana's nose. However, for the moment Roy can't worry about that he must find out about the running boy. Beatrice confronts Roy at lunch and tells him to keep his nose to himself. During this entire time a series of vandalisms are happening at the construction site where the new Mother Paula's pancake house is to be built. Roy finds out from the running boy that there are burrowing owls at the site and he is trying to save them. Roy doesn't help with anything illegal but he does get his history class to protest against the owls being buried by the bulldozers. Beatrice, running boys stepsister, and Roy's new friend Garrett help also. The owls are ultimately saved and Roy finally finds out what running boy's name is. Roy loses contact with running boy after this because he doesn't want to be found but he never forgets the secret place running boy took him to.This is a great book for middle school students even though there is some use of profanity. The plot is easily understandable because children can relate to Roy's struggle to help save the owls. Characterization throughout the book is great because the author shows how each child in the book is relatable whither it is Roy's wanting to return to Montana, running boy's passion to save the owl, or Dana's bullishness. Theme is great because everything in the book works toward the children saving the owls. This book would be great for role-playing because of the backgrounds the children come from. This will allow the students to relate to others and help with ways to deal with their own problems."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is marketed as Hiaasen's first novel for children but there is really no difference between Hoot and his other novels other than that some of the main characters in this book are school aged children and the book is about half the thickness of his other work. This is actually one of my favourite Hiaasen novels and this will be enjoyed by any Hiaasen fan no matter what age they are.This book is written in the usual fast paced, witty, surreal Hiaasen style with simultaneous stories where the characters all cross paths at one time or another. In this one Roy Eberhardt, son of a father who is constantly transferred to different locations across the USA isn't enjoying his new location Florida, too much at all. Like everywhere else bullies are picking on him and while being bullied on the school bus by Dana Matherson, he observes a strange boy running down the street. Fascinated, he decides to find out more about the boy, of course Dana won't leave him alone to accomplish this easily. Meanwhile police officer Delinko, a nice but not the brightest officer on the force is investigating constant acts of vandalism against a construction site for the 469th Mother Paula's Pancakes restaurant. Along the way the reader will come across dim witted site foreman Curly, unethical public relations agent Chuck Muckle and a bunch of other interesting characters including some nice little ground nesting owls.I highly recommend this book along with Hiaasen's other novels such as Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip and Lucky You as well. I also highly recommend theDVD movieof this book. It sticks fairly close to the novel which is extremely rare these days and also has an interview with Hiaasen in the special features. Hiaasen also comentates the bonus commentary version of the film as well."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is one of those books that you pick up and hold onto as it introduces you to fun characters as the story twists and turns its way to its conclusion. It has a great message for kids: sometimes you CAN make a difference in your fight for right when the corporate world is being greedy--it might be a long shot, but apathy won't accomplish anything! This book is a good teacher/parent choice when addressing ecology issues with middle-school kids."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot was an awesome book. I had to read it for the 6th grade reading list. I didn't want to read it at first but then later it was really good. I recommend it to anyone who likes animals or books."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a great book to read. I own the book myself. My teacher decided to read this wonderful book to all her language arts classes. She has read it more than five times I think. After I finished reading the book I started telling my family about it all of them wanted to read it. My sister was the first one to read it and she almost never reads. She ended up likening it. After that she found out that reading was actually entertain.My favorite character was Mullet Fingers or Napoleon if u will. His determination to save the poor defense less owls was one of the bravest things I've ever seen (read in this case) someone do. Most of my favorite parts are when he and Roy give it their all to try and save the owls.People like Carl Hiassen have a great imagination on these type of writing. All the stuff that Mullet Finger does to save the owls can be recreated in many way in real life. Some of the stuff in the book can't.I'd recommend this book to anyone that wants a good book to read. I'd also say this book would make a great movie. The characters in this book and the plot would maybe win a golden globe or two. An Oscar would be very unlikely. Some people might like it and the person that makes it might win a big profit out off it.This book has been the best book I've read so far. Most of my class like it as well. Ms Smith (my lang. arts teacher) must of really liked it to read it to us. I bet she got tired of reading it three times a day but she got through it in record time.This book should have a sequel. Like what happened to Mullet Fingers after his escape. I would really like to read it. I bet I would be one of the first ones to buy it. It would surely be an award winning one just like the first one. Carl Hiassen would get more money than he ever expected. That's why I'm writing this review in the first place. So u should really read this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiasen's first book was a brilliant one. The book is about Roy Eberart, a average boy who just wants to fit in. In between being bullied by the hulking Dana Matherson,being intimadated by supergirl, Beatrice Leap, and helping her step brother, Mullet Fingers, save the owls at the mother Paula's site, Roy always finds time to matain a normal life. I loved this book and I hope many others will too."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Intersting story compels the reader to not put this book down until the end. It is easily comprehensible for young readers and has a suitable modern environmental theme. Adolescents will like it because their generation takes on big business determined to expand at the cost of disrupting the natural habitat in a Florida setting. In a humorous clever manner, these middle school age children lead the way in trying to prevent the willful destruction of a nesting place of small burrowing owls by indifferent and corrupt corporate and political powers."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"While this book wasn't the best I've read in my life, I found it pleasently unique, and different from what I normally read. The characters were colorful, and the plot was fast-paced. Here is a brief overview of the plot:Roy has just moves to Florida when he encounters a strange boy, running from the schoolbus. He finds out that this boy is a loner who is desperately trying to save a rare species of owl from being wiped out due to the construction of a Pancake House. Roy becomes drawn in to this ecological effort--not that he doesn't already have enough to worry about between bullies and generally trying to fit in at a new school. The situation eventually evolves into a full-fledged scandal that will effect the entire town.My favorite thing about this book is how realistic the diologue is, and how the kids seem like real kids. The author does an amazing job portraying how middle-schoolers would actually talk to each other, a better job in fact than J.K. Rowling, and many other famous authors. If it weren't for this element, I would have found the story a lot less enjoyable.This book is also funny. Carl Hiaasen has this certain type of ironic humor that is almost-but not quite-comparable to The Simpsons. However, I think it takes a certain kind of person to appreciate the dryness of this humor.All in all, \\"Hoot\\" is quite enjoyable, and I especially recommend it to fans of ecology and related subjects."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I really like the book HOOT by Carl Hiaasen. I would give it 5 stars! It's about a boy named Roy in Florida and he does not let construction workers build over where burrowing owls live. Roy is a new boy in school and he makes friends with a girl named Beatrice and her stepbrother!I like how there is so much detail in the book! For example when Roy meets Beatrice, he's on the school bus he sees the running boy. He's running off the bus and she's getting on. He bumps her to the wall of the school bus!I think Hoot is a good book all ages!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is about this kid named Roy Eberhardt that's moving to Florida from Montana. When Roy goes to his new school, Dana Matherson \\"one of the biggest bullies in school\\" slams his head on the bus window.

As Roy learns more about the running boy, he meets new friends and solves puzzles.Hoot is a brilliant book. Carl Hiassen's writing style is great and this book is a total page turner.by Will"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"A great story is a story that pulls you in from the beginning, uses interesting and descriptive language, and has characters that you fall in love with. Hoot is all of these, and more! I rated it a 4 because of the aspect that it won a newbery medal and I believe it shouldn't have, for the way the characters talk abruptly after one another sometimes and the way some descriptions are weak. Otherwise, I would rate it a SOLID, SOLID, SOLID 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is typical Hiaasen faire of twisted humor, mystery, and not-so-hidden messages. The Florida adventure starts when on his way to school, Roy Eberhardt sees a shoeless boy running down the street. Curious why the boy is not going to school, Roy decides to find out who he is. The new kid Roy and the shoeless truant joins together on a secret mission-saving a family of endangered burrowing owls from being destroyed by the construction of a pancake restaurant on the lot where their home is located. Transplanted Montanian Roy is thrust into a world of capitalistic adults, limelight-loving politicians, school bullies,child abuse, and civil disobedience. Filled with humor, it also touches on the realities of child abuse and destruction of wildlife habitats. The manipulation of the bully was masterful, but you can't help feeling sorry for him in the end. Watch out for those alligators in the porta-potties! Recommended for ages 10 to 15 years old."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"How could anyone not take an immediate liking to 13 year old Roy Eberhardt?

As Roy's face is being smashed into the window of his school bus by Dana Matherson, the hefty school bully, Roy happens to catch a glimpse of another young boy running barefoot through his neighborhood.Roy's longing for action and mystery in his new Florida community lead him to become a current-day Matlock and nature activist! He starts to look for the mysterious barefoot running boy, against the advice of classmate Beatrice Leep. Throughout his journey, Roy makes a few new friends, becomes more aware of doing what is right, thanks the bully, and irritates an executive from Mother Paula's All-American House of Pancakes!

Carl Hiaasen is a great author with HootBeing the first book he had every written. Hoot was published in 2002. Other books by Carl are Skinny Dip. In Hoot with 292 pages of excitement and non stop reading making the book so good because of its length. The genre of this book is realistic fiction because of the events that could really happen. In my opinion this book was very interesting, exciting, funny, and action packed. An outstanding book. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on a scale from 1-10. This book being the best book I have read this year in 2005.Roy being a new student at Trace Middle School, on the way to school he spots a mysterious running boy. He later goes through adventures to help him stop Mother Paula's from building there 496th pancake house on the street of East Oriel and Cococanut Grove. He goes through many adventures to get revenge on Dana Matheson, a boy that beats up kids like Roy. This book has a lot of twists and turns and a lot of unexpected scenes. So watch out!Hoot was a very action packed book with lots of exciting scenes. One of the scenes that made me laugh so hard was when Roy went over to Dana's house and mooned him. Dana comes chasing angrily after Roy for a couple blocks. Though Roy outruns him. The author was very descriptive on how the chase went there were a lot of details. Roy being smart when he let Dana catches up to him. He lied to Dana, and tricked him to go on Mother Paula's property just to find cigarettes. The main scenes of action in this book were when Mullet Fingers (or Napoleon) vandalizes Mother Paula's property. Examples are when he put alligators in the Traveling Johnny's, pulled out survey stakes on the property ( two times), put Curly's gun in the toilets, and took out the seats of the bulldozers. It was always mysterious and a surprise what Mullet Fingers would do next. This next scene was very funny but exciting. When Dana was tricked into going to Mother Paula's property to steal some cigarettes Roy had lied to him about. On the way into the trailer he stepped on mousetraps (Dana being not so smart). He had broken 3 of his toes. Then Dana being stupid enough and slow at running tries to escape the scene but when officer Delinko comes he gets arrested for trespassing Mother Paula's property and accused of vandalism ( even though he didn't).This book was \\"laugh-out-loud\\" and had a lot of humor. This book made me laugh a lot. One of the funny languages in this book was when Kalo the dog tamer's language. It was funny how the words were said. I could imagine the character saying the words. He was talking French. But when he was talking English he said the words with an accent. The words looked funny, read funny, and said funny. This scene was also mentioned in the \\"funny\\" category too. When Dana was falsely tricked into stealing cigarettes at Mother Paula's. Dana breaks 3 of his toes from stupidity and tries to escape Officer Delinko and a foreman, Curly. But being too slow Dana got caught. One of the reviews on this book says this book is \\"laugh-out-loud\\" and \\"off beat hilarious\\".Overall this book was outstanding and excellent. I was rolling on the floor laughing and couldn't stop from the book's humor. This book was also addictive and exciting making me want to read it with all the action packed scenes. I highly recommend this book for young adult's kids age 10 and older. I will almost guarantee that you will like this book. Don't miss out on how Roy and his mysterious friend tries to save the owls and stop Mother Paula's pancake house from building. Find out now by reading Hoot!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is an outstanding book written by Carl Hiaasen. Carl had written another book called Skinny Dip. Hoot has 292 pages and every page is amazing and enjoying to read. Random House is the company who published this amazing book. Hoot has won very many awards including ALA Book for Young Adults, ALA Booklist, ALA Notable Books for Children, School Library, Newberry and many more.Hoot is about a new kid from Montana named Roy. On the bus, Roy meets a bully named Dana who the nicest person. Dana was rearranging Roy's face one day on the bus when Roy sees a boy running outside without any shoes. Roy gets curious, and wants to meet this boy. Roy's curiosity leads into Roy getting knocked out, almost bit by snakes, and almost getting crushed by a tough girl. Roy finally meets this boy and wants to help in his plan to try to save a couple of small owls. Roy becomes friends with the boy and his step sister and start to trust each other after Roy does some noble things.I really loved reading Hoot for many reasons. The characters say such funny things that will make you laugh so much. Like, one time in the story, Roy was at Dana's house and Roy's Mom said to Roy,\\" I hope they don't hurt each other. They're both rather husky, aren't they?\\" Another one was when Roy mooned Dana and Dana told Roy, \\"Hey, you moon someone and that's it. You get your butt kicked.\\" Which I thought that was hilarious.Of all the things I loved in the book, one of the ones I loved was how the author Carl Hiaasen would tell something happened but not tell what it was and tell later in the book what that was. This happened many times but here is one of the times it happened in the book. Officer Delinko was patrolling the construction site and he thought he saw a flash but thought it wasn't anything. Later, Mullet Fingers told Roy that he got the pictures that night at the construction site so that flash that the officer saw was the camera's flash. The way the author did that was cleaver and made reading the book so much fun and exciting to read.I recommended this book for any age. Anyone would enjoy and laugh when reading this book. It is such a phenomenal book. Every page is amazing and even though it's a pretty big book, every page is worth reading. Everyone's determination and actions to save a couple of owls the size of a pop can so they wouldn't get plowed bulldozers is lots of fun to read. Oh, by the way, have you ever heard of an owl the size of a pop can?"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I generally am not one to be coaxed or fall prey to child or young adult comedy, only upon the supposition that they are not funny. I mean not to offend anyone, but children's comedies are just tedious.Hoot is not.In hoot, the drive of the story is not the actual story, but the characters and the narratives. Hoot flaunts a story of minimal interests, but uses that as a fulcrum to launch a circus of cheap but funny jokes. Having read Hoot, you will not be rolling on the floor with laughter, but instead basking in their ironic glow. Hoot is not a fantastic piece of literature, but a darn fun book to read.The course of the book is not slow and \\"pointless\\", as I have heard, but fast, funny, flashy, and f-f-f- oh, whatever. Read Hoot because you're tired of serious books, not because you're prospecting for influential, lyrical, proseful books. Hoot meets neither of the requirements, but is still a genuinely good read.The book is entirely appropriate and within comprehensive context, and should(or could) be read by anyone within the general ages of 11-18.So give a cheer, and read hoot!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"When I read Hoot, I couldn't put it down because it was so interesting. Roy Eberhardt, the main character, just moved from Montana to Florida. Here he gets bullied a lot not only because he's the new kid, but because he dresses like a Montana cowboy kid, not a \`beachy' Florida kid. This story changes from one scene to another scene, which made it more interesting. One scene is about Roy's crazy life, and the other is about a new Mother Paula's construction site and how it is being vandalized by a mysterious person (you'll find out who he is if you read the book). Also, on this site there are burrowing owls, but if there are owls, how can they build there? Roy encounters some problems on the school bus. He is always being picked on by a bully named Dana Matherson. One day, while being beaten up by Dana, he sees a boy running at full speed with no shoes. A few days later, while being choked by Dana, Roy sees this boy once again running on the sidewalk. Same clothes, no shoes. So Roys curiosity got the best of him and he somehow breaks free of Danas clasp on his neck (you will find out how it is VERY funny), gets off the bus, and chases the boy. Before getting off the bus, he accidentally knocked over a girl named Beatrice. Unfortunately, if you want to find how Roy gets free, who the boy is, how they can construct on the pancake site, who is vandalizing the Pancake house property, and why he/she is, you will have to Read Hoot. Enjoy!!P.S. I would recommend this book to adventurous people, people who like realistic fiction, and people who like a good laugh once in a while. Read it before you see the movie."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiaasen's humorous but serious book, Hoot, has changed the way I feel about nature. This book is about three kids who will do anything to prevent the Mother Paula's Pancake House construction crew from burying so many \\"delicately perfect\\" owls. You will love it!Roy Eberhardt had just moved from the mountainous Montana to the hot and humid Florida. There he encounters a cruel bully named Dana Matherson who torments him non-stop. In addition, he meets a tough and bulky girl named Beatrice Leep who turns out to be a surprising character. Out of school, he meets a determined, young, potentially delinquent that Roy likes to call Running Boy, and a police officer that you'll come to like more and more throughout the book, named Officer David Delinko.It has been a pleasure reading Hoot together with my 5th grade class as a read aloud. I recommend this book to about ages 9 and up, and I strongly recommend it as a read aloud with your class. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt is the new kid at school in Coconut Cove, Florida. A boy who spent a lot of his life in Montana, he isn't used to the flat Coconut Cove, where you don't see many bull riders or cattle. But one day on the way to school, he spots a mysterious boy running along the sidewalk toward an unknown destination. And so begins a fun, suspensful adventure with new friends, some of them with feathers.I loved this book! My cousin recommended it to me but it was only recently that I actually gave it a chance. The cover is unique, and I think it's cute now, but it was also kind of misleading in the way that I thought it was about some silly talking owl. The story really surprised me, and I found myself not being able to put it down. There was some mild swearing, but nothing really bad. Some parts were kind of unbelievable, but it was a neat book. I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book starts out with Roy Eberhardt being bullied on the school bus by Dana Matherson. As his face is pushed against the window, he is the only person to see a strange boy running barefoot. As the book continues, there is a pancake house called Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House being built in the town of Coconut Cove. Behind the construction, there is a secret that only Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House knows. The land on which the pancake house is being built on is the home of the burrowing owls which are endangered species. Strange events are happening that no one can explain such as survey stakes being pulled out and the holes filed. There are small alligators in the out houses, the air is sucked out of the wheels of a truck, cottonmouths with taped mouths are set near the construction site, and the seats of the bulldozers are missing. Who are causing these events? The hero of these owls is trying to save the owls, but will he succeed?A reason why I liked this book is because of the characters. All the characters of this book are very different and in their own way unique. Roy Eberhardt is the type of boy that is shy in school but leads a unique life and always tries to do the right thing. Dana Matherson is the not very intelligent bully of the school that is also very gullible. Beatrice Leep is the athletic girl that is related to Mullet Fingers. Mullet Fingers (that's not his real name) is the strange boy that was running barefoot in the beginning of the story. Officer Delinko is the cop that is trying to get a promotion but also wants to solve the mystery of the Mother Paula's strange events. A quote that shows Officer Delinko's want for a promotion is, \\"Think your dad would mind writing a letter to the police chief?...Something they could put in my permanent file.\\"Another reason I liked this book is because of the plot. The plot keeps building up and it keeps you wanting to know what happens to the burrowing owls. You get surprised at the events that keep happening. A quote that shows a surprising yet scary feat is, \\"Then Beatrice had performed an astounding feat- she'd lifted his bicycle by the sprockets and chomped a hole in the rear tire...\\" When I read this part I was amazed and started laughing at the thought of someone biting a hole in a bike with their teeth.My favorite part of the book is at the end of the book when Roy tries catching a mullet with his bare hands. When he tried and couldn't catch one he thought it was impossible. When he remembers the time when he saw Mullet fingers catch one he thought that it was an illusion. As he starts walking back to the shore he finds a shoe missing. When he finds it tied to a root with a mullet inside, he knows that seeing Mullet Fingers catching a mullet wasn't an illusion and now knows that it's not impossible. I liked this part because it was just a good way to end the book. Roy knew that it wasn't impossible to catch a mullet with your bare hands and he would come again and try again."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"One of the BEST books I've ever read.

I personally didn't like how adults played a big role in this book. Most kids like books without too many adults in them. Some of the characters were a bit weak, but this book was very well written."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book was fantastic, the book is full of small, cunning mysteries. The book is extremely hilarious. Like, for example the alligators in the porta-potties, for \\"Curly\\" it wasn't funny at all but for me and the rest of my 6th grade Language Arts class it was very funny.Mother Paula's All-American pancake house is full of incredibly histerical chracters, like \\"Curly\\" who killed a rat in his bathroom thinking it was a cotton mouth mocassin. Then he put rat traps to trap any more rats.However, this book is also caring for the environment and its living things in it.Like the most important subjects of the story are Burrowing Owls who are almost killed by the building of Mother Paula's. Fortunately they are saved by Roy Eberhardt,Beatrice, \\"mullet Fingers\\", etc.My favorite chapter is Ch.20, when one of the owls finally give proof that the holes everybody thought were abandonrd years ago, wasn't true. \\"Mullet Fingers\\" is in one of the holes and a Burrowing Owl flies in the air, and lands on top of his head it is just incredible, I believe it left the whole audience with their mouth open.Even though the book doesn't describe their faces I could picture an image of Chuck.E Muckle all with hatred inside. All I have to say is that I would love to read what is next in Mr.Hiaasen's mind, which I bet is always full of ideas."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is one of the most intriguing books out there for young adults.It features numerous plot twists, some quirky characters, and humorous situations.there's no doubt that this book is a great success, several suspensful scenes build up to revealing the mother paula predicament. even though the book is entertaining it is ultimately not very memorable. all of the characters are well developed and are offbeat oddballs. The novel is a decent delight for people of all ages and is recommended for any reading.In my opinion my preferred character in Hoot has to be Mullet Fingers. He's a native outcast who has adapted to living in the wild . i admire his determined personality and his preseverance to continue to fight to save the owls . Not only but also he's stealthily acts and his clever moves make him an unpredictable character, like the time he used Dana as a decoy to get out of juvenile hall, i thought that was really cunning.Through out the whole the book there were many segments that were my favorite but my favorite would have to be when Mullet Fingers took Roy tothe Molly Bell and Mullet fingers then demonstrated how he could catch a Mullet by leaping in to the water and grabbing it. that part I really envisioned in my mind and i could literally see Mullet Fingers jumping into the water and resurfacing with a Mullet.In conclusion Hoot is a solid book and should be reccommended for readers of all ages, it really is a hoot to read. ^_^"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The site of Coconut Cove's future Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House is experiencing a slight problem: documents removed, alligators in the port-a-potties, and painted-over patrol cars.

They're even making predictions without being asked!!!I'm happy with the characterizations that lead to discussions about right and wrong, kid concerns and adult concerns, environmental issues, etc. Some teachers might want to be aware of mild profanity throughout the book.

This book contains events that will just crack you up: Crocodiles placed in portable toilets, 120 pound dogs becoming scared of a 2 pound snake; and some that will make you not want to put down the book: The main character, Roy, getting trapped in a closet with an angry bully, A boy running away with no shoes, and much more. I give this book a 5 on a scale of 5.In this story, a boy named Roy who just moved into Florida from Montana, has not made very many friends. He is not very sociable and likes Montana better than Florida. He is always running from a bully who despises Roy. Then, one day, Roy was pressed against a bus window and saw a boy running for what looked like no good reason. Roy was naturally curious and chased the boy to his lair. He met this boy and joined his cause: to stop some people from building a pancake house on top of multiple burrowing owl nests. Meanwhile, Police Officer Delinko is charged with the job of guarding the estate from vandalism, which the mysterious boy is doing. The officer gets put on desk duty for sleeping on the job, and from there he tries to work his way back into the police chief&#65533;s &#65533;preferred&#65533; list. Officer Delinko and Roy may be on different sides of this issue, but they meet up in some of the most random ways, including in a hospital.One scene that really sticks out is the one when Beatrice Leep bites a flap into Roy&#65533;s bike tire to give him an excuse for being late for dinner. They were visiting the site of the construction and checking on how the mysterious boy was doing. They were making sure nobody caught him. Roy got picked up and driven home by none other than Officer Delinko, who tries to get Roy&#65533;s dad to write a letter to the chief about how helpful the Officer was to them.Well, this wacky story is a great read for people of all ages, but it was actually targeted towards teenagers. Definitely, this book gets a 5 out of 5 from me due to its plot, humor, and truth about the environment. Hopefully, this book will change or solidify your position on destroying animal habitats.

I wish I would have had Roy's courage and presence of mind as he stood up to all the bullies and stuck to his ideals and new friendships. The poor kid becomes the focus to two of the schools' biggest bullies, but he takes it in stride. It was interesting watching him stand up to Dana with the maturity of an adult as Roy continually confronts Dana face to face, asking him to leave him alone. Then there's Beatrice Leep: She's another kid you don't want to mess with! And Roy becomes involved with her due to some very interesting circumstances! There's also a future pancake house, some bulldozers, and some miniature owls! But at the center of everything there is a boy without a name. Roy just wants to find out about the boy--but in so doing becomes embroiled in something much bigger than himself. The question is, will Roy leave it alone and lie low, or will he stand up for something that he is beginning to believe in?Hoot reminded me of watching a contemporary Andy Griffith show; complete with some bumbling small-town cops, uneducated townsfolk, a mystery with some big wigs from the \`big city', an environmental spin, and kids who tend to take matters into their own hands! The epilogue in this book is a riot--I do love stories that give you \`the rest of the story'! And the ending leaves you happy, yet slightly unsatisfied--but you know that no one will ever be the same! This cute little story will remind us to remember to look around and be aware that there is more to life than buildings and pancakes...and that one person can make a difference! Overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars.Content Review:PROFANITY: Many very mild/crude instances and some Moderate instancesVIOLENCE: Mild to moderate instances throughoutSEXUAL CONTENT: NoneMATURE THEMES: ModerateRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP: 12+There are many instances of crude language ('potty' language), as well as many references to profanity (such as, \\"he heard him mumbling profanity under his breath\\"). There were also other more moderate four-letter words (12) scattered throughout.There was quite a bit of mostly mild violence. A character is constantly bullied: His face is smashed against a bus window; he is choked and there are bruises left behind; he is attacked in a closet and almost killed; he is constantly threatened and verbally abused by the bullies. A character is punched in the nose (the nose is broken). A character puts alligators in outhouse toilets to scare people. A character is spanked and she retaliates by throwing the offender into a fountain and breaking his collarbone. Poisonous snakes are placed in an area to scare other animals. A boy is caught trying to steal and is wrestled to the ground. A character tries to bite another character's toe ring off their foot, and breaks a tooth. A character threatens a crowd with a shovel. A couple is always fighting and shouting at each other. There are a few moderate instances of violence as well: A character is bitten by guard dogs. A character remembers seeing a fatal snowmobile accident that is traumatic. A character is punished for beating up another by being stripped and tied to a flagpole. A character moons another character in order to make him angry so he'll chase him down.The themes in Hoot are mostly moderate. A mother doesn't want her child because he's \`difficult', so she continually sends him to military schools and juvenile halls instead of dealing with him. A character lives alone (a child), constantly runs away from home and school (truancy), and lives with dangerous animals. There's the question of acts of vandalism--is it ok to vandalize if you believe what you're doing is right? Teenage delinquency is mentioned, as a character has a record--and he is only in middle school. There is teenage smoking, stealing, and lying in all forms--when is it \`ok' to lie? The idea that lying is ok if you're protecting someone is often present. A few mild themes would be that of protecting the environment and the animals, and making friends/dealing with bullies at school and/or in new towns.Hoot is written for a younger audience and aims toward more older elementary/middle school age children. Due to some of the language, violence and moderate themes present in Hoot, this is recommended for ages 12+.This review was written by EmilyA Squeaky Clean Reads Book ReviewerThis book was sent to Squeaky Clean Reads by Yearling for a reviewTo see more fantastic books reviewed with content in mind, visit us at squeakycleanreads.com"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This was the first book of Hiaasen's that I have read and I didn't know it was a kid's book. I picked it at random. Don't know if I should read another one by this author or not. The writing was pretty plain and predictable."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"My opinion on HootBy Jayson DanielsI read Hoot by Carl Hiaasen and this review will be about my opinion of the book. Hoot is not part of a series. I found Hoot a great book and after this I hope you will agree. Hoot is about a boy Named Roy Eberhardt who moves to Coconut Cove , Florida, and a construction site is going to ruin an owl home and Roy and his friends have to find a way to stop them and save the owls.The part I liked the most was when Roy meets \\"mullet fingers\\" since that is a good part in the book since \\"mullet fingers\\" is a main character and he is a big influence. He helps Roy a lot.In hoot Roy gets help from friends to help try to stop the destroying of the owl home and to stop the construction site and he does that by delaying the building by doing things to it. He was very determined but he is not a trouble maker and he is shy.The author is trying to tell us that we should use all of our ability to help the world and nature. He also wants to show us what it can do if you help the world so I think it is a good lesson. I am not going to tell you the outcome but I recommend this book to you.I think this book was outstanding and it was very unpredictable for me. I also thought it had great detail and action. I really liked what they are trying to do and I agree with it. I would do the same thing if I was Roy. He is helping the world.Please read hoot and it is great. Thanks for reading"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I like this book because it has a good link to nature and the Characters stand up for each other.I took away the 5th star because most books I read had battles."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I was 11 years old when I first read hoot, though i read the german version and I thought I fell in love with Roy Eberhardt, the main character. And even now, 5 years later, after a recent re-read, I still love this book.I couldn't put the book down and the next thing I know was me rushing through dinner just to pick up where I left off.Hoot is a pro-environemntal book, and I think it is necessary for young adults to actually learn more about our endangered environment. Carl Hiaasen delivers the message with an appealing flair to young readers.Yes, the plot was a bit predictable, but so are 80% of books for YA out there.If you are to get one of those, I promise you will get much more out of hoot.I loved everything about the book - the setting, the language, the characters.C Hiaasen again in this book shows how proud he is of his city of residence.Hoot makes me want to visit Florida desperately, but also Montana (where Roy used to live).Towards the end I was really sad, for this read would end. I felt like I have connected deeply with the characters and for two days long, Roy, Beatrice and Fishfinger were my best friends."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is a great book. I would reccomend this book for anyone in middle school."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"While the book has a great \\"hook\\" from the very first page - the mystery of the running boy, who is first seen by Roy as his (Roy's) face is smushed against a school bus window by a bully - I was a bit surprised by how much my children (9, 11) LOVE this book. Hiaasen's book is chock-full of vivid descriptions of both the setting and the characters - and there are multiple well-developed characters. My kids usually prefer action(although they did love the quiet tale of the Penderwicks) to character analysis, but they were riveted by this tale and begged me to read multiple chapters a day instead of the usual one. And I've enjoyed it thoroughly myself.I'd say Hoot has increased the children's environmental awareness; given them an appreciation of Florida as something other than a state where beaches, hurricanes, and Disney can be found; encouraged them to really think about that fine line between right and wrong; increased their curiosity about the motivations of adults and the complicated balancing acts they engage in; raised the issue of dysfunctional families in a fairly sensitive way; and given us the opportunity to discuss many literary devices. And it is quite funny too, sometimes a bit slapstick but the descriptions are wonderful and the kids completely eat it up.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The story is divided into three main parts. This gives the reader different points of view from each character. The main part is about Roy Eberhardt and his friends \\"Mullet Fingers\\", and his stepsister Beatrice. The main part focuses on their efforts to try and save the owls' homes from getting bulldozed to make way for a construction. The second is about Officer David Delinko, who is one of the Officers investigating the sabotage acts on the construction site. He was caught sleeping during his early morning patrol once and was nearly fired. Now, with his job on the line he basically thought about nothing else but getting his job done. But when he sees the Burrowing Owls and slowly thinks about what will happen to them, he slowly has a change of heart towards the end of the book. The third part is of the construction Foreman Leroy \\"Curly\\" Branitt who also has his job on the line now that the construction was two weeks late. Despite his efforts to guard the construction site, the site is continually sabotaged and gets fired in the end. In the last part he doesn't join Roy and the rest of the crowd to protect the owls, but refuses to take any orders from his boss.Overall I'd say this is a great book with its unpredictable and hilarious characters. Aside from being funny you could learn something too. I noticed that Hiaasen writes mostly about environmental problems. This book illustrates how animals are affected when we destroy their home for the sake of money. Nobody likes seeing their home destroyed. How would we feel if someone showed up on our homes and told us that our house was going to get bulldozed? In the words of Calvin and Hobbes: \\"How would humans feel if animals bulldozed a suburb and put in new TREES?\\""},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This story is about a boy named Roy who has just moved to Coconut Cove and helps save the burrowing owls at a constuction site.

It gave me the plot, characters, and the events. I think Carl Hiaasen is an amazing author because he has a good sense of nature. The book started when a boy named Roy Eberhardt, had just moved from Montana to Florida. On the first day at Trace Middle School, Roy encounters a bully named Dana Matherson, an eighth grader who smoked and liked to pick on the new kids. On that same day while Dana was pushing Roy's head into the bus window, Roy sees a shoeless boy running at full speed next to the bus. Roy was so fascinated by this boy. One day when Roy was being choked by Dana, he saw the boy again. Then Roy gets free from Dana's grasp and runs off the bus after the shoeless boy. On the way off the bus Roy bumps into a girl that was getting onto the bus. When Roy caught up with the boy he falls into a ditch. When he got up he was pulled out of the ditch and had a sack put over his head. Someone took off the sack and then disappeared in a flash. One day, Roy missed the bus and walked home. While he was walking he spots a small harmless owl by a burrow. Roy had never seen something so delicate and small in his life. In the middle of the book, Roy is told that there is a Mother Paula's Pancake house being built by the site of where the owls lived. Roy starts to get very sad for the owls in their burrows. At the end of the book, Roy and his two best friends are Beatrice and the running boy stand up for the owls and help them from being buried."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot was a really great book.

In recent day humid Coconut Cove, Florida Roy Eberhardt a small, but quick boy was used to moving often and being the victim to the school bully. He never knew that one barefoot, running boy would lead to such curiosity and a surprising new friendship, but there's lots to know about this boy and his grudge against pancakes. When Roy finds out Beatrice leep the school's tough, girl soccer player, plays her way in the story there's sure to come some struggles and open doors into the teen's interesting past. Will Roy choose between what's right or what he's afraid of ?One scene in this book I liked is when Roy went to the bully's house and completely mooned the bully and how he just calmly pulled his pants up and walked around the corner of the house ready to run when the boy ripped around the corner. This passage in the book surprised me a lot, but made me laugh. To me the passage really showed me how much Roy changed form the beginning of the book to that point. From being shy to kind of being reckless in this case, but I did think it was a little un called for.This was a very well written, good book. It was the right reading level for me and I found myself with my nose glued to it every time I picked it up. I really recommend it to anyone that likes humor, a little mystery and a great adventure. It showed me that there are a lot of wonderful places to explore outside. This is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I think Hoot was a great book because the athor gave so much description into the writing.I also liked the book because when I was reading Hoot it made me build a picture in my mind and really the book wasn't to hard or long. Also in this book you can really laugh at some points or be really serious at other moments and the good thing is that the author explains it so well that you can tell when it skips from one moment to the next.Since it does that it explains really well how the book goes and I really recomend Hoot and other books Carl Hiaasen has wrote. I also liked this book because it made you want to read more and more because it had so many surprises that made it a great. So I would definatly recomend hoot to read because once you read this book you want to read more and more like it."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy Eberhardt is the newkid at Trace Middle School.

With the help of some friends in his new town Roy tries to save the precious and endangered animals. \\"Hoot\\" by Carl Hiassan is a great book filled with humor and originality. A quick read, Hoot is a suspenseful page turner that teaches kids they can do things too.Roy's story is very comical. Roy never wanted to move to Coconut Cove, Florida. But Roy's parent over ruled him, trying to convince him by promising a visit to Disney World, a promise to which Roy replied \\"Disney World is an armpit.\\" Roy arrives in Coconut Cove where he meets Garret, the guidance counselor's son and the Trace Middle School goof-off. Not everyone Roy meets is as friendly as Garret; Roy gets punched and pushed around on the bus by Dana Matherson, the biggest and meanest kid at Trace. Another amusing part takes place one day while looking out the bus window Roy spots a strange boy running with out shoes. Roy is very curious about the \\"Running Boy\\". As Roy wonders about the strange kid, Dana starts to beat Roy up, Roy slugs the bully in the nose. Terrified of what Dana will do to him Roy runs off the bus, chasing the strange kid. Roy chases the runner across a golf course where Roy gets hit in the head with a golf ball and knocked unconscious. Coconut Cove might seem like a sleepy town, but it really isn't. At the future site of a Mother Paula's Pancake House there is a lot of vandalism going on. Roy reads in the paper about a police car being spray painted while the officer, on guard duty slept inside.\\"Hoot\\" is a very original story. When Roy ran off the bus he bumped into Beatrice Leep, a tough soccer jock who confronts him the next day. She warns him about chasing the strange boy. Roy latter befriends Beatrice and finds out the strange boy is her step brother, who ran away from military school. Beatrice is the only one other than Roy who talks to her brother, who sleeps in an abandon ice cream truck. Another original aspect of they story happens when the boy who is called \\"Mullet Fingers\\" tells Roy that he has been vandalizing the Mother Paula's site, and explains that they are planning to bulldoze the site, in the process burring helpless owls! Roy, a nature lover himself, promises to help \\"Mullet Fingers\\" in anyway possible.\\"Hoot\\" is very suspenseful and teaches positive lessons. Mullet Fingers gets bitten by a guard dog on the Mother Paula's property and the bite gets infected. Mullet Fingers refuses to see a doctor for fear they will contact his parents, but when he goes unconscious Roy and Beatrice take him anyway. Roy gives his name at the Hospital so Mullet Fingers can get treated. The Hospital contacts Roy's parents who rush to the hospital thinking their son is hurt. Roy has to explain the Mother Paula's situation to his parents. Meanwhile Roy reads about a ground breaking celebration at the Mother Paula's, in the newspaper, and decides he must stop it. He brings in the article for current events and asks his classmates to come protest with him the next day at lunch. Roy, Beatrice, Mullet Fingers, and their classmates are able to protest and delay the ground breaking until Roy finds out from his father, that the construction work is illegal. Roy gives the information to the local paper who announces the scandal. The scandal latter shows that a city councilman was bribed! Roy and Beatrice become heroes while Mullet Fingers avoids the attention.\\"Hoot\\" is a fabulous book that teaches positive lessons, is funny, and very original. I recommend \\"Hoot\\" to teens looking for a good book. Girls and boys alike will enjoy the story and characters.-C.

Hoot is a great book! It is an excellent book for a 5th to 8th grade reading level. You won't be able to put this book down. It is an adventure and extremely funny. The 3 kids in Hoot set out on a mission to save endangered owls. The kids are drawn together because of an accident which forms a strong friendship. I love that these 3 very different individuals became friends. This friendship grows throughout the book and is tested several times. Some funny parts of this book are when someone puts alligators in the port-a-potty. Also when scary attack dogs come onto the property and scare the manager of the building. I also enjoyed all the pranks the people are playing on the manager of the building. This story shows how determined the characters are to help the owls, giving up is just not an option for them. Hoot is Newberry Honor Book. I think you'll love this book. If you enjoy this book the author, Carl Hiaasen also wrote Flush. As you can see Hoot is not just for kids, grown ups will love it too. So get Hoot for yourself or as a gift, either way you or someone else will love it. So you should go out and get Hoot!

It taught kids and teens that they can make a difference, but instead of getting that advice from their parents, they got it from the book.However, I have to tell you-it was really boring when i started reading it during my vacation, so i stopped, but made another choice to keep reading it a few hours later.Parents shouldn't be worried about the language in this book, since there's only about 3 bad words in this book, but really, I shouldn't use the word \\"bad,\\" at all, because those three words weren't really that bad at all. It had lots of humor, but the one thing I didn't get was when Roy dissed Beatrice, and she got all angry, why wasn't she still mad at roy a couple of days after she met roy again?It took me two times two read it and understand what going on, but really, I didn't mind because I couldn't take my face out of that book for a second.

The mighty mouse has to deal with his own family who betrays him, an evil rodent who is the king of the dungeon, a somewhat sympathetic jailor and a host of others who can only see a mouse as something to be caught in a trap and discarded. If you like happy endings where good wins over evil please grab this book off the nearest bookshelf and sail off to a land full of mouseful adventures.I was there (tell why you liked the book)I loved this book so much. I liked it a lot - even though it is fantasy. But with fantasy comes the fun part - could a mouse really marry a princess? With her story-telling approach, I felt like I was sitting around a campfire with Kate DeCamillo right beside me. She makes the reader feel like she is telling the story just to you. She captures your interest and soon your heart. In every chapter, she starts or ends with,\\" Reader . . . . . Reader do you know what happened next, And then Reader, he fainted.\\" In the end, the author signs off, \\"Reader, I hope you have found some light here.\\"It's so real to me (tell one more thing about the book that is important to you)Just recently one of my best friends got very sick. He had to fight through a terrible disease to save his life. I loved the Tale of Despereaux because he had to also fight for something that he believed in and save himself from probable death in a dungeon. If Deperaux and my friend had not believed in themselves, they might have both died. One of the most powerful things that we can learn from books is how to deal with our own lives and perhaps become a better person.Thumbs up or down? (Your recommendation)Whether you are a fantasy reader or not, this is a great book. One of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"\\"Hoot\\" could have been a really fine story of a boy's coming of age, facing an obstacle that pits life's lesson against life's lesson, right against wrong, moral against legal. As it turned out, Hiaasen just didn't carry his vehicle particularly deftly. The characters are paper-thin: frankly, we just don't give a HOOT about them. Roy is dull and predictable; the police are run-of-the-mill buffoons; and, as for the mysterious, barefooted Mullet Fingers, I couldn't care whether he lacerated both plantae on one of those new onion slicer gadgets. I wish I had taken a \\"pass\\" rather than invested three hundred pages in this trivium."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book was funny at first, but it got too politically correct for me. There is a definite left-wing, socialist message in this book--that government--and government regulations--are good and are there to save us from the big bad corporations. (All the people who work the restaurant chain are stereotypical, cardboard villains; in contrast, the main character's likeable father works for the federal government.) Some may say that you shouldn't take this book too seriously--that it's just a \\"comedy.\\" But it gets pretty serious as it goes along, and I think we should be teaching our kids to like businesses, because they create jobs, and to hate government regulations because they choke small business and risk taking and stifle job growth. Most people fail to realize that most fast food restaurants are franchises run by risk-taking entrepreneurs, not by greedy executives in some corporate headquarters."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot, by Carl Hiaasen, is a good book to read if you just feel like reading. However, if you feel like an intriguing plot and something that you will be unable to put down, you are looking at the wrong book.I regret to say this, but Hoot is just an average book with the un-original story of an American boy, Roy, who moves around and who is unsettled in his school life. He is faced with problems with finding friendship and the school bully, but then Roy discovers a boy on the run, and befriends the boy's sister who is in Roy's class. Roy then gets dragged into trying to save families of owls from their home, which is being renovated to building a chain restaurant.I don't think I have to tell you the outcome of the owls and the restaurant. To warn you now, Hoot is very predictable.If the isn't enough, sometimes you just don't feel like you're part of the story at all. The descriptions are not good enough to be able to see what the surroundings or people are like.If you have nothing to do, read this book. But if you have anything else to do, do that.The blandness and un-originality of Hoot is apparent even in the first chapter. Perhaps this can be excused for this being Carl Hiaasen's first childrens novel, and hopefully he will use more creativity and excitement in his next."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"My 9-year-old brought this home from the school library and upon reading it, informed me the word \\"damn\\" is used multiple times in the book. While it's not the most horrible thing in the world, I guess, teachers and parents should be aware it's in there. I'm puzzled as to why a children's book, and one that's apparently won awards, has swear words in it. Also, the synopsis on the book jacket described the story of a boy who moves to a new school and finds an unusual person to be friends with. However, my son told me the main points of the story were environmentalist in nature, coming out against a company developing land in Florida. While that kind of thing is something that should be discussed, I wish the synopsis had been more truthful. It's disappointing to see that there's some deception on the story description and then includes swear words once you get into it. Full disclosure is a good thing."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book was in great condition, we have no complaints there but the length it took us to get the book was longer than anticipated."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"this is a good book.it has gooood stuff in it.this book also has no borin parts.its good!!!!!!!!!!!%%%%%%%%%%%%%Stars"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book was so funny, filled with cops that don't do anything, mysterious running kids with no footwear, tiny burrowing owls all in a farmiliar setting.

He finally found out that the boy, Mullet Fingers, is Beatrice's step brother who had run away from a \\"special\\" school. While Roy got to know them, weird things started to happen to a new nearby shop, Mother Paula, a famous pancake shop. For example, six alligators in the toilets, cottonmouth snakes around the yard, paint on officer Delinko's car and many others. It was a mystery to Roy, and soon he found out.

A kid named Roy had just moved from Montana to Florida. He was the new kid in school and got made fun of because he didn't exactly have the Florida fashion. Well he was sitting on the school bus one day being choked by a bully when he just happened to observe a kid running by shoeless at full speed. Roy saw him doing it again a couple of days later so he decided to find out who this boy was. This boy was quicker then Roy and could certainly run for a longer time, so Roy didn't catch him that first time. When he did find out who this boy was, the boy made him realize that if Mother Paula's was to build a pancake house they would be burying a lot of endangered owls.

He is being beaten up by the school bully and is having a hard time fitting in. But he becomes entangled in an environmental battle when a chain pancake restaurant wants to build a new pancake house on a location that houses unique and rare owls. Roy and his tenuous friends take on a battle that may be bigger than they realize. Roy must find a way to follow his heart without breaking the law in protest.Hiaasen has a real way with his characters. They are people you love and get to know through the pages of the story. There is almost always some sort of environmental twist and, in some ways, it is like beating a dead horse. But the writing is always hilarious and entertaining until the last page. Readers, both young and old, will enjoy this effort."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a fabulous adventure and realistic fiction coming of age story by Carl Hiaasen about a young boy named Roy who is new to town. It is 292 pages of adventure, as Roy is bullied by Dana Matherson, the town bully. While Dana, the story's antagonist, is anything but a good person, his bullying does lead Roy to notice a boy running barefoot alongside the bus he is on, eventually taking him on an adventure of a major ecological and corrupt problem caused by a fraudulent business.The boy Roy saw running calls himself Mullet Fingers. He comes from a troubled home but is determined despite the odds to stand up for what he believes. Meanwhile, a breakfast chain, Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House, is going to open up a restaurant in town but the building's construction is constantly delayed due to damages that occur to the area in the middle of the night. The pancake company wants to begin building on the property and so hires a security guard to protect the area from any possible vandals. Through yet another scheme, Roy convinces Dana to enter the construction site in search of cigarettes. Dana is quickly caught in the act and people believe that he is responsible for the vandalism.Dana's trespassing brings light to the habitat of the burrowing owl, which is currently in the very area that the Mother Paula's intends to builds its restaurant. People quickly jump on the children's bandwagon, which wants nothing more than for these owls to live in their natural habitat. These children expose the company for what it really is and uncover some deals that are anything but legal among adults in his new.This story is perfect for the young adult reader, as it clearly shows that whether we like it or not, we all grow up. And when we grow up, we take on responsibilities that we never before dreamed possible. It is an inspirational tale to see young adults making responsible decisions on their own. Simultaneously, the young adults are forced to look at the adults around them who are taking bribes and making illegal deals, while they are fighting for what they believe and know is right. They are ready to take on the powerful executives, even though their chances might seem bleak.Throughout the story, Roy is forced into the world and must grow up, even if the adults around him might not have. It is a great read for young adults, as Roy is forced to adjust to the changes around him that come with moving to a new town. However, he quickly prevails.I personally loved this story because it allows young adults to see that despite all of the problems that occur in life, they actually can prevail and bring about good things through action. This story teaches students that it is imperative that they stand up for what they believe. Young adults of today can easily relate to Roy, for Macmillan Publishers just recently published it in 2002 at a Lexile Level of 760. Simultaneously, as a teacher of young adults, I personally have an issue with the presence of cigarettes and curse words in a story. And I know that many of my students' parents also would not appreciate some of the content that Hiaasen has chosen to include. Nonetheless, I appreciate that he does not sugarcoat any of the topics but rather \\"keeps it real\\" for the kids, allowing them to wrestle with the issues as though they are in Roy's shoes."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is about five characters (Roy, Mullet Finger, Beatrice, officer Delinko, and Curly), one group of animals (the owls), and one pancake house (Mother Paula's) fighting over an area of land and trying to save the owls. Roy tries to find out the right thing to do. Mullet Finger tries to help a group of owls. Beatrice tries to help Mullet Finger. Officer Delinko tries to solve the pancake house case. Curly tries not to get fired.This book is worth reading for several reasons. It tells about certain animals. Also it tells about right and wrong. It also shows many legal things. Finally, it shows that a little devotion goes a long way.

WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD! Roy Eberhardt is an adolescent boy who has moved from place to place with his father's job in the government. He now resides in the quiet town of Coconut Cove, Florida. In this town Roy is the new kid who has only a few friends. One day while riding the bus to school, Roy sees a boy running down the road in an old, tattered basketball jersey, dirty shorts, and bare feet. Roy is fascinated by the boy, and the next time he sees the boy he pursues him. While jumping off of the bus to catch the boy, he runs into Beatrice Leed. The boy turns out to be Beatrice's stepbrother. The main problem in the story is a species of burrowing owl that makes their nest on a construction site for the restaurant, Mother Paula's Pancakes. Beatrice's stepbrother has always cared about animals, and he wants to save the owls living on the lot. He pulls multiple pranks, and crimes to try to delay the construction. Later in the story, Beatrice's brother pulls in Roy and Beatrice to help out with the cause. Eventually Roy spreads publicity throughout the school and town, and when the televised groundbreaking ceremony for the restaurant came, there was a large protest against the construction. The school kids, along with adults, and the Mother Paula icon herself fight the company by not letting construction begin. In addition, a little detective work by Roy made the company forfeit the lot. Roy found out that the lot did not have any of the proper paperwork, and that the owls were a protected species, so the company gave up.

You laugh, you sigh, and you even feel sorry for the characters as the story moves. Roy Eberhardt is the new kid--again. This time around it's Trace Middle School in humid Coconut Grove, Florida. But it's still the same old routine: table by himself at lunch, no real friends, and thick-headed bullies like Dana Matherson pushing him around. But if it wasn't for Dana Matherson mashing his face against the school bus window that one day, he might never have seen the tow-headed running boy. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never have met tall, tough, bully-beating Beatrice. And if he had never met Beatrice, he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in the lot on the corner of East Oriole Avenue.

With suspense that never stops, you will never want to put this book down. This book never got boring and always seemed exciting. I think the book Hoot is the right choice for you."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot got a Newberry Honor. I think it deserved the Newberry honor because it is a funny, laugh out loud, mysterious, and exiting book. This book is fiction because it is a made up story.In this book, a boy named Roy is on his bus and all of a sudden a boy is running along side the bus. The weird thing about this boy is that he has no shoes and seems to be running away from someone. Roy thinks about that boy all day. He decides to run after the boy the next time he sees him. So after about a week he sees the boy running along side the bus. At the next stop he shoves everyone that was getting on out of his way and runs after the boy. After he sees the boy he starts running after him. Just when he thought that he would catch him a golf ball hit him because he was running on a golf course. The next day at school he met the strange boy's step- sister and he gets to meet the new boy. Then he learns that the boy is trying to save some baby burrowing owls. He tries to figure out if it is illegal to kill the burrowing. Will Roy be able to save the baby owls or will the bulldozers crush them?The story took place in Florida. The main characters are Roy, Beatrice, Mullet Fingers, Dana Matherson, Curly, and Officer Delinko. The problem is that the bulldozers are going to crush the baby birds and Roy, Beatrice, and Mullet Fingers want to save the baby birds.I give this book five stars because it is a book that kids can read. It is a funny, exciting laugh out loud mysterious, and descriptive novel and it is good for any kid who is interested."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in Hoot. The barefooted runner's anonymity grabbed my curiosity right off. Roy did the right thing by investigating the Environmental Impact Statement to support his protest. A great many lessons can be learned by this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Roy is pretty new to his Florida town. His father is in the government law enforcement agency and he and his family move around a lot. He isn't surprised when a bully on his bus, Dana, chooses to harass him. But Dana's harassment is a blessing in disguise--while Dana is shoving his head against the window of the bus, he sees a boy who looks to be about his age running barefoot through the yards near the school bus. Roy becomes determined in two ways: he is not going to let Dana bully him forever and he is going to figure out what is going on with the barefoot boy.Both of these goals are more difficult than Roy originally thought. Even though he punches Dana, he still isn't left alone. And once he starts getting close to finding out who the barefoot boy is, an intimidating older girl named Beatrice starts beating up on him almost as much as Dana. What is going on?Soon Roy becomes even more interested in the barefoot boy, especially when it becomes obvious he can't reason with Dana. But the boy is remaining very secretive. Roy begins to suspect the barefoot boy might have something to do with the ongoing vandalism that is stopping the pancake house chain from breaking ground in a nearby vacant lot.I liked the friendship that sprung up between Roy and Beatrice, and I liked the relationship between Beatrice and the barefoot boy. I liked what happened at the end of the book to the barefoot boy, and I really liked the fact that this story of the vacant lot was told both from the point of view of Roy and from the point of view of the police officer protecting the lot.I thought Roy's character was incredibly arrogant about everything, though, which made him a much less appealing and sympathetic character."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot, by Carl Hiaasen, takes place in Florida, probably in the 21st century. It follows the story of Roy Eberhardt, a new kid from Montana, as he tries to unravel the story of the \\"running boy,\\" the protector of the burrowing owls. The burrowing owls will be heartlessly slaughtered if the running boy fails to stop Mother Paula's Pancake House from building a restaurant over their dens. To help protect the owls the running boy does things like putting alligators in the construction site traveling johnnies and removing the seats from the earth movers.Overall this book was, in my opinion, a flop. Not only did it lack an intricate story that was challenging to read, but I didn't like the way it showed teens in average everyday life. If I want to know the habits of teens I can just look around me. Also, I found grammatical errors aplenty, as well as places elaboration of the story could have been made. For example, the book doesn't say what Mullet Fingers did after he escaped from juvenile detention. I'll admit I don't like realistic fiction, but for other reasons I didn't really like the book Hoot."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a fiction novel. The main character is Roy Eberhardt, an odd middle schooler who just moved to Florida. Roy is an only child who is adventurous and determined. Mullet Fingers is a little younger than Roy and is homeless. Mullet Finger's tough step-sister, Beatrice, lives at home, but looks out for her step-brother. Another important character in the story is Dana, the school bully who tries to annoy Roy.The setting of Hoot is in southern Florida near the Everglades. It takes place at the end of summer right at the beginning of the school year. Roy has to deal with the school bully Dana Matherson while he is on the school bus. Roy has gotten used to this kind of problem because he is used to being the new kid in school. Roy does a good job of getting back at Dana, because every time Dana bothers Roy he ends up getting hurt himself. The main problem in this novel is that the burrowing owls at the Mother Paula's Pancake House construction site will probably die if the Pancake House is built there. Mullet Fingers keeps trespassing and doing things to stop the construction from starting. Roy and Mullet Fingers mess up the ground breaking ceremony to keep the owls safe.My favorite scene was when Mullet Fingers gets into the owl hole and the news people see him there and they prove the owls really live there. His step-mom sees him there and wants him to come home, but he runs away again. My favorite character was Mullet Fingers because he was brave and he never gave up. I would recommend this book to my friends because it is a really interesting book when you get to the end. Kids who don't like to read might have a hard time with this long book. I would give this book a rating of 4 out of 5 because it was a little hard for me, but it was a good book overall."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot by Carl Hiassen tells you about a boy named Roy who is the new kid in town again. My favorite part in the book is when Roy gets into a fight with Dana the school bully and Roy wins. The part I didn't like was when Dana wouldn't stop trying to hurt Roy. I gave this book a 3 out of 5 star rating. I would recommend this book to young kids because is funny, adventures, if you break the law you get into big trouble, and it shows bully's get into big trouble and that its not right."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a crazy, fun-loving book! Roy Eberhardt is the new kid at a middle school in Florida. A construction company decides to build a Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House right on top of owl burrows. The owl's are helpless, so Roy and his two new friends decide to help. Even though this book has a couple of cuss words, it is awesome! You need to read this book!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book is one of my favorites because it really takes you on an adventure. This is the kind of book that is hard to put down because in every chapter something even more exciting happens.A part in this book that shows its an adventure book is when Roy the character in the book decides that he wants to find out more about a very curious looking boy running down the side walk. That's just one of the very exciting parts of the book.If you would like a real adventure I would advise you to read this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I love Carl Hiassen's novels, so I was excited to find he had written children's books. I ordered this one since it seems to be the most well-known, and it said it was for ages 10 and up. My 11-year-old is an avid reader and it is hard to keep her supplied with books. She reads on the 9th grade level, so I struggle to find books that match her level, but are still age-appropriate. After reading Hoot, I am disappointed to find that it falls short for that reason. Mr. Hiassen's writing style is so clever and creative, abundant with descriptive phrases and coined words that are perfectly suited to what he is describing. His books for adults are, however, full of profanity and vulgar language, which does hinder my enjoyment of the reading. I choose to ignore the foul language so that I can still enjoy his colorful writing and interesting characters.I had hoped his children's books would have the colorful writing minus the profanity. Sadly, this was not so. I can not endorse a book for children that has profanity in it, so my daughter will not be reading this one. It's a shame, because the words could have easily been replaced by acceptable ones without any diminishing of the story. In fact, a writer with such language talents should have been able to find multiple substitutions - perhaps even more colorful and effective ones than the inappropriate words he chose to use."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought that this book by Carl Hiaasen was great! This was a very inspirational book about a boy named Roy who moves to Coconut Cove, Florida. He faces many problems like a bully named Dana Matherson, and he meets a girl Beatrice, and her mal treated step- brother. Together the kids try to save mini owls who were going to get hurt, or killed by a building company that was building a new Mother Paula's Pancake House. I would reccomend this book to any one, but especially animal lovers. It is a great novel just like Carl Hiaasens other novels."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book was recommended to me by Amazon.com after buying other books for my 11 year old son. We both read it and I have to say it was a great story for kids as well as adults.. Carl Hiaasen deserved the Newberry award that he recently won for this!! I would love to find more books like it. Thank you for the recommendation!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"i think that this was a grate book!!!and i would also lik you too know that i am a speling be champian"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book was definitely not the best book I have ever read in my life. I only enjoyed parts of it. I thought it was very confusing. I was about to give the book 2 stars, but I decided to be nice. I liked the parts where Roy kept seeing the poor kid on the bus, then followed him. It was just fine."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I gave this book to my 10 year old and within the first five pages, she came accross the 'd' word in the text. I quote from page 4, \\"They yanked em' out of the ground, every d#@* one of them.\\" It is used by a construction worker who is talking to a police man but regardless, it is unnecessary. Although I am well award my child has heard it as well as other words,I don't believe it should be used by a children's author who is writing for 10 year olds."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"As a fan of Hiaasen's adult fiction and an environmentalist, I couldn't wait to read this book with my kids. What a disappointment. Sure, there's a story there, about a boy who stands up against the illegal destruction of a protected species - but the author seems to have replaced the outrageous humor of his other stories with tons of explanation and repetition, as if he's making sure kids might understand. Try reading \\"Notes from a Liar and Her Dog\\", or \\"The House of the Scorpion\\", or \\"Holes\\", instead."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot is funny because a man chokes a news reporter because he was mad.The book is sad because there are men who try to hurt these poor owls.The book is crazy because Roy is almost hurt by poisonous snakes.I think that Hoot is a great book to read because it tells about kids risking their lives to save the owlsWhen you are done reading the book you should go and see the movie!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought this was a great book, but not as good as the Tommytown series. In Tommytown the boys 11 -14 and the girl, Karen 14 years old acted more like their age and the scenes where funny and exciting. But both writers are super! Take a look atTommytownandThe Boys From Tommytown, (I actually did it. I inserted the titles) Anyway you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought the book Hoot was very good, it was about three teenagers daring to do something that normally kids would never dream of doing, saving little owles and there home from becoming a MaMa's Pancack house. this book is not only inspiring but it also is full of adventure, friendship, betrail, and coming together to help one another.Alexis, student at SMS."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"this is the best book and movie ever i love carl this book was so good i started crying all his books are good except flush that really let me down but who cares it was one book im still a hiaansen fan ill be futurw ms hiaansen lol"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book was purchased for my son to do a book report on. The book has held his attention so far. The condition of the book was better than I expected."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought that Hoot was a pretty good book. The book takes place in a small town called Coconut Cove, Florida. The main part of the book is about a few kids trying to stop construction workers from building a pancake house over a den of owls. Parts of the book were boring, but there were also really funny parts. A couple of the main characters were Roy Eberhardt and the bully Dana Matherson. If you like funny books and pranks then this is for you."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read Whoot because my mom loves Carl Hiassen. When she found out that he wrote a children's book, she rushed to the phone to call the book store to save the book for me. Now she wants to read it! Whoot is about a boy named Roy who one day sees a strange running boy who has no backpack or shoes. Roy thinks he's a criminal, but he is really a boy who ran away from his house who is trying to save the burowing owls. The owls' homes will be buried by construction for a pancake house. Will the owls be buried, or will their homes survive?"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This book proves that awards are given to authors, not books. I cannot imagine one of the middle school students that I have ever taught in my eight years enjoying this book. It is long, dull, and preachy. The characters and conflicts are unrealistic. If I had not been forced to read it for our adolescent book club, I would have abandoned it after page 3.Don't fall prey to the flashy colors on the cute cover. Just don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"My son read this book as a summer book report project, and for fun I read it as well. The best I can say is that it at least gave me an opportunity to discuss politics with him. The pro-environmental / anti-corporate slant is a bit heavy handed and quite trite. The expository repitition is mind-numbing, and the characters act most unrealistically (but very conveniently for the message). Apart from the environmentalism, which I usually don't mind, the author plays with gender roles a bit too enthusiastically for my taste. Even my son wondered why the protagonist was so infatuated with this mysterious \\"running boy\\". Bizarre at best, bad propaganda at worst."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot has language problems for an elementary-age book. And the subject matter is filled with EPA rhetoric. Stay clear.I'm just glad I read this before I let my 5th grader read this junk. As I write this, I'm only 1/2 way through but will finish...even if it bores me to death. Don't waste your money. And save some trees by not buying this book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Though written for a younger audience, (and nowhere was this evident when I bought it), Carl Hiaasen's newest fiction dispenses with the outrageously funny characters that first brought him to the attention of National Public Radio and thus to me: the former governor of Florida who now lived on roadkill and dashed into highway traffic in a bright yellow slicker to retrieve his dinner or the towering former biker bar bouncer who lost an arm to a barracuda and now sported an implanted weed wacker in its place.His passion for the disappearing Florida flora and fauna is still the underlying subject of this book, but without the vividly drawn characters, this is populated with two-dimensional figures in a Carl Hiaasen-meets -the -Hardy Boys novel."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I love Hiaasen's fiction. I was excited to know he was coming out with a book aimed at a younger audience so I could share him with my 12 year old, Sam not being quite ready for the likes of \\"Tourist Season\\". He and I read it together. Half way through he was begging me to put it down and start another book. I kept telling him we needed to keep going since I knew there would be a hilarious ending. Well, there wasn't. The book was boring, and the attempts at the Hiaasen humor didn't translate to this level of readership. The characters were not nearly as colorful as in his adult books. Bottom line-it just wasn't funny."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"What an offensive book depicting ecological terrorism and crime masquerading as righteous activities by children! ELF (listed by the FBI as an American terrorist organization accused of vandalizing millions of dollars worth of private property) would be proud. In the book, parents are clueless but well-meaning, school officials are inept, corporations are greedy and employees stupid, politicans are corrupt, and vandalism to property is condoned, all depicted through the eyes, of course, of an innocent child. This book does not belong on anybody's reading list - unless, of course, you belong to that part of the population who thinks capitalism, private property and profits are dirty words."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I bought this book for my 11 year old nephew, but fortunately I read it before I gave it to him. To quote \\"Roy\\" (the main character): \\"What a crock!\\" Here we have the all-too-common theme of the Eeeeevil \\"Big Corporation,\\" out to rape the land and kill the tiny little creatures (as well as sell those horrible coronary artery killers known as pancakes. See how Eeeeevil they are?) We have the courageous kids, so much smarter than the dim adults and so much less corrupted by the gross avarice that drives adults to kill baby (GASP!) owls in order to make (YUCK!) money. We have (SOUND OF TRUMPETS) the Environmental Protection Agency, wielding that most sacred of modern scriptures, the (HOORAY!) Environmental Impact Statement. I will concede that most pre-teens may not know the reality of things like the Klamuth Falls water debacle, in which a thousand farmers went into financial ruin because of environmental hysteria. However, my young nephew has parents who own their own business and who are proud we live in a country that protects private property and personal effort. So I threw \\"Hoot\\" in the trash and went out and got my nephew 3 books: Biographies of Daniel Boone, Thomas Edison, and George Washington Carver. I will never buy a child a book that I haven't read myself again."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I hated the book Hoot. Roy was the new kid. Dana was the bully. Beatrice was the other bully. I didn't like it, but I recommend the book for others. Overall, I don't like the book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":":[ Hoot was a blad and pathetic story about a book named Roy. Do Not Read it will save you the horror. Read other books like Warrior Cats."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot was a wierd book that had a lot of events that didn't lead to the ending. While Roy is trying to save the owls from Mother Paula's, Mullet Fingers is getting confused with the camers and doesn't gat any evidence.

At first I chose walk 2 moons but then I heard we were gonna read that in 8th grade , so I chose Hoot instead. It was so GREAT! Now I want to read Flush because of the reviews. 5 STARS WOW! How come Hoot only got 4 1/2?"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hiaasen has made a name for himself writing wacky adult crime novels which hit home on the troubles of the Florida eco-system. With Hoot, he brings some wacky, messed-up bad guys bent on destroying the environment into the life of middle school \\"new kid\\" Roy Eberhardt. This is a great book for younger readers (it is not YA fiction--it is more appropriate to age 12 or 13 maximum), especially because it shows how one kid doing what he believes in can make an impression in the adult world. Fun reading, great environmental themes, fantastic overall message. What a hoot!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought it was a very, very good book!! Read it is a good and funny."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Before I read this book, I read this talented author's second \\"environmental\\" book. What I enjoyed about FLUSH is that he takes a serious subject (environment) and teaches children about it with such wonderful, likable characters they don't even know they're learning. AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HOOT TOO. No preaching! How clever of this author.The characters were likable ... all except the bully; the plot moved at an exciting pace; the dialogue was sassy; and the setting (Florida) was perfect for this book.I'm not a died-in-the-wool environmentalist; I believe in development and believe both have their places in this world. Both are needed. Unlike the developers in this book, most developers are very decent, caring people who believe in saving the environment too. Most work in harmony with the environmentalists.Mr. Hiaasen brought the issues of development vs. environment to light in a witty story that is educational too."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is set in contemporary Florida where developers are forcing the last remaining pieces of the countryside into civilization, wiping out all natural habitat in their wake. If it wasn't for our heroes, Roy and Mullet Fingers, that is. The book is a story of their adventures to stop Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House from opening their 469th franchise as it would require bulldozering the dens of an endangered owl species.The focus of the book is Roy Eberhardt, who just moved from Montana and is adjusting to his new environment quickly. In the course of the book he locks horns with the school bully and gets involved in environmental activism. Indeed, as one reviewer noted earlier, the bad guys in this novel are corporations without a conscience who don't mind running afoul of the law. To this extent, this is a \\"leftist\\" novel.Yet, the different strategies chosen by Roy and Mullet Fingers do not allow this conclusion. While Mullet Fingers is from a messed-up lower-middle class home who resorts to \\"vandalism,\\" Roy is from a nice middle-class family who works within the boundaries of the law. Towards the middle of the novel an interesting conversation takes place between Roy and his parents about the way the world works. Roy finds out that owls don't own property, therefore, they have no right to their habitat. If the novel ended with a diatribe about the evils of private property, it would be a leftist novel. Instead, it ends with SUCCESSFULLY setting environmental regulations against corporate greed, which is a mainstream liberal stance.Perhaps one more thing about the novel's political stance. Hoot is fundamentally a boys' novel. Roy is the moral center of the book and his defining friendship with Mullet Fingers is of primary importance. The women in the book embody appropriate and inappropriate gender roles: Roy's mom is meek, kind, has no skills outside the home and is deferential to her husband. The family is happy. Mullet Fingers' mom is cold-hearted, loud, overbearing and hungry for the limelight. The family is a mess. The only sympathetic female character is Beatrice, Mullet Fingers' stepsister, who is physically strong and fearsome, but has little personality and plays practically no part in the action. On the other hand, she has some of the best lines. Towards the end of the novel when all the town dignitaries show up for the groundbreaking ceremony along with the Vice President of Mother Paula's and a C list celebrity, Beatrice comments: \\"These people ... need a life.\\" :)Hoot is entertaining, full of adventure and, because of its political stance, raises interesting questions that are worth discussing with your kids."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I thought that HOOT by Carl Hiaasen was and excellent book! It was full of adventure and it was an interesting topic that I would have never thought of. I thought that Mullet Fingers was a great character. He was my favorite. HOOT is a book about a boy named Roy. Roy faces a bully named Dana, who tries to punch him a lot. One day, on his way home from school, Roy sees a barefoot boy running. Roy is curious about this boy and tries to follow him, but the boy is too fast. So the next day Roy goes to where the boy went. It turnes out to be a cave in the ground. Eventually Roy becomes friends with Mullet Fingers, the barefoot boy. Together, Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice, a girl who Roy meets, try to save owls who live where a new Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House is being built. There are many vandalisms and the police get frustrated. Read this book to find out what happens. I recomment this book to kids ages 10-13. I liked this book because it had adventure. It also had an interesting topic. I couldn't put it down. Read HOOT and you won't be able to put it down either!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I purchased this book for my 10 year old animal loving son. The idea of endangered owls hooked me. I decided to pre-read the book to make sure it was appropriate for him to read. There isn't anything offensive in the book, but I thought it was kind of dull. I can't imagine my son enjoying this book. In addtion, I can't imagine my 8 year old daughter ever finding it enjoyable either. The very beginning is kind of intriguing, but after that it seems very predictable."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"It makes sense and make me loud out loud which I really did. The way the author talked can make you easily put yourself into that situation, it grabs your attention. It was a book that also have a hidden message that we should notice. It happened on the main character Mullet, his family issues will ruin his life if there are still no one help him... It made me thought a lot about that... There're lots of kids in our society live like that, it was our responsible too!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! My favorite character was Beatrice because she was tough and she stood up for what she believed in. She took care of Roy when he was always in a bad situation. Beatrice didn't like her step mom so I thought it was funny when Beatrice bit the ring off Lonna's toe.I think its great that kids of their age respect nature and the environment.This is a great book and kept my interest until the end."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I love this book, my teacher Ms. Smith read it to us during our Language Arts class. We enjoyed the book, learned a lot of new vocabulary words, and learned how to even saved an endangered species.My teacher made us research, burroing owls and what has happened to them. A picture of a newly hatched burrowing owl came out in the Miami-Herald yesterday and we learned that these little creature truly do exist and need our help.I would recommend this book to anyone in middle school and wants to learn how to preserve a species, to prevent being bullied at school, but most of all to make right choices when opportunities comes your way.It also helps I live in Hiaasen country and get to read Mr. Hiaasen's columns in the Miami-Herald!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I most definitely recommend Hoot to anyone that wants an inspiring book to sit down and read. Hoot is written in a literary style much like Louis Sachar's award winner, Holes. In Hoot, the bullying problems of Roy, and the controversy of small owls on a construction site are told separately until a mysterious boy, \\"Mullet Fingers,\\" brings the two stories together. Hoot keeps you on the edge of your seat; you won't want to put it down.I would not recommend the story to anyone that is sensitive to bullying and curse words. I believe the profanities in Hoot are the only words that can express the true meaning of the bullying. I was drawn to read Hoot from a censorship controversy in my school.Hoot is ideal for middle school aged students. All in all, Hoot is witty and entertaining. Five stars for Hoot!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"This is an excellent book for your vacations because you can leave the book whenever you want and take it back when you don't have anything else to do, this book is not a page turner but if you start it you will end it.The messages of the book are very nice and you and your children can learn something about the book. As all the books of CH is easy and fast to read, it will keep you interested in the story of the owls and the new restaurant that other people want to build in that space."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read \\"Hoot\\" which I thought was a good book.

I wonder why??? read this and you'll find out!!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"WOW! This is a great book that kept me intrigued and wouldn't let me put the book down. If you think about it, the plot is odd, and when I first read the inside cover I thought it was going to be a forceful read. Fortunately, I read it anyway b/c it was a Xmas gift and I didn't want the people who gave it to me to feel bad. :) Anyway, I reluctantly read it, and was surprisingly VERY pleased with the story. From the reviews I've read, it sounds like the children (like me) like it more than the adults. Maybe I'll get my parents' or grandparents' opinions...?AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO READING THE SHORT AND TO THE POINT REVIEWS, IN A FEW WORDS, IT'S A GREAT BOOK, ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS, AND I'D RECOMMEND IT FOR >ANY&lt; AGE GROUP! :)"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I chose this book because it sounded awesome by the information in the book.I also chose this book because Carl Hiassen is one of my favorite author eventhough he writes adult books.I think that alot of people should read this book because once you start reading it you get hooked into it real bad.So for all you people who read my review I would personally read it or give it a try."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I'm in middle school and I loved this book. I ALWAYS judge books by their covers and I was right to think that this one would be interesting. It doesn't really foucus on the plot but on the characters.

This book was also funny. For example, when Roy mooned Dana and Dana started chasing after him. He couldn't catch up because wasn't fit enough.. Roy's life is sort of like mine in many ways. One way that he is like me is how he is always interested in finding out about instances. These reasons make this story a great read. I loved this book and I hope others will read it."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"My sister & I love Hiaasen's adult books so when he wrote a kids' book I had to get it for my own daughters (ages 11 & 10). I read it first & devoured it in one sitting. Then my girls both started reading the book & actually fought over who would get to finish it first. I think Roy, the main character, is a kid almost anyone can find a reason to admire.\\"Hoot\\" has Hiaasen's characteristic environmental thread, cast of unusual characters, & distinctive humor (all toned way down, though). What I really like about Hiaasen's books in general is that, while there are usually positive outcomes in his stories, not everything is neatly wrapped up at the end & everyone doesn't necessarily live happily ever after. Also that his 'heroes' are sometimes as messed up as the 'bad guys'; or at least they're 'average' & not perfect.To be honest, I wouldn't mind if more kids (& adults!) were like Roy & looked past their own four walls, stood up for what they believed in, & tried to make a difference in their communities. Roy saw that the developers of a new franchise were breaking the law by building on the habitat of miniature owls (the developers had, \\"officially speaking\\", never seen any owls, of course). And though, to adults, the book's ending may be too tidy & predictable, I think the book as a whole has good & empowering messages for kids."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiassen created a story that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. The book has a variety of characters that are relatable to many personalities and children should connect with the story easily. My favorite animal is the owl so I fell in love with the cover right away. I enjoyed this book more due to the fact that it was based around an owl and its relationship with the main character.

A misfit policeman named Officer Delinko, browbeaten Mother Paula's Pancake House construction foreman named Curly, and the bully (Dana Matherson) round out the rest of the primary cast of characters. Officer Delinko investigates ongoing acts of vandalism at the future Mother Paula's Pancake House site, where, readers learn, burrowing owls are about to become collateral damage to the restaurant's construction. With a little help from the adults, which younger readers will undoubtedly appreciate being portrayed more often than not as inept (Officer Delinko, Leroy Branitt, Miss Hennepin) or heartless (Chuck Muckle, Lonna), Roy figures out what is really going on and does everything within his power to help his newfound friends save the owls. For those who can get past the over-the-top portrayal of the adult characters, Hoot is a neat story that touches upon several interesting topics, including: environmentalism, family relationships, bullying and friendship.

It wasn't his strongly pro-environment stance (present and in a version that everyone can relate to, even adult readers who were ready for an example of Florida's problems that doesn't involve draining the Everglades, as serious of an issue as that is) nor his eye for detail (a hair on the lip of a middle school vice-principal ranks up there with one of the classic Hiaasen bits of all time), but his characters.In every other Hiaasen novel, there is at least one hilariously odd character who helps break up the seriousness of the work by their misguided insanity, whether it's the hit man commiting murder for plastic surgery in \\"Skin Graft,\\" the hapless Hooters-besotted would-be white supremacists in \\"Lucky You\\" or any of the rock industry hangers-on in \\"Basket Case.\\"While these characters traditionally help break up the sometimes instense stories, they're also one of the places where Hiaasen's manic sense of humor gets a chance to shine. Without it being present in \\"Hoot,\\" the book feels like the author (or maybe an editor) was holding him back. And as a result, the various non-kid characters seem somewhat depressingly pathetic. (Honestly, do we need more than two adults who are about to lose their jobs, when one of them is a perfectly nice individual who's just stuck in the middle of this chaos?)Which isn't to say that \\"Hoot\\" isn't a good book -- it's a great one, one that pre-teens and up will enjoy (although there might be a few parents who take issue with the single swear word and Hiaasen's strongly anti-authority stance) and one that long time Hiaasen novels will find well worth picking up.I especially look forward to Hiaasen's next work of fiction -- one could almost feel his creative juices being recharged by doing this somewhat different sort of novel. While his usual rogue environmentalist, Skink, has gotten very tired, he creates a kid-appropriate substitute in \\"Hoot,\\" and makes him the central focus of the story. I hope we'll see more of Mullet Fingers and the Eberhardts in his adult novels.Recommended for Hiaasen fans and for readers 12 and up."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is a book made for anyone! It tells me what the plot is and what the kids do to try to help save the baby owls. This is so cool! I rate it as a 5-star book!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"HootBy: Carl Hiaasen292 pagesI really enjoyed reading this book. This book was about a boy named Roy Eberhardt who is a new kid who has just moved from the beautiful Montana to the swampy Area of Miami. Roy has made to friends Mullet Fingers, who is a boy who loves to get into trouble and loves animals and tries to save them in this book. Roy's other friend is Mullet Finger's stepsister Beatrice Leep. She is a very strong girl who plays soccer and is not the type that someone would want to mess with.While Roy was being beat up by his worst nightmare, Dana Matherson he sees a strange boy running along side the bus. He thought that he was trying to catch up to the bus but the boy was wearing no shoes or any backpack. When the bus stopped the boy just kept on running. This book soon turns into a mystery when you have to think of this Beatrice's brother is going to do the Pancake house lot next. Roy more towards the end of the book figures out why this boy is doing all of the vandalisms to the Mother Paula's Pancake House.My favorite part is when Roy first meets Mullet fingers in the woods and he threatened Roy with very poisonous snakes. This was my favorite part because this is when Roy actually comes face to face with the strange running boy who runs alongside Roy's bus sometimes.This book is like no other book that I have ever read. I can't compare it to any other book. I would say that this book is really funny at times and sort of a mystery to find out what Mullet Fingers is planning to do next.This book really made me fell like I was there and by reading this book I was helping Mullet Fingers help save the owls.

While I was reading it I was thinking it's okay, that's interesting, hmmm, aha, oh, ect. But what I never thought was wow!, cool, haha, weird, oh no! and so on. I felt like the author lacked passion, the comedy was juvenile, and the drama unrealistic. When I was done reading I was actually a little relieved it was over! That has never happened to me before. So read the book if you are a great Hiaasen fan, or 8 and under, but otherwise set the book down; walk away with your hands raised; and forget about the whole crazy idea of reading it. Cause honestly, it just ain't too special."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Carl Hiaasen forges into new territory: The kid book realm. Cleaned up and devoid of ... violence or much profanity, he makes a cute, quirky book that isn't limited to just kids. If anything, Mr. Hiaasen's literary gifts are more pronounced when there are no seedy elements to distract the readers.Roy Eberhardt recently moved from beautiful Montana to the swampy mishmash of Miami, and he's not thrilled about the change. He misses his old home, and the biggest, meanest bully of all, Dana Matherson, has taken a dislike to him. But on the bus, Roy catches a glimpse of a barefoot kid racing down the sidewalk. When he sees the boy a second time, he punches out Dana and pursues the kid (called Mullet Fingers, for a reason that will become evident late in the book).A mystery vandal is sabotaging the site of a future pancake restaurant, pulling up stakes, sprat-painting a cop car, and setting loose a bunch of glittery cottonmouths. Things don't improve when Roy encounters the boy's sister, Beatrice, a very tall jock with muscles and teeth of steel. Beatrice warns Roy to stay away from Mullet Fingers, but Roy is already quite involved. Mullet Fingers is on a one-boy campaign to save the tiny burrowing owls that live in the construction site -- and will be buried alive in their burrows when the construction begins. Roy begins walking the line between law and outlaw, right and wrong, trying to save Mullet Fingers and the tiny owls.Roy is the kind of kid that readers love instantly -- he's a quiet Charlie Brown who comes out of his shell for a good cause. (And he moons Dana) Mullet Fingers is a little harder to pin down, a strangely but that seems to be Hiaasen's intent. Beatrice is half-hilarious, half menacing -- the scene where she bites off part of Roy's bike tire is a scream. Dana is a pain in the backside, and readers will laugh and rejoice at his comeuppance. And Hiaasen outdoes himself with Roy's parents. He doesn't make them stupid, condescending or obtuse, but rather they trust in the big corporations a bit too much. And one of the most touching elements of this book is that Roy asks his parents for their advice, and protects his kindly mother from the knowledge of how Mullet Fingers' own mother despises him.Unlike many other adult authors who write a book for kids, Hiaasen doesn't dumb it down. He seems to have faith that his kiddie readers can handle tales of corporate double-dealing, enviromental mandayes, and paperwork that most people never have to think about. Kooky elements like a B-movie actress, an ambitious if well-meaning cop (the one whose car was painted), a baby alligator in a porta-john and a bunch of sparkling cottonmouths with taped mouths add an element of surreality to the book.\\"Hoot\\" is a hoot, but it's also a charmingly serious novel. Kids will like Roy and the effective but realistic tactics he uses for the owls, and adults will like the thought-provoking storyline and quirky humor. A keeper."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I love Hiaasen's novels about Florida and all of the zany characters he creates to tell his pro-ecology stories. When I saw he had written another one I reflexivly one clicked to have it sent to me. When I got it I thought it was a tad smaller in size than the usual novel one buys in hardcover and the print seemed to be a little large, but no matter as I dove into the saga of Roy Eberhardt.I was perhaps a couple of chapters into the book when I noticed on the fly leaf that it was a Children's Book of the Month Club selection. Really? Well, I was enjoying and as I continued to read through it I continued to be drawn along with the story of the new boy from Montana being introduced to both the beauty of Florida and it's not so beautiful experiences with developers.In this story the guys in black work for a Pancake House conglomerate called, Mother Paula's All American Pancake House. They intend to open their 469th family style restaurant on a piece of property in Coconut Grove. The fences are up. The construction trailer is on the site. The bulldozers have arrived. All appears to be ready for construction to begin. Then things start to happen. First all the survey markers are pulled up and all the stake holes are filled in.The air is let out of the construction vehiles tires. Alligators (small ones) are put in the out house toilets. No work is being done. The date for a grand opening is approaching. Who is doing this and why are no mystery to the reader, but they are a serious question to the construction foreman, Curly, police officer Delinko and Curly's boss at headquarters, Chuck Muckle. Of course, Mother Paula's is about to be constructed on land on which there a bunch of burrowing owls. Mother Paula's people know it. No one else does until a very unusual \\"hero\\" sets in motion a wonderful string of events which leads to a predictable but very humorous conclusion.It may have been written for children, but what the heck - we are all kids at heart."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I loved this book! What a fun read! This is a book which will appeal to all ages. As a fifth grade teacher I can't wait to read it to my kids. I know that many of them will identify with the main character. This definitely ranks as one of my all-time favorites right after Harry Potter and Holes. I anxiously await Mr. Hiaasen's next children's book."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Being a fan of Mr. Hiaasen's wonderfully twisted, weird fiction for adults, I was intrigued by the idea of him writing for a younger audience. Would there be a crazed, hulking idiot with a dead pit bull hanging off his arm? A roadkill-eating former governor? How would he present his somewhere-between-amused-and-disgusted attitude toward humanity in a manner palatable to kids?I'm happy to report that HOOT is funny, well written, and enjoyable, even for a depraved old lady like me. The plot concerns Roy Eberhardt, an intelligent, resourceful middle-school student who has just moved to Florida from Montana. He misses the mountains and wilderness of Montana. As a kid who has moved a lot, he's not surprised to be the victim of bully Dana Matherson. While being pummeled by Dana on the school bus, Roy spies a kid running along the sidewalk, a kid with no backpack and no shoes. Intrigued, he sets out to find him and gets involved up to his eyeballs in the strange kid's guerilla tactics to save a particular street corner from its fate as the future site of another Mother Paula's All-American Pancake. The adults seem to be ignoring the burrows of tiny owls that will be buried by the bulldozing equipment any day now. Roy's parents explain that it surely is a shame about the owls, but the company must have filed all of the papers and received all of the necessary permits. But Roy and his new friends --- Mullet Fingers, the outlaw boy, and Beatrice, his tough, soccer playing stepsister --- are not about to take the destruction of the owls' burrows lying down. Along the way they outwit Officer Delinko, the ambitious cop who tries to protect the site, and Curly, the foreman who's responsible for getting the job started.Roy's parents are thoughtful and very caring. Roy shields his tenderhearted Mom from the fact that Mullet Fingers lives in the woods and at the dump because his own mother doesn't want him. That's probably the most brutal aspect of the novel, unless perhaps it's the dishonesty of the Mother Paula's corporation in attempting to deny the existence of the endangered owls. Mr. and Mrs. Eberhardt worry about Roy and advise him, but ultimately, Roy figures out a successful plan on his own.The book carries us along with a pleasing suspense and steady pace. The author provides neat encapsulations of each character's motivations that are often missing from adult fiction. (Presumably we can work it out for ourselves.) While it might be missing the extreme characters and profanity of his adult novels, HOOT still reflects Mr. Hiaasen's usual indignation over the rape of his native Florida. Roy is an appealing character, one who may very well inspire young readers to question authority when necessary and act to protect the environment. How subversive is that? Kids of all ages should love it.--- Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman Nicol"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"As a third grade teacher I am always looking for books that not only entertain but teach a lesson. HOOT does both! My students enjoyed the story and learned about burrowing owls at the same time. They also saw the negativity of being a bully. Two lessons for the price of one. A downside for children in the eight-nine year old range was the use of a few inappropriate words. I look forward to reading this book again next year."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I am a big fan of Carl Hiaasen's columns and his off-the-wall novels, which focus on life in my old stomping grounds of South Florida. In interviews he has given, Mr. Hiaasen has said that he wanted to write a book that his kids could read as his adult works can be extremely crude and disturbing (although they are hilarious).With \\"Hoot\\", I think he has made a very good first effort in the kids genre. The story line of Roy, the kid who has had to move all over the country on account of his faher's job hit pretty close to home to me as I was in the same situation growing up. Hiaasen perfectly captures the frustrations of being picked on and unaccepted as a child. His encounters with Dana, the bully are great as Roy always has a way to win out.Roy becomes curious about a boy he sees running barefoot and after a while he learns about the boy, know as Mullet Fingers. This character comes off as a kid version of Hiaasen's infamous Skink from his novels Stormy Weather, Native Tongue and Sick Puppy. Mullet Fingers is a junior environmental terrorist who tries to sabotage a construction site which contains burrowing owls, which will be wiped out when the bulldozers roll. Roy learns all he can about the owls and the two, along with Mullet Fingers' stepsister, devise an interesting plan to stop the construction.This is a great book for the early teenager, but I think his adult fans might get a kick out of it. There's no weed-wacker prostetics in this one or people who juggle skulls, but a fairly straight-forward story that has a message."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Finally I've found a book I think my teen-age nephew may actually read and enjoy, other than the Harry Potter series. Hiaasen is always hilarious, poking fun at those who deserve it most, and now he's put his talents to work for younger readers. I'm in my 30s and loved it and it was passed on to me by a colleague in her 50s who loved it. I figure it's a good read for anyone from eight on up. It's a fun book with a message, but it never gets preachy. Parents might also be interested to know that it shows a very loving and respectful relationship between the middle-school hero and his mother and father. Other parents in the book - - as in life - - definitely have their faults, and this kid can see how lucky he is."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"If you are into mystries, nature, and aren't afraid to try a little something different then this is a perfect book for you! This book is one of my favorites of all time!It is about a young boy, Roy who teams up with Beatrice and Mullet Fingers to stop a pancake house company from killing owls living on their construction site! It is a great adventure! I absolutely recommend it to people of all ages! Fabulous!!! You'll LOVE it!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hiaasen takes a while to get into the kid lit groove. The first third of the book seems a bit confused, as Hiaasen fights his urge to steer his characters into his usual adults-only mayhem. He fashions a protagonist who is unreasonably precocious and spends too much time setting up adult characters.And then, when Roy's mother has a bed-time heart-to-heart with her son, Hiaasen finds his groove. The rest of the book flies (pardon the pun) as Hiaasen finds the right balance of madcap action for the \\"tween\\" reader.Adults who are put off by profanity will find this an appropriate introduction to Hiaasen's sly humor and progressive outlook. And kids who can make it through the first third of the book will find their reward in a heart-warming and hilarious epilogue.If you read \\"The Lorax\\" to your children as toddlers, give them \\"Hoot\\" when they start reading novels. They'll love it."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I loved Hoot! I am the mom of a sixth grader, who was required to read this book for school. I read most of her books, because I love good material.

The book is about a boy named Roy Eberhardt whose Father was a important political person who was always being promoted and had to be relocated because of it. Roy however doesn't like moving to Florida when his father got relocated for the sixth time since Roy had started going to school. \\"Disney land is an armpit\\" he said when he got the news from his parents. When he got to Florida, everything was basically the same as everywhere else, the bullies were mean, the classes were boring and every thing was basically routine: get bullied on the school bus on the way to school, have boring classes, get bullied on the way back home on the school bus. But one day when he was getting his normal bullying on the way to school, he sees a strange boy running alongside the school bus and didn't get on it. The next day he got off the school bus when he saw the boy and followed him.He later finds out that the boy is a run-away boy who is just trying to help some poor defenseless owls (that's where the title comes in) that about to lose their homes because Mothers Paula's All- American Pancake House wanted to build on their burrows. Roy joins him in his quest to give the owls their home back and never finds out the boy's real name until the very endI liked it alot because the book really made you get mad at Mother Paula's.Definetly buy this book or buy it as a gift!!!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read it for a school project and it was great.

It made me be happy and it made me laugh a lot. I live in the state of Florida so I know what he means by hot summer days.My favorite part of this book is when Officer Delinko's patrol car gets spray painted by the vandal, which is Mullet Fingers or should I say Napoleon Bridger Leep. It was funny when Officer Delinko falls asleep and when he wakes up sees his patrol car windows are spray painted black. Officer Delinko thought it was early in the morning, but it was really nine thirty. I laughed my head off in this part. Another part I liked was the part that Roy mooned Dana and Dana got real mad and chased Roy about three blocks.My favorite character was Beatrice. She seemed so tough, but she cared about the owls. She really didn't like her step mom so I laughed when Beatrice bit the ring off Lonna's toe.With this book I learned you should take care of your environment and stick up for what you think is right! This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I just read \\"Hoot\\" because my little brother had it lying around as part of his summer reading list. I actually read three of his summer books just because they all sucked me in within the first few pages. I am always disturbed when I hear people, adults and children alike, state that they hate to read. I wonder how anybody can hate to read when there are books like \\"Hoot\\". I immediately fell in love with Roy, the small, bullied kid who has such a great outlook on life. Maybe if more children read about a kid who was being pushed around but saw that he could endure and still be a productive individual, more people would come out in this world and feel as though they can contribute and are worth something to society.

I enjoyed the way he cleverly introduced his characters so that you would want to keep reading to find out what they would do next. I also enjoyed this book because it was very unique in its plot. I have never read a book like this one! It showed much creativity and wit.I would give this 4 stars because I enjoyed reading it and never wanted to put the book down.

He is a brave boy who becomes happy to make friends and for being of help to the environment. Hoot is a perfect book for anyone looking for a silly story that has a hysterical plot, and will leave them laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I read Flush and found it to be a fun read. Hoot is not a fun read and has little redeeming value: Mushy, ineffective parents who are in denial, a \\"protagonist\\" who lies whenever he can to manipulate the 'bad' guys, lies to bumbling police, lies to all parents and teachers and lies to the hospital -anywhere that the end justifies the means. All the adults are inept and the 'juvie' bad guy 'deserves' to be framed. Roy, the main character, is a snot - his parents are 'proud' of him- oh please!! enough already of people not being responsible for who they are! This book is a dud. There is nothing 'cute' or 'redeeming' about the deceit."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"I already don't like language that is not appropriate for adults to speak and so much more when a child speaks obsenities. I bought this book for my children after watching the movie. It was very disappointing as far as having to listen to foul language. We would have liked it without it!"},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Hoot is about Roy, a boy who is new in a small town in Florida and the adventure he discovers by simply chasing after a strange barefooted boy he sees running past the school bus one morning. There are the new-kid-in-school scenarios, the bully, a mystery about the strange barefooted boy, and eventually it all leads to Roy discovering a coverup involving a construction zone for a new pancake house and some endangered owls.While the story is unique and has very good intentions, I personally had trouble feeling invovled in it. I liked the main character, Roy, and pretty much all of his school-aged friends. What bothered me the most were the depictions of the adults in the story. From the extremely dim-witted, somewhat annoying policeman, Delinko, to the ill tempered, ignorant construction foreman, Curly, I struggled to read through sections in their (limited omnscient) point of view. Roy's parents were decent, but even they at times were hard to believe. Maybe kids wouldn't pick up on these things, but I do wonder about it. I personally wish the book had been solely from Roy's (limited omnsicient) perspective, or perhaps some of his peers, such as Beatrice and Mullet Fingers, rather than Officer Delinko and Curly. A good book for raising kids' awareness and ways to combat/protest illegal corporate environmental destruction and endangerment of native animal species, even if some of the story and characters are hard to believe."},{"Title":"Hoot","review":"Have you ever had to lie about your name? Roy did when a vicious snake bit Mullet Fingers, a runaway kid, while he was trying to save the owls. Roy had to give his name to the nurse because if Mullet Fingers gave his name she would call his horrible abusive mother. Then he would have to live with her again.This story involves three kids: Roy, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice, who try to save the owls that live in underground burrows. They have to sneak out at night, plant traps, and face the police and their parents. The town wants to put a Pancake House over those burrows. Pancake House or Owls? They go through a lot to try and make these defenseless owls safe.I would recommend this book to both boys and girls. I really liked this amazing book because it reveals true friendship and you see if the kids have enough bravery to save these owls. Carl Hiaasen's writing is very descriptive and has received numerous incredible awards including the Newbury Honor Award. I really loved this book and I think that you would too.I.

Never had a philosopher help such weapons wherewith to bind the princes of this world. How the crowds of the European capitals presses about the carriage of the President! With what curiosity, anxiety, and hope we sought a glimpse of the features and bearing of the man of destiny who, coming from the West, was to bring healing to the wounds of the ancient parent of this civilization and lay for us the foundations and the future\\"Alas, this was not to be. American idealism, French quest for security and British distaste for alliances and hypocrisy created an unworkable solution. Soul of the treaty was sacrificed to placate domestic political process, and as the result put Germany in the position of defiance and economic insolvency; the position which at the bottom drew sympathy from the former Allies and as the result contributed to brutality of the second conflict.Keynes draws a picture of pan-European economy which was destroyed by the treaty and rightfully predicted that not only Germany will not be able to pay, but will be obligated to pursue the expansionist policy at the expense of her weak Eastern neighbors. Treaty did not contain any positive economic programme for rehabilitation of the economic life of Central powers and Russia. One just could not disrupt the economic position of the greatest European land power, at the same time strengthening it geo-politically and suffer no horrible retribution. \\"\\"The Peace Treaty of Versailles: This is not Peace. It is an Armisticefor twenty years.\\" - said Foch about such a agreement."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"Though I don't condone the behavior of the Nazis I can now understand how it became possible - by the overpunishment of the Germans by the Versailles Treaty.Keynes style may be a little awkward today, 40 years later, but I found it much more lively than expected. His description of Wilson is withering.Complaint - my copy of this printing cuts off the footnotes on the bottom of any page that extends to the next page. Very amateurish!"},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace always feels like it's going to get dragged down by statistics, but it rarely does. Indeed it's one of the best presentations of a heavily numerical argument in plain English that I've seen.Keynes wants to convince us, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Germany will never be able to pay the reparations demanded of it. Accordingly, the middle 70% of the book is a detailed accounting of Germany's exports, imports, and internal health. Among many other findings, Keynes shows that Germany couldn't possibly pay the reparations without giving up most every creature comfort -- down to coffee and tobacco. And as for its exports, allowing Germany to wither economically would drag down the rest of Europe with it.Keynes dispenses with that middle 70% as clearly and briskly as he can, as support for the moral argument. In large part, Germany cannot pull itself out of the hell it's in until its people have some confidence in the future -- until, in effect, they stop hoarding their bread under the mattress and start eating it instead.Keynes explores this from an angle I hadn't thought of before. In essence, his point is that fears about the future change the world as it is &lt;em>today&lt;/em>: why would you sign a long-term contract denominated in marks if you believed the marks would be valueless in a year? Under the circumstances, the honorable thing would be to refuse to do business with anything but German businesses. Before you can conduct foreign trade, you need currency stability. And, in turn, how can you expect currency stability when reparations force Germany to hand over nearly all of its gold and silver?This book is an excellent blend of the moral and the statistical, the practical and the hopeful. And it also happens to be a terrific ground-level view of the world immediately after 1919."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"The late James J. Martin remarked that those who did not think that The Versailles Peace Conference did not have anything to do with World War II should read Keynes to correct this false notion. John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)was one of the early \\"revisionists\\" who clearly saw how destructive the Versailles Treat was. He also had insight into the political leaders who forced this Carthaginian peace on the Germans.Keynes was a representative of the British delegation to Versailles in 1919 and soon resigned in protest. He diagnosed the defects of Pres. Woodrow Wilson who was supposedly the most influential man at Versailles. Keynes accurately described Pres. Wilson as a naive Don Quixoti who had no knowledge of European History or basic diplomacy. Wilson was under the illusion that his status would be enough to impose his Fourteen Points and League of Nations on Eureopan leaders who were hard hearted and did not care for such naive idealism. Pres. Wilson was in a den of thieves and was not aware of it. Wilson could not evaluate the situation and was too self righteous to negotiate intelligently. Pres. Wilson thought he would impose the Versailles in the Americans, get the Americans to join the League of Nations, and end sin throughout the world. He obviously failed miserable as events proved. Members of the United States even refused to ratify the Versailles Treaty, and the Americans never did join the League of Nation.Keynes goes into precise detail to explain what the World War I and the Versailles Treaty was doing and would do to those in German and in Central and Eastern Europe. Keynes gave pricise details of malnutrition, lack of medical care, etc. and also gave a precise account of the health effects that deprivation caused these people.Keynes is just as precise in explaining the effects of looting the Germans with a huge reparation bill of $50 billion. If one can account for the increase of inflation between 1919 and now (2006), the bill may be fifty to a hundred times higher. This imposition was placed on Germans who lost their merchant marine fleet, colonies, and territroy. Added to that was the privations of World War I and the cruel blockade of the Germans by the British after hostilities ended.However, Keynes was perceptive enough to know that if the German economy collapsed, eventually the European economies would also collapse. The Germans were advanced in steel production, chemical industries, etc. Prior to World War I, the Euroepans, friends and foes, relied more on German economic production and trade than they willing to admit. In other words, if the German economy collapsed, it was only a matter of time that much of Europe would follow.Keynes wrote this book in 1919, and events in Europe took place as Keynes suggested they would. Those who argue that the \\"allies\\" should have intervened in German earlier that 1939 should realize that the time for interventions was in 1919 when a sensible peace treaty based on negotiations would have muted any German resentment. The laissez-faire and free market lads have blamed Keynes for all the woes in the West since World War I. The fact is Keynes did not create the modern state and the problems that have occured. All he did was view a bad situation and made a reasoned response to it."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"&quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; is a very enlightening book about the attempt at peace for the post World War I era. It focuses mainly on the Treaty of Versailles, and how the Council of Four neglected to solve the most important problems of the world that might have eventually led to peace. First of all, the Treaty did not make provisions for the rehabilitation of Europe, it did nothing to establish good relations between the Central Empires, and failed to adjust the systems of the Old World and the New. After reading this book, I agree with John Keynes' theory and account of the mistakes made by the world's leaders. His call for change and ways to solve the problems are sensible and caused me to think about what might have happened if certain things had been done differently. This book was very educational, but its slow moving and difficult text made it a little hard to follow. However, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the period between World War I and II, because it gives a very detailed, almost firsthand account of what actually happened during the peace conferences, and the economic consequences of those talks of peace."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"I decided to read Keynes not only because he was a great economist, but also because the lessons (that the great man offers in his book) are golden. The lessons Keynes offers - on human nature, economics, geography, polity and society - are worth remembering in a conflict ridden world.For instance, \\"collective animosities\\" that plagued Europe after world war 2 still plague the world today. The tide of nationalism, protectionism is growing stronger. Free trade is under threat. Keynes gives a very strong message \\"When good men fail to act, the consequences are disastrous.\\"Thus, economic aid and empathy with others is more important than imposing sanctions under national pressure. France and Italy, using their temporary victory, imposed a humiliating treaty, inviting \\"... their own destruction also, being so deeply and intricately intertwined with their victims by hidden psychic and economic bonds.\\"Don't make the mistake of reading this book as the one on Treaty of Versailles.

I have studied many accounts of WW II but I am trying to expose myself to WW I and this book does both a great job of explaining what happened to Germany and Europe after WWI.

For a book focused primarily on economic concerns, the text is surprisingly easy to read. However, the book's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness. The principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the founder of 20th century style, gov't & debt driven economics.The book is organized into chapters on pre-war Europe, Allied statesmen, summary of key treaty points, reparations, post-war Europe predictions, and Keynes' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement. Unfortunately, within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason. (Is this indicative of Keynes' own personal organization and logical thinking?)Within the book, he makes a very practical (but politically infeasible) argument for a non-vindictive treaty. He basically suggests that the Allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other Allies, and instead they should settle (though not ideally) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only German gov't property. (Did the German gov't sponsor Keynes' work in writing this book?)Keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the German people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise. There is some logic in this point; however, later on he goes on to state that the US should forgive its $10 billion debt to its wartime allies ($5 billion of which was owed by the UK). Forgive me if I'm wrong, but doesn't such a move disincent American entreprises from entrepreneurship as well. It's extremely hypocritical that the Allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the US during the war and then once it was over to claim that they couldn't pay them. If they didn't want to repay, then they shouldn't have borrowed the money - period. (If I borrow money to buy a home, the bank won't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether I'm out of work, injured, or the house burns down. I don't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment.)Notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic, Keynes does produce a reasonable, brief list of treaty rememdies, especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Not until the advent of the Cold War and the interests of extending American political influence would Keynes' policies largely succeed (albeit yet again to the detriment of American taxpayers).Overall, I felt the book was ok.

Critics still argue over whether Keynes exaggerated the deleterious effects of the treaty on Germany's economy. Some also contend that the account, which was widely read during the 1920s, encouraged both German intransigence to overturning the treaty and Allied acquiescence in allowing it to be overturned -- two key factors in the rise of Hitler and the reconsolidation of German military power before World War II.Keynes' book remains highly readable in many sections. He was not only a brilliant economist, but a superb writer with a keen eye for the foibles of the great men of his time. However, some sections of the text, such as the one dealing with reparations, are abstruse and less suitable to the modern audience. These are still brilliantly told, but unless you are a grad student or a scholar with a particular interest in the many details of Germany's economy in the early part of the century as well as the demands put on it by the treaty, you are not likely to find these sections as gripping as the others.The book must be read by those interested in the Versailles Peace Treaty and the aftermath of its signing. Even today, the power of Keynes' argument is evident. I've just recently finished reading Margaret MacMillan's \\"Paris, 1919,\\" and while I enjoyed the book, I found her arguments against Keynes to be unconvincing. MacMillan says the actual collection of economic claims against Germany was rather modest, less, for example, than Germany collected from France in the aftermath of the 1870 war. But Keynes admitted the allies might not hold Germany to all the economic terms of the treaty. He still felt strongly that many of those terms - whether enforced or not - discouraged sound planning by German investors, companies, and its government, and unnecessarily impoverished the German people. This he felt was bad for not just Germany, but all of Europe."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"Maynard Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace has long been recognized as a classic, and it takes on new significance in light of the recent meltdown on Wall Street. But if you want to buy a copy, you should forget this edition. It appears to have been scanned from an earlier copy, but no effort was made to clean up the text after scanning it. As a result, there are whole sections of gibberish, a mix of characters and symbols that makes no sense whatsoever. Much of the book is literally unreadable."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"Keynes took the opportunity proffered to him in 1919 to voice the fears of many of his fellow countrymen that the treaty recently signed at Versailles stripping Germany of it's colonies, a substantial portion of it's population, all it's overseas concessions, its air force, any place at the League of Nations and an enormous amount in reparations payments to be made over the coming years, was an act of consummate folly that would only lead to future war. He took great pains to point out the folly of the French position at the conference, namely to be as extreme as possible, cognisant of the fact that their claims would be moderated and noted that in several cases where the British and US delegations had no specific interest, provisions were passed 'on the nod' which even the French would not have subscribed to. Keynes was damning about both Clemenceau and Wilson and pointed out that almost everything had been done which 'might impoverish Germany now or obstruct her development in future' and that to demand such colossal reparations without any real notion of whether Germany had the means to pay was foolhardy in the extreme.Keynes book provided a fulcrum for British doubt about the treaty and an avenue for British sympathy with the fledgling German Republic. Keynes made treaty revision a thing of morality and enlightened self interest to avoid 'sowing the decay of the whole of civilised life of Europe'."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"For Keynes, the Peace Treaty of Paris after World War I was a matter of life and death, of starvation and existence, and the fearful convulsions of a dying civilization.But the negotiating politicians had absolutely no vision. Clemenceau wanted a Carthaginian peace, President Wilson was essentially a theologian and Lloyd George yielded to national electoral chicane.The victors had no magnanimity. \`The future life of Europe was not their concern; its means of livelihood was not their anxiety. Their preoccupations related to frontiers and nationalities, to imperial aggrandizements, to the future enfeeblement of a strong and dangerous enemy, to revenge and to the shifting of their unbearable financial burden on to the shoulders of the defeated.But for Keynes, the policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation was abhorrent and detestable: \`Nations are not authorized, by religion or natural morals, to visit on the children of their enemies the misdoings of parents or of rulers.'Keynes had the decency to leave the negotiations from the moment he saw the looming disastrous results.Keynes brilliantly calculated that Germany could not pay the imposed debt. He foresaw the coming German hyperinflation. He clearly recognized the danger of \`a victory of reaction' (the right) in Germany, because it would endanger the security of Europe and the basis of peace.Eventually that's what happened with all its disastrous consequences for Europe.His prediction of millions of dead from starvation in Germany didn't occur.This sometimes rather technical book is still a very worth-while read. His author was a visionary."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"Great British economist John Maynard Keynes second book recounts his assessment of the economic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles, where he was a member of British delegation as an economic expert.Keynes starts with providing a dazzling psychological analysis on how the treaty came to be.\\"When President Wilson left Washinghton he enjoyed a prestige and a moral influence throughout the world unequalled in history ... Never had a philosopher help such weapons wherewith to bind the princes of this world. How the crowds of the European capitals presses about the carriage of the President! With what curiosity, anxiety, and hope we sought a glimpse of the features and bearing of the man of destiny who, coming from the West, was to bring healing to the wounds of the ancient parent of this civilization and lay for us the foundations and the future\\"Alas, this was not to be. American idealism, French quest for security and British distaste for alliances and hypocrisy created an unworkable solution. Soul of the treaty was sacrificed to placate domestic political process, and as the result put Germany in the position of defiance and economic insolvency; the position which at the bottom drew sympathy from the former Allies and as the result contributed to brutality of the second conflict.Keynes draws a picture of pan-European economy which was destroyed by the treaty and rightfully predicted that not only Germany will not be able to pay, but will be obligated to pursue the expansionist policy at the expense of her weak Eastern neighbors. Treaty did not contain any positive economic programme for rehabilitation of the economic life of Central powers and Russia. One just could not disrupt the economic position of the greatest European land power, at the same time strengthening it geo-politically and suffer no horrible retribution. \\"\\"The Peace Treaty of Versailles: This is not Peace.

At the end of 1919 J M Keynes published \`The economic consequences of the peace' . He took great pains to point out the folly of the French position at the conference, namely to be as extreme as possible, cognisant of the fact that their claims would be moderated and noted that in several cases where the British and US delegations had no specific interest, provisions were passed 'on the nod' which even the French would not have subscribed to.

Keynes made treaty revision a thing of morality and enlightened self interest to avoid 'sowing the decay of the whole of civilised life of Europe'."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace was written in 1920 by Keynes, who was not already recognized as the most influential economist of the 20th century, a condition he would only attain when he wrote his famous General Theory some years later, and can be interpreted as a personal outburst against the heads of state of the four countries who participated in the Group of Four (France, Italy, UK and the USA) and decided the fate not only of the defeated countries (Germany and Austria) but also of the whole world, in a way that Keynes was adamantly against and which led to his resignation of his capacity of an important negotiator in the British delegation. One has also to remember that Keynes had always been against the war and lost some important friends in the conflict.The portrait he gives of the different negotiating abilities of French's Clemenceau, United States' president Wilson and British Prime Minister Lloyd George is a devastating picture of the different motives each one of them had at the time: the aim of Clemenceau was to exact revenge to French's traditional enemy and to debilitate Germany as much as possible, thus postponing her return to prosperity and to menace again France. WIlson's, portrayed as a good man but lacking any negotiating feature a man of his stature should have, was a frail man only to save his face in the moral stances he took in his preliminary 14 points Armistice proposal, which led to the initial surrender of the Germans to the Allied forces. The British Lloyd George was only worried about upcoming elections in his country and was playing all the cards (good or bad) he had to save himself from an humiliating defeat to the Liberals.The outcome of it all was a Peace Treaty who despised each and every point of reality, representing a burden Germany would not be able to pay, thus leading to the dismantling of an economic European system that led famine, social disturbance and finally to the World War II.The book is a best-seller ever since and very easy to read and should be also recommended to every one interested in the power broker skills one has to have to succeed (Clemenceau) or fail (Wilson) in negotiation as hard as this one."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"Having read the \\"General Theory\\" many years ago as a student, I decided it was time to read \\"Economic Consequences of the Peace\\". I purchased the Kindle edition, and immediately discovered that there is no introduction by Volcker, as claimed on the Amazon product page. In addition it is more difficult to access the footnotes, which are at the end of each chapter, than in paper versions. Otherwise I was very happy with the Kindle edition.Keynes attended much of the conference and wrote fascinating pen-portraits of the main players - Clemenceau believing in the inevitability of eternal conflict and wanting a Carthaginian Peace; Wilson having high moral principles but insufficient intellect to stand up to Clemenceau; and Lloyd George converted to an ever more oppressive treaty by the need to win an early general election in Britain.In my judgement the key observations Keynes made in this book about the state of Europe in 1919 and about the Versailles Treaty were:1. Not only Germany but also much of Europe (excluding Britain) was in a poor economic condition and would find recovery difficult.2. One particular factor he noted was the existence of inflation and the danger of it continuing, worsening and damaging economies. He said the problem was serious throughout Europe and particularly Germany, which already had a large budget deficit.3. The Treaty contributed nothing towards creating a fair, functioning and integrated economic system in Europe.4. The Treaty breached the terms of the Armistice Agreement in the level of reparations and territorial adjustment, which was morally reprehensible. Germany had not surrendered unconditionally but was treated as though she had.5. Germany could not possibly pay the full amount of reparations on given knowledge and all reasonable assumptions about the immediate economic future. In addition reparations were unfair in that unlike an indemnity the amount was unknown and unknowable.6. The combination of points 4 and 5 (plus the obnoxious and inaccurate \\"war guilt\\" clause) meant that Germany would feel victimized and betrayed, whereas the Treaty should have sought the reconciliation of nations. Keynes predicted a future war.The only point on which one might conceivably say that Keynes was not fully vindicated was the first: much (but not all) of Europe boomed in the 1920s. However, it can be argued that Keynes was not fundamentally wrong even on this issue. Those who believe there were structural weaknesses in the major economies, or who follow the line of the Austrian School in arguing that the Great Depression arose from an expansion of the money supply in the 1920s that artificially inflated the economy with an inevitable slump to follow the boom, will argue Keynes was right about the fragility of European economies.Among the dissenting voices to the view that Keynes was largely correct on almost all issues was &Eacute;tienne Mantoux, who in 1945 wrote \\"The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes\\". Mantoux ignored almost all the six points listed above and concentrated instead on showing that German coal and iron production were higher than Keynes predicted, and that Germany was better off than he supposed. However, Mantoux's figures are all based on the actual inter-war situation, where Germany paid only one-eighth of the reparations and developed with the aid of American loans, whereas Keynes' predictions depended on the Allies squeezing Germany until the pips squeaked. In addition Keynes had stressed that predictions cannot be perfect, and changing circumstances change outcomes.Keynes was correct in his assessment of the effect of reparations and the weakness of Germany in 1919, for when the Allies attempted to extract maximum payments in the years 1919-23 Germany suffered from economic disasters without parallel in a democracy. With a desperate economic situation and unable to pay reparations, Germany suffered the occupation of the Ruhr by the French in January 1923. It meant that Germany had no goods to trade. The result was that Germany resorted to printing (even more) money to repay reparations and loans. This led to hyperinflation. Keynes was also vindicated in his prophecy of inflation elsewhere in Europe by the inflations in Danzig, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Russia. Mantoux's specific points about iron and steel not only ignored the fact that the production was with the aid of US loans and the non-payment of reparations, but also ignored myriad other contrary economic indicators, including not only the 1923 hyperinflation but also the fact that Germany had 30% of its workforce unemployed in 1932.Keynes was correct in saying that the Treaty would not bring peace. A hatred of the Treaty and the oppressive French occupation of the Ruhr helped to undermine the Weimar Republic, bringing Hitler to power and precipitating the Second World War. Keynes played a role in the settlement after the Second World War. His words of wisdom about the failures of the Versailles Treaty were heeded, and principles of cooperation and rebuilding meant a prolonged period of peace and prosperity in Europe after 1945 - a striking contrast to the failure of Versailles to achieve this.Finally, it has been claimed that the book created (or at least encouraged) appeasement in the 1930s by convincing Britain and the US that the Treaty was unfair to Germany. This is impossible to prove. More important in creating sympathy for Germany was the French occupation of the Ruhr 1923-25, and the main causes of appeasement were anyway miscalculation and the desire for a quiet life among people who had lived through the horrors of the 1914-18 war. It should be noted that Keynes was one of the earliest and most passionate opponents of appeasement. On this too Keynes was proved right."},{"Title":"The Economic Consequences of the Peace","review":"How could he have known?

As such, steps for exegesis are presented and explained in a systematic manner. The language used is technical, but not too difficult for one with at least some experience in biblical languages.The book can be divided into three main sections:The first section (pg 5-66) comprises of 2 chapters dealing with the theory and practice of exegesis itself. Chapter 1 deals with the twelve steps that one would engage himself in when examining any Old Testament text. Here he presents the theoretical steps that one would engage in. For each step, the author lists various questions that the exegete would have to ask with regards to text, the contexts, grammar etc. of the passage. These steps are comprehensive, with many sub-points to guide the reader and ensure that he does not leave any stones unturned in the exegetical process. Chapter 2 then gives practical examples from the Old Testament text for each step, briefly demonstrating the process of each.The second section (pg. 67-88) focuses on exegesis with regards to sermon preparation. This was especially helpful, as he skillfully directed the reader to understand what how the technical and often tedious process of exegesis can be applied to weekly sermon preparations on any text. He stressed the need for realizing how the biblical text can apply to the contemporary crowd. He rightly affirmed that without application, the exegetical research and resulting presentation would be but a talk, lecture of lesson.The final section (pg 89-165) is more of a guide to the available materials and resources that would aid an exegete in his work. He gives many helpful comments with regards to the diverse range of books and sets that can be helpful. However, the perspective of the author of this book with regards to the Word of God is that \`there is no single authoritative version of the Old Testament text in existence' (pg. 90). As such, he strongly advocates the need for textual criticism, and discusses its process in detail. The various books and resources that he recommends in the 4th chapter are also all with the rationalistic viewpoint of the great necessity of textual and other forms of criticism.Nonetheless, despite the author's liberal view with regards to the preservation of God's Word and the inerrancy of the OT text, there are still useful suggestions and pointers that he has to give to students of exegesis. The steps are presented in a very logical and systematic step-by-step format, which would aid especially beginners who are new to the process.Therefore in reading this book, one must be discerning, and be able to pick up the pointers and steps that would be helpful. At the same time, the reader must be able to realize that certain steps are unnecessary if one were to subscribe to the view that God's Word is perfect and certain, and that there is no need to question the very words of God."},{"Title":"Old Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors","review":"It's very useful for the process of the exegesis and study of the OT."},{"Title":"Prins-Lock Warriors","review":"I am a great sci-fi fan and also a person who cherishes my faith with a deep sense of God's unconditional love for all of His children.

She ran the first Women's Studies course at the University of Sydney in the early 1970s. I was there at the time and marched in demonstrations in support of feminism.Early feminism was based on a number of earlier theories [invented by men as it turns out], such as Marxism and Liberation Theory.Liberation theory was a theory which explored the way that those in power denigrate, deny, ridicule, minimize and invalidate those without power, and the ways they maintain that power. In the early days, according to Curthoys, feminism was a movement against such power and for those without power.Curthoys argues convincingly that this has now completely reversed and feminism is largely part of the status quo and part of the power elite. This creates a problem. How can a movement against power be part of the elite establishment?This problem is solved by a tricky maneuver which roughly works as follows. They change the conversation from people to ideas. The idea of the masculine is supposedly privileged versus feminine. The fact that men live shorter lives, are more likely to suicide, be murdered, to be the victims of violent crime, more likely to drop out of school or be imprisoned, and have little chance of getting custody of children in a divorce is irrelevant. Patriarchy, the system we all supposedly live under, privileges \\"the male\\".In this way they found a way to distract attention from the contradiction of privileged white females railing against privilege.Apart from this insightful argument, the book is also valuable for its lucid explanation of Liberation Theory.

This reminds me of a lighter version of a John Sanford novel. Not as gritty and not at the same depth, but similar in theme, flow, etc and similar with the ways of small town police departments.

The plot moves along at a rapid but steady tempo. The characters are believable and draw the reader into the story. Friedman also manages to portray the setting of Northeastern Ohio along Interstate 77 so powerfully that it becomes a character in the tale as well.Friedman realistically depicts the frustrations and pettiness of turf battles that play out between small city police departments and county sheriffs as they seek a serial killer that continually jumps jurisdictional lines.All in all, Dead End is a very entertaining crime drama that I highly recommend. The current free price makes it a must read."},{"Title":"Dead End","review":"Without giving away too much of the plot, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which had good character development and a fast-paced plot.

He needed something to occupy his time during his recovery, and elected for a \\"good true-crime\\" book to read. After lengthy looking, he settled on \\"The Onion Field\\" by Joseph Wambaugh, and found it so much to his liking that he immediately requested the movie!"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I hate to give this only three stars, because the book itself is incredible, and incredibly powerful. It's every bit as good as \\"In Cold Blood\\". But the Kindle version is littered with literally hundreds of conversion errors. Here's how these happen: Older books that don't have a digital file already often only have the printing plates or a hardcopy of the book. These are scanned and an OCR (optical character recognition) program converts the scan into text. But sometimes they make a couple of mistakes. In other books, I've put up with a mistake here and there, even though mistakes of that sort would never be released by a reputable publisher in a printed book and I see no reason why the standards should be lower for a digital book.But \\"The Onion Field\\" takes the cake when it comes to these. I started highlighting them because they were so frustrating and distracting, so that Amazon could be alerted to the problem. I'll include 49 of them at the end of the review. But the important thing is that any one of them might be easy to overlook, but ultimately having so many of them takes away from the power of this incredible book. Every couple paragraphs I kept getting pulled out of this very absorbing story to parse some nonsense so I can figure out what I'm supposed to be reading.Is this any way to treat a classic?Anyhow, at this time, I simply cannot recommend the Kindle version of \\"The Onion Field\\". Which is a shame, because I cannot recommend highly enough \\"The Onion Field\\" itself, Wambaugh writes with incredible power. But reading this version, if you didn't know these errors are unintentional and didn't appear in the printed versions, you'd think him a moron. This is a man that deserves better.As promised, here's a sample of 49 of the errors (I removed one so that I wouldn't have to have a swear word in here).

The characters are well sketched."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Put this stinkburger down after 80 pages. I wanted o disembowel myself to stop themind-numbing monotony. Way too much meaningless detail and tedious descriptions ofcrap that never mattered or moved the story along.Almost as bad as James Lee Burke filling page after page with repititive scene andlandscape descriptions to get to 300 pages.Wambaugh is definitely not a Caunitz or even aMahoney but he's light years away from Sandford who is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"As an ex-LA cop, Wambaugh in this book documents his facts well. However, this is the only true-crime book in his repertoire where he keeps in mind that a crime has been committed. The reason why? The victims were cops.Notwithstanding this detail, which takes nothing from the horrid crime and the pain to the victims' families, Wambaugh never downplays the brutality of the case (in respect to his fellow officers) while the criminals in this case he duly brings to justice, if it can be called justice.Two instances in the book represent Wambaugh's attention to detail, yet they give nothing to the character of either the cops/victims or the criminals. The fact that the detail appears also in the film (which Wambaugh scripted) demonstrates the immaturity of the man. One of the criminals has sex with his partner's girlfriend just before the other's arrival, and our culprit sniffs the air to gauge his probability of detection. Of the two police together, they wrestle down a gorilla of a man brought in for booking, and afterwards show a little of that macho party spirit, that in the end they had been victorious -- the perp was also gay.If you can avoid Wambaugh's actual personality, the book is a compelling work of presenting a horrible crime and its aftermath. If you can stomach any of his other &quot;true-crime&quot; books, give serious reflection to his Wambaugh's handling of things in this one."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The book was in VERY POOR condtion. However I only paid $2.86 for it. The descrition did not match the product I recieved. I will not purchase anything else from this dealer."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I lived in Los Angeles in 1963 and I've seen the movie several times, but not until I picked up a used copy of the book out of the Good Will this last week did I read the written account. As usual, the book is ten times better than the movie. It's gripping and very hard to put down. The sadness of what happens to the surviving police detective is so frustrating and seems, today, so unnecessary. Of course, we forget that seeking help from therapists and even talking about your innermost fears(called &quot;burdening others&quot; with your problems), etc. were not the vogue in 1963. If they had been, this story might have ended differently. I was particularly interested in the author's references to local landmarks which made the story come alive for me. What makes it eerier is that the area of the onion field where the murder took place is not all that far from the city but even so, it's strictly away from city life, kind of up in the hills, pitch dark at night and isolated with nothing but a big lonely highway running through surrounding fields growing a variety of crops. Oddly enough, regarding the two sleazoid criminals, at times they seemed more intelligent than some of the defense attorneys. Fantastic story! I predict it will stay with you for days after reading it."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The Onion Field is a top shelf book. It's the in-depth analysis of the true story of a 1963 event in Los Angeles. Two cops pull over two crooks in an otherwise routine traffic stop. But the desperate crooks get the drop on the cops, get their guns, kidnap them, drive them out to an onion field in the countryside, and murder one of them. One of the cops escapes death, but is haunted by guilt over the death of his partner and his inability to help. The murderers are captured, tried, convicted, and then retried over and over again on appeal.The surviving cop is further savaged when the LAPD uses the case in training as an example of all the wrong things a cop can do when stopping and approaching cars.Haunted by horrific memories, saddened by the loss of his partner, wracked by guilt, ostracized by his own, and repeatedly tormented by defense attorneys in one retrial after another, the cop suffers emotional meltdown. Wambaugh, takes us meticulously through the crime, second by second, and then tells the surviving cop's powerful and moving story: the destruction of a forgotten victim. This is as good as it gets. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The cruel slaying of LAPD Officer Ian Campbell and the sadistic hunt for his surviving partner, Karl Hettinger in a Bakersfield onion field is vividly recounted in this Wambaugh non-fiction classic. Additionally, in-depth and fascinating studies are made of the cold-blooded killers, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith. Finally, the heartbreaking psychological deterioration of Officer Karl Hettinger, a victim of survivor's guilt and hard-nosed, ignorant superiors is recounted in painful detail. An agonizing, dark, and horrible page in California history."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This is an interesting book. See the movie, too. People mention Capote's IN COLD BLOOD in previous reviews, and Wambaugh used that book as a model for this one, and even used Capote's release forms to get interviews. Wambaugh could not get the surviving cop to tell the story so that Wambaugh could write the book. When Wambaugh told him about this book idea, and how it wasn't going to happen, Capote encouraged him to keep at it. So, with Capote's encouragement, Wambaugh finally got the surviving cop to cooperate, and the book got written. The whole subtext of the book is what I find fascinating, and that is: the surviving cop, who could not help his partner being killed, felt guilt that destroyed him emotionally. But the actual murderer and his partner felt no guilt whatsoever. Psychopaths can not feel guilt, even after they've murdered. The innocent man felt guilty, and the guilty men felt innocent. It's an incredible and wrenching and tragic contrast that underlies this whole book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This is the true story of the abduction of two police officers in Bakersfield California in 1963, and of the murder of one of the officers in a nearby field of onions. The by-the-book coverage of the investigation is dovetailed with observances of the psychological breakdown of the surviving partner. If you have read &quot;In Cold Blood,&quot; then you should read this as well. A classic police story, written with honesty, reality, and incredible style."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I read this book many years ago. Last week, while I was browsing through used books in a Goodwill Store, I came across a hardbound copy in pristine condition. It was selling for $2.00. Needless to say, without hesitation, I bought it. I found myself an absolute treasure. Without a doubt in my mind, this is easily the finest non-fiction story of crime and retribution I have ever read, gripping and haunting thoughout. Only one other non-fiction crime story comes close to it, and that is SWORDFISH by David McClintick. If this book can be purchased, do so without hesitation. Jay Wickramasinghe, Citrus Heights, California"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Master Storyteller Joseph Wambaugh shifts from fiction to non-fiction for this riveting account of the execution of a Los Angeles police officer and its aftermath. This excellent book was brought to the screen in a fairly accurate rendition starring James Woods and Ted Danson at the beginnings of their respective careers. Of the book I must say that my realization of the identity of the gardener late in the narrative was one of the most moving and dramatic experiences of my reading life. Wambaugh is a genius!"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The two cops didn't expect anything life-altering when they pulled over the car with the busted taillight in Hollywood that Saturday night in 1963. But that was what they got. Before the night was over, one officer was dead and the other would never be the same.Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 true-crime account of the killing is perhaps his best-known and most celebrated work, made into a memorable movie and a kind of calling card for Wambaugh's critical yet sensitive way of writing about crime and police work. \\"The Onion Field\\" may be based on a true story, but it reads like a novel, much like Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" would have had Capote been as interested in the crime itself as in the problem of capital punishment.Like \\"In Cold Blood,\\" you have one killer who is gay and unreasonably violent, another who is a hardened tag-along. Unlike \\"In Cold Blood,\\" Wambaugh wastes little sympathy for either, especially as they and their attorneys work the system to preserve their lives while the surviving cop is left roasting on a spit, forced to relive the experience that night in the lonely onion field where his partner was killed as the rest of his life spirals out of control.There are sections where \\"The Onion Field\\" is hard to put down and others where it lulls you to sleep. Wambaugh finds everything in this case too fascinating to keep to himself, whether it's a juror with a persecution complex or a defense attorney who objects to everything in hope of getting a mistrial. The first 50 pages may be the dullest in the book, as the \\"before\\" lives of several key participants are examined to great mundane length.But once the two felons, Jimmy Lee Smith and Gregory Powell, find each other, Wambaugh is at his best tracing their brief partnership of crime. Powell styles himself a trenchcoat-wearing mastermind, but his idea of strategy is a getaway car with a burnt clutch so there is no chance of pulling away from a job too quickly. As the pair drive around aimlessly, Powell waving his gun around, Smith wondering when he might ditch his pal and steal the loot for himself, \\"The Onion Field\\" is on a par with Wambaugh's best comedy. Then they meet their destiny and the two lawmen, and the bad guys' stupidity is no longer funny.The other element this book really nails is the story of the surviving detective. Already wrestling with huge survivor's guilt, he is forced to endure much departmental second-guessing about how he allowed the crooks to take him alive. In time, he becomes such a mess he starts to steal, as if willing his own disgrace. Naturally, this gets brought up in court by an opportunistic defense attorney, who labels him a sociopath.\\"He doesn't know the meaning of guilt,\\" the lawyer says, ironically enough given by this point of the story guilt's all the guy does know.I've found other Wambaugh books more compelling, especially \\"The Blooding,\\" which has many of the same themes (pathology, the strain of police work) but also a better story and sharper focus. \\"Onion Field\\" is a memorable book, though, something to shake the most jaded reader into thinking about how many different ways we can find ourselves on the wrong side of the law."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"It has been some years since this one hit the shelves, but it is non the worse for wear. Actually, I have to agree with another reviewer in that I too, feel this is one of Wambaugh's best. A true sory, brought to light in a very readable story like format. It is rather unforgetable. The author does a very good job of not only telling us a story (Wambaugh is, after all, first and formost a great story teller), but gives us great insight into the thoughts and motivations of the killers. He gives us a wonderful profile of the oung officer who survived this horrible crime. I cannot in all truth say it is as good as \\"In Cold Blood,\\" but it comes pretty close to the mark. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This gripping narrative describes the 1963 kidnapping and murder of Los Angeles police officer Ian Campbell (1931-1963) and the crime's lengthy aftermath. Campbell and his partner Karl Hettinger were kidnapped at gunpoint one night by two hoods during a routine traffic stop, and then driven into the country where Campbell was shot dead in an Onion field. Hettinger managed to flee to safety, but was left with psychological trauma and a crushing sense of guilt over his partner's death. The author details the lives of the two killers, their lengthy trials and appeals, and the aftermath for the traumatized Hettinger, who was blamed by many for allowing the tragedy to occur. Readers learn not only about the crime and its lengthy aftermath, but also about the victimization of survivors, and about our imperfect system of justice.Author Joseph Wambaugh modeled this book after IN COLD BLOOD, Truman Capote's superb look at the 1959 murder of a Kansas farm family. Wambaugh didn't quite match Capote, but THE ONION FIELD makes excellent reading (it also became a pretty good movie). Readers might also like Wambaugh's THE BLOODING (about the first use of DNA testing) and ECHOES IN THE DARKNESS."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The Onion Field is a truly remarkable story and so very sad. This is a story that the State of California and the LAPD should be so ashamed of how they treated Karl Hettinger, while allowing two criminals to dictate the courts.The LAPD was very lax in not providing help for Karl and instead issuing a policy that stated that how Karl and Ian handled the situation they found themselves in poorly.Having been through two bank robberies in my lifetime no one knows what you feel and how you would react until you walk in the shoes of danger.I hope that both the State of California and the LAPD have enforced rules to help law enforcement officers who find themselves in a very emotional situation by getting them the medical help they need and deserve. The LAPD should have NEVER decreased the amount of Karl's pension.I am so proud of Karl's wife for standing by her man.To those who treated Karl like he had the plague I can only say SHAME on you!I applaud the author."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The book was excellent in every way. Of course the narrator could have read it faster but that's why there is the option of speeding the narration. Otherwise both text and audio are flawless gems!"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I haven't read \\"The Onion Field\\" since shortly after it was published, but it's been one of the most unforgettable books I've ever read. Wambaugh portrays the devastation wrought by the machinations of the legal justice system on a police officer, already scarred by the misfortune of surviving a dreadful ambush. Still, the story is compelling, heartbreaking, beautifully told, and well worth reading. Reading other reviews below moves me to join with them in recommending this powerful, memorable book."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I really like this book. I especially am drawn to the fact that it is a real story, and I was recommended this book by someone who actually worked with the surviving officer in the story. A must read :)"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I read this book years ago when it first came out. It was well worth reading a second time. Wambaugh invokes intense emotions in the reader with his astounding ability to tell a story. I saw on the news the other night that Greg Powell has cancer and has been given 6 months to live. There was a mercy plea for him to be released from prison so he could die surrounded by loved ones. Did he allow Campbell to have loved ones with him when he executed him? He disgusts me."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"I first read this book in the 70's and it has remained one of my all time favorites. When you read about the events on the actual onion field it will scare you to death, truly well written."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Listen, everyone knows this is an intriguing story, so I don't need to rehash.Here's my problem: I received this book on Kindle, and the amount of typos are disgusting. Are you really charging people for these downloads? Seriously?"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The Onion Field tells the true-life story of two young Los Angeles Police Department detectives who are kidnapped by two robbers in 1963 and the subsequent ordeal of all four men.The book is structured like an episode of television's Law and Order - the first half of the book focuses on the crime, while the second half focuses on the numerous, protracted criminal prosecutions that follow the incident.Wambaugh raises important questions about the purpose of the criminal justice system (punishment, retribution, rehabilitation?) and the disparity between official police policy and actual police practice.Wambaugh illustrates how our system of laws exist to protect the criminals and police departments exist to protect the \`integrity' of those institutions per se, but there is no system or institution that protects with similar zeal and diligence the rights of police officers, victims, or prosecutors, i.e., the three parties most intimately associated with the crime, besides the criminal.The Onion Field is well written and although it is nearly 500 pages, I finished it in one sitting.Highly Recommended, especially for fans of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This book has some great lines about prison. One has stayed in my mind ever since I read the book 25 years ago. Jimmy Smith: \\"Powell was a punk in the gym in Vacaville. They bent him over a workout bar and browned em.\\""},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This book remains one of the best true crime books ever written. It follows the lives of both the victims and the perpetrators, and explains how each winded up where they did.The surviving police officer's life eventually fell apart after he survived the Onion Field incident; this was long before they coined the term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.A fascinating read, and a must-read for fans of crime literature."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Most true crime stories are very tedious, very detailed, which is necessary, but this one takes the cake. If this had been fiction I don't know if I would have been able to finish it. I had to keep telling myself the information was taken directly from the court records, otherwise it would have seemed ridiculous and unbelievable. It's only redeeming trait is the psychological profile of Karl Hettinger---excellent! This part of the story was very well written with great insight into the effect the occurence had on Hettinger and how that effect manifested itself. Since it is a true story, it shows alot about the workings of our justice system and how criminals use it to try to get out of their just punishment."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Horrifying account of two thugs who kipnap two LA cops when they stop them one March night in 1963 for a tail-gate infringement. The book outlines with infinite sadness the fate of the two cops at the hands of these low-life criminals. One can only rage against the American judicial system that allowed the two perpetrators to go through a series of trials that totally exhausted everyone working on them, resulting eventually in virtual apathy. I am somehow appeased by reading on Wikipedia that Jimmy Smith was released in the '80s only to be returned, for relatively minor infringements, to incarceration, to die there in 2007 - whilst Gregory Powell still languishes in well deserved confinement."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Though I have only read about a half dozen true crime books, I would say this is one of the best out there. Of all the true crime I've read, \\"In Cold Blood\\" stands out as the pinnacle. This is the only other true crime book I've read that can stand with it. Very similar in the style it's written, the amount of information, and the presentation of the characters. This book draws you in and keeps you there. The ability of the author to present a lot of information and detail yet keep it easy to follow and absorb is key to me. Some authors tend to over do it or spend to much time on certain details that don't directly affect the story being told. This book has a great flow from page to page. It was hard for me to decide whether to give it 4 or 5 stars. If I was a big fan of true crime, I would probably give it 5 stars. It is a great book, even for a person like me, that isn't really into true crime. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This was a true crime book where a police officer got killed. The book was very well written and never boring (as a few true crime books I've read over the years can be) some parts were very hard to read, as in gave me a strong emotional response, but then again those are some of the best books that can do that.I really don't want to give any of the book away, if you enjoy true crime books I recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This book was outstanding when it was written and I couldn't stand to see it only had one review as Amazon was not in business back when it first came out. It was good picture but the book is well written and based on a true story. It's a page turner that will keep you up all night and that's promise. The scene in the onion fields will keep you up."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This was a 4.5 in rating. What a fascinating story. It was extremely well written. The author did an excellent job of showing the two sides of the life stories and perspectives of the criminals and the police officers. It was gripping and insightful into prison life. Heart breaking to think about the impact to the remaining officer. Great read! Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Written in the mold of a \\"non-fiction novel\\", \\"The Onion Field\\" is magnificent story about a tragic event. With well placed foreshadowing and background stories, the story reads like novel. Yet as a work of true crime like Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\", the book is far from ficticious.The early portions of the novel set the stage for the collision course. Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger are young cops that are both enthusiastic about their jobs. Yet on a routine traffic stop, they crossed paths with career criminals Jimmy Smith and Greg Powell. An abduction/hostage situation turns deadly for one of the cops which leads to the tragic self-destruction of the other officer. As this portion of the story unravels, Powell and Smith adapt to their lives in prison and semmingly endless maze of trials.Some may see the story as being dated, yet I would suggest this is one of the best works of true crime available. The repeated trials documented at the end of the book run somewhat tedious at the conclusion. However, the reader is likely to be pulling for the surviving officer at the books end even enduring the tedium."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"Wambaugh is one of the greatest and most frustrating writers in America. This book, his first, is absolutely terrific. His later books have steadily gone down hill as he clearly has decided to exchange quantity for quality. Choir Boys also is pretty good, but most of the rest are in the Danielle Steel trash category. Read this one for sure"},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"The story was OK - it certainly started out well and told a good tale about a terrible crime. I found the last quarter or so, detailing the various trials and re-trials (would they ever end?) a bit tedious and sometimes hard to follow the thread of the narration.But what really annoyed me about this ebook was the very poor spelling and punctuation throughout, which I presume occurred in the conversion process. Did no one proof read this before releasing the Kindle version? It's certainly the first time I've seen this in my more than 50 book Kindle library, and there's no excuse for this poor quality control."},{"Title":"The Onion Field","review":"This is an eeerie real life account of what happened back in 1963. the details of the investigation both shock and frustrated me as I could not believe our justice system essentially allowed these two criminals so muck leeway. The surviving cop's life became a testament to why stricted laws needed to be put in place and why therapy is something that allows a cleansing of the soul for those who need it."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"And dead men's cries do fill the empty air . . . I say, come forth, and fight with me!These words of Warwick from Shakespeare's Henry VII, Part II seem a very appropriate theme for Eric Ambler's \\"Cause for Alarm\\". First published in 1938, when the Second World War had not officially started, Cause for Alarm painted a picture of a world where the dying had already begun, albeit in the streets and alleys of Europe if not yet on the battlefield.For those not familiar with his work, Ambler was to the modern British spy novel what Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett were to the American detective novel. Ambler transformed the spy novel from a simplistic black and white world of perfect good guys versus nefarious bad guys into a far more realistic world where sometimes the difference between good and evil is not all that great.Typically, Ambler would take an unassuming, unsuspecting spectator and immerse him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-World War II Europe. The result was a series of highly entertaining and satisfying books that many believe set the stage for the likes of le Carre, Deighton, and, most recently, Alan Furst.\\"Cause for Alarm\\" follows Ambler's typical plot line. Nicky Marlow is a recently laid-off English engineer. He is also recently engaged. His search for employment grows increasingly frustrated until he answers and advertisement for what appears to be a somewhat down-at-the heels machine tool company. Despite being told that that the company (the aptly named Spartacus Machine Tool Co.) sells machine tools used in the armaments industry and is profitably engaged in selling its equipment to Italian \`military-industrial complex' Marlow accepts a position as the company's Italian sales agent.No sooner does Marlow arrive in Italy than he is swept up into a web of death and intrigue. He soon finds his predecessor was murdered and finds himself in the cross-hairs of the OVRA (fascist Italy's secret police), a \`general' who may be either a Yugoslav or German spy, and Soviet secret agents. It seems as if everyone is telling Marlow, \\"come forth and fight with me.\\" Marlow, at first at least, has buried his head in the sands and ignore the moral implications of his work. He is just doing his job, or so he says more than once.As mentioned the basic outline of an Ambler novel, the innocent Brit caught in a web of sinister, cynical European intrigue, may be found in Cause for Alarm. However, the pleasure of reading Ambler is not just for the plot but for his keen eye for detail, his vivid but realistic prose (Ambler writes in a world where black and white is overwhelmed by shades of grey), and his ability to place his \`small characters' and their problems in the context of a world about to go mad yet again. You won't find easy answers in an Ambler novel and you won't always find a knight in shining armor riding off into the sunset with \`his lady'.If you like well-written, realistic novels set in pre-war Europe you should read Ambler. Similarly, if you are a fan of Alan Furst (as I am) you should read Ambler. It is always worth going back to the source!Highly recommended.L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"To read or not to read the great spy novels of Eric Ambler? That is the question most people ignore because they are not familiar with Mr. Ambler and his particularly talent.Mr. Ambler has always had this problem. As Alfred Hitchcock noted in his introduction to Intrigue (an omnibus volume containing Journey into Fear, A Coffin for Dimitrios, Cause for Alarm and Background to Danger), \\"Perhaps this was the volume that brought Mr. Ambler to the attention of the public that make best-sellers. They had been singularly inattentive until its appearance -- I suppose only God knows why.\\" He goes on to say, \\"They had not even heeded the critics, who had said, from the very first, that Mr. Ambler had given new life and fresh viewpoint to the art of the spy novel -- an art supposedly threadbare and certainly clich&eacute;-infested.\\"So what's new and different about Eric Ambler writing? His heroes are ordinary people with whom almost any reader can identify, which puts you in the middle of a turmoil of emotions. His bad guys are characteristic of those who did the type of dirty deeds described in the book. His angels on the sidelines are equally realistic to the historical context. The backgrounds, histories and plot lines are finely nuanced into the actual evolution of the areas and events described during that time. In a way, these books are like historical fiction, except they describe deceit and betrayal rather than love and affection. From a distance of over 60 years, we read these books today as a way to step back into the darkest days of the past and relive them vividly. You can almost see and feel a dark hand raised to strike you in the back as you read one of his book's later pages. In a way, these stories are like a more realistic version of what Dashiell Hammett wrote as applied to European espionage.Since Mr. Ambler wrote, the thrillers have gotten much bigger in scope . . . and moved beyond reality. Usually, the future of the human race is at stake. The heroes make Superman look like a wimp in terms of their prowess and knowledge. There's usually a love interest who exceeds your vision of the ideal woman. Fast-paced violence and killing dominate most pages. There are lots of toys to describe and use in imaginative ways. The villains combine the worst faults of the 45 most undesirable people in world history and have gained enormous wealth and power while being totally crazy. The plot twists and turns like cruise missile every few seconds in unexpected directions. If you want a book like that, please do not read Mr. Ambler's work. You won't like it.If you want to taste, touch, smell, see and hear evil from close range and move through fear to defeat it, Mr. Ambler's your man.On to Cause for Alarm. The book begins powerfully with a prologue, Death in Milan. A man is waiting to follow an Englishman in the cold. The Englishman appears and crosses the street. A large limousine accelerates violently into him, running him over. The man next to the driver sees that the Englishman is still alive, and directs the driver to \\"Go back and make certain.\\" They run over the Englishman again. This time, he dies.English production engineer, Nicky Marlow has just gotten engaged, and almost as quickly loses his job when the Barton Heath works have to be closed when a key customer is lost. Jobs are scarce during the Depression, yet he turns down a chance to take a four year contract in Bolivia for small pay. Finally, he applies for and obtains a one-year assignment in Milan which will mean being away from his fiancee, who has encouraged him to be sensible. They can get married later.The job means supplying equipment needed to make munitions, and Germany and Italy are now allies. So Marlow is put in the touchy position of helping make arms that may be used later against his countrymen. He closes his eyes to that problem and begins doing his new job, replacing a predecessor who was unexpectedly killed in an automobile accident. Soon, strange characters begin courting his favors and offering him tempting deals. One of them even encourages him to play along with another of the characters. It seems that Marlow has unexpectedly put himself right in the middle of Britain's enemies as they spy on one another. Everyone needs him to do their bidding, and few care whether he survives or not. The Fascists even grab his passport to make him more vulnerable. Totally unprepared, he begins to pursue a dangerous double-timing game.One of the reasons why I am so fond of this book (which I have read several times) is that it points out that when we ignore the morality of our business activities there will be a price to be paid. Another interesting moral question is what the right thing to do is when we are faced with the possibility of reducing risk to others by increasing the risk to ourselves. When are we obligated to do so?The colorful figures of Zaleshoff and General Vagas make the story ever so much spicier. Neither are people with whom Marlow would have associated in England, yet the two are key to his making progress in Milan.The book's structure is written like three novellas. The first details the situation in which Marlowe finds himself. The second involves his engagement in the espionage. The third relates his attempt to escape. You will feel like a person being sucked by the undertow out to sea as you progress from one novella to the next . . . as increasing fear and heaviness grip you.After you finish, think about some place in your life where your work causes or could cause harm to others. How can you overcome that current or potential harm?"},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"This novel has all the suspense, all the action -- and all the humor -- of other Eric Ambler novels. It also features one of my favorite fictional characters -- the Russian agent Andreas P. Zaleshoff. If you like spy fiction, this one's for you."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"It's the late 1930's and the European continent is poised on the brink of war. British engineer Nicholas Marlow accepts a position in the Milan office of a machine tool manufacturing company known as Spartacus. Since Spartacus' products are used in the production of munitions, Marlow has access to information of value to those engaged in espionage.A bit naive, Marlow is rather easily sucked into the cloak and dagger intrigue endemic to that time and place and rather unfortunately incurs the wrath of Mussolini's secret police.Cause for Alarm is an engaging spy novel that has a smooth narrative flow. Moreover, Ambler's detailed knowledge of his subject matter is quite apparent. A solid 4 stars for this early contribution to the genre. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"Absolutely gripping first two -thirds of the book. Wonderfully draws you into its world, and takes you into the twists and turns of the spy world. However, the final third is a major let-down. Probably because we are jaded now, but the reversion to straight story in the last furlong was a marked dissapointment after the stirring middle section."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"I enjoyed the first part of this book, wherein the protagonist Marlow gets involved -- reluctantly -- in intrigue in pre-war Italy. There was definite, palpable suspense as Marlow begins to attract the attention of a bunch of characters who may or may not be good guys in the Europe that is slowly drifting toward horrendous war. But at one point, a long and very improbable escape/chase scene takes place which, for me, destroyed the flow and rhythm of the book. It's as if the author wanted to eat up a lot of pages just so he could get to where he could wrap things up. Without that chase/escape scene, the book could have been a third shorter, and probably would have been a better book. I've read two other Ambler books and despite proper respect for his contribution to the genre, I don't think I'll read any others. Give me Furst, Deighton or other modern day espionage writers."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"After reading several of Alan Furst's wonderful WWII espionage novels, I noticed that he cited Eric Ambler as a major influence. \\"Cause for Alarm\\" is the second Ambler I read, after \\"Coffin for Dimitrios.\\" Although the plot of Alarm is not as twisty as that of Dimitrios, you really get a feel for what it might have been like to be an innocent bystander caught up in the intrigues of Fascist Italy. Interesting supporting characters round things out to make for a good, quick read."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"A hapless protagonist dropped in the midst of unexpected circumstances only to find his way out by his own good fortune and the assistance of newfound friends. Such is the signature Ambler tale his fans have learned to like and expect. They'll be happy to find another one here. They may not be so happy to find some of the same characters they encountered inBackground to Dangeror a protagonist that is strikingly similar as well. Indeed, there is much in common in this and his earlier work. If not for the heavy does of Axis counterespionage on the eve of World War II, some might consider this one a bit stale. I found just enough new material to make it fresh and, like other Ambler works, equally intriguing."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"I've been working my way through this series of espionage books and have enjoyed them. In this one, however, Ambler's \\"innocent bystander,\\" an engineer named Marlow, is clueless about everything. And I mean everything. Perhaps this was meant to symbolize English attitudes in the years before WWII. Or perhaps it reflects Ambler's view of engineers generally. Or perhaps it was an attempt to paint the armament industry as heedless of political influences. In any event, the growing war threat doesn't seem to have reached him, something made even more puzzling by the fact that he takes a position with an armaments company's Italian office. Marlow's persona is drawn in sharp contrast to other characters, who are dedicated to causes and full of initiative. Poor Marlow is manipulated and becomes dependent on the skill of a Soviet agent.It's worth a read but lacks the appeal of others in the series."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"I highly recommend this novel. Ambler is at his best. A great spy story with Ambler's average Joe who gets caught up in intrigue but perseveres and overcomes."},{"Title":"Cause for Alarm","review":"Cause for AlarmThe man Ferning is murdered at night in Milan, hit by a car to make it look like an accident. In England a production engineer loses his job due to the slump. After months, Nick Marlow decides to apply for a job that requires \\"fluent Italian\\". This company specializes in high-speed shell production for cannon. After Marlow arrives in Milan, he gets a visit from General Vagas, who says he was a friend of Ferning (Marlow is his replacement). Marlow reports to the Police for his residence permit, but peeves signor Capitano. Then he meets another businessman, Andreas Zaleshoff, who shows him a picture of Ferning, and offers advice, which Marlow spurns. Chapter V tells how to recognize the old-fashioned method of steaming open envelopes to read the letter.Marlow meets Zaleshoff for dinner and is put wise to the situation. Ferning was murdered because he worked for Vagas; counter-espionage did this to avoid publicity. Marlow would be in danger if he accepted Vagas' offer. Vagas pays off important people so he is untouchable. Now Zaleshoff explains why Marlow should take Vagas' offer! Marlow is attacked and beaten by four men, it is only a warning.But the secret deal with Vagas is exposed to the authorities; an overlooked human factor did something. Now Marlow has to flee, and he is helped by Zaleshoff. They begin walking cross-country, and hiding in the brush when necessary. This escape keeps your interest. The details about disguises and changing clothes are informative. Marlow gets his bonus from Vagas and returns to England. He then changes jobs.This story follows the plot of \\"Background to Danger\\". A man gains important and dangerous knowledge while performing his job. He escapes by a long flight through the countryside until he crosses the border to an adjoining country. Later novels avoid this plot.
