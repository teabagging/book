This is certainly one of the top five books to own and study for limit holdem. The rage nowadays is no limit holdem, so if that is your game, this book is not for you. If your game is limit holdem and you have been struggling, you can not afford to miss this one. This book ranks up there with \\"The Theory of Poker\\" and \\"Holdem Poker for Advanced Players\\" as absolute essentials for strengthening your limit holdem game. It is great for rereading every three to six months to re-evaluate your game, plug the inevitable leaks and reassess your overall approach to the game. The reason I say it gets better with age is that as you gain more table experience you come back to ideas that six months ago escaped you because you lacked the proper reference points. Now, in rereading them you reopen your view and thinking about the game to a new level. It is like that every time I come back and read this book again. It's like spring training for your holdem game; cover the basics, learn finesse plays, out think and outplay your opponents. Simple, but not easy.

It is not for beginners; it is filled with interesting and advanced topics in limit Hold'em. This is a good book for any reader who is looking to read more advanced material.

The Short-Handed essays are illuminating as well.

A few obvious bits of advice about not going on tilt but no real analysis of what goes on inside a poker player's brain during a game. For this reason, I feel the book's title is misleadinng, to say the least.Second, the book has little original to say. It echoes ideas that can be found (but said more clearly) in books by Sklansky and Malmouth. If you have books by those authors, you don't need this one.Third, the book makes comments which strike me as completely wrong. Namely, that tournament victories are largely achieved by luck and that pot limit is bad for the game of poker. This leaves those of us who think tournaments are won by skill, or who like pot limit, out in the cold.Finally, the book is quite dry. The lively annecdotes which can make other poker books fun to read are not here. This is dry stuff. If it were better stuff, that wouldn't matter so much, but it's not.Clearly, given the rave reviews this book is getting, I'm in the minority here. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so. Still, if you're a limit player who likes to grind away, maybe this book is for you (although even then there are other authors I'd prefer) but if you like pot or no limit, don't bother."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"Inside the Poker Mind is a good overall book that discusses many of the concepts in all of the above books but from a psychological perspective.

Frankly, I have difficulty believing anybody gave this one less than 5 stars because it is a rare and excellent work. I will admit that it is not a book for beginners or even those who have yet to read Ed Miller's Small Stakes Hold \`Em, but it offers extensive benefits for the intermediate player on up. Inside... is basically a collection of essays concerning topics seldom discussed, or not addressed in detail, within the typical \\"how to\\" manual. Feeney, despite having a PhD and being an accomplished high stakes player, is not broadcasting to readers from Phil Ivey-ian heights. Feeney ground out poker at the lowest levels before becoming the player he is today. His experiences in the small limits ring true for those of us dwelling in them today. My favorite essay in here, \\"How am I doing? Who Cares?\\", warns readers not to be results oriented in regards to sessions. Variance is sometimes mind-boggling, but what we must do is concentrate on playing correctly despite our aces being snapped or getting cold-decked. Really, the entire Part IV section on poker and emotion is sensational. His definition of tilt is much more subtle than the ones generally offered, and, I believe, it is much more accurate. Overall, with brilliant analysis and clear style, Inside... is far better than most of its competitors. It's for the thinking man which is what everyone should aspire to be if they want to make any money out of the game."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"I find the title of this book to be slightly misleading: \\"Inside the Poker Mind\\" is a collection of essays on what NOT to do as a poker player (e.g. do not get smug and play weak cards, do not go on tilt, do not overestimate your odds, do not play beyond your means, do not take bad beats personally, etc.). From the title one might expect the text to relate in some way to getting \\"into the mind\\" of one's opponent (i.e. the text may have some strategic advice); this is simply not the case. There are a handful of strategic plays involved in this book, and some consideration of reading hands. However, these are addressed from the perspective of how not to make a mistake in either overusing certain strategies, or being too rigid in the face of changing conditions in the hand.Essentially, this book assumes you already know everything there is to know about being a good poker player, and merely need some cautionary advice on avoiding common mistakes. While not valueless, I do not believe this focus serves the prospective readers of the book; the author frequently references \\"Hold 'em Poker for Advanced Players\\" and \\"The Theory of Poker\\" to flesh out ideas he mentions in passing, and probably the reader would do better to explore those books IN PLACE of this one (although I have a very low opinion of \\"Hold 'em Poker for Advanced Players\\"). The warnings this book contains are well-advised, however, and on the whole I'd probably give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could.HITS: Cautions against overplaying marginal hands; good essays exploring the tilt phenomenon; the author's \\"by the numbers\\" pure analytical mindset becomes infectious, and could influence your play for the betterMISSES: The author is so vehemently anti-no limit and pot limit hold 'em that he refuses to address these games at all (absolutely do not attempt to use the author's strategic limit plays in a no limit or pot limit game); tournaments are denigrated as a drain on the poker economy (demonstrably false, in my opinion); no basic strategy advice; references other texts (particularly \\"Hold 'em Poker for Advanced Players\\" - a terrible book in my opinion - and \\"The Theory of Poker\\", which is truly great) excessively to fill in basic ideas that more properly could be explained in the text.I'd recommendThe Poker Tournament FormulaandPoker Tips that Pay: Expert Strategy Guide for Winning No Limit Texas Hold eminstead of this inside look at the poker mind. \\"Poker Tournament Formula\\" provides an excellent set of basic principles and \\"Poker Tips that Pay\\" teaches through detailed hand examples.

The section on randomness is extremely basic and repetitive, of use only to a novice or an idiot who would never read a book on poker in the first place.Much of Part Four: Poker and Emotion is also painfully repetitive, taking about 20 pages to describe his concept of \\"tilt\\" which could be stated much more succinctly in a page or less. I prefer the essays on Subtle Losses of Judgement, which also contain his concept of tilt, and the essay You the Machine.Part Five: Miscellaneous Topics is fairly nonessential reading though more interesting than much of Part Two and Part Four.I recommend this book mainly for Part One, the section on short-handed play in Part Two, and Part Three.

However, as other reviewers have noted, NOTHING takes the place of LOTS of hands played. As an aside from the review, my personal recommendation is as follows:1) Get the books and study. Re-read as your game improves.2) Play on-line cheaply and move up in limit as your game improves.3) Buy the Wilson software...it's not impressive looking, but it lets you play millions of hands without going into your wallet.4) Get into or start a home game and play as often as possible. Playing with friends isn't as scary as with strangers at a casino.5) When you've done the first 4 things, visit a local casino or cardroom and try an inexpensive game.If you're still losing money after that, I suggest you switch to checkers or tiddlywinks."},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"there are lotsa other books on profiling players.... this one really makes you take a look at yourself as well"},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"hello poker fans. i am scott. i have been playing serious poker since i was 16 and i derive a majority of my income from poker. as i am sure you gather, i devote a lot of time to studying poker.as anyone familiar with the game realizes, correct poker strategy forms a web of various concepts with often seem to contradict each other. being able to successfully balance these seeming paradoxes is paramount to expert play.this book, alone among the scores that i have encountered, guides the reader through that diffiecult task. john's book is about how to think about poker and he does an excellent job.inside the poker mind is second to only the theory of poker in helping the reader become a substantial winner at middle and upper limits.i would highly recommended it to anyone who is interested in poker or, for that matter, money.in fact, you should buy several copies in case you lose the first couple.some other books i would recommend are the works of bukowski, beckett, dostoevski, cummings, ts eliot, and kafka.scott"},{"Title":"Inside the Poker Mind: Essays on Hold 'em and General Poker Concepts","review":"John Feeney is one of the kindest people I've ever met.

The information is very accurate. Although he probably could have written a lot of articles off the top of his head, he didn't! He spent the time to research all the topics thoroughly, and consulted other experts (Sklansky and Malmuth to name two) to make sure the info was accurate and complete.3.

'Known,' that is [insert wink and nudge here]... biblically speaking.Humanity isn't drowned out, though, in this good book, and Felix Dern is not the progenitor of a nation. Though, owing to his almost perfect intercourse-to-conception percentage, he could be if he had sex more often. But he hasn't and, therefore, isn't. Good thing, too, because like most actors, psychologically speaking, he's a mess.An actor ... [is] most confident when they are notthemselves ..., and no matter what they do, no mattertheir curses, there'd be no price to pay when thecurtain falls, no child to bear and rear and feedforevermore, amen.Procreation -- personified by Felix, or Lix for short (a punny contraction because of all the female boots he licks) -- seems to be author Jim Crace's point. Felix, in particular, is a forgettable character; whereas Lix, the hyper-potent sperm donor, is the singularly ubiquitous Man.For one so fertile and flamboyant, for one soarrogant in costume, Felix Dern, the showman,was--offstage--surprisingly shy and timid. Thatwas, in rising middle age, his major flaw, hismain regret--and also his saving grace.Ironically (is the irony intentional?), the same flawed saving grace could be said to be working for the novel's plot, which consists of dinner and a movie, followed by an almost book-length Felix this-is-your-life flashback showing how, when and where and with whom each of his happy accidents (or curses?) have been conceived.There is nothing in Genesis on an epic scale, no angel-heralded deus ex machina to turn certain doom into instant triumph. There is nothing turbo-charged or ostentatious, and in the hands of a lesser writer, the book could have easily turned out as entertaining as all the begats in Leviticus. Even when the narrative drags in spots, it is picked up and redeemed by Crace's consistently beautiful writing and the epigrammatic lines that periodically fall onto the page like manna from the sky:Everything's exotic and amusing when the objectof your journey is a body and a bed.We need to flirt and covet strangers for thehealth and spirit of our marriages.Juveniles had all the fun. The trick for adults,then, was to act like juveniles.These little darts of wisdom scattered throughout the narrative are like candy sparkles on a cake: they don't do much to the overall flavor, but the added color is nice. This is not to say that Genesis is a superficial confection, just one with enough visual pizzazz to appeal to those who like to stare in the bakery window at all the pretty dainties on display. And, if Crace ever stumbles across this review, he may be cringing once he gets to this point, wondering when and if this cake metaphor is ever going to end! Or maybe, owing to the sharp wit he seems to possess, based upon the subtlety of his writing, he's nodding his head knowingly, anticipating the inevitable denouement. Regardless of this whimsical and far too self indulgent speculation, here it is (the denouement that is): cake and birthdays go together like firecrackers on the Fourth of July. Or childbirth and existence, which seems to be at the core of what Crace's novel -- at its moist and chewy center -- is mostly all about.Still, the streaks and pricks of light areeloquent. They tell of people going home. Theytell of love and lovemaking, of children,marriages, and lives. You think, But this couldhappen anywhere. It does.And the why and when of how people come together, fall in love and fall apart is really just so much Shakespearean sound and fury [No one's to blame, but passion is not intended to endure./Falling in love is not being in love. Waiting for the perfect partner is self-sabotage.]. What matters most between a man and a woman is the simple act of reproduction. Because, eventually, you will come to understand that sex is not love and it isn't love -- or that type of love -- in the end that really matters anyway."},{"Title":"Genesis: A Novel (Crace, Jim)","review":"Genesis (or Six, as known in the UK) by Crace has his hero, Felix Dern (or Lix as he is shortened throughout) telling of your atypical male, overly fertile man who has just learned his wife of two years is pregnant. Her first, his sixth (all by different women). He is a stage actor, currently in Tartuffe (an irony intself as he plays a man who is his very antithesis) who is wandering through his local haunts, guilty over his feelings for his wife's cousin, Freda, his first love and second conquest. Rather than an night of intimacy he is instead roped by Freda into attempting to shelter a young activist (in an apologetic reminisence of his previous student activism dome twenty five years earlier).As both Lix and Mouetta fail to navigate through this Orwellian vision of the City of Kisses they end up celebrating their anniversary in a car in a park culminating in her pregnancy. Flicking between the thoughts of both as each seeks in private isolation to understand the questions and true meanings of the other, the primitive drives of each is laid open. Lix's preoccupation is driven by sexually-orientated vision, Mouetta's by both a desire to understand her husband, to be a mother and garner a self-assurance in her physical attractivity.As a result we float through a world given over to understanding the primal urges whilst consciously aware of the intruding, policed social world around us.Crace then moves us back to Lix's youth, stepping onwards through the key fertile moments in his life, moving through the remaining five pregnancies he has caused, from one sexually motivated escapade after another. We follow a history of Lix's life, ascertain how his second child, created by activism, was spurred by his desires, from his innocent \`stalking', his third through his farcial attempts to kidnap of a millionaire all to make himself more desirable in the eyes of Freda, his fourth and fifth with his wife Alicja, the first of these during a flooding, the second in an implied guilt after we learn of her repetitive infidelity, and lastly with An, his co-actor, the opening stirrings of which were witnessed in secret by his now eighteen year old son, George, born of Freda. So at the very end we have a quick rerun of his children, Bel, George, Lech, Karl, Rosa and the newly pregnant Mouetta - an explanation of Lix's life and lost loves.Crace has created a dreamy world, shown in a fantastical light, where extreme opinions are somehow portrayed as \`ultra-cool', but are ultimately safe from reality, a cocoon where intellectual posturing and touchings on the real world are merely pranks. Ultimately we see the facades that Lix presents are a facet of his chameleon-like unconscious stratgies to adapt his male desires to achieve his sexual goals and the results of those actions. We follow as he struggles to achieve and fails to explain his desires and suffers misperception as a result. We watch the women who have found him fascinating but ultimately seen through the unconscious faade and recognised his failings to materialise as a long term partner.

Of his last three books, I think Being Dead and The Devil's Larder are both incredibly good books. On the other hand, I was rather disappointed with Quarantine. Here, I am sorry to say, is another disappointment.Genesis is the story of a man, Felix Dern, who has produced a child with every woman with whom he's ever had sex. That amounts to six children, if we include the one who is yet a fetus at the top of the novel. And yet, Lix, as he is called, is a timid man despite his fame as an actor. How does he manage this?It can't be because of his supposed fertility which appears a non-issue to me despite the fact that Crace keeps coming back to it. Lix doesn't cause a child every time he has sex (which would have been really interesting.) And he can't be afraid that every time he has a relationship with a woman he will have a child. He doesn't even know of his first child and his child with his first love-for-a-month, the fiery Freda, doesn't explain the years of abstinence that follows this break-up.Does his nature come from the repression of this unnamed city in which he lives his life? It's hard to tell but it seems unlikely since his fame allows him a lot of freedom and travel to America. If his home is so bad why didn't he just stay in Hollywood?When it comes right down to it, I couldn't fathom Lix at all and this ruined the book for me. Though Crace has an excellent prose style, the only place where this story really came alive for me was near the end where we got a glimpse at Lix through the eyes of his children. Perhaps that would have been a better book."},{"Title":"Genesis: A Novel (Crace, Jim)","review":"Crace's \\"Genesis\\" novel almost works. It's a great premise. The book is constructed with 6 children, 6 conceptions; and you know from the beginning that you'll hear about each one. Some of the characters are entertaining such as the fiery revolutionary feminist Freda who insists on being on top. Her Cousin Mouetta also shows some personality and spunk. And Crace authors one of my favorite single sentences I've read in a novel on page 127, \\"She wanted the drama of the streets relocated in between the sheets.\\" Doesn't that sound like it ought to be a line in a popular song?Thematically, the main character, Lix, seems at a loss about how to father. That is perhaps the great paradox of the novel, that a man who excels at fertility is so completely lacking in fatherly commitment, love and understanding. In fact, we encounter just about everything from love, lust and lumpy gravy, except for that most exceptional consequence of romantic love, the family. Whereas real life family life is one of the most character-building experiences, in Lix we find a man who lives inside his stage personas, much as some men live most fully within their heads. Thus, \\"Genesis\\" for me was a titillating modern tragedy.That said, the book meanders to a conclusion. By the time of Lix's 6th conception, we're about as bored with his sex life as he is. Therefore, I wound up asking myself, \\"Do I really care?\\" In the end, this was an enjoyable enough reading experience, hardly riveting or one that I could not have lived without.

Novels are fiction, yes, but an effective novel involves the reader to such an extent that he believes what he is reading actually happened. That never happens in GENESIS because the characters are bathed in artificiality -- they resemble robots, in fact -- and the story is scarcely worth describing. The setting, a phony city, comes off as phony (although for some reason I kept thinking of Ljubljana -- not the real city, just a phony city written to sound like Ljubljana). I have dipped into contemporary literary fiction from time to time -- and I heard Crace was a rare nonironical nonpostmodernist nonsneerer -- but I have almost always been deeply disappointed. This book is no exception. Back to J.B. Priestley, P.H. Newby, Waugh and Greene.

The overture is short or else it's not the overture. Nor is marriage meant to be perfect. It has to toughen on its blemishes. It has to morph and change its shape and turn its insides out and move beyond the passion that is the architect. Falling in love is not being in love. Waiting for the perfect partner is self-sabotage.' then perhaps this book would not deserve our close attention. And I think it does.When passages such as these are used for a moment of meditation, then GENESIS has a lot to say about how we are functioning in this discombobulated world..

Grady Harp"},{"Title":"Genesis: A Novel (Crace, Jim)","review":"This is the first time I've read a Crace book and I'm not inclined to repeat the experience. It involves a group of unlikeable and unadmirable characters engaged in nothing much except making children and having sex, toward which they all have pretty juvenile attitudes.The chief character, Felix Dern, who carries the unpleasant nickname of \\"Lix,\\" is a weak, timid man, especially when it comes to sex, and it is his misfortune to impregnate every women he sleeps with. Fortunately (and perhaps surprisingly), this is a limited number, especially when you consider that Lix is a rather well known actor and considered quite handsome.All the action takes place in what I take to be a fictitious Eastern European city before the Gorbachev era, in a vaguely repressive Communist regime. This is mildly interesting, and perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book, although not sufficient reason to read it.The book is reasonably well written, and occasionally, the reader will come across a phrase that is sufficiently felicitous to be noticed. But it is a book without rewards or deep insights, in story or character. From what I read in the other reviews here, his other books may be a good deal better.

His later short stories tend to be about \\"manly men\\" who speak in a telscoped professional short hand about \\"manly things.\\" So, if you don't know much about firearms, ships, trains or cars circa 1900, some of the dialogue will seem a bit abstruse such as this bit from, \\"The Captive,\\" the lead story in this collection: \\"I presume you never heard tell of the Laughton-Zigler automatic two-inch field-gun, with self-feeding hopper, single oil-cylinder recoil, and ball-bearing gear throughout? Or Laughtite, the new explosive? Absolutely uniform in effect, and one-ninth the bulk of any present effete charge--flake, cannonite, cordite, troisdorf, cellulose, cocoa, cord, or prism--I don't care what it is. Laughtite's immense, so's the Zigler automatic.\\" Hmmm, maybe they are \\"immense,\\" but Kipling is right to presume. Anyway, \\"The Captive\\" is yet another, in an unlimited series, of Kipling's jingoistic puff-pieces defending the British Empire and allaying anyone's concern that the British aren't just the nicest, most understanding, understated and smartest chaps about, but also the most able too--even in the face of Laughtite and Zigler. This story is of some interest in that it is defending Britain's aggression in South Africa at the turn of the twentieth century, otherwise known as the Boer War, which bequeathed to the world one of the most emblematic of twentieth-century inventions: the concentration camp (or at least the label).The rest of the stories are a mixed lot of various cats and dogs. There's \\"The Bonds of Discipline,\\" featuring one of Kipling's recurring characters, the irascible seaman, Emanuel Pyecroft. In a very different vein from \\"The Captive,\\" this story demonstrates how the British are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest--oh, and ablest--chaps about in matching wits with the \\"Portugee,\\" as opposed to the Dutch Boer. Then there's \\"A Sahib's War,\\" also a very different story which concerns an Indian who travels with his British master to South Africa and there discovers that even Indians realize that the British are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps about in matching wits with the Dutch Boer. Then, as a twist, there's another Pyecroft story, \\"Their Lawful Occasions,\\" concerning how some British may not be the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps when they try to match wits with other British--namely one Pyecroft and companions--who, in turn, really are the nicest, most understanding, understated, smartest and ablest chaps. The rest of the short stories are even more divergent than these.So, how does Kipling get three stars? Well, it's sort of like the question once posed to Andre Gide about who the greatest French poet was--the answer: \\"Victor Hugo, alas!\\" And who do you think is the greatest English short story writer?

You can get divorce, tax audit, and college &quot;survival&quot; guides, as well as a lot of untried and fantasy information from armchair survivalists. Joe Bigley (known to his associates as &quot;Aboman&quot;) has placed the term back in it's rightful niche -- the means of preserving your life. While the book does contain much information on emergency and wilderness survival, it is also a guide on how to assume responsibility for your own life.We are a society that has turned our fate over to the police, fire department, ambulance, and when all else fails, the lawyers. There is an increasingly widespead attitude that you should be saved from your own mistakes and bad decisions. Bigley not only shows you how to take back responsibility for your own actions, but how to live as independently as possible. For instance, he covers how to understand electricity and how to use it wisely. He offers ideas on economical diets that are nutritious and tasty to avoid the doubts and expense of over processed food. Most importantly, he gives good solid advice on disaster preparedness, which considering the times, is a subject every American (and many other nationalities) should be skilled in.Aboman's Guide to Survival and Self-Reliance is designed to help you take back control of your life. It's not just a survival guide to get you out of a tight spot, but a text on how to manage your life for the long-term. Don't expect a lot of 80s doomsday stuff, but a simple outline on how to save money, eat well, be healthy, and live long and free.Should you think I am just doing a friend a favor here, think again. I also have a survival book out and run a survival school. In other trades we would be considered competitors, but during these uncertain times the more good information that is available to the public the better. I recommend the book highly for all who want the best for themselves and their family."},{"Title":"Aboman's Guide to Survival & Self-Reliance: Practical Skills for Interesting Times","review":"When Joe (AKA ABOMAN) picked up his chisel to write this book it was after many years of experience as a teacher and practitioner of the survival arts.

Joe shows his art in every page of this book.I have a lot of \\"Survival books\\". Some are just tired rewrites of military survival skills books but others, like this one, are real discourses on the topic of survival. In this book Joe covers everything from escaping a burning building to surviving natural disasters to trouble-shooting problems with your home and vehicle. He even covers some of the alternative and herbal remedies that are giving \\"modern\\" medicine heartburn... because it works.One essential part of any book is readability. I keep a few survival books near my bed just in case I have a problem falling asleep. Joe's book on the other hand is like a cup of really good, rich coffee.

This new book reiterates the lactate threshold approach to training, expanding on the same themes. The concepts previously introduced-namely energy systems, heart rate, anaerobic threshold deflection point, and blood lactate levels-are fleshed out.In addition, the author expands on his previous book by adding sections on overtraining, circulation, blood levels, and nutrition.The book is replete with heart rate graphs and tables which explain training concepts and document training and testing.Janssen's thesis is that training intensity can be prescribed based on measuring blood lactate levels. If the athlete does not have access to lactate measurement, training can be based on heart rates imputed to reflect lactate levels.It's a great book for athletes, coaches, and sport scientists. It's targeted toward runners, cyclists, triatheltes, rowers, and cross-country skiers.Athletes and coaches who read such books are interested in getting down to the nitty gritty: How do I apply this information? What should I do to follow the training concepts? Here, the book also helps. General and specific advice is given, with examples.The book merits several readings. Scattered throughout the book are numerous pearls. Wisdom that many will miss on their first reading. For example, in small type below a table describing the percentage share in total energy supply for various sports, Janssen notes that although the share of anaerobic energy supply in cycling is only 5%, this is by no means indicates that this source of energy is unimportant-due to the decisive role of anaerobic fitness in breakaways.Fundamental and more problematic is that the author's thesis about lactate threshold training is controversial. Many sport scientists and coaches are of the opinion that it's like the story of the man searching for his lost keys under a streetlight-not because that's where he dropped them, but because that's where the light is. The existence of blood lactate and our ability to measure it may or may not have much importance in \\"scientific\\" training. Lactate, perhaps a false marker in training programs, may serve to endow false science to coaching methods that, fundamentally, are truly based as much on experience and art.There is another troubling, basic problem with Janssen's thesis; a problem that arises whenever lactate threshold training is discussed. Most authors, Janssen included, conceive of lactate threshold as corresponding to the race intensity of a one-hour event. The United States Cycling Federation determines threshold in a way that generally finds it to equate to a blood lactate of about 2.5 millimoles per liter. Janssen and European coaches often quote a figure of about 4 millimoles. Yet Janssen himself, as well as my own and other published research, shows that athletes complete in one-hour events at blood lactates between 6 and 10 millimoles per liter. Janssen tries to help here, by explaining that there are different types of thresholds. However his explanations are scattered and don't adequately address the contradictions he himself raises.Yet another obstacle is Conconi's method of determining heat rate deflection point. Conconi's method was widely lauded when described almost two decades ago-it's now losing favor. Sport scientists and coaches have found difficulties with this method-problems that Janssen alludes to.There are other problems with this book, sure. As a racer, sport scientist, coach, and author myself I sensitive to the following problems-which, though present, are less of an issue in this book than in most:1. The reader is often given mixed messages or frankly contradictory ones. Sloppy inconsistencies detract from what otherwise is a more polished work.For example, in describing the phosphate energy system, the author on page 2 states that the amount of stored ATP is sufficient for about 2 seconds of maximum effort. The value doubles on page 10 when he states that the store is exhausted after 4 seconds of effort.Another example: On page 12 the author states that the muscle fiber ratio in any person is basically unchangeable. Later on the same page he states the training stimulus can rebuild white fibers into red fiber.Yet another example: On page 18, in describing how to train the phosphate system, the author states that \\"sprint workouts are not really intervals because recovery is nearly complete.\\" Later, on the same page, in describing how to train the lactate system, the author states: \\"Like the phosphate system, the lactate system can best be trained by interval workouts.\\" The reader is left confused about intervals.2. The author advances a number of teleological augments that I as a scientist reject. For example, he states that since carbohydrates are stored with water, this energy source is heavier than fats; and \\"that is the reason why birds of passage only store fats as fuel.\\"3. Language is sometimes careless:For example: Carbohydrates-sugars, starches, and glucose-are stored...\\" As glucose is an example of a simple sugar, the sentence construction jars me.Another: \\"when the carbohydrate store becomes exhausted, the burning of fats increases.\\" The prevalent current thinking is that fat use is relatively constant at all levels of exertion, and that carbs supply the increased energy needed at higher levels. Better would have been to say: \\"the carbohydrate store becomes exhausted, the percentage contribution of fats burned increases.\\"4. The graphs and tables are plentiful, wonderful. Unfortunately, they are often not well-labeled or not labeled at all. It's therefore sometimes difficult to understand the point that the author is making.5. The author makes questionable statements. For example: \\"whenever the cyclist must let the pack go, acidosis is the most likely cause.\\" I feel that although it's possible that acidosis sometimes limits performance, aerobic capacity and glycogen depletion are two other as likely causes.6. The author risks alienating many in his audience when, in discussing blood levels and the doping agent EPO (erythropoietin) he argues that \\"It is hard to understand why altitude training and hypoxic tents are permitted and EPO is not.\\" He argues that athletes who use banned substances are \\"doping victims\\" who \\"should not be treated as criminals.\\" Although I appreciate his point of view, I don't share it. Athletes who cheat are cheating more than just themselves; they defraud their opponents, sponsors, and spectators. In professional sport, cheaters take race earnings, salary, and fame away from clean athletes. By introducing such controversial opinions, Janssen casts doubt on his training reasoning in general.As stated at the outset, despite the problems enumerated, this is a great book. A book for athletes, coaches, and sport scientists in many sports-running, cycling, triathlon, rowing, and cross-country skiing..."},{"Title":"Lactate Threshold Training","review":"Next to the book, Rowing Faster, by Dr.Volker Nolte; Lactate Threshold Training,by Dr.Peter Janssen, is also a must have for any coach.Xeno MullerOlympic Medalist,men's single scull rowing"},{"Title":"Lactate Threshold Training","review":"Lactate Threshold Training (LTT), by Dutch MD Peter Janssen is a disappointing and frustrating read. Since my frame of reference is Wilmore, Costill, Billat, Daniels and other great researchers, I expected the same level of scholarship from Janssen. Unfortunately, LTT is poorly researched, and, thanks to Janssen's choppy writing style, often difficult to follow.The problems start in the first paragraph of the preface when Janssen references Conconi, then goes on to say: &quot;Heart rate monitoring of workouts and races, with or without lactate determination, is now essential to athletes and coaches.&quot; Hence, in his opening remarks, Janssen admits that LTT isn't as much about lactate as it is about heart rate (HR). In fact, lactate and lactic acid don't appear in his glossary!Replete with HR graphs and tables, LTT is an odd mixture of fact and fiction from beginning to end. Sadly, fiction plays more than a minor role Janssen's treatise. In a section titled The Lactate System (page 5) he claims that &quot;Muscle soreness is a characteristic of increasing acidosis....&quot; He states further that &quot;The acidosis within the muscle causes miroruputures....&quot; Janssen fails to report that intense workouts that create acidosis frequently do not produce muscle soreness. He also fails to mention that muscle soreness is most likely the result of eccentric muscle contractions. This is just the first of many questionable claims that fill the pages of LTT.Janssen tells us that lactate threshold (LT) and anaerobic threshold (AC) are the same thing, and occur at 4 mmol/l (page 33, graph 21 on page 34). Since numerous researchers have found LT varies greatly from person to person, pegging LT at 4 mmol/l (L4) cannot possibly be right. Janssen, in numerous places, admits as much, but continues to use L4 as if the variations don't matter.Janssen also makes dubious claims regarding the relationship between LT and HR. He describes a phenomenon called heart rate deflection (HRdefl). HR increases linearly with exercise intensity, but only to a certain point. Intensity eventually reaches a high enough level that HR starts to lag behind. In other words, the relationship between HR and intensity ceases to be linear and the HR line begins to curve to the right (graph 24, page 37). The beginning of the curve is HRdefl. This description of HRdefl is fine as far as it goes, but then comes the shaky relationship with LT: &quot;If this speed should be increased beyond the HRdefl, lactate will begin to accumulate. &quot; So, according to Janssen, HRdefl and LT conveniently coincide. There's a small problem, however. Janssen also claims that LT can be in the range of 40% to 65% of VO2max (page34). But VO2max values in that range aren't anywhere near HRdefl. In fact, running at 65% of VO2max is slower than marathon pace!One could go on and on about the nonsense in LLT, but I'll conclude with what I consider the most troubling sentence in the entire book (page 189): &quot;It is hard to understand why altitude training and hypoxic tents are permitted and EPO is not.&quot; Is Janssen advocating the use of performance enhancing drugs, or has his poor writing and sloppy style left him misunderstood? I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But there's no doubt the difference between live-high/train-high and live-high/train-low has somehow eluded doctor Janssen."},{"Title":"Lactate Threshold Training","review":"I have a master's degree in neuroscience and I'm working on a Ph.D. I read difficult technical journal articles every day.

Yet I found this book almost completely inaccessible due to the author's inability to portray even the simplest of material in a clear and useful way.This book is abyssmal. The writing is poor, although I suspect that this might be due to poor translation. Worse, the figures are hopelessly confusing and unhelpful. Many of the graphs lack units or labels on the axis.

The original volume is quite hard to find and this inexpensive reprint is very welcome. Sternhell and Thorndike remains, after more than 55 years, a unique and highly valuable account of World War II antisubmarine warfare (ASW). Some of the data are incomplete or not fully accurate, owing to its publication before German and Japanese data had been fully weighed -- and also because some parts of the story (such as the impact of communications intelligence) could not then be included due to the relatively low level of classification. But the authors had played leading roles in U.S. Navy efforts to analyze ASW throughout the war and they lay out most crucial aspects of the ASW campaign with a clarity and precision that no subsequent book has even approached. Their treatment is not highly technical -- there is a little bit of mathematics, but nothing to daunt anyone who recalls even the barest rudiments of high school algebra. Most of the quantitative information is conveyed in clear tables, diagrams, and graphs. This book is essential reading, even today, for anyone who wants to understand ASW -- the ASW of World War II, or the ASW of today.(Note: I am the Chief Scientist of the CNA Corp., a non-profit research and analysis institution that is the parent of the Operations Evaluation Group, still serving the nation more than 60 years after its founding at the beginning of World War II.)"},{"Title":"MICHIGAN RIVET CORP.: International Competitive Benchmarks and Financial Gap Analysis","review":"In February, 2006, the new owner of Michigan Rivet Corp. led the company (renamed MRC Industrial Group) into Involuntary Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and dissolution of the company."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"When I had collected the original Sandman issues, I was always intrigued by the cover art as well as the story and illustrations inside.

Most other comic covers are nice, detailed and stylistic, but often plain, uninspired and all-together too similar. The Sandman covers are twisted, gritty and often haunting works which evoke intense feelings in the viewer's mind. Some make you want to look away, others draw you in. Regardless, all the artwork here will leave you eager to explore its nuances and most exquisite facets.In addition to the astounding artwork, a few extra bits and pieces were included to make this more of a complementary package. A short, previously unreleased Sandman story, insightful commentary for every cover, plus some interesting anecdotes and quotes make this a true collector's item. All of the covers are in their original form, free of logos, titles, code-numbers or any other markings which might obscure the aesthetic wonder of these ingenious creations.You're paying ... for 208 pages of extraordinary artwork, writing and design by Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman. This comes down to 8.3 cents a page--a true bargain. If you're not willing to pay 8.3 cents for a wonderful work of art, then you may want to re-evaluate your definition of thriftiness."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"Even though I am not an avid fan of the comic-book genre, this book blew me away. From an artistic standpoint the visual work is top notch and incredible, and the commentary was fascinating. It really inspired me creatively, and made me want to investigate this medium in more depth!"},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"I don't know why I haven't gotten around to reviewing this collection of work before, but it is amazing! As the title suggests, it is the collected covers of the Sandman comic book series that ran from 1989-1996. There are no Sandman stories in here, just the collected covers of all the issues and some commentary on the covers and The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman himself.\\"Just.\\" I love this book. It's \\"Art\\" with a capital \\"A.\\" So many different styles, forms, and moods. It's beauty and magic captured on paper. It calls to mind art as diverse Edward Gorey, Salvadore Dali, the movies of Tim Burtn, and on one startling cover even H.R. Geiger (in a non-Aliens way).The introduction is very nice too.I recommend this for any fan of the Sandman series."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a Friend, I was familiar with McKeans art from the comics and she had recently gotten into his work... So i thought it'd make a good gift.It was a great gift! I looked through the book thoroughly myself and was amazed at not just the artwork but the presentation of it throughout. McKean and Neil Gaiman's Commentry and Notes throughout are both Fascinating and sometimes hilarious. (Ah the Fish...)I'm gonna pick up a copy for myself, as this really is an Amazing book... ArtFans or ComicFans alike will appreciate just how Beautiful Mckeans Art is."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"If you've ever read any of the Vertigo's SANDMAN stories, you've probably have seen some of Dave McKean incredible cover illustrator work. He has illustraded, also, some classics, like Arkham Assylum, Black Orquid, etc...In this book, we're shown the magnitute of his talent throughout Sandman series, have comments on each cover, plus a previously unreleased Sandman story!"},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"At first, I as disappointed. It's not a Sandman story. (OK, I came in late. Everyone else read Sandman long ago.)That passed fast. Everything about this book is amazing. Big things first: The art, the reason I picked it up, shows very advanced craftsmaship. The pictures are built from striking elements, composed well, and worked heavily. Everything is fair game: figure, watercolor, found objects, photography, ... all of it. I like Nick Bantock and I like the best of David Mack. Bantock overdoes sometimes, and gives a muddy image. Mack doesn't always reach the real limits of the medium. McKean does not suffer either flaw, except sometimes with type. Words can not capture the images.On a lower plane, the book itself is wonderful composition. These are small things, but they matter to me: the printing, the book design, and the page layout all bolster the imagery. The physical book is heavy, glazed paper; it has substance in my hand. The whole book is consistent: description on the left page, cover art on the right. Once that rhythm is set, there is room for wide variation. I will not mistake the sketches, negatives, and notes for the cover art, though. Comments left, covers right. Anything else can vary.Within the lefthand commentary, there is yet more discipline. The artist and writer alternate in their own voices, and rubrics describe the materials and provenance of the art. Fonts and column position on the page change, even overlap. The visual structure is so clear, though, that the overlap is not interference; the mix of fonts is message, not mess. The rest of the page is open to any format, as long as I know how to extract the meaning.I was disappointed at first - well, I'm wrong a lot. If you like an artist's monograph and like the first-person commentary, it's a good bet that you will like this. Whether you do or not, I do."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"Dave McKean has vision. His art trancends mediocrity, transporting you to a place where true creativity reigns supreme. The art is interspersed with colorful, sometimes humorous, anecdotes by McKean and Sandman writer Neil Gaiman. Every page of this book is a treat. Even if you have every Sandman issue ever published, you'll want to compare the original covers to the art in this book. Unencumbered by logos, etc. and printed with higher quality inks on better paper -Dust Covers is an unparalelled showcase for one of the most visionary artists of the 20th (and soon - the 21st) century."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"What's in it: All the covers of all the Sandman issues, covers form the hardcover and softcover collections, many non-Sandman photographs by Mckean and other Sandman images. To give this book the little extra, most covers are commented by McKean and Gaiman, and there is a little Sandman Story.My opinion: If you like the covers, then get this book. It is the only &quot;Art&quot;-book that I have and would recomend.P.S.: I am refering here to the Titan Books edition, which has been out for a while and will probably be the same as the US version."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"I have been a fan of Dave Mckean for a long time but I always felt that his art excelled the most in the covers that he made for Sandman, other Vertigo comics and some CD covers. So I was waiting for this kind of book for a long time. This book contains many of the best works of Dave Mckean, who I believe to be one of the best artists that appeared in our century. Dave Mckean reaches deep into your unconscious, he speaks in a wordless world of dreams that your soul must travel to find the forgotten truth inside you. His paintings seem like a web of photographs taken from a dream.30th of August of 1999"},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"This is not a comic book.

But until now it's never been possible to see them without logos and titles and the like. Dave McKean has unfathomable talent, incredible creativity, and a curious fixation on fish, all of which are beautifully presented. Between Dave and Neil Gaiman (who provides us with the delightful Last Sandman Story), this book, like so much of their other work together, is stunning."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"If you are a Neil Gaiman or Dave McKean completist, you need a copy of this book. This is a collection of all Dave McKean's covers for Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. The full-colour reproductions are all comic-sized, minus all the text, UPC codes, etcetera which detract from the artistic detail. Neil Gaiman explains the thought processes which went behind the covers, and lets us in on a few in-jokes. Dave McKean supplies additional concept sketches and photos. Gaiman and McKean make great art together. I hope they continue to collaborate."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"Dave McKean is the most gifted graphic artist I know. I conside him a true heir of Francis Bacon, Savinio and Magritte; yet he is completely original. His work is recognizable at first sight (I easily spotted a cover of a Front Line Assembly CD as McKean's work), and impossible to imitate. The reason is that he is in love with experimentation. You can copy ideas and poetics, but not craft and virtuosity (in this sense, he is more like Bacon than Magritte, whose technique was mediocre). You can disagree with the violence of some images, but still you'll be surprised and fascinated; the images will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Collected Sandman Covers, 1989-1997","review":"For years Neil Gaiman has built up a reputation for producing beautiful artwork; this despite the complicated adult nature of many of his works.By meshing together various media, ink, paint, photography and so on he has produced 'dark' pictures with mature themes. It is no coincidence perhaps that his illustrations have accompanied books with similar themes; which is why he was commissioned to prepare covers for these books and graphic novels.This collection of his work throws together many examples from his diverse range of work, leaving the reader reeling from the feast in front of him. It will be quite a while before you see images as arresting, and illuminating, as those gathered here.For anyone with any kind of love of artwork, or for fans of Mr Gaiman alike, you'll be opening this book for years..."},{"Title":"Contemporary Russian drama","review":"Contains the five plays:\\"Alive Forever\\" by Victor Rozov\\"A Petrarchan Sonnet\\" by Nikoai Pogodin\\"The Naked King\\" by Evgeny Shvarts\\"Its Been Ages!\\" by Vera Panova, and\\"A Warsaw Melody\\" by Leonid Zorin"},{"Title":"Mary Kelly (Contemporary Artists (Phaidon))","review":"Lots of great images and info about Mary Kelly's important but hard to find art. It's a pity the texts aren't better. The interviewer (Douglas Crimp) embarrassingly doesn't seem to know much about Kelly's work, and the critical takes aren't really new or deep.Overall, the new Phaidon series is beautifully-produced, but not really up to the standards the series once set, when it published more significant critical work and scholarhsip.

ALIVE! However, an amulet he wore for protection had cast Richard from the 15th century to the 21st century when he was in danger. But Richard was not yet king when he was zapped forward. His brother, Ned, was. Then his brothers, Ned and George, were sent to the 21st century by the Grand Wizbar, followed later by Elizabeth!Dorothy, Annie's friend, was making a movie about King Richard the Third. Richard changed the script in an attempt to rewrite history. A nosy reporter, &quot;Babbling Brooke&quot;, got involved too. Soon all three members of the royal family were losing their hearts to three extra ordinary women!When the 15th and 21st century clash things get amusing fast! This is a swift paced book that, if you keep your mind of who's who, is full of wit and will keep you smiling as you read!"},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"When the usual psychic can't make it to act as medium for the annual s&eacute;ance to summon the slain King Richard's spirit, Annie Spooner steps in. She's the longest standing member of the Richard III Society. A scholar, she's published several books about him. Rather than summoning a ghost, however, the s&eacute;ance has the unexpected result of the real Richard's arrival.Actually, an amulet given by his brother brings him to the twenty-first century when his life is endangered. With no way back to his own time, Richard settles into exploring his new world, from peanuts at the market to borrowed designer jeans that don't fit. Soon the Grand Wizbar sends his brothers, Ned and George, followed later by Elizabeth as she pursues Ned in a quest to fulfill true love.Richard soon learns of the filming of his story. Of course he steps in, first to correct history, but soon to rewrite it. He lands the part of himself, along with his brothers in appropriate roles. Combined with poltergeist activity, and women who shape each of three time traveling men's destinies, the result is a fabulous romp.Past, present and future fuse in a hysterically inaccurate timeline that will keep readers in stitches in ONE TOO MANY TIMES. This revisionist history combines wizardry, windows 2000 and wondrous impossibility in a marvelous original manner. Characterizations are believable, implausible, and a touch ridiculous, and the plotting even more so. Yet the result is a mesh of the old with new, the impossible with the improbable and a profound overlay of humor. Move over Mel Gibson and Shakespeare for Diana Rubino's eclectic blend that will keep readers enthralled. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"I laughed out loud a lot while reading this book. The characters are all larger than life, and the romance sizzles. A romping read you will not forget in a hurry. More like this one please. As for the historically inaccurate, well, you have obviously never read an single one of all Ms Rubino's other excellently-researched books!"},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"The only praise that can be given to the author of this book is her original idea to take characters from history and put them in a new situation, intead of sticking with the unmovable plot and re-writing actual events as &quot;history with dialog&quot;, as the genre of historical fiction has been called. But that is the ONLY praise that can be given. This book was so silly and badly written that I had to force myself to finish it. I avidly read anything Richardian but I would advise any history buff to just say no to this novel."},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"Since September 11 I have been unable to concentrate on anything except the news, but this fun book kept me reading and made me smile.

Diana Rubino is funny and original."},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"I love the detail the author put into the past and present, making the story richer and more fulfilling. I found it very endearing that the king gave up his throne to be with his brother. Back then sometimes rivals were killed to ensure the throne.

The story did drag slightly when they worked on the screenplay but I felt it still deserved its high rating. - Theresa B."},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"\`Annie Spooner locked up her three-hundred-year-old cottage and headed for her annual pilgrimage within the ruins of Middleham Castle. She tried to forget that another year had slipped by and it was now the five-hundred-twenty-fifth anniversary of King Richard III's death in the Battle of Bosworth.... Every August 22, they held a s&eacute;ance to summon the slain king's spirit. Lady Dorothy Ludham, a leading psychic, acted as medium. Richard's spirit appeared every time, splendidly attired in kingly raiment, a glittering crown atop his head. He would visit with them briefly, then return to the great beyond, leaving them speechless with wonder.' But this year Dorothy couldn't make it leaving the duty of summoning the spirit of Richard to Annie.Annie, who has no psychic abilities, goes through the steps she has heard Dorothy do for several years. As the pressure from the other members of the s&eacute;ance builds, she actually forgets the words to the chant and assumes this would be one year without the king's presence. Annie couldn't have been more wrong. She didn't actually summon the spirit but the actual man himself. King Richard, III was transported from 1463 to 2010.When his brothers Edward and Charles find him missing they go to the one person they know has to be behind the disappearance - Ulch the Grand Wizbar. After much discussion, Edward, who is actually King at the time, decide they must find a way to help their brother. So, with the help of Ulch, they travel to the year 2010 to be with their brother.What do you get when you take 3 members of the 1463 Royal family and transport them to 2010? You're reading one of Diana Rubino's books, you get laughter. I don't know that I've ever read a book that has made me smile and laugh with the turn of every page. Rubino has taken characters from two worlds, combined their differences and blessed us with a book that I feel would make a very enjoyable, funny movie. This is one that Mel Brooks needs to read."},{"Title":"One Too Many Times","review":"The author Diana Rubino has managed to weave three love stories into one, and also such a vivid cast of characters that yo will remember Babbling Brooke long after you have read the novel.

I have loved the game for my entire life, but I never realized so much preparation goes into every little aspect of the game. George Will covers each part of the game - pitching, hitting, and fielding - by observing and interviewing some of the greats of the game; Hershiser on pitching, Gwynn on hitting, Ripken on fielding, and Larussa on putting it all together.George Will quoted Wes Westrum in this book - &quot;Baseball is like church. Many attend, but few understand.&quot; This book increased my understanding of the game and as a result has added to my enjoyment of baseball. I see things I didn't see before I read this book - the nuances of the game have become more clear.I did not believe I could love the game more, but after reading this book, I do! I would highly recommend this book to both students of the game and to newcomers looking to understand the game."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors as the coaches meet before a game, or how much sign stealing really ocurrs? The answers to these questions and much more about the behind-the-scenes goings on of the great game of baseball are in this magnificent book by the conservative political columnist George F. Will. Will takes you behind closed doors with Tony LaRussa, the best manager in the game. He also takes you to the pither's mound with Orel Hershiser, to the batter's box with Tony Gwynn, and to the shortstop's position with Cal Ripken, Jr. And when he gets you there, he explains every thing that is going on in everyone's head and he does it with stunning detail, and first-hand knowledge that will keep you begging for more after you finish. Will's book is a must have for even the casual baseball fan."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"If you have ever had any doubt that baseball is a slow paced, boring sport that withers in comparison to football, basketball, and hockey, then this book is definitely for you. In it, George Will explains the simple pleasures of baseball and the tremendous perfections in which it involves. He goes into great detail of the managers roles, the pitchers roles, the batters roles, and the fielders roles, focusing mainly on Tony LaRussa, Orel Hershieser, Tony Gwynn, and Cal Ripken respectively, but often throwing in stories of other baseball greats. Will gives tremendous insite of the finer points of the game which should be appreciated by any true sports fan. He shows how baseball is not only a game of physical skill, but of tremendous mental skill, and a little bit of luck. I found this book to be amazingly interesting and insiteful. Already being a baseball fan it taught me to enjoy the game on a whole knew level, the strategic level of it and I highly recommend it to any baseball fan, or sports fan for that matter."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"So insightful and so true, even 10 years after the book was published. A must for any fan of THE GAME."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This is a fascinating journey into the national pastime. George Will writes economically and wisely not only about what the game is, but also what it once was. The evolution of the sport - although that is certainly not the focus of the book - is illuminating for anyone who is interested in how institutions come to change. Will brings a deep explanation to the chief facets of the game - managing, pitching, hitting and defense. Ultimately they groove together to form a gorgeous tapestry of understanding. There's a word for this kind of non-fiction work: indispensable."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"If you enjoy the sport of baseball, you gotta read this book. George Will provides insights into the details of baseball by examining the game from the perspective of the Manager, the Batter, the Pitcher and the Fielder. It's wonderful the descriptions of the minute aspects that make the difference between a regular player and someone with the skills like future Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. I've read this book many times, and I never tire of the stories of how this game is meant to be played. You will enjoy the game even more after reading this book."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will does a great job of detailing great figures in the history of baseball and the changes over the last 100+ years.

Still a good book for baseball fans."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"As Woody Allen's dalliance with Soon Yi ruined his films for many film buffs (especially New York reviewers), George Will's penetrating and often disturbing political commentary seems to have colored Men At Work for some reviewers below. Pay them no mind. Men At Work is a brilliant distillation of the insights of several brilliant Baseball Men who Work very well indeed.Men At Work is faintly scholarly in tone - use a dictionary if you must (I didn't need one). For us non-scholars, though, if the mechanics of baseball is of interest, this book is for you.An Example: Tony La Russa outlines nine basic ways to run the double steal - and the defense's proper response to them all. I had no idea! We didn't get this in Little League (on the other hand they don't call it the Big Leagues for nuthin')!Here's another: An explicit split second analysis of stealing second base - it demonstrates almost beyond doubt that you steal on the pitcher - not the catcher (which perhaps shows that Will is biased against pitchers or in favor of catchers - a form of Baseball Politics?)Will shows that when Gywnn is (no, WAS) pulling the ball, his timing was off, and why this was true.Men At Work is not sentimental - if you want the Boys of Summer you won't find it here. What you will find is uncommon insight from some of baseball's best presented by a clearly devoted and talented writer."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I put down &quot;Men At Work&quot; with a profound sense of disappointment. I passionately love the sport of baseball. There is no feeling quite like sitting in the stands on a hot summer night and watching two teams play nine innings. I passionately love books about baseball- David Halberstam's &quot;October 1964&quot; being the favorite of the genre. I liked Will's 1998 follow up to this book, which was published in 1990. But I did not like &quot;Men At Work&quot;. Here's why-&quot;Men At Work&quot; reads like a tech manual. Hit, run, pitch, field. Okay fine, but when one distills baseball into such an exact science the passion leaves the game. &quot;Men At Work&quot; makes baseball into a game of economics- put in pitcher W against hitter X because he has a Y-to-Z ratio between his groundball outs and flyball outs . . . This is not why I love baseball.Also, after a while Will's observations become redundant. George we spent fifty pages learning about the strategy employed by Tony Gwynn in hitting, why do we have to read twenty pages recapitulating the same things from Wade Boggs?If you want to read a good baseball book, read &quot;October 1964&quot; or &quot;Bunts&quot;. Don't read &quot;Men At Work&quot;."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will shows his passion for the game in this work. As a baseball fan myself I can appreciate the technical aspects of the game and therefore this work. If you are no more than a casual fan I am not sure this is the book for you. If you are an avid fan, however, or wanting to learn more about the intricacies of the game then this book is for you. In lengthy detailed interviews from some of the games best you'll learn about all the little things that go on during a baseball game that you simply can't get from a box score. Pitching, coaching, managing, defense and hitting are all covered. Will addresses them all adequately and with quality, classy athletes. A must read for any true fan, old or new. While the players are retired now it is still worth any young baseball fans read. It will give you a much greater appreciation for the game as a whole. I can't wait for Spring Training."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"My husband is an avid Yankee fan and bought this book for him for fathers day. He was ecstatic and reads it constantly. Great book for any baseball fan."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This is a fantastic book on baseball that was ahead of its time. A couple of interesting historical points emerge from these pages. First, there is the link between Will's profile of La Russa and the A's and Michael Lewis' later look at Billy Beane in \\"Moneyball.\\" Second, there is the fact that, of the individuals he profiles, only Orel Hershiser never really became Hall of Fame caliber (while Gwynn and Ripken did). Third, there is Will's use of Bill James' stats and insights, which has become commonplace among younger baseball writers. This is a great read during the cold months of winter."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I am definitely enjoying this book. I'm sure any baseball fan would feel the same."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will did a great job in provideing insight into the minds of baseball greats Tony Gwinn, Tony LaRussa, Cal Ripken & Orel Hershiser.There is a great deal of information provided about the preperation and thinking that the subjects put into their profession.

What if baseball were your job? How is working baseball different than playing baseball?There is the premise of Men at Work. Baseball is a job.

Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn. The other two workers, Tony LaRussa and Orel Hershiser, are no slouches.The text is somewhat dated. It does not consider the steroid era or the parallel home run record orgy.

If you want to learn more about the ins and outs of baseball, this is a great book to start with because it also gives a number of different perspectives from a number of key positions in the game."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Picking players such as Orel Hershiser, Tony Gwynn, and Cal Ripken Jr to analyze made the book extremely enjoyable for me as two out of three of them were players I was able to regularly watch. All three of them were players with high integrity and strong character. Had Will chosen the Albert Belle and Roberto Alomar types of characters to highlight, I would have never bought the book.Will dissected the game of baseball down to it's intimate points that are easy to forget when watching the game (especially on TV).

The sport and the business of it has evolved and changes. its not just a game anymore"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"A great book to inform those who think baseball is &#34;slow&#34; or &#34;boring&#34;. It is truly amazing what all is going on in the minds of the position players, pitchers, hitters and managers at any given time during the game and George Will describes it very well indeed. You won't watch baseball the same way again. It doesn't hurt that true pros like Tony Gwinn, Orel Hershiser, Cal Ripken and Tony La Russa were the &#34;authorities&#34; used to illustrate the intricacies of the game."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I bought this book for my son.

I've grown up with the game and this is one of the best books that I've read concerning how the game should be played.I've read several books about particular players and their backgrounds, but this is the first book that I would recommend to a potential ballplayer."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Although the characters are dated, this book is still the definitive look inside a baseball game. The players are all from the 80's and 90's (Cal Ripken, Tony Gwynn, Orel Hershiser) but the manager profiled is Tony Larussa who is still in business and you will see why. His game-prep is phenomenal!I loved this book, and if you enjoy baseball, you will love this book as well. One of the few baseball books to read with a highlighter!!"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this reduced baseball to a tech manual, removing the passion. I got the impression that Will enjoys baseball because it allows him to feel sophisticated. I enjoy baseball because it's a thinking man's game, but half of that equation is GAME, with competition, passion and celebration for the winners. At best, Will captures some of that passion in his book. But more often than not, it makes it seem more of an engineered factory product.There are occasions when I really enjoyed the book. I love baseball, and I do love the minutia. It's fun getting behind the scenes to watch Tony LaRussa's coaches work together, and to see the pure hitting mechanics from a master like Gwynn. But I suppose the simplest way to put it is--it's too much of a good thing at times, it becomes mundane, repetitive and boring way too often. Even more advanced baseball writing (i.e. Hardball Times, Baseball Prospectus) tends to be a lot more fun than this. Check out any of Halberstam's books, or John Updike's essay about Ted Williams' last game titled \\"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,\\" if you want pure literary baseball magic.One last thing--consider these two baseball titles. \\"Men at Work\\" versus \\"The Boys of Summer.\\" Interesting the different images they bring to mind. I prefer the latter."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will's &quot;Men at Work&quot; was written out of his love for the game, and &quot;the game inside the game.&quot; The book features extended interviews with baseball luminaries Tony LaRussa, Orel Hersheiser, Tony Gywnn and Cal Ripken jr. It is divided into sections on managers, pitchers, hitters, and defensive play. Will states that baseball is about paying attention, about the myriad details that make up each pitch, each play, each out.At times the book bogs down into a tech manual, giving even the most enthusiastic readers a little too much detail; at other times Will's rightwing political bias does emerge in the guise of a discussion of a strong work ethic, individual initiative for personal gain, and nostalgic idealization of the past.But taken as a whole, &quot;Men at Work&quot; is a paean to what used to be called &quot;America's favorite pastime&quot;. Will demonstrates why baseball appeals on many levels to a wide range of people. As a lifelong fan, someone who has never tired of the game because however lopsided the score, there is always something to pick up on (see Tony LaRussa's quote above), I recommend the book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will's passions for America's great pastime is evident in every story. He goes behind the scenes for the details and strategy that is involved in every pitch. His look at the manager, pitcher, hitter and fielder will add insight to the game and garner a deeper appreciation of the game within the game. A great baseball book!"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This extraordinarily written masterpiece provides the reader with an insider look at our national pastime. Will writes with an educationally objective, yet personal style that grabs you from page 1. I didn't want to finish it; I wanted more. Will, like the men he features, is a master of his craft. A must read."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This somewhat outdated book (written in late '80s) is an ambitious compendium of the skills employed by some of the best players and managers of the game. Through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, Orel Hershiser, Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr., Will fees us a Herculean amount of \\"inside baseball.\\" Perhaps the boatload of statistics and anecdotes are a little too weighty, but Will leavens it with his wit and his solid journalism. Maybe a good baseball fan doesn't need to know all that Will gives us. But as a former baseball fanatic who lost interest for decades, I found it very enjoyable to take a refresher course in the ins and outs of our national pastime and be reminded why I love the game so much. A solid, notable baseball book by a devoted fan."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will turns his focus to baseball's technicalities through the eyes of pros like Tony Gwynn, Cal Ripken, Tony LaRussa, etc. The result is an educational look at pitching, catching, managing, defense, and other facets of the national pastime circa 1990. These pages provide valuable insight seldom covered by the oft-trivial sportswriting that rarely examines strategy. These pages provide insight for hardcore fans, students of the game, coaches, players, etc. Unfortunately, Will's thick prose makes for rather stiff reading - perhaps he should stick to political columns, where his prose at least, is much better. Hardcore fans might enjoy this book, but could be better directed towards BASEBALL FOR BRAIN SURGEONS by Tim McCarver, and Roger Kahn's HEAD GAME (about pitching)."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Will includes tons of fascinating insights and anecdotes, but the writing is ponderous. He seems unable to be agile in explaining anything. Statistics are frequently presented in far more volume than necessary to prove the point in question. There are misspellings and sentences which simply do not scan. This book seems to have lacked a strong, intervening editor. The result is a book at least 30% longer than it needs to be. In addition, although its 4 stars are still active in baseball, a great deal has changed since then including interleague play, smaller parks, the big home run totals, the even greater importance of the closer, the money -- this book is in big need of an update. It's also surprising that he never really addresses free agency. If he were writing it today, he would need to discuss salary cap and realignment."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I am a fan of baseball and an admirer of George Will. That he wrote such a comprehensive book on our National pasttime makes me smile. However, the book was a bit broader than it needed to be, and the term 'over-analysis' might apply."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This was one of the first books I ever read that tackled the &quot;brains&quot; behind baseball. Since then I've read a bunch of others, including Tom Boswell and Tim McCarver. Like the previous poster, I felt like they all had their head in the 1970s (or earlier). They were missing today's game.The book I found that does what SFGiants Fan wants is one that talks about the modern game, talks about new stadiums and expansion and short benches and deep bullpens and closers and everything is _Off Base_ by Andrew Torrez.Has anyone else here read _Off Base_? It seems to be &quot;Men At Work&quot;, only for 1999, not 1985."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will (Yes, the political columnist) takes a meticulous look at the history and workings of professional baseball, describing the heroes of old and the reasons for changes that have shaped the game. Will's analysis is extremely thorough but sometimes pedantic, so have a dictionary handy. The book really captures the timeles, unchanging quality of the sport. Wasn't a page turner for me, but a good read for baseball purists"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"As the feeling of pain and disagreement comes across me, I sit to read the baseball book by the ultra left-winger and bad bow-tie wearer, George Will.This book focuses on managing(Tony LaRussa), pitching(Orel Hershiser) hitting(Tony Gwynn), and fielding/cosistency(Cal Ripken). The book has a technical feel, but it does not bombard the reader with statistics. It has a preaching attitude, but that Will has pinpoint focus and awesome personal insight into the tasks of baseball.If you are looking at looking inside these aspects...this book is totally for you. If not, the writing of one of our great conservative journalist will impress. One of my favorite reads."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"&quot;Men At Work&quot; is a great, great baseball book. Is it as good as &quot;The Summer Game&quot;, &quot;Five Seasons&quot;, &quot;A False Spring&quot;? Interestingly, it is and it isn't. Technically it is. It contains superb reportage and loving writing about a game George Will adores. But the there is a technology to Will's writing, a one-two-three, a but-for premise that borders on lawyering, advocacy. I love it, yes, but I have to rate this just below the pure romance of Roger Angell or the raunchy, man's-man baseball-as-life stories that infuses Pat Jordan's work. Will has written here a book that precursors &quot;Moneyball&quot;. It describes the new age of baseball, an age of computers and preparation that replaces the Joe Schultz &quot;Let's beat 'em, then pound some Budweiser&quot; era described by Jim Bouton's &quot;Ball Four&quot;.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I'm sorry, but it's not my fault that George Will's political ideas are beyond right field, to the warning track, back, back, back, back - gone.But he writes great baseball.'Course, I'd probably get along with Richard Mellon Scaife if he wrote baseball.It's a Ten, dammit!! Get it!!"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Simply too much categorical, mind numbing data (that isn't actually used on a game-by-game basis) to maintain any sort of interest. If it were a book on chess problems then it may have made sense to break down sooooo many possible variables, but it's not; it's a book loosely based on Will's belief of how the game should really be viewed and it makes osmosis seem exciting.As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception. I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"The point of this book - unlike Keith Hernandez's fine &quot;Pure Baseball&quot; - is not really to instruct the baseball adept in the subtleties of the game. It is to present &quot;portraits of greatness&quot; - the sort of thing John McPhee (to whose lofty prose standard Will comes admirably close) did for Bill Bradley in &quot;A Sense of Where You Are&quot;. It's a genre that I particularly enjoy and I think Will makes a solid case for all four of his subjects. Very enjoyable reading.(As the title suggests, much of Will's hero worship here seems to be driven by a sense of his own inadequate masculinity. But what would you expect from a guy who wears a bow-tie?)"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"As a long time fan of the game, I appreciate insights new to me, especially in the La Russa section. However, in typical George Will fashion, he completely ignores the big issues in order to make his point on minor ones. For example, on hitting, he totally misses the importance of power. It's not that 50 HR w/ 150 SO and 50 BB is ideal, it's that 40 HR + 120 BB and a mediocre batting average leave Gwynn on the second team.On the other hand, what can you expect from a man who thinks that the First Amendment guarantees that the the paid speech of corporate lobbyists displaces the free speech of citizen constituents?"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This book was recommended to me, but I have not had an opportunity to read it. The book arrived quickly and in fine condition."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Received the book in a timely fashion!

If you want to learn more about the game, this is a must read. Jam packed with everything about baseball, from managerial strategy to hitting. You will know more than you did before about the national pastime. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Men at Work is a wonderful piece of writing that gives its readers a solid understanding of what it takes -- both physically and mentally -- to make it in the complex world of baseball. Some may find it a difficult, slow read, but compared to his political columns, Will really dumbs it down. I guess he realizes that baseball is not a sport enjoyed by Harvard-educated intellectuals. But the book itself is refreshingly intellectual, due to Will's dedicated study of the game and his (and the subjects' of the book) attention to detail. The only setback of the book is that, it may seem a little outdated. There is hardly any talk of free agency, revenue sharing, expansion, etc. Of course, this book was written before the big salary boom of the 1990s. Expansion was far off and the lack of competitive balance had yet to become an issue.This book is excellent, nearly perfect, in fact. Subjects for Men at Work II might include Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Ivan Rodriguez, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciapara, or Joe Torre (Lou Piniella would most likely offer a wonderful look at modern managers). Hopefully, Will realizes that there is still much to be learned on the part of fans everywhere. We could use another book, George."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"The quintesential book on baseball. Insights of the game told by an author who understands the game within the game. A must read for all serious fans."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will is a witty columnist, television personality and author that has won many awards over the duration his career. He spends most of his time writing columns for Newsweek and The Washington Post. Also, he makes appearances on the ABC network commenting on political issues. My focus is on his 1990 number one best selling book that stayed on top for over two months, \\"Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball.\\"Many books are available today that focus on the game of baseball. There are all sorts of reading material obtainable if you are looking for such things as history of the game, pitching strategies, tips for hitting and the list goes on. Nobody else but George Will can bring all of these elements into one clever written piece of literature.Will breaks his book down into four main branches of baseball. He focuses on the managing, pitching, hitting and defending aspects of the game. This is done with the help of some protracted interviews with some of baseballs legends. In the managing section he interviews Tony La Russa, one of baseballs' great all time managers. He provides insightful details on getting the winning edge over the opponent. \\"He is responsible for wringing the last drop of advantage from the situations that will occur in each game. To do this he must know the abilities his players have revealed in their past performances and he must have similar knowledge of the players in the opposite dugout\\" (Wills 7). With his vast knowledge of the game, Will certainly communicates to us how meticulous managers have to be to become successful.In the next three sections he gives us a very informative look at baseball interviewing Orel Hershiser for pitching, hitting with Tony Gwynn and defense with Cal Ripken, all of which are legend of the game. He focuses in on these sections just as he did for the first section, full of enlightening insight of strategy and looking extremely close of the inter workings of the game. Not just through his eyes but also through the eyes of these great players. Will also portrays the game of baseball as a difficult sport to master because \\"baseball is a game of failure, even the best batters fail about sixty five percent of the time\\" (Will 1). Many people don't appreciate the level of skill it takes to be able to either thrown a 90mph pitch or hit a 90mph pitch. Will makes it clear that constant effort and much practice is needed to succeed at the game of baseball.I found that this book is for the baseball blooded competitor that wants every advantage possible when playing the game. Although, Will might be over-analyzing America's national pastime to the point of exhaustion, he makes us realize that there is more to the game than just playing it. He makes us realize that baseball doesn't ride on talent by itself but hard work and determination gets players to the next level.I think George Will has written a great book that has definitely put a solid image of what it take to be a ballplayer in the readers head, not just physically but mentally. He has broken down the barrier of the unknown and has taken us through an insider's look of what baseball is really all about. Baseball on the outside is just a simple game where most would agree that only physical challenges are met. But Will shows us the professional baseball mind and how the game gets so much more complex as the competition grows stronger. One cannot help but gain an understanding and a deep appreciation for the game of baseball through all of his Will's insightful words and thorough analysis of some of the greatest players that ever lived."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"Will's approach and in-depth analysis make this a tantalizing read for the fan. The reader will never look at a game the same way again. Every situation - from four perspectives - pitcher, batter, defense &amp; manager. The games within the game. While the individuals Will has selected are, in some cases past their peak or retired, the book is nonetheless timeless because it is about the game, not the players. And this is one game that never changes."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"As expected, this book is a concise and insightful trip into America's favorite sport. The author is both knowledgeable and objective about the evolution of the game in the last half of the 20th century. It makes for good reading even if you are not well versed in the sport."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"This is a great book if you want to understand baseball better. His Chapter on defense is particularly helpful."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George Will was always thought of a Conservative think tank columnist until he wrote a book on baseball. To his credit, his approach is, if not unique, then refreshing. He takes a micro-look at baseball, while focussing on some of the bright lights of the era of the late 1980's and early 1990's. Tony LaRussa from a managing perspective, Tony Gwynn from a hitting perspective, Cal Ripken, from fielding and Orel Hershiser from pitching.Will looks at the day to day preparation of each of these athletes, and how they approach their sport 162 days a year.He has chosen fine models for his investigation. Gwynn had a cerebral and focussed hitting approach that was so thoughtful, and so advanced, that he could have come from several decades in the future. Ripken set a standard for high level consistency that may never be challenged. And Hershiser, like Ron Guidry before him, may never be a Hall of Famer, but soared to heights for a few a seasons that few have ascended.Tony LaRussa, as of this writing is still an active manager, and is still in the elite of baseball dugout management.This is a highbrow look at professional baseball, and is a precursor to Michael Lewis' excellent book, \\"Moneyball.\\"Will has a passion for baseball, and I am glad he shared this book. It is a highly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"As those who read him know, George Will is a huge baseball fan in addition to being one of the country's preeminent political and social commentators.In \\"Men at Work\\", four men who were marquee figures in major league baseball at the turn of the 1990s gave Will interviews that shed light on the intricacies of the game: a manager (Tony LaRussa), a pitcher (Orel Hershiser), a hitter (Tony Gwynn), and a fielder (Cal Ripken). Will also interviewed numerous others in this book that will teach even seasoned fans much about the national pastime.In the book, Will takes on controversies such as the designated hitter and aluminum bats. One of the issues much talked about nearly twenty years ago and taken up in the book, artificial turf, has waned since then, as most franchises have since built new stadiums that have grass playing surfaces.As in his political columns, Will brings forth a seemingly innumerable number of interesting statistics and little-known facts. George Will is also simply fun to read; he has a masterly command of the English language and has one of the best writing styles you will ever encounter. Even if you are only somewhat interested in baseball, you will enjoy \\"Men at Work\\"."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I originally picked up this book on the strength of Will's political writings. I didn't expect an awful lot, but was very surprised when I found that Will actually knows the game....better than most people, even. Delving into baseball's past and yet staying connected to the present and looking into the future, Will gives the reader a very clear picture of how the game is played at the professional level, detailing many of the subtleties and minutiae that must be mastered to attain that level. At times a little dry and over-statistical, the book is filled with many informative and amusing quotes and anecdotes which make the book an overall pleasure to read. Highly recommended for any semi-serious student of the game."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"The book does provide some very interesting stories and the premise of the book is a good one, but George Will somehow manages to mess it up. I found the book to be very incoherent, jumping from one thing to the next with little, if any, transition. The book has everything, except good writing. I never thought I would say that about George Will, but it is true."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"I bought this book thinking that Will would provide some of his philosphical interpretations of the outwardly lighthearted lyrics of the popular 80's band from Australia, Men At Work. I always thought there was a lot more to the band then what everyone saw on MTV, and finally, this famous, great thinker was going to tell the world what I had always known about the group. Man, was I disappointed. I read thru the first 7 pages, and there was no reference to the band. I thought he was just working up to it - describing what a complex and artful sport baseball was, and then I figured he was going to surmise that the band was like baseball, in that it was also complex and artful. But it just never happened.My friends told me I was stupid for making that assumption, because the sub-title of the book is &quot;the craft of baseball&quot;. But I just figured that was one of Will's typical nonsensical references - you know, like when he's talking about Clinton having sex with Monica, and then he throws in something about Sir Thomas Moore leading the Knights of Plantagenet to Victory over Hirohito's armies of Luddites or something. Who could blame me for thinking this book was Will's treatise on how the veggemite sandwich impacted the anglo-christian societies of the 80's or something?Well anyway, if you're a serious fan of the band &quot;Men at Work&quot;, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"there is a tendencey among well educated baseball fans to make this great game out to be more then it is. George Will is an extreme example of this. Much of this is overwritten,and overblown which is too bad, beacause the subjects written about{cal Ripken, Tony Gwynn and the overrated-underrated Tony La Russa}are quite interesting,though Mr Will turns this book, somehow into a polemic on American values,thereby losing any credibility. Strange. A far,far better example of baseball wriitng exists in Thomas Boswells collections or anything by Roger Angel. This is the equivalent of a $2,000,000 a year utility infielder:overpaid and not worth the money."},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"George F. Will is better than just about any other author I know in using flowery prose to mask what I consider to be his biggest problem; namely, his failure to communicate with readers and hold their interest.Instead of being the insightful and introspective look into the game of baseball its author hoped for, it comes across as pretentious and muddled. While I love baseball, I found this book to be inane and boring.As far as I'm concerned, &quot;Men at Work&quot; represents Will's swing at a 3-2 outside pitch. I hope he never writes a book about golf.

Thank you for the book and sorry it took so long for the feedback.Trust this seller.~R~"},{"Title":"Men at Work","review":"A few disclaimers are in order on this review. As is generally known, George Will is a prominent conservative pundit, one of the apostles of the \\"free-market\\" ideology that lies in shambles at our feet, after Wall Street hit up Washington for a few trillion to tide them over their latest performance deficiencies; sufficient coins to buy quite a few food stamps. Will might not have reconsidered his position on the financial markets, but he does think, and has recently come out against the war in Afghanistan. In terms of baseball, I listened to all the Pirate games back \\"at the beginning of time,\\" roughly when the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A. But I put baseball aside, along with my complete set of baseball cards, as a thing of early youth, and haven't been back. I have no idea who won the last World Series. The final disclaimer: Will's book is almost 20 years old, so what is the point?The points are as numerous as fireflies on a summer evening in the country. For the willing, as it were, Will expands that small subset of people indicated by New York Giants catcher Wes Westrum who said that baseball is like church: \\"Many attend but few understand.\\" Will eschews the cant and the marketing, and explains what baseball really is all about, in an intelligent way that confirms that the game is the most cerebral of America's sports. He presents the game from four different perspectives, and personifies those viewpoints in the person of key individuals of that area, thus, the Manger is represented by Tony La Russa, The Pitcher by Orel Hershiser, The Batter, Tony Gwynn and the Defensive Player by Cal Ripken. All these players are mere newcomers to one whose baseball \\"heroes\\" come from the \`50's and \`60', yet they are now all \\"old-timers\\" to today's players. One of Will's consistent themes is that those who reach the pinnacle in this game exert tremendous, focused energy attempting to gain the slight statistical advantage in any given situation, and therefore over the long-term, will turn that slender advantage into victories.Will combines both philosophical perspective and a dry wit. For example, he says: \\"So there is an inevitable poignancy inherent in the careers of even the best professional athletes. They compress the natural trajectory of human experience--striving, attaining, declining--into such a short span.\\" Will also discusses the classic baseball movie from the \`80's, \\"Bull Durham.\\" Annie is the heroine, who follows this minor league team, and lends more than solace to one player each season, as she teaches Whitman and Blake to English students at the community college, and says: \\"A guy will listen to anything if he thinks its foreplay.\\"There is one other book I would put in the same category as this one, Russell Chatham's \\"Dark Waters\\" which explained the mysteries of the appeal of fishing to someone who could never see the point, myself.Finally, there is the \\"Say It Ain't So, Joe\\" aspect to this book. The quote, probably apocryphal, is attributed to a disillusioned street urchin who was a baseball fan, and confronted \\"Shoeless Joe Jackson,\\" who was indicted for being in a scheme to fix the 1919 World Series when he played for the Chicago White Sox. We now know that all too often the struggle to gain that slight statistical advantage concentrated on the correct amount of steroids that one should take, and how best to mask the drug abuse.

Our only question is \\"When?\\""},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"This book is a gem. There is no other book about the first Americans that has such an even handed thoughtful analysis of the complex array of data involved in the controversy. Haynes is one of the key players in this controversy and his research has cleared up much of the confusion around what can be considered reliable archaeological evidence of human presence. His work with African elephants throws considerable light on how bones can be broken or otherwise altered by natural processes and appear as pseudoartifacts. The book provides a rich background and is written in a readable style for most scientically literate readers. It should be on the shelf of any anthropologist, archaeologist, geologist, ecologist, or enthusiast interested in the peopling of the Americas at the end of the Pleistocene."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"This book was a thoughtful reinterpretation of the existing data pertaining to the nature of Clovis lifeways and settlement in the New World. Rather than concerning himself with the nature or timing of the first Americans, Haynes introduces an ecological perspective to the study of Clovis, a population movement model in which adopting a very specialized adaptive strategy would enable a 'fugitive' culture such as Clovis to spread rapidly throughout the New World."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"I read this book back in May 2001, and it is a very nice comprehensive book on Paleo Americans. The book is not so technical that a person with some familiarity with paleo science is able to understand and enjoy it. A few of the topics were not things that interest me, but they might interest you. This book covers many subjects, from hafting of Clovis projectiles, to modern replication of butchering, to comparisons of old and new world technology, dispersal, foraging, extinction, adhesives, etc. Well worth the money, and re-reading several times."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"I liked reading this book because, although it appears to be written for specialists, it's very accessible to the interested layman. For me the best part was the presentation and analysis of the archeological evidence of Clovis people in North America. It's striking how scant this evidence is, how difficult it is to discriminate tools from naturally shattered rocks and bone, how difficult it is to gather and date, and, as a result, how little can be said firmly about the first settlers of the Americas. The only thing that's completely for sure is that there have been people living, in your area, for thousands and thousands of years. That's what I learned from this book! And, there were some great pictures of Clovis artifacts, with some paleolithic European stuff, too.About half way through or so, the author started to speculate about the lifeways of the Clovis people. It seemed like he was going way beyond his evidence, whereat I put the book down, and demoted him to four stars. I'm sure he's still reeling. Onward and upward. Interesting to read, if you enjoy archeology."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"I am not sure I know much more about the Clovis culture than I did before reading the book. I even read the conclusions twice to try to 'get it' and since there is so little evidence as to who Clovis people were, where they came from, how they lived, etc. there is very little to conclude. It's like putting together a 1000 piece jig saw puzzle with 200 pieces. You think you know what the final jigsaw puzzle should look like, but you just ... don't ... know .... for sure.I would not recommend this book for a reader who wants to read something from cover to cover. This is a sleeper. IMO, it is a book to back up research or knowledge on Clovis in small dosages."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"The info and analysis on the Clovis period is pretty good. However, the emphasis on the \\"authoritative\\" position that the Clovis people were the first settlers in the face of a tremendous quantity of mounting evidence that Homo sap. settled North and South America at least 20,000 years before Clovis, greatly detracts from the value of the book."},{"Title":"The Early Settlement of North America: The Clovis Era","review":"a lifeless story ... a chore to wade through ...

Let me give an example by relating one of my favorite Jewish jokes, in my own words.Hymie and Sophie owned a little convenience store in a nice Jewish neighborhood, and they made a nice living. However, the neighborhood began to change, the Jews moving to the suburbs and a wave of Catholic immigrants replaced them, working in the growing factories around the city. Their business fell to almost nothing. One day Hymie says to Sophie [please add Yiddish accent here and throughout], \\"you know, if we were Catholics, we would get our business back.\\" So the next day the couple went to the local Catholic church and professed their desire to become Catholics. Father O'Reilly was suspicious and put the pair through months of study and service, but the couple pulled through with honors. On the Sunday they were to be baptized, the whole Catholic community attended, each in his or her best attire. Hymie and Sophie looked radiant. They knelt before the alter, ate the wafer, and the good Father O'Reilly blessed them. Three times to each he said, \\"you're a Catholic,\\" sprinkling the water on them. There followed a great feast and celebration.Well, business did pick up. The couple were doing so well that one day Hymie said, \\"You know, Sophie [add Yiddish accent] we must invite the priest to dinner.\\" Father O'Reilly accepted with pleasure, and showed up Friday evening for dinner. The had some wine and hors d'oeuvres, and Sophie came out of the kitchen with the steaming piece de resistance: a magnificent pot roast. Father O'Reilly was horrified. \\"After all your studies, you don't remember that you must eat fish on Friday!\\" Sophie, mortified, quickly regained her composure. Taking some water from the pitcher, she stood over the pot roast, intoning \\"You're a fish, you're a fish, you're a fish\\" while sprinkling the steaming dish.Now, that is a funny joke! Forever after, when you want to say that you can't change the leopard's spots in Jewish, you just say \\"You're a fish.\\"What is the joke like in the book? It occurs on page 61. I won't repeat the whole joke, but only the last three paragraphs. \\"This is disgraceful!\\" cried the indignant priest. \\"Didn't you promise to abstain from eating meat on Friday?\\" \\"Meat? Who's eating meat?\\" answered the other blandly. \\"This is gefilteh fish.\\" \\"You must take me for a fool!\\" snapped the outraged priest. \\"How can anyone make fish out of meat?\\" \\"The same way you made a Catholic out of a Jew,\\" answered the convert smoothly. \\"I sprinkled water on it!.\\"Isn't that just awful? Lots of adverbs and adjectives (\\"indignant\\" \\"outraged\\" \\"smoothly\\"...) but no subtlety. I invite someone to take these joke and restore their humor.By the way, if you liked my version of the joke, someday I'll tell you \\"I Could Have Saved Mama\\". Now that's a funny joke."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Jewish Humor: From Biblical Times to the Modern Age","review":"This book is so unfunny, so corny, so stupid.I am sorry for not mustering up more intelligent words but this book doesn't deserve an intelligent review.

The only good thing I can say about it is the author said he was biased in his introduction. Reputable authors present information in a responsible, unbiased manner. Schriver presented his information in a judgmental, biased manner. He tried to explain how things really are, but most people don't think as he does -- thank God. For a textbook designed to teach students who will work in a field which pretty much demands that biases and preconceived notions of people and how the world works be foresworn by the practitioner, this book fails to meet the most basic need for social work students: appropriate guidance. I immediately sold this book after my class ended. I remember feeling sorry for the person who ended up purchasing it. Physically, it's in great condition. I cannot say as much about the content.

There are themes in this book comparable to the dumb dums who deny the existence of the holocaust. If you look at nothing else be sure to read pages 51-55 where all of the world's woes are blamed on white Christian heteral sexual males.Unfortunately people of all creeds, all colors and religions, etc have done horrible things throughout our human history; most of this conflict has been same color vs. same color of people.Get your facts right, get beyond an agenda, don't buy into the reverse racism polices of affirmative action, creating clubs or events based on race or color, if you want equality don't hide behind the garbage. Instead get into the real world, treat others as you would be treated, earn things, and don't take things from people because they say you're disadvantaged and essentially not as bright as others, so your test score gets a curve.So many things are sensationalized and uber-hyped today and given more prominence to all the empty-headed know-it-alls that fill classrooms throughout our great nation, but let's face it, if you continue to teach with a one-sided agenda, continue to teach one small part of a story as the whole story then you brainwash people to blame others for their problems. I see this every day in my work, in the classes I have taken, enough is enough.In short YOU are responsible for continuing the cycle of hate that has divided our world along so many lines and denies us the progress we need as humanity."},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work Practice (3rd Edition)","review":"The book was out of stock and communication was good giving a new date for delivery.

The book is not constructed in a clear way, topics run together with no clear transitions, and is poorly written. The author will introduce a theory or define a term by quoting other authors' definitions. Not just one per term, but many for each new term explained. By the time you finish reading that paragraph you have multiple views on a definition, and none of them are clear. I have read over 40 college textbooks and this is by far the worst I have ever had the misfortune to read. The writing style of the author is so atrocious it appears to be a research paper gathered by a fifth-grader!"},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work Practice (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is as clear as mud.

For the life of me, I can't understand why my instructor would select such a terrible book when there are others that are much better. Schriver uses an annoying technique of citing other people's work to try and explain terms when he should simply define them himself. In fact the book is rife with citations that attempt to explain theories, methods and research but instead of clarifying points, this method makes it more confusing. Somebody forgot to tell Schriver that citations are meant to support his points, not make them for him. All in all, it's an extremely choppy read that ends up saying nothing. He also uses multiple paragraphs to explain what he is about to explain and when done reading, I couldn't help but wonder what point he was trying to make. I have no idea how Schriver got this book published, but it's a crime that a qualified editor allowed such tripe to make it into the hands of students that are actually trying to learn. You won't get much out of this book; take a pass unless you are required to buy this book for a class."},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work Practice (3rd Edition)","review":"I had to purchase this book for my MSW program. Unfortunately, since the book was just released this year, there were no \\"used\\" copies available. This book is AWFUL!! By far the worst textbook I have ever had the misfortune of owning. It's so bad I can't even force myself to read it. Schriver (repeatedly) talks about the origins of words [who cares] and lists 3-4 definitions for each one. \\"Smith says it's this.... whereas Jones defines it as...\\" and so on. Pick one already! Rent it if you can. Not worth owning."},{"Title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work Practice (3rd Edition)","review":"Schriver's is a text whose reach exceeds its grasp. The theoretical premise and the structure for the text are good. Schriver argues that there are biases in traditional approaches to various systems and that alternative paradigms exist. However, the writing is often dense. The classification of some theories as \\"traditional\\" vs \\"alternative\\" can be disputed. Many theories seem to have characteristics of both. On a positive note, many of the readings included in the text are very interesting.As a faculty member who has used the book in a BSW course, I find that I need to guide students through this text. I distribute a guide to each chapter. Essentially I \\"translate\\" Schriver with more concrete examples. Other texts I have use require fewer translations.

It's really too bad this is the only book available for such a great piece of software. The front and back covers state, &quot;Comprehensive/Complete Guide for Poser Users&quot; - not even close. The other reviewers have summed this book up by stating how dysfunctional it is. I got the impression that the author sat around and played with a few dials, took screen shots, and pasted this mess together for an ignorant publisher to sell to unsuspecting buyers. Amazingly there is more reference to older versions of the software than to ver 4 which is the cover title for this book! And I do have to repeat this from the other reviewers since it frustrated me so much - there is soooo much reference to Zygote that they must have compensated the author. It's unbelievable. Poser already comes with a great wealth of props, clothing, and poses that it was incredible to see the author using Zygote models and props in the books tutorials. And then arrogantly suggesting that the reader purchase these models from Zygote to use in the books tutorials! Amazing. Spend $200 on the software, $50 on the book, and about $30 per model at Zygote.Just by human nature we are curious about things, but please don't let your curiousity get the better of you when deciding to purchase this book. If you are fortunate enough to find a copy at a book store, spend just fifteen minutes browsing through 550 pages of wasted time. Luckily I didn't open the CD and returned it a week later...."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"While I'm not necessarily sorry I bought this book, it is disappointing in many ways. It is poorly organized, carries a lot of hash from previous editions that's poorly integrated with the new material, and worst of all the tutorials require you to buy models from a third party vendor, rather than being supplied on the CD as the promotional copy leads one to believe. By the time I finished it, I felt like model supplier Zygote should have subsidized the healthy price tag, given the books total reliance on their expensive models. To make matters even worse, the included CD is poorly matched with the book, and doesn't contain what the books says it does. There aren't many alternatives to this book for the poser student, but ... I expected better."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"This is the first computer book I regret buying. It is the most useless use of paper I have ever seen. The author has no teaching ability and no skills at Poser. I had some prior experience using poser, and was hoping this book would fill-in the holes for me. Unfortunately, this &quot;guide&quot; creates far more questions than it answers. Mortimer merely instructs the user to play with the knobs until something utterly useless, and ugly has been created. Anyone with a moderate amount of computer experience doesn't need this, and anyone new to computers is far more likely to be scared by Mortimer's art than learn anything from it.I burnt my copy of this book camping, and no it isn't even very good at starting a camp fire. Crumpled newspaper works much better. And reading random bits of crumpled newspaper is far more likely to improve your Poser skills than this pile of garbage."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"This book is a complete waste of money. Having owned Poser since version 1, I was looking for this book to contain in-depth data on advanced topics such as: Morph Targets, Textures, Grouping, etc...Well forget about it. This book breezes over these topics in a paragraph or two.Instead, the reader is treated to entire chapters on &quot;wacky animal creations&quot; or, as a previous reviewer wrote, turning the dials to make useless distortions.Please, until there is a writer who is intelligent and serious about the software, don't waste your money on this book and go online to get better information."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"The book is awful! The artwork is hideous, and the &quot;lessons&quot; are useless. Mr. Shamms Mortier is a con-artist, and every book he has written is scam. If you don't believe me, take a look at the reviews of other books he has written; he's left a trail of destruction behind him on Amazon. Thank goodness for free speech!Mortier's use of English in this book is extremely poor. His understanding of the Poser is extremely poor, and his understanding of how to teach is also extremely poor. What I can't understand is why any sane publisher would allow this man to write books. Poser 4 Handbook is basically a republishing of the online material, only more confusing (Shamms can't even plaguerize well). To anyone who wants to learn Poser 4, just read the online documentation for now, and maybe someday there will be a more useful book on Poser available."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"I am not one to trash books or criticize, but I have bought many, many computer arts books and I am inclined to agree with most of the negative comments made by other reviewers. Let's just look at the facts. First off Shamms Mortier does have some good ideas, some. It is his choice of how to use the space in the book that is baffling. He has an entire chapter on &quot;customizing&quot; animals. His idea is to select a section of the animal and then turn the knob real hard. By doing this one can have a horse that has it's midsection abnormally small. Or a Raptor with a really really big bottom jaw (more knob turning) He goes on to illustrate how one can take a Poser figure and make the neck really long (evidentially one turns the knob...hard) What he never tells us is why? Why should I want a disfigured horse? Why should a person have a really big head? Is there a demand for this? Rather then give us a more detailed tutorial on how to make the hoarse walk, just walk, Mr. Mortier tells us how to make some man/hourse thing A &quot;monitor&quot; or something. In one inconceivable section he puts a sharks head on a skeleton? Are there drug tests for authors? Apparently not. Then there is the &quot;handshaking&quot; chapter, it is fine except that it is hopelessly out of date, many of the programs he mentions are owned by other software companies or have been orphaned outright. He spends a disproportionate amount of time and space giving instructions on how to manipulate animals that don't come with Poser, a bear, chimp, shark and deer. In every one of his chapters, it seems, he just can't resist making some ridicules hybrid, in the hand chapter he shows us how to put human heads on fingers, in one simply unbelievable section he makes a totem pole out of dogs heads. I'm not kidding, he writes underneath this abomination &quot;here is a very interesting totem pole&quot; It is a post with three dogs heads on it. This man needs help. Two headed Raptors, babies riding bears, cowboy mermaids, Zebra textures on people. Why Mr. Mortier, for the love of God why?Most of the characters he has come up with look as though they have been in some sort of train wreck or were dropped from a high place, the cat he &quot;customized&quot; by making it's head flat looks like it has been run down by a car. In the advice from Poser masters, one is told, I guess, to buy 3D Studio Max or some other 3D software program to make more models. I don't hate this book as much as some, it is worth having if only for the fact that it is the only one (there is another one out now about Poser Pro-Pack, buy that one and leave this one alone). Eccentricity is good, I like abstract art stuff, but lets not put the cart before the mangled horse."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"What is so amazing, well it's obviously not the book according to the one star I gave it. What is amazing is that Shamms is able to write one low quality book after another and still get publishers and people to buy his books. Some how he has been able to get away with writing over 20 different books with only the most basic knowledge and very brief experience of the programs. I would like to know how he pulls it off, I mean if he can write a book on Poser then I should easily be able to write a book on well, anything I know nothing about and still make money off it."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"This book is filled with the childish scribblings of a total poser novice whose idea of testing the program was twiddling the knobs. Why anyone would buy a book that tells them to do something they probably already did before they bought the book is totally beyond me.My advice : go buy Richard Schrand's far superior book (Poser 4 Pro Pack f/x &amp; Design) at least with that book you'll learn something, I did."},{"Title":"The Poser 4 Handbook (Graphics Series)","review":"It seems to be very popular to put down Mortier's books, but let's get real: this book is a very useful reference for the program. I may not personally like the type of projects that Mortier uses as examples, but that's not the point --Mortier's art and style are not what you're paying for: how he attains his effects is the purpose of the book, and he does cover the methodology of Poser very well.Mortier covers everything from morphing, lighting and multi-figure composites through hierarchies and spawning props with a lot of useful info which greatly augments the relatively sparse user manual.Aside from Poser alone, his sections of 'handshaking' (using Poser with other applications) is invaluable. Poser is a tool that works best when used with a number of other applications such as UV mappers and texture creation programs. Mortier's lists and descriptions of programs that work well with Poser is worth the price of the book alone. His 'Hints From Master Users' includes great tips from some of the most well-respected names in the Poser community.As a successful 3D and special effects artist, I use Poser about 4 hours a day, and have probably spent thousands of hours with the program since its first release; Mortier's book was invaluable in learning the ins and outs of what is a fairly complex program to use well. I still refer to the book on a regular basis, and am constantly finding some useful bit of info that I missed in earlier readings.So, get past the silliness of some of the projects and look at the methods Mortier uses to get his results. If you use the book in this manner, you will most definitely learn Poser, and you will learn it well!(By the way, as far as 'handshaking' goes, Bryce and Amorphium Pro are two programs often used with Poser, and are mentioned in 'The Poser 4 Handbook'.

Outdated? In some respects, undoubtedly. But still useful and enthralling? Unless you happen to feel like wading through several semesters of foreign languages and philology to come to the same gestalt view and connaissance available in 600 or so well-written pages, absolutely."},{"Title":"The Loom of Language","review":"The theme of this book is language, its origins in the past, its growth through history, and its present use for communication between peoples. It is at the same time a history of language, a guide to foreign tongues and a method for learning them. It shows, through basic vocabularies, family resemblances of languages...Teutonic, Romance, Greek...helpful tricks of translation, key combinations of roots and phonetic patterns. It demonstrates that it is as easy to learn several languages at once as it is to learn one; it condenses vocabulary to a minimum of essential words; it simplifies grammar in an entirely new way, and it teaches a language as it is actually used in everyday life rather than in the abstract manner of textbooks.(...)"},{"Title":"The Loom of Language","review":"A good reason exists why The Loom of Language, first published in 1944, is still in print. It remains one of the best overviews of Indo-European and Near East languages to date. While a basic grasp of linguistic tools will help, the reader essentially only needs an understanding of English grammatical rules to get through the book. The explicit goal of The Loom of Languages is to introduce readers to a broad range of languages, language timelines, language roots and the tools necessary to understand a wide variety of linguistic patterns so as to learn new languages. The greatest asset of The Loom of Language is that it never strays off track. The authors carefully, consistently marry one chapter to the next. This is no dry linguistic workbook either; the authors take the time to explore the history and culture behind various languages, peppering the work with colorful anthropological anecdotes.If one fault could be listed with The Loom of Languages it would be that a muddy xenophobia trickles into some of the chapter as witnessed by this comment concerning the lack of Greek and Latin language influence in the Eastern Europe of antiquity: \\"The comparatively late appearance of loan words in the Slavonic lexicon faithfully reflects this retardation of culture contact with more progressive communities (page 419).\\"Modern day readers unaccustomed to the cultural proclivities of earlier linguists and anthropologists may find the repetitive use of words like \\"Aryan\\" or \\"high culture\\" unsettling. That said, the nitty-gritty of the data (with a few exceptions) in The Loom of Languages remains unadulterated and essentially informative. Recent discoveries by linguists and anthropologists now contradict some of TLOL findings, but not enough to undermine the goals of the book. A highly recommended book for budding linguists or those with a curiosity about the link between language and history."},{"Title":"The Loom of Language","review":"This book contains a lot of information on the ways european languages are connected, and how to use this to your advantage when learning other languages. The prejudices of the author show through fairly strongly, however, and the book contains a lot of outdated judgements of one language over another. The book contains some outdated information, and his reviews of Esperanto contain some easily verifiable errors of fact. The word lists in the back of the book are helpful."},{"Title":"The Loom of Language","review":"I was looking for a book that would cover a broad range of topics and many languages and this was interesting all the way through.

However, its flaws are that it doesn't take into account the predominance of Greek roots comming into common usage through scientific terminology, not Latin roots that many of the other attempts use. It doesn't respect the widespread knowledge about English even in Asia and neglects the need for a simplified lexicography. He cites \\"Basic English\\" as a natural starting point which contains the main 850 words in English used to define all the others.If a person wanted to get a head start learning the international language of the future. They probably wouldn't be too far off if they studied Greek roots which are easily recognized by native English speakers first such as \\"haema\\" for \\"blood\\" as in the word hemoglobin. And only the words from the list of the basic 850. Then studied only the Latin roots easily recognized by native English speakers such as \\"Omni\\" for \\"all.\\" Finally, study the simplified spelling and grammar of Novial.If nothing else, this book will give people a greater understanding of languages in general and perhaps help them speak or write more effectively in any language, even their mother tongue."},{"Title":"The Loom of Language","review":"On the one hand, my Latin teacher must have spoiled me with a number of extemporaneous analyses on indo-european Languages. Those spirited additions to the standard lesson really caught my imagination, while this book never has. I thought it would, alas. Maybe I just don't yet understand frederick bodmer. It's nice to see that others really found the text helpful and useful, perhaps it even touches on the mythical and mystical, for them.On the other hand, my favorite source on the origins of language remains the etymologies in the Red Merriam-Webster collegiate dictionary. Despite my present jadedness, I can never forget the utter ecstasy in finding a solid, trustworthy explanation for the origin of almost any word. For me, such trustworthiness was what gave meaning to American civilization....much more than my high-school history classes.On my first day of my present work, I was tickled pink (nearly Red, if you will) to find a Merriam-Webster collegiate dictionary on my desk. This experience of my first day really made me feel at home. I always imagined that one of the executives must have had the same thought on Merriam-Webster and that is why it found its way to my desk. Those first days were truly special."},{"Title":"William Wordsworth, rev","review":"Davies has written a very good book. The book is intelligent, fair and kind and thorough. It seems that all the major relationships of Wordsworth's life are carefully described. Relationships with his sister, Dorothy; his wife, Mary Hutchinson; his French amour Annette Villon and their daughter are all carefully desribed. His brothers, his children, Coleridge, Robert Southey, Walter Scott are all part of his life, and insightfully presented in the book. Davies writes well about the Lake district, and Wordsworth's business dealings. It is a good, solid, well- rounded portrayal of Wordsworth. The poetry is not analyzed, but introduced and placed in the context of the poet's life. At the end, I liked Wordsworth very much and will be happy to read more of his poetry. I would give the book 4 1/2 stars if it were possible."},{"Title":"William Wordsworth, rev","review":"This disappointing and tedious book about Wordsworth's life and times lacks insight and warmth. The author is a dabbler whose books' topics include fiction, the Beatles, and a hiker's guide to the Lakes District. The current book grew out of the author's research for his hiking guide, when he discovered that there was no other detailed, non-academic Wordsworth biography. In essence, the book is a calculated business venture rather than an expression of the author's interest in,knowledge of, or love for Wordsworth. To his credit, the author is frank about these facts, although his uninspired text could not have hidden them. The book is flawed by unnecessary and uninsightful speculation on the one hand and on the other by a general lack of sensitivity to the profound beauty of Wordsworth's work. The author's narrative style is dry, lifeless and uninspired, and Americans will be particularly put off by its distinctly British flavor, which can only be regarded as a provincial flaw in a book offered to general readers in the global market. Spelling, word choice, turn of phrase, and the assumed context are so distinctly British as to leave American readers feeling that they are overhearing a joke which they do not quite understand. Many Americans will find the book inaccessible for this reason. A much better choice is Penelope Hughes-Hallett's &quot;Home At Grasmere&quot;, which is warm, sensitive and well written."},{"Title":"William Wordsworth, rev","review":"Hunter Davies set out to write a popular biography of Wordsworth. He indicates at the outset that this is not going to be a work of literary criticism, that it is not going to focus on the development of Wordsworth's poetry.This present work nonetheless in helping the reader understand Wordsworth the person, also helps us understand Wordsworth the Poet.Wordsworth was orphaned from his father at the age of eight, and from his mother at the age of thirteen. He was supported by relatives who did not approve of his behavior as a child and young person. He was exceptionally independent and often rebellious child.When his mother died he was separated from his siblings. Only at the age of seventeen did he come to see them all together again. And here began one of the most significant relationships of his life, with his sister Dorothy. She would be for him the companion of his youthful years, the great souled fellow explorer of nature and inspirer of his Poetry. She would remain even after he married Mary Hutchinson a central figure in his everyday life. For the last twenty years of that life Wordsworth and his wife cared for her. This after she had lost her mind and sat all day in her wheelchair.One important theme that runs through this work concerns Wordsworth as family man, as good brother, as faithful loving husband, as caring father.Wordsworth 's life too has important friendships at its center. The greatest and most creatively important is with Coleridge. Davies tells the story of their work together on 'The Lyrical Ballads', and of the many years they were close. Coleridge had a central role in recognizing and promoting his friend's genius. It may well even be that Coleridge feeling Wordsworth the far greater poet ceased writing poetry of his own because of this. Coleridge's great poems , 'Kubla Khan', 'The Ancient Mariner' are part of the \\"Lyrical Ballads'. But most of the twenty- three poems are Wordsworth including the very great 'Tintern Abbey'Davies also gives us a good sense of Wordsworth's character and of the transformation with the years from revolutionary youth to more conservative figure. Wordsworth too went from financial dependency and relative poverty in his early years to greater prosperity towards the end of his life. He went from being an orphan to becoming the head of a family which included besides his wife and children two other women, his sister Dorothy and Coleridge's longed- for- one Sara Fricker. The story of how the far more gregarious talkative social Coleridge came to greater loneliness with the years- and how the more taciturn Wordsworth came to build a rich home in which he had much feminine support is told movingly by Davies.Wordsworth's friends Southey, Lamb, Coleridge DeQuincey considered him to have lived a fortunate and happy life. This was in one sense true. But he also knew terrible losses with the years. His sailor brother John's death was a blow he recovered from only with great difficulty. He and his wife lost two young children in a year. This too devastated him. The last blow was the death of his beloved daughter Dora at the age of thirty- seven. Still Wordsworth lived to the age of eighty , in relatively good health most of the years. He also knew great renown and recognition in his latter years. And his relationship with his wife Mary only seemed to grow stronger with the years, and was one of true love and mutual respect. He who always had a special caring for children lived to see five grandchildren, the children of his eldest son, John.Wordsworth despite the great popularity he would one day have did not have a smooth path to recognition and acceptance as a Poet. His work was for many years harshly criticized and ridiculed. The 1807 edition of his Poems received ten negative reviews and not a single good one. But Wordsworth had equanimity and confidence. The calm sublime of his Poetry was apparently that of his character also. Weathered, rugged looking Wordsworth who even in his latter years would walk twenty miles a day was a pillar of inner and outer strength. The great Poetry and most believe it was created in the decade from roughly 1797 to 1807 has stood the test of time. His life as portrayed in this biography was that of a person of virtue, principle and great genius.I greatly enjoyed this work. It has given me a much fuller and complete sense of Wordsworth's life and work than I had had before."},{"Title":"Dear Penelope","review":"There wasn't anything wrong with this book. I liked the premise, I loved the name (Sebastian--ooh! la! la!), the writing was good. But, overall, the book for me was just fluff. It was a pleasant diversion for a few hours, but nothing that I will remember or make this one a keeper. I thought the idea that Seb was her protector was good, but I felt Lucy lacked something. I just couldn't get into her. And when her family showed up, it reminded me of the Darling family when they descended on Andy Griffith in Mayberry. Anyway, this book is an okay read.

Many of the plots are more like the romances she wrote under the name of Mary Westmacont. On a whole the Parker Pyne stories are rather a forerunner of the FANTASY ISLAND tv series."},{"Title":"Parker Pyne Investigates","review":"I enjoyed reading the Parker Pyne stories because they focus on both the human angle as well as detective puzzles. The stories start out by being more about love and romance but gradually take on a more serious appearance with Parker Pyne solving complex murders. The most amusing aspect is that Pyne has worked his whole life in a government office compiling statistics, yet is able to apply his knowledge to solving all kinds of puzzles. I definitely liked the Middle Eastern setting in some of the later stories. Christie had traveled extensively in the region with her archaeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan and you can see her love for the region in the stories. A nice alternative to the usual Poirot and Marple fare!"},{"Title":"Parker Pyne Investigates","review":"Parker Pyne isn't an investigator; he's a retired bureaucrat, who has gleaned much insight into human character from working with statistics. His agency advertises \\"Are you happy? If not, consult me.\\" As he says to one client, \\"I am a specialist in every kind of human trouble...Human troubles can be classified under a few main heads. There is ill health. There is boredom. There are wives who are in trouble over their husbands. There are husbands who are in trouble over their wives.\\"And sometimes, he uses the old principle that if you have enough problems, you can make them start solving each other. :) If you like these, particularly the earlier stories, I recommend that you try Chesterton's collection, _The Club of Queer Trades_.\\"The Case of the Middle-Aged Wife\\" - Maria Packington is suffering through what would now be called her husband's mid-life crisis: he's taken up with a pretty young typist at work. (Not an actual affair, but he takes her out to restaurants, gives up golf to take her on the river). Remember, Parker works to cure unhappiness, not to investigate people, so his treatment starts in a novel way: a beauty specialist, a dressmaker, and handsome young Claude Luttrell to introduce Mrs. Packington to London night-life.\\"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\\" - \\"I can assure you, Major Wilbraham, that 96% of retired empire builders are unhappy. They exchange an active life, a life full of responsibility, a life of possible danger - for what?\\" After lunching with Madeleine de Sara, the major is pretty well taped by Pyne's staff, and they find a problem suited to his skills.\\"The Case of the Distressed Lady\\" - Daphne St. John, having run up gambling debts, gave in to temptation: she had a paste replica made of an expensive ring, belonging to a friend, and exchanged it with the original. Now she just wants someone to replace the original before Mrs. Dortheimer sends the ring to the jeweler for resetting.\\"The Case of the Discontented Husband\\" - Reginald Wade's wife wants to divorce him and marry a long-haired artistic type (he himself diffidently disclaims any knowledge of that sort of thing; golf and tennis are his line). Parker Pyne rebukes him for taking an overly humble attitude, and sends in the glamorous Madeleine de Sara to help turn the tables.\\"The Case of the City Clerk\\" - Mr. Roberts' life has been a ceaseless struggle to survive; all he asks for is one adventure, to give him something to remember in his daily round afterwards. An old friend of Parker's who's still in government service needs to have some papers carried secretly to Geneva, and the logical choice in his own department is highly suspect. Voila...\\"The Case of the Rich Woman\\" - Mrs. Rymer's late husband was a working man in a factory, until his inventions began making money. Being rich was fun at first - but her new 'friends' look down on her, her old friends avoid her, and she's tried everything she can think of to get some fun out of her money. Pyne comes up with something more than his usual treatments for boredom this time.\\"Have You Got Everything You Want?\\" - Elsie Jeffries, a rich young woman on the train to Istanbul, will meet her husband there - a straitlaced, good looking young man, almost dull. But she comes to Pyne, a fellow passenger on holiday, because she found part of a note in his handwriting - something about 'my wife' and 'before Venice would be the best time.'\\"The Gate of Baghdad\\" - The opening poem later appears in the novel _Postern of Fate_. Pyne signs on for the 36-hour road trip from Damascus to Baghdad, but murder interrupts his journey across the desert.\\"The House at Shiraz\\" - Pyne has left Baghdad for Persia; the German pilot who brought him helps him explain to customs about the bug powder he carries. Having struck up an acquaintance, the pilot reminisces about two Englishwomen he carried out there: Lady Esther Carr and her maid. The flowerlike beauty of Muriel King was what touched his heart, but she died in a tragic fall from a balcony. Pyne begins poking into Lady Esther's history, remembering a rumour of insanity in her father's family...\\"The Pearl of Price\\" - Pyne is part of a tourist party at Petra, along with an American magnate, accompanied by his daughter Carol and his secretary, an archaeologist, a French colonel on leave, and a worn-out M.P. All respectable people, above suspicion - until Carol's pearls disappear.\\"Death on the Nile\\" - No, not *that* case. Pyne is still trying to get on with his holiday, when yet another woman calls him in for consultation. Lady Grayle has enjoyed poor health for years - but now she's not enjoying it at all. In fact, she suspects that her husband is poisoning her. But does she want him proved innocent - or guilty?\\"The Oracle at Delphi\\" - Mrs. Peters has accompanied her artistic 18-year-old son to Delphi (even though she'd rather be at a luxurious hotel in Paris or the Riviera). Then he disappears - and she receives a ransom note. Enter Mr. Parker Pyne..."},{"Title":"Parker Pyne Investigates","review":"I am not a great fan of short stories. However, this one collection i have read many many times over. Parker Payne is a brilliant character. Clever, amusing, great to read about. the way he solves problems and crimes is excellent, and rivals even Poirot and Marple. Indeed, the concept of a detective who solves \\"problems\\" (i.e. such as being unhappy) is so astoudingly original in itself.I absolutely adore this collection. It is not only my favourite collection of short stories ever, it is one of my all time favourite Agatha Christie novels. It ranks, in my opinion, alongside the greats such as \\"Towards Zero\\" \\"Murder Is Easy\\" and \\"Death Comes as the End\\". The stories are so interesting and so incredibly enjoyable. I loved every word of them. Anyone who likes psychology will be fascinated by this excellent collection of stories.I think my very favourite story is \\"The Case of the Discontended Husband\\" which, as well as being my favourite in this collection, is also my favourite short story ever.These are hugely interesting and wonderfully entertaining. If you are looking for a diverting read and are interesting in human nature, this is definitely the book for you. (Also, watch out for the stories set in foreign parts. Christie excells when she sets her stories abroad.)It is very unusual that i will give any short story collection any more than a three star rating (at best) as i am not a fan of their form or style, but this is possibly the only exception.

The stories in \\"Parker Pyne Investigates\\" are enjoyable and fast paced even if it is not one of the best of Christie's works.Some of the standout stories in the collection are \\"The Case of the Rich Woman\\" in which a wealthy widow wants advice on how to spend her fortune and wakes up to find herself hypnotized and living on a farm with everyone calling her a different name; and \\"The Gate of Baghdad\\" in which Parker Pyne must prove that an apparent accidental death was actually murder. The first half of the collection contains stories in which Parker Pyne helps his clients find happiness, whether they are a wife who needs a little romance because her husband is beginning to stray or a poor city clerk who yearns for some small adventure just once in his life. While Parker Pyne claims not to be a detective, the second half of the collection certainly reads more like mysteries to be solved than not, as Pyne encounters kidnapping, poisoning and a case of mistaken identity.\\"Parker Pyne Investigates\\" is an interesting collection of stories.

Nor can the intricacy of his cases compete with those of Miss Marple, or even with those of Tommy and Tuppence.These mini-mysteries make up a compilation of \\"Christie afterthoughts\\" which are simply not in the same league with her more renowned achievements such as \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles,\\" \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,\\" \\"The Clocks,\\" \\"Postern of Fate,\\" or \\"At Bertram's Hotel\\". In a word, I found some of these stories to be \\"goofy\\". Since they are all fairly abbreviated, there's not much in the way of sub-plots which contibutes to their shallowness.I'm a HUGE Christie fan, having read everything she wrote, some multiple times. From that perspective, unless you are working your way through all of Christie's works as a personal project, just skip this one. If you really savour short mysteries, you would be better advised to go out and buy a copy of the most recent \\"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\\".You'll notice that in the \\"official\\" reviews above, (not the reader's reviews), you'll read that Christie wrote spectacular mysteries, that she's basically the Queen of mystery writers, etc. This is a frequently employed publishers' and/or reviewers' tactic which is strategically utilized to market books which aren't, in themselves, all that good. Promotional chatter like this should pop up as a big red flag for prospective buyers. That is sadly the case in this instance.Unfortunately, and especially for eager new Christie fans, I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Abelard (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"This volume in the excellent Cambridge Companions Series examines the ideas and contributions of the medieval philosopher Peter Abelard. Noted more for his eventful life as a controversialist, heretic and his famous affair with his student Heloise (which led to Abelard being castrated in revenge by her powerful uncle, Fulbert via hired henchmen), Abelard was also an outstanding philosopher and logician whose work anticipated many of the important developments in medieval philosophy which, taken up by thinkers such as Ockham, would spell the end of the medieval philosophical project.Edited and with contributions from John Marenbon, one of the leading experts on Abelard and medieval thought, this volume explores Abelard's ideas on language and logic, metaphysics, human cognition and ethics. Abelard's insights in language, logic and ethics are especially interesting, as they overlap with many issues now being explored in contemporary philosophy.This volume is a must for any student of Abelard and also of medieval philosophy."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Abelard (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"The Cambridge Companion to Abelard, Edited by Jeffrey Brower and Kevin Guilfoy.One expects anything with the 'Cambridge University Press' impimatur to be of high quality, and this book is no exception. As I consulted it for a book on Abelard's theory of atonement, I was just a bit disappointed that there was no chapter dedicated to that subject; however, once I got past the Table of Contents, I discovered Chapter 8 on 'Sin, Grace, and Redemption' which treats that very subject, beginning with the important observation that 'atonement' as a theological issue seemed to bloom in the 12th and 13th centuries, with two of the three main competing theories arising within 50 years of one another, from Anselm of Canterbury and Peter Abelard, respectively.One of the tragedies for those interested in Abelard is that we do not (yet) have a complete translation of his commentary on Romans. However, the author of Chapter 8, Thomas Williams, who, understandably, is adept in Latin, offers a summary of Abelard's thought from the whole Romans commentary.The book covers all facits of Abelard's work, including his literary writings, especially Abelard's autobiography and letters to Heloise. The chapter headings show how remarkably modern Abelard's thinking was, as it includes Logic, Philosophy of Language, and Mind and Cognition. (I will be less surprised now to find similar topics in the works of other 11th - 13th century thinkers.)As far as I know, the authors are all experts on Abelard. The biographical chapter is written by John Marenbon, a medievalist and author of 'The Philosophy of Abelard'. It's notable that all authors and editors have chairs in philosophy and not theology. With Abelard, that is probably a very good thing.Compared to a similar Cambridge volume on the better known Anselm, the Abelard is longer and deeper. It will not replace reading Abelard himself, but it is useful in that these folks have read Abelard's works in Latin, unavailable to us."},{"Title":"The Writing of Yehuda Amichai: A Thematic Approach (Suny Series in Modern Jewish Literature and Culture)","review":"This is an academic study of the work of the person many regard as the finest Hebrew poet of the past half- century. Amichai is a poet whose deep connection with the life and reality of modern Israel have made him one of its most beloved poets. Abramson analyses some of the major themes techniques and forms of his work. Her chapters are titled: Biography and Autobiography, Allusion and Irony, The Father of God, Alienation and Fragmentation, The Love Poetry, Jerusalem, Not of this Time, Not of this Place- The Short Stories, The Stage Plays.Among her claims is that Amichai is despite his involvement in writing about the two major events of modern Jewish history, The Shoah and the Birth of Israel is not a political poet. He is a poet within the Hebraic tradition whose examination of the theme of fathers and sons, is done in relation to the problem of orthodoxy and secularism . \\" His search for faith is not for the revival of a lost or denied metaphysical sentiment , rather it is for the indication of a moral purpose within the existing world and in history. His early work is preoccupied with quarrying for himself some sense in the darkness of war and personal confusion, and learning to live within an ontological context that has rejected the centrality of God and in which traditional imperatives are no longer valid. Together with the romantic nostalgia that characterizes much of the poetry of his generation , this constitutes his worldview.\\"Abramson provides true insight into Amichai but there is of course no substitute for reading this poet of the landscape of Jerusalem and the Jewish soul , in irony ,contradiction, friendship, comradeship of battle, love, loss stone and silence."},{"Title":"Earth Shelter Technology","review":"(Rating should be about 2.5 stars)\\"Earth Shelter Technology\\" reads more like a very long abstract than a technical reference itself. There are many (262) references for the 194 pages of text and figures. The book covers the basic ideas of earth sheltering pretty thoroughly, but unless you dig into the references, you're left with very little practical information that you'd need to design an earth-sheltered building.I thought that I'd hit real meat with a formula for soil temperature as a function of depth underground and day of the year. Plug in mean temperature and annual temperature swing amplitude, and you're almost there. But this formula includes a constant for thermal diffusivity of the soil. Well, there's a table with thermal and other properties of various materials; BUT the authors left some blanks: the thermal properties for rock, heavy dry soil, or concrete -- precisely the materials of interest when constructing an earth-sheltered structure in dry areas -- are missing.There are also many figures with axes labeled but not dimensioned; you can get a qualitative idea of how things relate, but nothing like a quantitative relationship.The book is dated (copyright 1987); the references are of course even older, going back to 1949. The book reads as if written a decade earlier, though. The dated impression is partly due to the technology used in the book itself. There are no photographs; instead, there are hand-drawn ink illustrations that surely took quite a long time to produce, but lose much of the detail that a decent photograph would show (example: \\"Aerial view of the University of Minnesota Bookstore\\"). Also, the text refers to simulation programs for handheld calculators and for mainframes -- there's nary a mention of a PC.There are very few alternative books on this subject, so I'd recommend it for a conceptual overview. But you won't find enough information here to design an earth-sheltered building."},{"Title":"Earth Shelter Technology","review":"Boyer &amp; Grondzik have pulled together all of the disparate sources of information required to properly design an underground facility.Although the book was written in 1987, there are no other books which have pulled together all of the design issues and formulas required to properly design a structure, including heating &amp; ventilation, waterproofing techniques and studies of existing structures.While people have been building and using underground housing for thousands of years, most of the published material consists of &quot;how we did it&quot; or analysis of ancient buildings. This is the first book I've found which brings the material required to properly engineer a design into one place.The focus of the book is on the engineering aspects, so don't expect much in the line of architectural design. Site selection, including soil types and proper detailing for passive solar heating, load balancing for heating &amp; cooling systems, drainage system design and proper daylighting design are all covered very well.This is not the ideal resource, I would like to see a more current book, which would give analysis of exiting structures over a longer time-frame (many of the structures analyzed were built during the &quot;energy crisis&quot; of the 70's &amp; early 80's, and thus only had a decade or so of occupation.)Overall, if you are interested in designing an underground home which will provide a safe, secure and low maintenance facility, this is a good reference. Oh, you might find you can easily design a &quot;no-power&quot; dwelling, at least as far as heating/cooling costs. Unless you like paying utility bills....This is a technical book, some engineering knowledge is desirable when reading it, but it is not beyond the level of a high school student with some physics."},{"Title":"Earth Shelter Technology","review":"This is a comprehensive &quot;high end overview&quot; of the things you need to consider if you're going to design and build an underground house. It is not specific to a particular location or house design. As an engineer this book has provided me with a lot of insight into what I need to think about for my house. If you're looking for finished designs and building instructions this is not the book for you. It has been a great introduction for a house I'll be building in the Sierra foothills in the next few years."},{"Title":"Earth Shelter Technology","review":"This is probably the only book that shows you how to engineer a underground house properly from start to finish.

It wasn't thought so at the time, of course; the 1962 paperback I read has two introductions, one from the editors who call Johnson \\"a rubber-legged thing of surprise and caprice,\\" and one from V.S. Pritchett, who admits that Johnson may be seen as a \\"stock comic African\\" but then says stoutly, \\"Who is more irrational, childish and backward...: the poor hallucinated black clerk Johnson or the emotionally incompetent and obsessed white Commissioner Rudbeck?\\" And of course Pritchett hits the nail squarely on the head, for that is the set-up of Cary's novel, and in Johnson he has created as rich and fascinating a character as Gulley Jimson, from the better-known Horse's Mouth. On the one hand, Johnson is a liar, a thief, a wastrel, childish and thoroughly incompetent at his job as a clerk. On the other, he is gay (in the old sense), imaginative, romantic, energetic, persuasive, a natural leader, and a wonderful poet or song-maker. Cary has included the full text of a number of songs, and I would love to hear them sung.The setting is the the colonial office in a remote small town in Nigeria, where Rudbeck represents the rule of British law, with the occasional aid of a corrupt Emir and his Waziri. Johnson is his clerk, and at the start of the novel he has just fallen for a local girl, whom he proposes to buy from her father with money he doesn't have. How he manages this scam and a string of others, while throwing parties every three or four nights, details the \\"rise\\" arc of the novel, to be followed inevitably by the fall. The structure is impeccable. (It is said to have been Cary's favorite novel.) The ending is beautifully crafted.In short, this is a good book and at times very funny. I'm leaving a star off as a concession to the delicate sensibilities of those who won't be able to get beyond Cary's whiteness and Johnson's blackness. But they might try to relax a little--Johnson is good company.p.s. to editor: please spell the author's name correctly, here and elsewhere,"},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","review":"I bought this book about a week before I had to leave the city. I got it within 3 days of buying it. The shipping is amazing!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Fingerprints","review":"Even for the hardboiled supporter of the Earl of Oxford as true author of Shakespeare's works this book must be just a teeny weeny bit too much: The authors have managed to discover the fabulous Earl not only as author of Shakespeare, but as the true author of just about ALL English literature written between 1558 and 1604 - the talented Earl at the tender age of 8 being explicitly commanded to that enterprise by Queen Elizabeth to raise the quality of English literature. The list of the creative Earl's real-life-pseudonyms includes (among many many others) Gascoigne, Golding, Green, Lyly, Marlowe, Peele, Sidney, Shakespeare, Spenser....This find is no surprise, considering just three of 14 heuristic strategies the authors use for identification of Shakespeare's\\" linguistic fingerprints in Elizabethan literature:Ox-Strategy: Consider occurrences of orthographic o in Elizabethan literature as possible clues to de Vere's authorship, especially in connection with e as eo.\\"This means, all publications that contain words with o (especially big O) are possible works of Edward de Vere, Earl of O-xford; as well as works with words containing eo = E.O. = Earl of Oxford (as for example eo in the name &quot;George&quot; = unrefutable evidence of de Veres authorship)(no, this is no joke!).VER-Strategy: Consider all Elizabethan works that contain words with VER (as ever, fever, never, deliver, quiver, lover, verity, suffer etc. etc.) as possibly written by the Earl of Oxford (no joke either!)&quot;Original-Source-Strategy: Consider Shakespeare's English language sources with the expectation that they are themselves the works of Shakespeare-de Vere.Etc. etc.Considering those criteria, it should be hard going to find ANY literary work of that period that was NOT written by the Earl of Oxford.Obviously, there is method in this madness: Both authors are tenured linguists at the University of Washington. Initially I took the whole thing to be a send-up of the authorship-issue; but a hoax of about 530 pages is just a bit over top: overdoing the joke. No, this is dead serious: The two authors have threatened to write a follow-up of three more books on the subject.I'm no psychiatrist - but its hard to avoid the impression that this is a case of partial lunacy in its concise medical sense. And the disease seems to be catching - Professor Sharon Hagus, Professor Rafael Escribano, Professor Yasukuni Takano and Professor Jack Hoeksema, all of them praising the book (for example: The arguments are very clear, cohesive and convincing\\") seem to be heavily infected.Not even to be recommended as a good laugh - its boring as hell.(Amazon demands at least 1 star out of 5; if I had the choice I would vote for 5 lemons of the most sour sort)."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Fingerprints","review":"No.Read Beauclerk, Whittemore, Streitz,Anderson, Stritmatter, even Joe Sobran'soverestimated book on de Vere (my apologies,Mr Sobran.

Wm. Shakespeare, an enterprising businessmen of the stage, hired the multitudinous young genius Chr. Marlowe to translate these works into English. By some shady strategm, public knowledge of this work of antiquarian scholarship was prevented from transpiring to the ears of the public and posterity.

Why? Because it's fun to read, witty, and incisive! The rock and roll heaven portion, where various deceased rock stars are broken down in terms of how they died, is definitely worth reading.One or two others have already castigated author Dave Marsh for having somewhat of a left leaning bias in his stinging criticism of the PMRC and certain religious zealots, as well as his categorization of famous right wing rockers. I disagree with the reviewer who referred to Marsh as being &quot;PC&quot;.

It definitely gives a comprehensive look at the history of rock as well as gives a detailed account of how rock has influenced modern society.However, there are a few things that I do have to nit pick about. The first is Marsh's list of performers who appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival. One performer he has listed as playing there was Aretha Franklin. However, she never appeared there. In fact, the closest anything anybody heard from her was when Otis Redding sang his version of \\"Respect\\", which he wrote. He also omitted Lou Rawls from the list of performers. Rawls played there on the first night.

The best parts are when they display a sense of humor. Example: in response to a religious-right rock-hater's charge that a song by the Cars has Satanic &quot;backwards-masking,&quot; Marsh and Bernard reply: &quot;Well, now we know how he (Cars frontperson Ric Ocasek) got (80's supermodel) Paulina.&quot;"},{"Title":"The New Book of Rock Lists","review":"As with most of the stuff written by The King of Rock Criticism, Dave Marsh, this is intelligent, fun and challenging, and sometimes maddening (in a good way).

This desperately makes me want to check out the songs on this list, many of which I have never even heard of (and I know disco pretty well - or at least I thought I did). Also, this book inspired me to come up with some of my own lists. For example:FOUR OF THE GREATEST YEARS FOR ROCK-AND-SOUL SINGLES:1956 - Don't Be Cruel, Hound Dog, Heartbreak Hotel (Elvis Presley); Blue Suede Shoes (Carl Perkins); Blueberry Hill (Fats Domino); Roll Over Beethoven (Chuck Berry); The Great Pretender (Platters); Be-Bop-A-Lula (Gene Vincent); Long Tall Sally (Little Richard); I Walk the Line (Johnny Cash).1965 - Ticket to Ride (Beatles); Satisfaction (Rolling Stones); Papa's Got a Brand New Bag (James Brown); Wooly Bully (Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs); Stop in the Name of Love (The Supremes); Unchained Melody (The Righteous Brothers); The Tracks of My Tears (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles); We Gotta Get Out of This Place (The Animals); Help Me Rhonda and California Girls (The Beach Boys); It Ain't Me Babe (The Turtles); The Jolly Green Giant (The Kingsmen); Love Feels Like Fire, Helpless (Four Tops) [those two songs are a couple of my all-time favorite album cuts that were never released as singles].1984 - Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen); When Doves Cry (Prince); What's Love Got to Do with It (Tina Turner); Jump (Van Halen); Time after Time (Cyndi Lauper); Oh Sherrie (Steve Perry); Borderline (Madonna); Church of the Poison Mind (Culture Club); Head Over Heels (Go-Go's); On the Dark Side (John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, a quite-a-bit-of-the-time very good Springsteen sound-alike).1992 - It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over (Lenny Kravitz); Losing My Relgion (REM); Wicked Game (Chris Issak); Love is a Wonderful Thing (Michael Bolton) [JUST KIDDING - WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION]; Smells Like Teen Spirit (Nirvana); Cream (Prince); Enter Sandman (Metallica); Justify My Love (Madonna); Right Here, Right Now (Jesus Jones).Give this book a whirl.

I finished based on the idea that I wanted to see who was going to fall victim to the &quot;critical axe&quot; and at the end found this less than rewarding. Even factual errors like song titles (Zevon's &quot;Carmelita&quot; as Carmelita's Way&quot; or Thin Lizzy's &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as &quot;There's gonna be a Jailbreak&quot; were distracting.

In his introduction to the 1994 update, he accurately mentions that his book &quot;appeared on the cusp of the most important changes since the advent of rock and roll.&quot; He recalls the gradual fade of disco and punk styles and their meld into the raw, underproduced 1990s hip-hop and alternative rock.That first &quot;Lists&quot; was quixotic, goring rock's sacred popular and critical cows while presenting chart statistics - as important to pop as to baseball fans -- as trivia under and around his sharp opinions. Moreover, Marsh's exhaustive knowledge and research exposed rock's lesser known masterpieces, having the effect of a recipe you had to try when you got home. The book re-established what made rock important to many.By 1994, hip-hop and rap ruled charts, dominated fashions, entranced youth and alienated generations as R&amp;B and rock and roll did for Marsh's generation. But Marsh (who collaborated with &quot;Source&quot; magzzine editor James Bernard on this edition) could not take the breezy, sarcastic approach with this style; to treat the music less than seriously played into the hands of perceived racists and authoritarians wanting it and its young, black artists silenced (Marsh's intriguing &quot;enemies&quot; and &quot;fake friends&quot; lists provide one example.)Whether Marsh and Herbert admit it (they don't here), rap's use as rhythm as melody sears the music from its tradition and fails to compare with from the bebop jazz Marsh points it to in his list &quot;Discredited Rock Theories.&quot; While some important musical statements used the form (one list links Grandmaster Flash's &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;White Lines&quot; to a Mel Brooks novelty rap), most music fans, black and white, felt betrayed by the lack of continuity. Bob Herbert of the (#10 enemy) New York Times pointed out this week that rap &quot;has so thoroughly broken faith with the surpassingly great, centuries-long tradition of black music in America. With rap, both the music and the poetry have vanished.&quot; Marsh and Herbert would strongly disagree, and the book suffers, rather than thrives, for that dichotomy.&quot;The New Book Of Rock Lists&quot; will entertain rock or rap fans, but convert neither. The incongruence of the first book's hilarious lists play poorly against the later hip-hop updates. Chapters on &quot;Dancing,&quot; &quot;Criticism,&quot; &quot;Broadcasting&quot; (featuring sly Marsh commentary on today's radio scene), and above all, &quot;History&quot; try bridging gaps while revising the story (&quot;Print the legend, not the fact,&quot; the first book exclaimed). Seminal figures like Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and the Beatles each had chapters in the original version but now are tucked into larger chapters. The essential singles and LP lists from rock's first 25 years are sadly missed.The book remains fun, teaching much to those willing to see pop music as seamlessly and meaningfully as Marsh has, wise and willing to connect folk and blues songs like &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; to a century's music and a people's history. The good news is that, regardless of music's standing by &quot;Lists&quot; third edition, it will be cohesive or disjointed and a better read in either case."},{"Title":"The New Book of Rock Lists","review":"Dave Marsh has outdone himself. The Book of Rock (and Rap) Lists is subjective, annoying, and obsessive. It's also ridiculously entertaining. Marsh's opinions take on an almost disturbingly rabid flavor (no one he likes can do any wrong), and his politically correct mindset gets irritating. But this remains one of the greatest bathroom books ever."},{"Title":"The New Book of Rock Lists","review":"Dave Marsh has once again out-done himself. In New Book of Rock Lists, he adds to what has happend in the past ten years. The old book was excellent. From Elvis to the Who to the Ramones.

(He lists famous &quot;Right Wingers&quot; near the end of the book, perfomers who may have at some point expessed an opinion slighly right of center, and of course that makes them right-wingers). His lists seem motivated by political concerns and &quot;diversity&quot; as well, which dampens their fun value. My other qualm with the book, and this is, I admit, a point of personal preference, is the seriousness with which the authors take rap music (if such an epithet as &quot;music&quot; can be applied to it). Rap is basically for teenagers, and the image of adults salivating over the likes of Ice T and Easy E. is pathetic. No, Mr. Marsh, the work of Grandmaster Flash does not exist on the same plane as that of Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley. Those men were musicians; rap &quot;artists&quot; are poseurs looking for attention and an easy buck. Still there are some interesting things here, and this is worth at least a casual browse."},{"Title":"Jungle Jenny","review":"As a senior in high school, I am looking for books that will interest me as both a school student as well as a young adult. I have found that book with Eve Cowen's Jungle Jenny.This story is about an American girl named Jenny going to Brazil to see if her boyfriend Cliff is cheating on her or not. While in Brazil she experiences a terrifying adventure as she tries to escape the Amazon.I enjoyed reading this book because it was an easy read and a page turner as well. It had my full attentiveness throughout the whole book. This book can appeal to a variety of age groups. I think teenagers would like this book for example; it has a great deal of suspense. I think that young adults would enjoy this book as well because it is a great page turner that leads to a great climax and ends satisfactorily."},{"Title":"The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1: The Woman Rebel, 1900-1928","review":"This is a brilliant collection of Margaret Sanger's personal letters, diary entries, and the pamphlets and tracts that she wrote during the younger part of her adult years. It is a truly inspiring look at one woman's strength and courage as she faced down religious tradition, the law, and public opinion in her stand for women to govern their own bodies. She not only describes the poverty, the meanness, and the ignorance of her day, in chilling and able detail, but devotes her life to correcting what she sees wrong while inspiring others to do the same.

Nearly a century ago, Margaret Sanger was defending woman's 'ownership of her own body' and linking access to contraception to civil liberties and personal freedom. Rights we take for granted have a long and sometimes surprising history that comes clear on these pages. Required reading for our own time, whichever side of Roe v. Wade you are on.\\"-- Linda K. Kerber, author of No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship\\"These wonderful letters, diary excerpts, and essays dramatize women's long struggle for respect, self-awareness, independence, influence, and control over our bodies and our lives. To contemplate Margaret Sanger's harsh reality and the enduring vision of this courageous pioneer--while the war against women escalates on every front--is a heartening and galvanizing act of rebellion. Esther Katz and her splendid team have given us all a very great gift.\\"-- Blanche Wiesen Cook, University Distinguished Professor, John Jay College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, and the author of Eleanor Roosevelt, volumes 1 and 2\\"This engrossing volume, meticulously edited and selected, captures Margaret Sanger in all her complexity during a formative period in her long career.

After reading this book, I truly understand who Margaret Sanger was, and why her work was so important to all women everywhere in the past and today more than ever. Sanger pioneered the availability of birth control for all women, giving women control over their lives, which is so counter to today's trends to eliminate birth control and abortion. Reed has written with great knowledge and perception of her subject and of the field of women's rights. Reed's writing draws the reading into a book that is difficult to put down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The difference of man and the difference it makes (Meridian books)","review":"Dr Adler here gives us a fine presentation and analysis of animal cognition and how it corresponds with human knowledge. The distinctions Adler offers here are timeless and crucial. The answer to this question of the difference in man and animals is neither purely scientific, nor purely philosophical; rather a combined approach is needed. The relevant question to be answered is \\"Does man differ from the rest of the animal kingdom by degree or by kind, and if by kind is this difference radical or superficial?\\" Adler, using a traditional Aristotelian and Thomistic analysis of the modern research while combining it with the more recent positions of other philosophers and scientists, concludes that it is a difference in kind and that this difference is indeed radical. Man is a different \\"kind\\" of thing than the other creatures that inhabit our planet.Adler is indeed fair and objective throughout. We must look at the operation of the creature in question, and in this case - articulation indicates what a given creature does in fact \\"know\\". The argument for difference in kind turns on man's ability to articulate \\"designators\\", that is verbalized concepts in both their connotative and denotative form. There is no evidence that animal communication is expressive in this way. The data that has resulted from inquiring into animal intelligence suggests no more than an ability of perceptual abstraction, whether memorized or immediate. Mankind articulates designators and these articulations cannot be explained by mere sense perception or any perceptual generalization for the very fact that such designators are inherently non - perceptible. Not only does man attribute and recognize particulars as members of abstract classes or the classes themselves, he has the additional ability to express concepts that are not empirically observable at all; i.e. \\"God\\", logical relations such as \\"inference\\", pi, etc. Thus, the negative edge of Ockham's razor prevents us from attributing conceptual awareness on the part of animals yet the positive edge of this principle of parsimony demands such additional attribution to mankind.Next, Adler, using a traditional argument from Aquinas and Aristotle, argues that this ability must be immaterial due to the immaterial nature of the concept - a \\"class\\" or \\"universal\\" that cannot by definition be material and hence not merely an act of the physical brain.Adler is fair throughout his contention. As an example he admits that his immateriality position would be falsified by a \\"Turing machine\\" a computer robot that would be able to communicate with humans via propositional words and sentence formation. This is the third prong of the \\"Cartesian Challenge\\" as asserted by Rene Descartes centuries ago. If a purely physical machine can achieve conceptual thought and propositional language, then Adler admits his immateriality theory on which conceptual thought is based would be falsified.The benefits of this work go far beyond the main issue of human/animal distinction. The bibliography is outstanding. The footnotes are insightful and nearly comprise a second work on their own. Peripheral issues such as theories of human knowledge ala Locke, Kant, and the Aristotelian \\"triadic\\" relation of words - concepts - object are explained here along with a lucid discussion of \\"intention\\" and \\"meaning\\". Most importantly, the final chapter illustrates why such a discussion on the distinction between man and animal is important highlighting the relevant moral and theological questions that are implicated by the results."},{"Title":"The difference of man and the difference it makes (Meridian books)","review":"Who are the people who suddenly discover what it feels like to learn something? Our technology can be applied to make music from anything that produces sounds likeSample the Dogfor Oh Lord, let us sample the dog, but the sum of useful pleasure addictions keeps bouncing around like a cosmic pogo stick up.Early in this book by Mortimer Adler are some modes of difference. Adler is mainly concerned about the difference in kind and differences in degree. Each whole number is discrete, and the intermediate compromises don't exist when the law of the excluded middle is applied for things that \\"only\\" do or do not pop up on every cosmic pogo stick up ride. 2013 might be an unlucky year, which would make it the perfect time for getting rid of all the lotteries that imply how the marginal thinking of millionaires and billionaires might be distributed by whoever can gather wealth from anybody taking a chance on small odds to produce a pile that will be given to a chosen few.twenty plus thirteen is 33, about where Nietzsche suggested: Nail every enthusiast to a cross in his 30th year. Thomas Jefferson was 33 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence asserting individual rights to self-government. Every one thousand years a millennium reaches its adolescence. 2013 is much farther into a vortex than 1913, when a mere century was at stake. I was 33 in 1980, when Walter Kaufmann reached the age of 59. In 2013 I will be 66, twice as old as I was when Walter Kaufmann sent me a post card on which he checked:Give it your best shot.I have been learning about the danger created by political systems when people try to communicate by reading something they don't want to think. Those who believe they are responsible for imposing order upon people who are only trying to entertain the absurd results of experiments that tend to vary by degrees instead of being a particular kind of lucky winner, for whom life reflects sweetness and light and governments exist to protect the property rights of righteous gains from the acceptable forms of gambling and pleasure addictions. Acts of kindness create danger when dealing with a singer like Aimee Mann, who has worries that kindness can kill if you listen to what she is singing in Deathly.Deep thinking is episodic. Walter Kaufmann could think that the holocaust which wiped out many of the European Jews was far too large to be as logical as a single Jewish journalist writing in 1913 that Germany needed to have a war to purify itself because a best friend of the Kaiser was fooling around with bisexual behavior and being friendly with foreigners. Goofy ideas in newspapers don't seem like much until Germans feel that they are being blamed for World War I, which was like a sacred duty when Germans were being told to go kick the rest of the world all to hell.What you people really need to know about the next thousand years is you got to look sharp, like Delbert McClinton, who sang Itain't What You Eat But the Way How You Chew It. Some people have jobs that allow them to take a year off when they want a change. When I was in the army, I wanted an early out when I came home from Vietnam, so I stayed in Nam long enough to get a 150 day drop on my two years of active service. I also wanted to drop any reserve requirements that might Bag Dad for overseas power plays.Great thinkers have been afraid to say anything new until now. Shut down the casino. The American dollar was just a dumb version of credit default swaps, none of which will be any good if you people can't think your way out of intermediate states which have never been possible. Walter Kaufmann was a sitting duck as an American philosopher because Americans don't have philosophy or just wars or even money. Electronic financial transactions convoluted the idea of wealth into hyberbolic cyberpower beyond the comprehension of the kind of people who want to be responsible for checking with Moses to see if we need any new laws."},{"Title":"The difference of man and the difference it makes (Meridian books)","review":"Adler believes that morality requires consciousness and that our best (only?) evidence of a being being conscious is its linguistic behavior.Compare Adler's thesis with Julian Jaynes' (Origin of Consciousness in the Break Down of the Bicameral Mind) and with Douglas Hofstadter's comments, pp. P6-P7, in the new preface to the 20th-anniversary edition of Godel, Escher, Bach.

Two-thirds of each application section (Word, Excel, etc.) was just a rehash of &quot;Office automation 101&quot;, information that could be gleaned from working with macros.

As the political cartoonist at BYU in 1979-80 I decided to compile a book about the BYU Experience that only students can know. \\"Zoobie\\" is a slang term for students that attend BYU (or more affectionately B.Y. Zoo). The reference to Zoo is applied because of the wide diversity of students that attend there. The book covers what it is like to attend BYU from the Student's point of view. It is a collection of actual articles, photos, letters to the editor and cartoons from all the major cartoonists at BYU during the Dallin Oaks years. Most of those cartoonist went on to become professionals at different newspapers across the country. It's not just a historical scrapbook, but is heavilly slanted to the humorous side of student like including BYU Coed jokes and hilarious quotes that arose in the 70's. Copyright priviledges were obtained to the other cartoons which includes Grondahl's classic cartoon of the BYU student that had been mugged, having BYU Security (police) investigating the incident. The manged student saying, \\"All I said was let he without sin cast the first stone.\\" Being able to laugh at ourselves and our self righteous quirks is what makes BYU the most unusual place to go to college. Over the years I received numerous letters and even read a few reviews online about the book and how funny it was, especially from past students. The book for sale on this page is the coveted original edition. In 2010 we republished the book for those who didn't want to pay such a heafty price for a collectable.

The four volumes cover the life and career of Robert E. Lee and do it in a manner that you simply do not want to stop. I enjoyed each and ever page of each volume. Freeman's research is almost beyond question and of course he had the advantage of being much closer to Lee (time wise) that other, more recent biographers. Freeman's style is extremely readable, particularly when you consider the era in which it was written. Yes, the four volumes are a bit intimidating when you look at them on the shelf, but is is quiet surprising how fast they read and how much important, interesting and useful information the author has packed into them. Strange as it may sound, these volumes are real page turners. Anyone interested in the Civil War and R.E. Lee in particular should indeed read this work.

The projects are solid, they work well and do what they are supposed to do.Despite this, the book has plenty errors throughout, as in the section that talks about resistors, it is correct where it needs to be, where it gives the value for each color, but the examples it uses are not(red, black, red = 1000 when it should equal 2000).When you start a project, it lists the parts that are needed, but doesnt give more than \\"resistor 10kohms,\\" and you have to figure out which is which. Not until later projects does it tell you which color codes to use.The end of the book has an order form for individual project kits, one kit for each project at around 30-40$ apiece when you can get the same pieces (for most of the projects) for 15-20 at radioshack.My summary of this book is that it uses a few good project ideas and was sloppily put together to fill a shelf and sell kits, rather than make a quality product."},{"Title":"The Third Uncle","review":"He treats me like a child--I'll show him!

I found it fun to compare with my own experiences, working in a department store in the early 1980s while putting myself through secretarial school."},{"Title":"Here Come the Brides","review":"I first read Here Come the Brides in the late 1960's, so this was a re-read for me. It's a fun book, very fast paced and well written. The author is an English gentleman, writing in the first person as an American woman in her 20's living in mid-1960's NYC, working in the bridal department of a large NYC department store. The author makes a few mistakes as to how American women of that time period dressed and talked. For instance, most American women in the mid-1960's didn't wear hats and gloves to work, and on their days off they certainly didn't dress up in a suit and \\"brogues\\" to take a walk and visit a museum. Most young American women, both then and now, have never even heard of \\"brogues\\". They are heavy walking shoes, and no American girl would be caught dead wearing them with a suit.

He shows how to contact ones inner guide through visualization and gives advice on all aspects of working with inner guides. This book is not about channeling, but the only book I ever found on hermetism. Hermetism is the practice of magick using imagination alone without the need of drawing circles on the ground to control spiritual forces that are summoned forth. The author provides an invaluable service to all students of spirituality by writing this book. He proves that students here in the west, have a rich tradition they can use without having to travel to the east in search of a guru. You can be your own teacher and this book shows how to do it."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I was first introduced to this book back in 1992. It changed my life. Having been raised Catholic, but being fortunate enough to have had exposure to the tenants of Buddhism, I was no stranger to the basic principles of prayer and meditation. The question was always what to do with this 'time alone with one self'. The Inner Guide Meditation was the answer I was looking for. It's a very powerful tool that, regardless of what your religious beliefs are, gives you access to the energies that make us who we are. If you read and follow the guidelines within, you will be able to ask questions of, and get answers from, the energies that drive our behavior, and you can resolve the tensions that naturally reside within all of us. It's a simple practice that once you get the hang of it will serve you very well.The author is, sadly, now deceased, and the center he founded no longer exist. The recommendation of having a chart done to help you identify your trouble spots is not essential to successful meditation. Once you begin your practice, simply meet each of the energies and take notes on what positive thing they need from you in your everyday life. Check back regularly with them and your Guide and make adjustments as necessary until a harmony is developed between you and that energy. It's a lot of fun, although difficult at times, but very rewarding. The positive changes in your life will astound you.If you approach this method with an open mind, and take the time to read the 1st 50 pages about 2 or three times, and actually try it, you will be pleasantly suprised at how much spiritual homework you'll be able to complete, and at the positive changes in your life. Please note that once you get into this, there will be times when it gets VERY difficult to get through a particular issue. It's as if you've been climbing a flight of stairs and with every step towards the next plateau, a 10 pound weight is added to your shoulders. Those last few steps can seem impossible to make. That weight is the resistance your ego presents to the challenge of change. Just stick to it. You will make it to that next plateau.There really is nothing else out there like it (although someone recently wrote a VERY similar book but calls it something else and makes no reference to this piece of work). The beauty of this method is that it really transcends religion and, regardless of whether or not you can relate to the imagery or spiritual references, is a great tool for inner work.Enjoy the book and good luck with your spritual growth."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"This book provides a journey into the self that can truly provide the kind of self knowledge that can set you free. The author is an astrologer. I have had my chart done many times and I always came away depressed about aspects in my chart that seemed to doom my life to struggles that I could not win. The author has worked out ways to deal effectively with the things that are a challenge to the individual. I had a marvelous experience with one of the meditation exercises when only a few pages into the book. This solved a health problem that I had for some time. This book has techniques that work for a person such as myself who have been into metaphysics for years and years, or people that are relatively new to meditation. The people I gave the book to said that it was the first book that worked for them right away. This is not a book just to read, it has techniques than, when practiced, are life changing."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I would recommend this book to all who are not in a position to interact directly with meditating groups and teachers. Especially the first section of the book is loaded with many important technical details on how to meditate, which usually are available only by interactions with live teachers (as opposed to purely book knowledge). The only weakness of the text is that the second part of it (questions and answers) strives at addressing too many different topics at the cost of loosing the instructive qualities of the first part."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"OK - I'll admit it - even though I wouldn't use everything from this book verbatim and for my own personal use and in my hypnotherapy practice I have adapted some of the techniques from this book - I still find the book a worthwhile reading.The following exerpt may give you an idea - a gist of this book:\\"The following is a lovely example of transforming outer experiences by working with inner archetypes. The process engages \\"active imagination\\" and its purpose is to transform one's negative unconscious projections.The example involves the assistance of an Inner Guide (you may as well just ask the unconscious/superconscious to bring up the appropriate image or just let it surface into your awareness).Say, for instance, that your neighbor is trying to poison your dog. Ask your Guide to take you to or bring you the image of that neighbor as you know him to be in the outer world. Then give that image permission to take its true form as it lives in you. Say that it turns into Dracula. The Dracula image is a picture of the energy in your that projects out from you onto your neighbor and gets him to try to poison your dog.Call on the Transformational Energies (these may be energies represented just as Light and Love, or angels, planetary forces, Tarot cards, etc.). If you are familiar with the Tarot cards, you can pick the images/energies of Sun, Fool and High Priestess.Ask them to send their love into the figure (Dracula) to heal and transform it so that it reaches its highest possible form in you at this time. After they do this, say that the Dracula figure has turned into a King. Dracula and the King are the same energy, the King being its higher, more conscious form.Ask the King what you have to do new in thought, action or behavior (having nothing to do with your neighbor), so that the energy the King represents in you will remain constant and not sink back into unconsciousness and its Dracula form.When you have received this information, give the King energy form permission to enter your body. Feel what part of your body this energy lives in and where it radiates from. If the transformation is successful and you have really changed this part of yourself, the neighbor will either change dramatically or go out of your life immediately. Because you have changed your role needs and no longer need a dog poisoner in your reality, the neighbor's choices are to change as a role player for you or leave your reality.Never work with images of known people from the outer world in the inner world. It tends to sustain rather than release negative unconscious projections. Always ask the image of the known outer world person that your Inner Guided brings you to take its true form AS IT LIVES AS AN ENERGY WITHIN YOU. This insures that you are, in fact, working on an aspect of yourself.You can go to images of everyone you know and ask each of these outer world figures to take its true form as it lives in you. Here you will get the images of what you are projecting on each of them. It's both fascinating and revealing to do this and to discover just what we are projecting on those people we love best or least.\\""},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I have been talking with my own \\"inner guide\\" for about 8 years now. My guide has all of the \\"True Guide\\" qualities that the author describes. My first experience with my guide was very intense and it literally changed my life. This guide continued to be with me off in the corner of every single one of my meditations always there if I ever needed anything. My guide never offers any opinions and will never tell me what to do even if I ask directly. My guide is never judgemental and is the most peaceful being I've ever encountered.My problem with this book, although it has some really great ideas, was that it says that your true guide can not be female. Nor can it have wings or appear angel like. The author also says that a true guide will always appear to you if you are open. I have found these things to be untrue in my own experience. My guide has always had a feminine presence and she rarely shows herself to me. Enstead she is more like a guiding voice, an energy that I very clearly feel in the top right side of my meditations. The time that she showed herself to me 8 years ago (this wasn't the only time but it was the most vivid and intense) I told her that I wanted to see her and she asked me to turn my palms up. As soon as i did she came right up to me. She was floating, almost fluttering in front of me. She appeared to be made of bright, white, glowing energy. She had the shape of a human face but she wasn't human. She smiled and she kissed my face and held my hands and I started crying uncontrolably. For this book to say that your guide can not be anything but a man was rather offensive to me. Perhaps becasue I am a woman but also simply because my guide is female. My mother's guide is a male so I do know that females can have male guides but I met my inner guide before I even knew that OTHER people had guides too. For awhile I thought I was insane!Another problem I had with this book is that the author spent about one third of the book answering questions of people who wanted to know more about the Inner Guide Meditation. If you already have a guide and have been working with him/her then this whole section might be a little redundant. The author also gives alot of \\"have to's.\\" For example, if you don't do it this one way then it won't work. In my personal experience there are so many ways to communicate with your guide. If you're confused just ask your guide. I can't imagine one man's way of working with his guide being the ONLY right way."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I was taught the IG med 20 years ago by a mentor. I was a left-brain skeptic hypnotist then, and I had a terrible time with it. \\"It's just my imagination!\\" \\"Of course it's your imagination. That is the tool. It's a two-way function. Your subconscious uses it to talk back to you.\\" I made a commitment to doing it twice a day for 30 days to see if I could become capable of not feeling like it was a waste of my time. It took far less than that to get a clue to the power of it.If you do these altered state (theta brainwave dominance is where this sort of thing normally happens after all), that helps for most people. This can be so powerful, and the inner world so \\"autonomous,\\" it can kick your a**, make you bawl, change your entire perspective on something, and when done right and a few on different aspects of the same topic, can cause such radical changes in your \\"reality\\" it can freak you out. Eventually, the only hard thing is doing it, because your psychology figures out the power of it (change=death and all) and then \\"getting around to it\\" can be damn difficult.I began this without astrology or tarot, except for a few 'planets'. (Sun rocks, and if developed over time is like a local and decently talkative god, little-g.) I didn't take tarot or astrology seriously so although I was introduced to it, I avoided that. I learned to make anything(s) you can conceptualize into an archetype and work with that, instead. I think that was good, as I came to redefine whatever it is we're working with, as being infinite and essentially, an 'identity' as 'an arbitrary collection of consciousness assigned a title', totally creative and flexible. I've learned that the result of dividing the universe up into 78 or 12 or (...) pieces, in astro and tarot, is something incredibly powerful. I was biased against those models. I regret that it took me over 15 years to begin getting a clue about that. There are other systems (the table of elements, the body skeletal structure or organs, etc.) for those interested.I am on my 4th IG, the first female. I find it bizarre that Steinbrecher saw this gender pattern in IGs, which I didn't realize until after I had her. I thought my IGs were male until then because that's what I was comfortable with is all. She is also the first angelic, or perhaps I am just finally to the point of truly being able to perceive the 'holy'; my sense is this is a capacity which often has to be developed. I loved the 3rd IG so much it required inner intervention to get me to let go of him and quit crying about it. This IG is creative in ways that blow my mind. The complexity and depth of what often goes on is often the max my brain cells are capable of dealing with. It has required so much radical restructuring of how I think just to wrap my brain around stuff, let alone acquire mental fluency with attention/process in new ways. Much of this has ended up being profoundly shamanic in nature, or perhaps it is cabalic. I don't follow anybody else's systems, so I don't really know those (I have a saying that \\"the only tenets of truth I hold are based on personal experience\\") except the surface symbols, but much experience seems to correspond with those archetypes. In the end it's all cosmology (spirituality, psychology, physicality, etc. is just another perspective on cosmology, like wave/particle or ice/water or something) which I am still working to wrap my tiny little brain around.IG current gave me a glimpse through her of the true potential we had together, and I realized with incredulity that the process model, and a ton of related belief systems, was about 1% of 1% of what was possible. So I just have a regular date with IG to have her do with me whatever she thinks is best. This has left most of the ES IGM model behind now. That is a good model though, and a great place to start. But it is a doorway. Steinbrecher opened a door and described how to walk through it. There is a whole world to explore beyond that. Do it consistently and with an open mind and eventually, who's behind the door will take you forward from there.My teachers are inside me now, not outside. A good thing, since years of searching and blogging haven't found me anybody else really seriously doing this for the long term and recording it. Which is confusing, since it's pretty fascinating, so you'd think there'd be IG-Journey sorts of blogs all over. (See palyne.com click 'psiche' choose 'archetype meditation' category, for some of mine, probably best to go back in time a ways in that category to get past tarot to other stuff.) I long for decent community that shares experience like this, but so far it feels like a path I walk alone.I've enjoyed reading Jung and Steinbrecher (particularly Jung's Red Book) as they so clearly were on this important road long before. Although I disagreed with ES about Seth and Jane Roberts, and although thinking he was brilliant doesn't mean I think he had the final word on anything, still, this book is a total classic and is the benchmark of the genre. I wish I knew what 'else' ES thought or knew about this work, I'd have been so interested to hear what else or more he learned over time. I recommend that the introduction by Israel Regardie of all people give a clue to the nature of this kind of work--it is not merely fun, but has depths that can change your self and your world. This book is a good intro for anybody."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I think this book has very useful information for connecting to Holy Guardian Angel.and this is related with hypnosis. but anyway this book is not bad. Thanks very much.Have a good day."},{"Title":"Search for the Real and Other Essays","review":"Hans Hofmann's biography is very colorful. And his essay \\"Search for the Real\\" was a good read for any artist. Even if you don't really understand it or agree with his ideas, the descriptions of plasticity and push/pull are very enlightening. I'm sure he was an amazing teacher. This book is a good read for any artist, as well as for people who do not make art (to get a better understanding of the mind of the artist). This book was great! I recommend Kandinsky's \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\" as a wonderful companion to this book. Between the two your mind can encompass art and thinking that is related to art in new (maybe even familiar) ways."},{"Title":"Search for the Real and Other Essays","review":"Hofmann has received more and more attention from scholars and writers on art as time has gone by. This is the essential collection of his lucid and illuminating remarks on art. Hofmann's writings (along with Kandinsky's \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\" and other neglected texts) give the lie to the formal aesthetic analysis of art historians who have pigeon-holed abstract expressionism as the species of disruptive innovation that it was and nothing more, when in reality its practitioners had deeply personal philosophical and spiritual concerns. Hofmann believed that the artist must translate his feelings for nature into a creative interpretation of the medium. In other words, \\"to explore the nature of the medium (i.e., the paint) is part of the understanding of creation, as well as part of the process of creation.\\" So the artist doesn't create a mirror image of nature, but rather the artist communicates an engagement with the essence of things through the creation of art (e.g., a painting) that becomes a shining, transcendent, \\"spiritual\\" object in its own right. He took a Hegelian approach - the artist's interior life, plus the medium, creates a \\"spiritual synthesis\\" that is a new thing in the world.Heady stuff, and not for the faint of brain, but if you're not a stranger to philosophy or otherwise willing to explore the nuances of what happens when an artist approaches the canvas (what Hofmann calls \\"the blending of experience gained in life with the natural qualities of the art medium\\") then you just found the Artist's Bible for the post-representational world of expression."},{"Title":"Search for the Real and Other Essays","review":"But it turned out to be amazing.

If you're looking for an art theory book \\" The Art Question \\" or \\" Art and Fear\\" are much better books."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"This is a book that at times reads a bit like a Ph.D. thesis, but's it really much better than that.If you've ever entertained the idea that popular films such as The Matrix, or TV shows (X-Files) might be saying something interesting about ideas in today's world at some deeper level, but you're not really sure what it is, this is the book to read. Nelson shows how Robocop, the Terminator and so on are just the latest puppets standing in for a certain way of thinking about the world, even a 'religious' way of thinking, that in fact is very ancient in Western society. It's been driven into eclipse by our modern, scientific, and materialistic society, but becomes strangely ascendant the moment we walk into a movie theatre, read a Stephen King novel, or listen to a conversation about an 'interesting' movie at the water cooler. Why? Well, buy Nelson's book.I could imagine this book being misread as an attack on conventional religion, but it really has nothing to do with that. I could also imagine that some readers, not accustomed to slogging their way through terms such as 'Platonism', 'demiurge,' and so on, might miss out on finer moments in Nelson's work, when she casts off the robes of the academic (which don't really suit her, anyway) and speaks in plain language about her ideas.In any case, this is a fine book well worth a careful reading in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"If you have bookshelves at home covering sci-fi/fantasy/horror, mythology, AI, psychology, alchemy, animation, and semiotics, and know them only as &quot;things I'm interested in&quot; without being aware of any other common thread, Victoria Nelson just might convince you that you are interested in those things for the same reason she is, and that people throughout history have been: you are mapping a geography of human imagination, taking a journey that you can't help but pursue. Although the book is structured as a history of ideas, there's an autobiography being told, too, about a precocious, sensitive kid fleeing grad school to Hawaii (just as I did) only to return years later &quot;to finish the PhD thesis I never wrote&quot;. Along the way, you'd find many great books and films you may never have heard of."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read. My copy is heavily underlined and well-thumbed. There are few authors that connect the topics she does in the way she does it, and there are even fewer who do so with such insight. It's a hard book to describe as it includes much: puppets and humanity, reality and imagination, philosophy and religion, film and fiction, high and low culture. It's a fairly large book at around 300 pages of text and also there are useful notes in the back. Even though her ideas may be above the head of the average person, her writing style is easy to follow. If you're a somewhat curious and minimally intelligent person, then what you'll probaby enjoy about this book is learning new ideas and discovering new authors. I'm very well read and I came across a number of things I'd never heard of.Two topics Victoria Nelson covers that are of particular interest to me are Gnosticism and Noir. If you like these topics, then another book you'd like is Eric G. Wilson'sThe Melancholy Android: On the Psychology of Sacred MachinesandSecret Cinema: Gnostic Vision in Film. Wilson is directly influenced by Nelson. There aren't many books that look at the religious aspects of Noir, but another one is Thomas S. HibbsArts of Darkness: American Noir and the Quest for Redemption. Somewhat oddly, a major connection for these authors is that they all discuss Philip K. Dick who is a favorite author of mine. Dick was mainly a fiction writer, but also wrote non-fiction about what it is to be human in terms of philosophy, religion, and science (in particular the subjects of Gnosticism and androids). If you read Philip K. Dick's non-fiction, it will give you a richer perspective on the meeting of high and low culture (which is an emphasis of Nelson and Wilson)and on the dark quest for redemption (which all of these authors touch upon). Two Philip K. Dick books I'd recommend areThe Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical WritingsandIn Pursuit of Valis: Selections from the Exegesis. If you want a clear overview of Philip K. Dick's philsophical and religion thoughts, then you should readPink Beams of Light from the God in the Gutter: The Science-Fictional Religion of Philip K. Dickby Gabriel McKee.Some of Nelson's best insights revolve around the notions of imagination and reality, sanity and insanity (which are typical Philip K. Dick topics in both his fiction and non-fiction). This is where she discusses various genre writers (for example, Poe, Lovecraft, Schultz and Kafka) and where she explores the connection between psychology, spirituality and creativity. If you're intellectually fascinated by imagination and creativity, then there are some truly awesome books out there that would give even greater context to the already large context that Victoria Nelson provides. I'd guess that much of the groundwork for Nelson's thinking comes from the Jungian tradition of thinkers and she references Carl Jung a number of times (but she also discuses Freud). If you're interested in further reading about the imagination, then check out these other books:Dream & the Underworldby James Hillman,Imagination Is Reality: Western Nirvana in Jung, Hillman, Barfield, and Cassirerby Roberts Avens,Daimonic Reality: A Field Guide to the Otherworldby Patrick Harpur, andThe Trickster and the Paranormalby George P. Hansen.Besides my mentioning a number of related books, I'd consider The Secret Life of Puppets to be very unique. There are many books out there about these kinds of topics, but she brings it together in a very compelling way. These ideas easily could've become lost in abstract intellectuality if handled by a lesser writer."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"Overall Victoria Nelson has written a fine book. I was particularly interested in her Chapter on the American Fantastic Mode, and her excellent description of the difference, historically and currently, between European and American High Literature (Art). Where European high culture has embraced The Fantastic, in America the Genre has been delegated to comic books, murder mysteries, ghost stories, love-based romances, and recently, science fiction. Nelson points out that American literary icons such as Hawthorne or Fitzgerald only occasionally ventured into non-realism as \\"entertainments\\" leaving \\"fantasy\\" mostly for the pulp fiction mongers. She also seems to feel the \\"lower\\" form of fiction have been unjustly disparaged. Although the intent seems to be academic, Nelson's prose style renders THE SECRET LIFE OF PUPPETS more of a pleasure read than a textbook."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"This book is amazing. The most fascinating book of nonfiction I have read in 10 years. It will definitely develop a strong cult audience, although the author/scholar maintains a truly balanced and studious examination of the phenomenon at the heart of the book. This is one of those books that will almost make the nonfiction bestseller list, if nobody in marketing pushes it. If they want to push it -- well, I can imagine all the die-hard realists who will foam at the mouth. But they are a pretty fuddy-duddy bunch of worn-out hasbeens anyhow, and you will see why when you sink your teeth into this one.This book answers a lot of serious and critical questions concerning the transcendental imagination and its underestimated and ignored role in our pragmatic culture. If you have often thought that the Academics who rule the roost (and the brain-washed editors who determine which novels will and will not be nominated for the Pulitzer) have lost their pathway to the great darkness which holds volumes of helpful and fairly eternal light, Victoria Nelson will put place your nearly correct, incomplete thoughts into a realm of rich and understandable meaning.This book is a well-thought out prophesy of the richer literature to come. Prepare to enter the unexplainable, miraculous, demonic realms of subject matter upheld as most significant by Platonic thinkers, who are by far more adventurous than that other bunch."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"Victoria Nelson must not think the genre she is writing about is worthy of accuracy. Just off the top of my head I found three mistakes in a single chapter. Alan Moore's graphic novel The Watchmen is referred to, amusingly, as The Nightwatchman. She also credited the writing of the movie Beetlejuice to Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson (it was written by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren) and credited the movie Edward Scissorhands to McDowell (this is the movie written by Burton and Thompson). This suggests an utter contempt for the subject matter, as though it's not worth her time (or her editor's) to fact check the titles or the authors of the works she is citing. If you don't think such mistakes are insulting, imagine an academic book referring to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabana.This patronizing attitude leads to an examination of fantasy and science fiction wherein Trekkies are compared to Heaven's Gate cultists and fandom is given quasi-religious motives. I suppose the author must scratch her head in confusion at the idea that people find it fun to go to science fiction conventions or watch shows like Star Trek, but that just makes me wonder why she, of all people, chose to write a book about it."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"I recommend this book for anyone curious with the trends in popular media in using facsimiles of ourselves in the form of robots, aliens, etc.Very interesting read. I like the discussion of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and the critical reactions to the book during her time. The strong reactions were more about tramping on religious' ideas of creation being limited to God rather than focusing on science getting out of control.The book briefly mentions the Soderberg movie remake of Solaris. A movie about an actual facsimile created by the planet Solaris. The terminator movies and nearly every other movie released today could be interpreted in light of the ideas discussed in the book.I never finished the book because I got caught up with other things. I'll go back and finish this one. Just need the time."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"I may be hopelessly low-brow, but I really don't know what to make of this book. At the end of Chapter 1, the author writes:\\"But caveat lector, those in the know view the process as irreversible. What come out of the hole, the hole of this book that you must crawl into, will not be the same as what went in\\". I have read all the way to Chapter 9, and I still don't get it. I may be dense, but aside from some interesting ideas, I see no hermetic initiation or anything justifying the self-serving paragraph I quoted above. In any case, I certainly was expecting at least an intellectual experience worth remembering. I feel I have been deceived and that the book is nothing more than an example of a kind of intellectuality that attempts to be esoteric and mysterious. Rather snobish, if you ask me."},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Puppets","review":"Nice way to connect wide range of topics.

Craven in his slim collection of lectures in taking a more interpretive than narrative approach to the Civil War finds that the majority of people in the North and South were conservative and only reluctantly came to war. Unlike most historians, he believes that slavery was not the primary cause of the war. He admits in another of his books, \\"The Coming of the Civil War,\\" that his approach is \\"revisionist\\" but he said that his \\"effort in this book was to balance the picture, not to present a Southern point of view or to defend slavery\\" (vii). He believes that he was more fairly presenting the issues involved leading up to the war rather than accepting traditional, northern-centric biases.In his shorter book, he says that Lincoln's election precipitated secession because the South found that it must submit to Republican Party views or lose its way of life. He finds that the attitudes within that party justifiably gave rise to southern fears about its political domination and eventual abolition. Revolutionary changes in the North were based on its views of wealth and sin. He finds a cooperative management/labor paradigm shifting to an exploitative one in the new industrial North which led, in part, to condemning slavery as contributing to the problems of those exploited northern workers and farmers. Moral aspects in the North including religious revivalism combined with political reasons added to the party's antislavery stance which the South interpreted as primarily an abolition threat. Thus the disparate groups which finally made up the Republican Party gave southern interests valid reasons for worry over the future political power of the South and the concomitant threats to slavery.In the South where radical change was anathema, any thoughts of becoming \\"modernized\\" along the northern paradigm were viewed with horror. Attitudes therefore hardened in the South as well as the North and finally all of the abstractions boiled down to a very simple, but profound difference as expressed by Lincoln in 1860: \\"You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted\\" (67). Alexander Stephen's position maintained the southern right to slavery because the Constitution protected that property right and therefore could not be restricted.Craven emphasizes the anti-slavery debates in some southern states to make his point that before positions of the two sections hardened in the 1850's there was a substantial minority in the South which did not view chattel slavery as a positive good. But after the Compromise of 1850, the economic interests of the Northwest and Northeast united against southern interests paving the way for a clearer North-South conflict. Craven finds that the forces involved in creating the \\"Modern World\\" mainly after 1830 forced great changes and \\"these forces made long standing problems acute and clothed them with emotion\\" (85 footnote). The South could not accept a weakened colonial status and definitely not accept the impending social-economic revolution (86).I found Craven's short book thought provoking because it challenged my orthodox, northern-centric biases of the causes of the war. Unfortunately, due to the book's brevity, he was unable to include footnotes, a bibliography, or an index. His studying the origins of the war from a scientific perspective is an excellent way to search for more complete explanations for the conflict.

Overshadowed by Whitman and the free verse followers of the twentieth century, Bryant, as well as all formal American poets of the 1800's, deserve a Renaissance.

I immediately was caught up in the feel of the sea and tale of the bruding master of the &quot;Lydia&quot;. Forester was a master of painting a word picture about the sea and I found it impossible to put down."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"Captain Horatio Hornblower is a collection of three short novels originally published in 1937 and 1938 as \\"Beat To Quarters\\", \\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\". All are set during the Napoleonic wars roughly between 1807 and 1811. The great success of these stories led Forester to write a number of Hornblower prequels and sequels, all of which are still read widely. It also spawned a long list of successors, some of which are excellent although none fully measure up to Forester in my opinion.Beat To Quarters introduces Hornblower taking HMS Lydia into the Pacific Ocean to insight a rebellion against the Spanish. The story takes a number of twists including Hornblower finding his ally is a madman, a change in the political situation and the introduction of Lady Barbara Wellesley, the fictional sister of the Duke of Wellington.Ship of the Line finds Hornblower commanding HMS Sutherland for a cruise in the Mediterranean. Hornblower not only must face the French but he must deal with a superior officer who would like to see him fail.Flying Colours begins where Ship of the Line ends. Hornblower is a prisoner in France and must find a way to escape.I thought that I knew these stories fairly well having seen the 1951 film Captain Horatio Hornblower staring Gregory Peck. However the novel is quite different in several areas. Perhaps what surprised me the most was the level of violence, sex and swearing that was included in the novel. I hadn't expected the violence to be as graphic, the sex to be as obvious or the swearing to be present at all. The novel has a gritty realism that was not matched in the genre until the 70s.Captain Horatio Hornblower was written when Forester was in his thirties and before he had thoroughly polished his craft. While it might have a few rough edges it is a tremendously powerful, action-filled novel. The shy, self-doubting, self-deprecating but outwardly implacable Hornblower is one of the great characters of adventure stories. If one were restricted to reading only one novel of \\"wooden ships and iron men\\" then that novel should be Captain Horatio Hornblower."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"I can't believe that there are not more reviews here for these books, since they are among the best popular novels ever written. I first read them in my dim and far away past, lead to them by my love of historical novels. I believe these three were written in the late 1930s while England was under the shadow of the Nazi march to dominance. Naturally tales of the war against Napoleon would resonate, but the books have lasted because of the quality of the plotting and the characters. Forester excelled at setting up unsolvable problems for Hornblower with clever solutions that keep suspense high and satisfy the intellectual needs of the reader. The interplay of the characters is excellent. When I was reading these books, my father told me that some of the stories appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, and that he remembered people talking about them all over town. These are great books if you like history and a good plot. I doubt they will ever go completely out of fashion. (Note: These books are much better than the video series about Hornblower. While interesting, that series has some laughable period details and has elevated Hornblower to almost superhuman status. It's the Hollywood version. Compare that to the production value and details in the movie Master and Commander and you will see what I mean.)"},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"I was introduced to the entire series of Hornblower books in 1972. I read them in order of hornblowers rank, Midshipman thru Admiral. They were all great, but the one I remember the most was Captain Horatio Hornblower. It began when he was Captain of H.M.S.LYDIA and ended when Hornblower, Lt.Bush and Coxswain Brown escaped back to England in H.M.S.WITCH OF ENDOR (they re captured this vessel from the French). It all began when the LIDIA captured the Spanish ship of the line Natividad on a dark night off the coast of South America only to discover later that England and Spain signed a peace treaty. Hornblower had to seek out the Natividad (which he had given to el Supremo) and sink or recapture it. He later met and fell in love with Lady Barbara Wellesly (the sister of the Duke of Wellington). Upon his return to England he was assigned a ship of the line the Sutherland. Once you begin reading this series of books you are compelled to read them all."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"Some may say Hamlet or Moby Dick, I say Captain Horatio Hornblower is the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"&quot;Captain Horatio Hormblower&quot; was first published as &quot;The Happy Return&quot; in 1937.

The price for the paper back was over $40. The Condition of the Book was remarkable and that made the price absolutely unbelievable! It was worth the price I paid and I think the company that sold it to me should have charged more but it is too late for that and I am VERY happy with the book!"},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"I once read a Hornblower short story which wasn't very good, so it was with some trepidation that I read these three novels. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only are they well-written and thrilling, but they are also, at times, thought-provoking.Fans of Star Trek, will instantly recognize the introspective and distant Hornblower as a partial model for Captain Piccard. Hornblower, like Piccard, must always keep his distance in order to maintain the respect necessary to maintain the chain of command. Forrester even has something like a \\"redshirt.\\"Hornblower's insecurity is really Forrester's stamp of originality. Paired with the violence of the story, it really helps to create a level of realism which is often lacking in other adventure stories. Even when the action is fantastical, the writing is so good that it never feels like a pulp.The length of these books is very approachable. The shortest one is about 150 pages long. The longest one isn't quite 200 pages, and there aren't many boring stretches. No ones writes like this any more, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"My father was an Iowa farm boy but when he was in college in the late \`30s, he became a fan of the early Hornblower stories as published in the magazines. When this omnibus volume of the first three novels (_Beat to Quarters_, _Ship of the Line_, and _Flying Colours_) came out, he bought it. And I inherited it -- having first read it in junior high and at least four or five times in the decades since. There were certainly well-received sea stories written before, but Forester reinvented the whole genre. Patrick O'Brian is a more subtle and much more literary writer than Forester, but without Hornblower, Jack Aubrey would never have existed. The adventure begins with Hornblower, in the navy since the age of seventeen (rather a late start, actually), in command of the LYDIA frigate on detached duty in the Pacific, which in 1809 pretty much still belonged to Spain. He's supposed to seek out and supply arms and aid to a reported rebel against Spanish authority, but the man turns out to be a raving megalomaniac who calls himself. In the process, he takes the 54-gun NATIVIDAD, a ship almost twice his weight in weapons. Then, for diplomatic reasons, he has to give it up to El Supremo -- and then, finally, Spain having changed sides in the war, he has to go and fight her once again. On the long voyage home, he has a passenger, Lady Barbara Wellesley, the (fictional) sister of General Sir Arthur, and a love affair ensues -- almost. The thing is, even though his officers and men think the world of him, and even though he has proven himself again and again a talented navigator, first-rate seaman, and indisputable leader of men, Hornblower has a very depressive opinion of his own abilities. He's extremely self-conscious of what others may think of him, he worries about his own personal courage, and he tends to attribute to good fortune those things which are actually the fruits of his own insights and careful planning. In the second book, Hornblower has been moved up to a 74-gun ship of his own in the western Mediterranean, and he has a good time creating consternation among the French in Septimania and Catalonia. And then he has to sacrifice his ship, more than half his crew, and his own liberty in order to keep a four-ship French squadron from causing its own havoc. The third volume sees Hornblower, the badly wounded Lieutenant Bush (always his right hand), and his coxswain, Brown, incarcerated as prisoners of war. But Bonaparte wants to make an example of them, so the three are packed into a carriage and sent off towards Paris. It's the beginning of winter and the chance arises to escape, so Hornblower grabs it. The rest of the story tells about them holed up until spring and then making their slow way down the Loire to the Atlantic, where they contrive a highjack a captured British cutter and fight their way out to the Royal Navy's blockading squadron. There are a few social attitudes and casual crudities in Forester's narrative, incidentally, that might make an uninformed reader squirm, but Forester was a product of his time, just like the rest of us. I recommend you read this volume first, but then go back to the first book by internal chronology (_Mr. Midshipman Hornblower_) and settle in."},{"Title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"I first read this book back in 1975.

GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Problems of the Chinese Revolution","review":"While probably not the best introduction for those unfamiliar with Trotsky's philosophy, this book hits the mark. In article after article, Trotsky shows how Stalin's policies were aimed against the interests of the international working class. Trotsky's arguments are many, but in essence, he argues that Stalin forced the Communist Party to subordinate itself politically to the bourgeois-nationalist Kuomintang party of Chiang-Kai-Shek. This obvious deviation from Marxism was justified by the Stalinists on the grounds that China was an oppressed country straining under the weight of western imperialism. Stalin -- and Mao -- argued that within backwards countries there exists something called the &quot;national bourgeoisie.&quot; Stalin and Mao repeatedly forced the working class and the peasantry to accept the domination of the so-called &quot;national bourgeoisie&quot; in the name of fighting imperialist oppression. Trotsky shows that the &quot;national bourgeoisie&quot; in the backwards countries is just the agent of imperialism, nothing more. Thus, Trotsky advances the theoryof the permanent revolution, which says that true national independence and agrarian reforms can come only in a struggle against the so-called national bourgeoisie."},{"Title":"Problems of the Chinese Revolution","review":"Trotsky's analysis of the early stages of the Communist Revolution in China is a remarkable exegesis of Stalin's dictatorial and anti-revolutionary attempts to organize a political leadership for the sake of working against the peasantry. Trotsky is especially meticulous in his documentation of Stalin's internal declarations of aligning the U.S.S.R. with the Chiang Kai-Shek and the Kuo-Min Tang. Trotsky writes: \\"The Communist Party of China has been a shackled party in the past period. It did not have so much as its own newspaper. Imagine what this means in general and especially in a revolution! [..] Can we tolerate anything like this? This means to disarm the the proletariat politically\\" (89). Trotsky constantly called for the arming of the proletariat and the forming of independent Soviets in China, while Stalin constantly fought against it. Perhaps if Trotsky had been in the position to implement his politics more directly the history of Communism in China would have been different."},{"Title":"Problems of the Chinese Revolution","review":"Recently I reviewed in this space Andre Malraux's Mate's Fate, a novelistic treatment of the Chinese Revolution of 1925-27 that emphasized the turmoil at the base of Chinese society in its late phase after the popular front alliance with General Chiang Kai-Shek's bourgeois nationalist Kuomintang broke down and Chaing began his extermination drive against the Chinese Communists. In Leon Trotsky's book, under review here, we get a real time, real life analysis of the political questions that led to that catastrophe and what revolutionaries could learn from it.I have noted elsewhere that the Communist International (hereafter Comintern) evolved in the mid-1920's , under the impact of Stalinization, from a revolutionary organization that made political mistakes, sometimes grossly so, in pursuit of revolution to an organization that pursued anti-revolutionary aims as it turned primarily into an adjunct of Soviet foreign policy. Prima facie evidence for such a conclusion is the Soviet Communist Party /Commintern policy and its implementation toward the budding Chinese Revolution.As much as policy toward the Chinese Revolution became a political football in the internal Russian Communist party fights between Stalin's bloc and Trotsky's bloc it is impossible to understand the strategy for the Chinese Revolution without an understanding of Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution. No Marxist, at least not openly and honestly, put forth any claim that in the West the national bourgeoisie could be a progressive force in any modern upheaval. Russia, in the early 20th century was, however, still a battleground over this question. This is where Trotsky formulated the advanced Marxist notion that in Russia the national bourgeoisie was too weak, too beholding to foreign capitalist interests and too dependent on the Czarist state and its hangers-on to fulfill the tasks associated with the classic bourgeois revolutions in the West. Thus, for Russia alone at that time Trotsky postulated that the working class had become the heirs of the revolutions in the West as well as its socialist tasks. The Revolution of 1905 gave a glimmer of understanding to that proposition and the Revolution of October 1917 cannot be understood except under that premise.In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution the question of who would lead the revolutions of the countries even less developed that Russia, mainly colonial and semi-colonial regimes, formed one of the new political battlegrounds. And China was the first dramatic test that Trotsky's original Russia only premise applied to underdeveloped \`third world' capitalist regimes, as well. However,unlike in Russia, this time Trotsky lost. The necessary independent organization of the working class and the political separation of the communist vanguard were not carried out and, to our regret, the Chinese Revolution was beheaded. As mentioned above this was a conscious Stalinist policy of kowtowing to Chiang by unequivocably ordering the Communist Party to make itself politically and miltarily subservient to the Kuomintang as well as providing Comintern military advisers to Chiang.Today, even a cursory look at countries of belated and uneven development hammers home the fact that the various tasks associated with the Russian and Chinese Revolutions still need to be carried out. Thus, the political fights that wracked the international communist movement in the 1920's which under ordinary circumstances would only be of historical interest today take on a more life and death meaning for many of the peoples of the world. That makes this book well worth the read.I would also add that there is a very interesting appendix at the end of this work detailing reports from the field filed by those Comintern agents that carried out Comintern policy in China and who, as a result, had become oppositionists. These reports give added ammunition to Trotsky's more theoretical arguments. They also give fresh and bones to the some of the points that Malraux was trying to bring out in Man's Fate.

What this book lacks in length it makes up for with a fastpaced story, wicked battle scenes, and a suprising amount of character development. The majority of the story is told from the perspective of the orcs, who remain refreshingly evil throughout the book (most villan oriented stories end up trying to humanize the bad guys, I'm glad this one didn't).

Calarco's production was applauded by critics for its unique placement of ROMEO AND JULIET with the sexually charged world of male adolescence. Calarco's four actors are students at the prep school who, during a break from their arduous and uneventful studies, decide to recite Shakespeare's famous play aloud. In a evening of all four male performers reciting R &amp; J as it was originally performed--with male actors playing all of the roles--two students begin to singularly read Romeo and Juliet. As unconventional a love story as its original, SHAKESPEARE'S R &amp; J presents young men searching for answers to their own lives and loves, using one of the most famous texts as a tool for self-discovery and expression. Though much of the text is pulled directly from Shakespearean text, we are watching an entirely different story unfold. And, with a few exceptions, it is mostly successful, and entirely theatrical."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's R&J; - Acting Edition","review":"I was so excited for this play to come in. I expected a complex mix of the oppression of Catholic school life and the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare's most famous lovers. Instead we get what is basically the script of Romeo and Juliet with lackluster stage directions and zero characterization. There are glimmers of characters, but we never get more than what we would get in some sort of table read. That's what R&J is, essentially: a table read.

I don't actually KNOW if there are any limitations in the script for directors/actors!)After having studied SHAKESPEARE extensively in a college ENGLISH program I believe this will become a favorite for college professor's use in the classroom. The story is reminiscent of the story of DEAD POETS SOCIETY in the coming of age comraderie of the boys in the prep school. Shakespere himself included the sexual ambiguity of Murcutio... so it wasn't such a unique insight, yet Calarco developed this theme to its fullest extent beautifully.This adaptation stands alone on its merits, yet used in conjunction with Shakespeare's work empahsises that more subtle sexual identity theme as well as the other more obvious social issues typically discussed.

I've read a good number and there are no others that compare. Granted, Finney's style is challenging to today's readers. Be prepared to work systematically, just like Finney worked in crafting these Spirit-enlightened and brilliant arguments. I read Finney for the first time in my twenties. His approach to interpreting scripture changed my thinking and my life for the better. My soul was blessed as Finney exposed with such dexterity the mistakes that one can make with the Bible. While Finney is a little severe in some areas, a true benevolence rests beneath his high expectations for believers. Finney's approach holds the key, in my opinion, to exposing the heresies that continue to diminish the success of Christianity, especially in the context of evangelism to intellectually energetic minds.Jonathan Blevins, another reviewer, treats Finney's work with no small amount of disdain. Forgive Jonathan: He is very young (he gives his age on his blog). As a young man I, too, spoke with strong conviction about things I did not well understand. There is a great deal we do not know -- much that we will still not know after reading many systematic theologies. Yet, you will treat yourself to a great adventure by reading Finney. To help with the task, get Philip Schaff's famous work \\"History of the Christian Church\\" (8 volumes). Give special attention to the period of 300 - 600 A.D., as this is the time frame when most of the christological and sotereological inventions were formalized and worked into Christian theology by means of political intrigue or force. Remember, there is no systematic theology as consequential as the Good Book itself."},{"Title":"Lectures on Systematic Theology Volume 1","review":"I've read halfway thru the first volume. Finney's Systematic Theology is not like other books on the subject. This book is a wealth of perspective and understanding. Yes, Finney uses his lawyer brain to analyze and build a systematic theology, but I find that it is excellent at explaining many ideas and thoughts that are new to me. I applaud truthinheart.com for preparing this book. I have read a few of his other books and found them to also be very clear and challenging."},{"Title":"Lectures on Systematic Theology Volume 1","review":"I first read Finney because of references to him in the works of A.W. Tozer (one of my favorite authors). Finney's life may have been Spirit-filled, but his understanding most certainly was not. I object to the reviewer who compares him to Jonathan Edwards--Finney takes his lawyer's mind and twists the scripture to fit his understanding of justice. His theology is indeed rational and logical--but it is in no way biblical. He proves that &quot;the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing&quot; (1 Cor. 1:18). Truly it was folly to Finney.He plainly teaches against the graciousness of God and the saving power of the blood of Christ--arguing from a multiplicity of &quot;laws&quot; that Christ's sacrifice could not atone for our sins, but that we must pay the price for them ourselves by good works. Out of this flow Finney's concept of the Holy Spirit as the agent by which we are enabled to live perfect and holy lives--through which we are justified before God and satisfy His divine justice. No teaching has been more thoroughly refuted and despised as this: that man is saved by works, not of grace or through faith.In fact, I wonder that Finney mentions Christ at all! What need is there for a Savior if we are fully able to save ourselves? Indeed, Finney believes that Christ died to set an example for us, so we would not take God's mercy for granted and &quot;continue in sin that grace may abound&quot; (Rom. 6:1). Therefore the Son of God, the blessed Lord and Savior, has shed His precious blood for no greater reason than to show us what happens if we sin?! Such heresy has rarely been uttered even by the lips of the most defiled sinner! What is more distressing is that so many today actually BELIEVE this!I do not despise Finney as a brother in Christ, nor do I deny that He was greatly used of God in his generation to awaken many to the need for godliness and faithfulness in these last days. But I DO deny that he taught the truth concerning salvation--indeed, that he had any semblance of understanding at all. This reaches far beyond the Arminian/Calvinist debate. This theological system is founded upon the most destructive of all heresies--the denial of salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and not of works (Eph. 2:8-9).

It's been helpful at all levels. I recommend it to undergrads who are just interested in psychology, to anyone wanting to brush up on any area of psychology, and to psychologists or psychologists-in-training who want a handy reference to look up new or unfamiliar terms. It contains clear illustrations -- for example, of the eye and of some optical illusions -- and includes a separate list of common statistical formulas, a list of Greek symbols found in psychology, and a list of abbreviations commonly found in psychology.It has entries for everything from the most broad topics, e.g. &quot;behaviorism&quot;, which gets a lengthy encyclopedic-like entry, to the most narrow, e.g. &quot;phobophobia: fear of fearing&quot;, &quot;bad trip&quot;, and &quot;Barnum effect&quot;. It includes biographical entries. It includes many entries concerning statistial analyses used in psychology -- factor analysis, Latin square, rank order correlation, etc. Every aspect of psychology is included here -- the physiological, the psychoanalytic, the behavioral, you name it. All in a very small and concise package -- ordinary paperback size and probably less thick than the latest John Grisham novel.Each entry leaves you with a good grasp of the basics of the term in question.This is a good book for picking up and browsing if you're just trying to edify yourself, and it's a good book to have handy if you are surrounded by psychologists (or books) who occasionally hit you with a term you aren't quite sure of or would like to know more about.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Psychology","review":"Has basic information and definitions about psych terms but once you get past the basics the book looses its value.

In this timely book by former Senator and 1972 Democratic nominee for president, George McGovern, a cogent defense of this much maligned philosophy is offered. Liberalism, not conservatism, is the true compassionate political philosophy, and McGovern defends it masterfully. In my opinion the best quote in the book comes from chapter 3 where McGovern points out the obvious difference between the liberal and conservative view on the role of government: \\"I challenge my conservative friends to name a single federal program now generally approved by both of our major parties that was not first pushed by liberals over the opposition of conservatives.\\" McGovern cites Social Security and Medicare as two of the best known examples, but I can think of a number of others such as the FDIC, the SEC, Head Start, just to name a few.But perhaps the most important message in this book is that America should return to those ideals that once made it the most respected and envied country in the world: compassion, decency, and respect for the opinions of mankind. By doing this the United States could begin to win the war on terror and recapture its position as the most respected and admired nation in the world. Such a scenario would produce the cooperation and goodwill necessary to defeat the menace of terrorism. This message is needed now more than ever. I highly recommend this wonderful little book."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"George McGovern's, The Essential America, is a candid, refreshingly-honest discussion of American liberalism, today's &quot;most maligned political philosophy.&quot; This great American statesman tackles the criticisms of liberalism head-on, and clearly demonstrates how both the liberal and conservative traditions have evolved and eroded politically. George McGovern remains ever-faithful to the &quot;social gospel,&quot; teachings instilled in him at any early age by his father, a devoted follower of John Wesley. Moreover, McGovern's political beliefs are soundly and squarely rooted in the U.S. Constitution.McGovern remains unafraid to espouse liberalism--whether it be Jefferson's, Lincoln's, or his own. In so doing, he demonstrates how far America has strayed from the brilliant guidance of our founding fathers. He addresses all of the toughest issues of our day, including the war in Iraq, world hunger, and, of course, international terrorism.This is a book only George McGovern could have written--specific, thoughtful, provocative-- a blueprint for a wiser, stronger American future in a more peaceful world."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"George McGovern has always been a voice of reason and it's good to see he's still around and speaking out about things that are great about America and things at which cause us concern as a nation. You won't find many neocons reading \\"The Essential America\\" because they've \\"written\\" their own book on this country...and gotten us into a lot of trouble because of it. McGovern points out that so much of America's spending is in non-productive areas....much of it in defense that has produced us with little tangible results over the past fifty years. He rightly concludes that the current president and his ilk in Washington have not made the United States any safer in the world, but more vulnerable, given the needless foray into Iraq and the even larger question of the uneven tilt toward Israel. We'll be paying the price for those mistakes for ages to come.Senator McGovern speaks of his war service in this book but does so humbly and with many references about what patriotism should be. He reminds us of the hollow phrase, \\"America...love it or leave it\\" and echoes his own words from 1972....\\"let us change America, so we can love it the more.\\" I hope this is a fitting prelude to the defeat of George Bush in November...or to put it more liberally...erasing America's mistake. \\"The Essential America\\" provides a ringing endorsement of the liberal tradition in this country and it is a book that is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"The 167 pages are easy and enjoyable reading. Buy several copies as gifts for all your friends and neighbors, especially young people.The elder statesman explains how the search for the just society and a moral foreign policy based on reason and enlightened self-interest has been an essential part of the American quest from the beginning. Recognizing that both conservatism and liberalism are essential elements of the American tradition, he invites the reader to apply the principles of our nation's founding fathers to such issues as diverse as the Israel-Palestinian conflict, health care in America and hunger throughout the world.The counsel of history helps inspire his opposition to never ending unwinnable wars that only prolong and worsen human agony producing uncontrollable results that frequently inflame whole regions to catastrophe; isolate America, weaken our own security and undermine our national interests as well as our values.In spite of his crushing 1972 defeat (38% of the popular vote) at the hands of the Nixon campaign which was routed in a criminal conspiracy and more recently; the rise to dominance of the radical right and their dangerous policies, this old historian's optimism is infectious. He reminds the reader that ideological blindness will not dominate forever. He predicts that liberalism will play a far greater role in the next 25 years than it did in the past 25 years. Perhaps genuine conservatism will also make a come-back.This great man's compassion finds inspiration in the Methodism of John Wesley as well as the Christian social gospel which considers the search for social justice a natural expression of personal salvation.One is struck by his bottomless well of charity and kindness even to his political adversaries. He even makes a point to praise Richard Nixon for launching the Environmental Protection Agency, supporting civil rights and opening the door to China.(May I also recommend his 1978 autobiography, \\"Grassroots\\"?)In the U.S. Senate, George McGovern was a brilliant bipartisan visionary who joined forces with his good friend and senatorial colleague, Robert Dole in skillfully crafting, maneuvering, legislating and implementing the most massive assault on malnutrition in American history. He stresses that liberalism needs conservatives to point out its weaknesses and minimize its excesses. Both political philosophies have been with our Republic since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson bitterly battled with each other in an ideologically divided young nation. Both philosophies have redefined themselves numerous times as history developed. Both are as American as can be.Certain snobbish and mean-spirited know-it-alls have twisted and spun and rewritten reality in a desperate and pathetic effort to make the good name of George McGovern synonymous with 1960's counterculture chaos and confusion and to blame monstrous results of monstrously misguided and long discredited policies on voices of reason and balance.President Eisenhower thought a lot of George McGovern; and so did Barry Goldwater and countless other thinking conservatives who knew him well--many of whom remain his close friends to this day.The real George McGovern is the son of a small-town Wesleyan Methodist minister. He was a World War II bomber pilot and real hero who learned the difference between reality and storybooks. He has spent his life as a tireless humanitarian who never suffers compassion fatigue, a passionate defender of rural American family life, a dedicated history teacher with a critical mind, a consummate listener, reader and deep thinker and a true Christian gentleman.George McGovern comes straight from the heart and soul of America. And his voice speaks from the conscience of a kinder, gentler, older and wiser America.The last two pages of this wonderful little book contain the closing lines of his acceptance speech 32 years ago at the Democratic National Convention. *This time. Let's listen...\\"And this is the time. It is the time for this land to become again a witness to the world for what is noble and just in human affairs.

In his sincere and commonsense approach he states the factors he feels are most important to our national security; well educated children, healthy citizens, productive family farms and ranches, clean environment, and an open and honest political process that works in collaboration with its citizens and the governments of other countries. He does this in a gentlemanly manner always focusing on the issues while remaining respectful of former colleagues whom he disagrees on policy with. I found this very refreshing and a wonderful respite from the hatefilled diatrabes of pundits on FOX and other media news channels.He also argues that the preemptive and illegal war with Iraq has not made our citizens safer and is against everything America is supposed to stand for. For far less than what has been spent on this war we could have made our citizens safer by putting money into our police and fire departments and strengthening security in other areas. We now have a federal deficit over $8,000,000,000,000 and growing rapidly. To combat this we are cutting social programs at home, many that invest in the education and future of our youth and the health of our citizens. The book points out that after the end of the cold war the industrial-military complex which had grown so huge was facing having to downscale. The government had the opportunity to use money that went into defense normally in other areas in the form of a \\"peace dividend\\". Now a perpetual \\"war on terror\\" assures the industrial-military complex they are in the green forever and that we can invade wherever they have an interest (legitimate or not) in the name of combating \\"terror.\\" How convenient, not my idea of how my country should operate though. What has all this accomplished? None of it has made us safer and has eroded world opinion and trust. Gee, I wonder who is benefiting from all this? I doubt the answer to this question is the average citizen.Unfortunately, even if someone like former Senator McGovern were elected President it will be difficult now to do anything but try to dig us out of over $8 trillion in debt. Still we need a major change and much more honesty in our government. It makes me feel ill when I hear politicians invoke God's name constantly and pray in public meetings then refer to dead civilians as numbers they aren't interested in, endorse torture, and get caught in lie after lie. I personally am praying for a huge housecleaning in the next election.Prophetic Quote?\\"Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes. And armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. \\"In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended. Its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force of the people. \\"The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war... and in the degeneracy of manners and morals, engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\\"- James Madison, April 20, 1795"},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"George McGovern offers some solutions to restore America to greatness in areas such as; addressing terrorism, Israeli- Palestinian peace, relations with other nations, and restoring the image of our country after invading Iraq.The book included a great quote from Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson- \\"Wisconsin can get a new Senator, I can't get a new conscience.\\" You aren't likely to read about any of today's Senators making that comment.One of Mr. McGovern's poignant questions was \\"where is the peace dividend?\\"After the cold war ended there was an expectation that defense spending would be reduced. As he states, it's not the burden of the military to export or spread democracy.His highlighting of the farewell addresses of both Washington and Eisenhower was used effectively to show a point.He questions why we don't trade with Cuba but we trade with China? Good question. It really makes no sense.I don't agree with Mr.McGovern on more than a few issues. Seperation of church and state is but one of them. His view of Woodrow Wilson is another.But McGovern explains his viewpoints eloquently, stating that he is a \\"straightforward patriot and a strong advocate of constitutional democracy.\\"His concern with hunger is admirable as well as his concern for the American worker and family farmer.He proposes protecting the American worker from corporations that exploit cheap labor and bad working conditions with a possible closing of the American markets to those corporations.\\"The Essential America\\" is well worth the read for it's common sense observations and ideas whether the reader is a Democrat or Republican."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"Although I first bought and read this book when it was first published in 2004m - after hearing Mr. McGovern speak and having him sign the book - although I enjoyed it, I didn't have cause to give it a great deal of thought until recently, when I read (and reviewed) Barak Obama's second book, \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\" That read brought me back to this one for a second look. The comparisons are far more obvious that the contrasts - each representing mildly differing perspectives on the meaning of Liberalism in American politics. One, from a senior statesman, long time senior US and past (unsuccessful) candidate for President of the United States - one who has a total of 10 or 11 books by now to his credit: The other by a young (by national political standards at age 45!)first term US Senator with recently declared presidential ambitions.Two expositions on the true meaning of \\"liberalism\\" in the context of our democratic republic. While I found myself enthused and excited by Obama, my second reading of Senator McGovern's book reminds me that 1) Liberalism has always been an integral element of the American tradition; 2) That proponents of it have ALWAYS been at odds with more conservative beliefs and interests and, perhaps most importantly, that the things that seem like new ideas to a new generation of voters, by-in-large, are not. They are, rather, democratic populist liberal ideals redressed in today's clothing and reiterated in today's idiom.In no way to I intend this comment to be misconstrued as criticism of Mr. Obama and his writing or expressed beliefs. Rather, it is to remind all of us - as it reminded me - that Liberalism is not a new concept. It may, understandably, seem that way to some young people who have spent the greater part of their adult lives dealing with the realities of Conservative government - sometimes encompassing all three 'separate but equal' branches of the Federal government.McGovern's writing style (and the organization of this book) is a lot like the man himself. It is brief, concise and honest in a way young ambitious politicians seemed to eschew for some years. As with all of his writings, the now retired Senator, organizes the book to be first grounded carefully in history. A simple listing of the 6 chapters conveys the heart of this idea. They are:1. Faith of Our Fathers2. The Spoils of War and the Fruits of Peace3. Liberalism and Conservatism: The American Condition and How We Got Here4. The Changing Character of the Liberal-Conservative Equation5. The Sources of Security and National Greatness, and6. Come Home, AmericaAs a senior statesman whose Will Roger's-like quiet innuendo and humorous suggestions are punctuated with deeply direct and judgmental observations (after all, he no longer worries about needing to be elected!) I would recommend taking a look at this book today - The wisdom and experience of the past is incredibly relevant to an understanding of both the issues of today and the WAY they are now represented and discussed - argues and debated. A recommended read for students of modern American history and political shenanigans."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"My father (conservative) and mother (arch conservative) would probably be rolling in their graves to learn of my discovery of George McGovern so late in my life. They actively campaigned against him, back in the day. But reading his prose, I am inspired and my basic beliefs about what it means to live in a civil -- and even &#34;christian&#34; -- society means are reinforced by this man's warm spirited and humane thoughts on the role of government in a modern, thriving civilization."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"Part (deserved) re-election campaign broadside on Junior Bush and part survey of U.S. history, Senator George McGovern (1922-2012) is at his humble and lucid best in \\"The Essential America.\\" It's good medicine for conservatives, making us do our duty (as an article not long ago in The American Conservative magazine urged) to think through the kind of society we'd like to have. Indeed, duty calls for more than just rejecting what the other side has done or wants to do. Thinking conservatives know that and thinking liberals like McGovern know it, too.Among the compelling expositions in \\"The Essential America\\" is how Jeffersonian liberals and Hamiltonian conservatives borrowed from each other's idea chests, making so many Americans into composite characters. McGovern's explanation of how American liberalism became statism (although he doesn't use the word statism) seems to come straight from the Institutionalist School of Economics/Sociology started by Thorstein Veblen and expanded by John Kenneth Galbraith. The senator doesn't directly tie ideas to Galbraith but mentions his indebtedness to his former Kennedy Administration colleague in the book's acknowledgments (p. 167, 2004 hardcover edition). Their industrialism/big business-has-made-big-government-a-necessity argument has a logical consistency that can't be ignored.The gloss drops from the faade when we recall the nature of government and its limits. McGovern is keenly aware of the limits of power in the international arena but seemingly not in domestic affairs. Why? Because the senator, great man that he was/is, is in the grip of the same bug that infects so many of us - rationalism. Having been a practicing politician for so many years causes some of his ideas to be born in rhetoric, trailing off into simplicity, and rationalism does the rest.When this mindset bumps up against the complexities of the real world the results are often counterproductive. How else to explain approving of breaking up 19th century trusts (which were cartels) yet applauding the banking cartel that is the Federal Reserve? Doesn't McGovern realize how much greater financial calamities have become since the trusts were done away with and The Fed given power to destroy our savings?McGovern is right to \\"hit the ceiling\\" when someone implies conservatives are more patriotic than liberals so I'm not going to say that conservatives are more religious than liberals. But how do liberals miss the fact that the prophets of old never criticized government for not \\"helping\\" the poor? The hardheartedness of individuals and localities is criticized but never is there a call for the king/government to create programs or redistribute wealth. The closest thing I've encountered is Joseph's handling of the Egyptian famine but note how Joseph did all he could not to make people dependent (see Book of Genesis).Other than rationalism, the biggest problems with today's American liberals are they don't believe in spontaneous solutions (so well explored by Carl Menger and his Austrian School of Economics) and their supposedly sunny view of mankind goes out the window when it comes to supporting localism/states rights. Governance is oriented by either localism/constitutionalism or by top-down/democracy. It can't be both but that won't stop rationalists from believing otherwise.Even though he crosses himself up with rationalism, Senator McGovern remains an excellent teacher and an American hero. His book is courageous, honest, informative, and well-meaning. Considering that the United States is the first major nation to be born from the European Enlightenment and that the rationalism of the Enlightenment is what guarantees that liberalism will continue to dominate conservatism in American thought, his thesis is correct. The word \\"tradition\\" is considered a conservative word but McGovern's use of the phrase \\"liberal tradition\\" in the book's subtitle summarizes the American experience perfectly."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"Sen. George McGovern, along with Sen. Ted Kennedy, never betrayed the Liberal philosophy that has given so much to America - in terms of expanding Liberty, challenging injustices and seeking domestic and international cooperation over confrontation and war.Modern politics, alongside modern media, has assisted in allowing Liberalism to be re-defined. But, this has only been made possible by political leaders who have lacked courage to challenge that re-definition. The end result has been the rise of a right-wing ideology that continues to represents its historical role of enforcing stagnation and the status-quo - i.e. maintaining the \\"order of things\\" on economics, gender, race, etc.In the end, Liberals have no one to blame but themselves. Standing on the shoulder of giants, per the very Liberal achievements of the 20th century, should have never been easier. But, alas, enough Liberals ignored that history or abdicated courage in favor of getting re-elected. As a result, the Liberal impetus has been stripped, nay castrated, by a rhetoric that paints it as un-American or the symbol of failure.And, until or unless, a Liberal leadership (re-)emerges with a voice and conviction equal to that of a Reagan era, Liberalism will continue to allow itself to be defined by reactionary forces. The observation by Bertrand Russell (\\"The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt\\") may tempt one towards despair, but fatalism has never been a trait of Liberalism.While some of what Sen. McGovern writes may be seen as conceit or arrogance, they are rooted in a knowledge of the history of American Liberalism - and its accomplishments - that justifies that ambiance of confidence. Now, if only enough political leaders would translate such paper confidence to oratory and legislative confidence, would Liberalism restore its rightful place in American history so the 21st century can be as progressive as the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"There is no denying that this is a book firmly from the liberal point of view. This book gives what I consider \\"old-fashioned\\" or \\"classical\\" liberalism, a liberalism I am very firmly rooted in. McGovern speaks to a less strident, more cooperative form of approaching government, without shying away from his liberalism.I worked on McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign, as a starry-eyed 18-year-old, during the height of the Vietnam war, and with the \\"Summer of Love\\" fresh in my mind as a cultural reference. To me, Nixon was The Enemy, a scheming, conniving hypocrite who stole his foreign policy, particularly re: China, from McGovern,who broke into his opponent's campaign headquarters, looking for something that wasn't there (shades of Weapons of Mass Destruction!), and who had no regard whatever for the rule of law or the responsible practice of fair governing. However, I did not know that McGovern considered Nixon to be a LIBERAL (a \\"moderate liberal\\"). His explanation made more sense than I was initially willing to give it, but he is short on dogma (shorter than I was), and longer on a collaborative form of working with and within government.He also lavishes LOTS of praise on Republican Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and George Bush SENIOR, and his longtime friends Bob Dole and Barry Goldwater (all of these held their positions honestly, and could work with people on either or both sides of the aisle to get things done - that's almost a lost art these days...). He was, however, not so fond of the way Bush JUNIOR was running the country...He also dispenses with the idea of liberals being \\"soft\\" on terrorism or war; he was a much-decorated bomber pilot in World War 2, and defends his fellow bomber pilots, even the conservative ones, as you would your own brother (I have a conservative brother who I love and admire greatly; let me tell ya, folks, it's not an insurmountable obstacle to respect those you may not agree with...).Chapter 5 is very interesting: \\"The Sources of Security and National Greatness\\" - again, a liberal plan to serve as a guide, not a blueprint. He discusses several topics:1) Security and National Interest2) Wise Use of Food Production to Combat Hunger3) National Health (being healthy as individuals as well as a country)4) Education (remember education?)5) Environment6) Farming and it's critical importance7) The Credibility of Government8) The MilitaryI don't mean to review this book as a \\"me me me\\" advertisement, but it was a serious eye-opener for me, and I thought I knew him pretty well. The book is VERY well-written, and he sticks to, and defends, his particular form of liberalism, very well. I highly encourage the fence-sitters to read this book; it is not the sort of fist-waving-and-screeching type of liberal that has been portrayed in the press. He was the kind of liberal who I still am, and I got my liberalism from him. If you want to hear it from THE MAN, read this book; it is very well worth your time. It's not thick (only 166 pages, excluding Acknowledgements and the index), and you will learn to see the liberalism that I grew up believing in, and could well deliver this country from eating itself from the inside..."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"The central theme of this slim volume is similar to other recent political books by Robert Reich and James Carville. Says McGovern, not \\"a single federal program now generally approved by both of our major parties . . . was not first pushed by liberals over the opposition of conservatives.\\" While there are a couple of surprises here, the author's devotion to this central tenet of liberalism - - not all that government does is bad - - isn't. This is not to say that the book is uninteresting.Chapter One starts off with a ten-page synopsis of the some of the key ideas of the founding fathers. Their commitment to a separation between church and state is there, for example. After that, we are treated to a critique of the current administration that reads not unlike what we've seen in other places.The former senator and presidential candidate gives a fair amount of print to praising Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower. While Ike was hardly known for progressive social policies, McGovern notes that he towed the line on military spending. The author uses the former president's often quoted lines about the military-industrial complex to back up his point. The fact that both men thought highly of one another made for an interesting side note.McGovern proposes a laundry list of social programs to solve society's problems. While most of them seem sensible, they are presented in a scatological manner. The senator devotes a couple of pages to upgrading our aging rail system. He proposes gradually expanding Medicare to cover the entire uninsured population, in all age groups. At several points he addresses the treatment of alcoholism, a subject close to his heart since the untimely death of his daughter to alcohol poisoning.The author addresses the fiscal implications of launching so many government initiatives at one time. But his explanation is short and won't satisfy many. In particular, fans of the Bush tax cut will be put off by the complete roll back of that plan. In addition, it's hard to imagine that halving military spending will be a popular notion.McGovern comes across as a cantankerous octogenarian at a few points, once railing against the infringements on his privacy allowed by the USA Patriot Act. He promises to push federal agents back through the door if they ever come for him after reading his private records. This makes for a brief moment of comic relief.A problem with the book is that it just doesn't offer much that can't be found in other places. He also doesn't seem to have a realistic path for accomplishing his goals. On the other hand he is clearly a man who loves his county and has great optimism for its future. In the end, one has to agree with his assessment of the wisdom of the people: In spite of the fact that they didn't choose him in 1972, they usually get it right, he reasons."},{"Title":"The Essential America: Our Founders and the Liberal Tradition","review":"These are the thoughts, experiences and wishes of ex-Senator George McGovern from South Dakota who yearns for American greatness and peace in the world. He served in the Senate for eighteen years and ran for President in 1972. In 2000, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom by then Pres. Clinton.He firmly believes in the moral and political principles of our founders: liberty, equality, justice, truthfulness, and compassion for all -- many of those are missing in today's America. Instead, we live in a world where millions of people are frustrated, angry, and desperate over the conditions of their lives.He says that terrorism in American theaters, restaurants, shopping malls or buses may become a reality. He feels that terorism is caused mainly by the conflict between Israel and Palestine more than poverty and injustice. We've backed Israel since its inception in 1948 but, since 1967, they'be built large numbers of settlements on the West Bank of the Jordon River which they took from Palestine in the Six-Day War. There some Americans live amid hunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease. And yet America continues to pour billions of dollars into the development and defense of Israel. We have armed and equipped their military until it has become the most powerful armed force in the Middle East.He had a lot to say about the stock market corruption. He compares it to the crash of 1929 only on a bigger scale.He believes in the 'plain old-fashioned morality and common sense, as embodied in our founding documents and the faith of the future.' Our founders' words: \\"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\\" \\"Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\\" \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\\" It is his stance that liberalism is \\"a philosophy and way of life we inherited from the Founding Fathers.\\"Liberalism's role is to harness federal power to serve the public interest. He calls Bob Dole a true \\"compassionate conservative\\"; his parents' (father was a Methodist preacher)were lifetime conservatives who considered his friendship with Dole as the crowning achievement of his political life.He gives some details about Andrew Jackson's attempts at changing the government from being controlled by the wealthy to the \\"common people\\" of America. After Jackson, the \\"robber barons\\" exploited the nation's resources. We've endured the Populists, Progressives, then FDR from a conservative family in 1932 changed things and served four consecutive terms.He calls Jefferson, Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and FDR as the architects of American liberalism. Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" was the most profound influence in shaping modern-day liberalism. He was a believer in free enterprise capitalism and created TVA which has outlived its time. He laid the foundations of the United Nations, which is on American soil in New York, his home state.George McGovern is a dreamer in his old age, I feel. We won't be around to enjoy the paradise he wants this country to become.

Only one problem she's Chinese and because of that she has a hard time trying to fit in.Every one thinks, well almost every one thinks that since Emma is Chinese that she is different from everyone else. On top of that she still struggles to find a date for the prom.But then there's her brother Emerson who's thinking about running away to China with his Caucasian girl friend, because no one approves of there relationship because Emerson is Chinese and his girl friend (Linda) is Caucasian.I would have to say that this book Who's Hu?

I would definitely give this book six (6) out of five (5) stars. ******"},{"Title":"Who's Hu","review":"I was intrigued by an excerpt of this book, assigned as part of a short stories unit in my son's English class. Unfortunately, the most interesting part of the whole book was that excerpt. While the author presents a very interesting story of a young immigrant girl growing up in Boston during the 50s, not unlike my own story (although mine would be 10 years later), the quality of the writing isn't up to par. Many chapters went off tangent and the prose was dull. I was disappointed because the book could have been fascinating had it been shorter or written better. Perhaps avid middle school readers may still find it a good read for its subject matter, but only if they aren't picky about writing quality."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"Fifteen (Avon Camelot Books)The Luckiest Girl (An Avon Camelot Book)Sister of the BrideJean and Johnny (Avon Camelot Books)If you're a fan of Beverly Cleary's \\"mid-century\\" teen novels, you're sure to like \\"Green Eyes.\\" I'm a youthful and hip (no, really - think Reba McEntire or Susan Sarandon or Candace Bergen; my son, nieces and nephews will back me up on this) 50-something woman, and my most vividly remembered teen romance novels (read as an eager pre-teen, of course) are Cleary's \\"Fifteen\\" and Ms. Nielsen's \\"Green Eyes.\\" The Lizzie McGuires and Hannah Montanas we have now are also great, but it's amazing how fresh and heart-warming these wholesome 50's/ 60's books still are today. And retro can be hip, too, right? Maybe a more zealous typist will add a plot synopsis in a later review (and the item description really should be revised to add one), but I'll just note that it's a warm story of a high-aspiring teen caught up with feeling that she's not sufficiently pretty or chic (gee, these issues seem to still be around) who gains insight that life continues after high school, and that some of the girls who weren't very visible as teens get a chance to shine in their 20s or 30s or 40s or whatever...Here's an excerpt from the book (from its back cover):\\"I was just thinking about the play,\\" Danny said, his usually candid eyes not meeting hers. \\"It's going to be out of this world.\\"\\"And that's exactly what we'll say in our editorial,\\" Jan agreed.\\"I was being personal, not editorial,\\" Danny explained painfully. He went on slowly. \\"I was thinking of how much I'd like to ask you for a date to go to the play if I weren't afraid you'd snap back that you had to work or you wish I'd drop dead or something.\\"On another day, she might have snapped at him and refused his offer because she was embarrassed. Today it seemed perfectly natural to lean over the banister, smile, and say, \\"I'd love to go to the play with you, Danny.\\"[...]\\"Written in 1955, this is a story about a high school girl - Jan - who is passionate about journalism and her work on the school newspaper, to the exclusion of her social life.It some ways it's heavily stamped by the time period in which it was written. For example, getting interested in clothes and making her appearance more attractive seems to be a big part of the growing-up process. On the other hand, here is a girl who is more focused on developing her talents than worrying about her looks or boys or dates, and that doesn't completely change at the end. Perhaps even more importantly, we see that part of the reason Jan's mom is such a nutter is that she so completely gave up her own aspirations and personal development when she got married. So overall, I think it was a pretty progressive book for 1950.Some of the dialog seems a little forced, in a shove-the-lesson-down-your-throat sort of way, and there's a major plot event at the end that seems way over-the-top coming right after some of the major events that have already happened, so it's not a perfect book, but I did stay up way too late last night finishing it, so that says something about it....\\""},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"Janice \\"Jan\\" Morgan, 15 at the start of the story is naturally elated when she is elected editor of her school paper. Jan's mother, a bitter woman who spends her days worrying over Jan's brother Andrew, 12 often rebuffs Jan's efforts and refuses to attend academic awards events. When Andrew was 8, he fell into an icy puddle. He then got an earache which developed into rheumatic fever. He missed 2 years of school and as a result, their mother indulges him to the point of excess. Their father is a lumberman who works in Cascadeville Washington's lumber camp and comes home on weekends.Jan is a refreshingly progressive protagonist who claims that her mind is her best feature. She is not a girly cliche. Although she maintains top grades and racks up academic accolades, she is not immune to boys she likes, particularly Danny, who is on the newspaper staff. A highly responsible girl, Jan saves to buy her own clothes and yearns for a typewriter and a chance to attend college. The Morgans' resources are so strained from Andrew's illness that they cannot afford a car; a modern kitchen with a refrigerator and an electric stove or even a move closer to the lumber camp.Alice Morgan, bitter at giving up her dreams often takes her bitterness out on Jan. She gives Jan ever reason to feel \\"pushed clear out of the family circle\\" and does not seem to appreciate Jan's maturity, foresight and ability to plan for her future. She lashes out at Jan over trifles. Andrew delights in baiting Jan and rebels against their mother's directives that he not play outside or resume outdoor activities with the Boy Scouts. Andrew lives for the day when he can sled down the mountains and play in the snow with the other kids. Despite it all, he has a group of friends who fortunately stick by him.Andrew's illness has made her overprotective. She won't let him play outside for long and the two have locked horns about this. On Christmas, Alice buys Andrew two extra gifts, even after they all agreed that Jan and Andrew would get one gift apiece due to financial strain. This effort fell flat as Jan railed and rightfully so at the unfairness and Andrew wept that he didn't want more than his fair share. To add insult to injury, Alice has the temerity to tell Andrew that her gift of a building set was better than the Scout knife from Jan. That was cruel. The Morgans had a heated quarrel about this and Mr. Morgan later tells Jan that they have agreed to send the extra gifts back and the money would be applied to Jan's typewriter and a sled for Andrew.I loved this book and read it as a child. I especially loved the parts about the Preston family whose infant son Jan babysits. In one memorable part of the book, Jan's young charge Johnny, 1 came down with diptheria. Fortunately, Cascadeville is such a small town that the one doctor is always available and makes house calls. A kind, brusque man, Dr. Conners has made it plain that he cares about the \\"two generations he brought into the world\\" and how he thought diptheria's reign ended during the 1910 epidemic in their town. Fortunately, Jan's ministrations and the doctor's diligent treatment pull Johnny through. I like the way the Prestons are presented in an \\"adult reader\\" light so that young readers get a better understanding of adult interactions and concerns.During Johnny's convalescence and subsequent quarantine, Jan has some time to do some serious thinking. She discovers her own inner resources in helping her young charge pull through. It was Jan who stayed up all night with Johnny until the doctor arrived while the Prestons were out of town at a party. Alice Morgan could not leave as she risked being quarantined as well and worried about leaving Andrew alone. It was Jan who followed through on Dr. Conners' directions. It was Jan who, to a certain extent saved Johnny.Jan shows her mettle and in time Alice Morgan comes around. Thanks to Mr. Morgan, who has made it plain that he will do his best to see that both children are treated fairly and that he will no longer stand for being treated like a guest of honor in his own home when he is there on weekends, things change for the better. (This theme is revisited some 10 years later inAmy and Laura, two sisters whose father tells them never to bring problems to their mother, who has returned home from the hospital after surviving an accident. The girls' mother insists on being part of their lives and not to be protected from things that crop up). Alice appears to have lived by the Glen Campbell song, \\"The Dreams of the Everyday Housewife.\\" Dr. Conners, a delightful old school doctor gives Alice Morgan some plain talking to and when Jan herself is in an accident, she discovers who her friends really are. Alice discovers a place to showcase her talent and also blooms. Andrew gets a green card from the doctor to resume normal activity, which is what he wanted all along and he finally gets his sled.This is an excellent, classic book that covers a bygone era and has a rich cast of good, strong characters."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a teenager, and I was delighted to find it again and re-read it. Even though our lives are not anything at all alike, the internal struggles that Jan deals with in the book were similar to mine, and even now, in my 50s, it still speaks to that teenager inside of me, and shows me how far I've come as an adult. It is the story of an unhappy girl, trapped inside herself with hurt, jealousy and unfulfilled dreams, and that was sure me. It is well written, and shows how Jan learns that even though some of her hurts are justified, a lot of them were more her perceptions after they were filtered through those hurts. She begins to see the truth, deal with the hurts, and re-interpret the rest without the filters of anger and jealousy, and in the process she begins to blossom and realize some of those dreams. It is a story of growing up. I recommend it to any teenager struggling with growing up, and even adults."},{"Title":"THE LANCASTER AT WAR","review":"Wonderful review of the Lancaster's use in the war.Covers not only the plane but also describes in some detail ground crew and air crew experiences.

A handful of the poems were gems but the majority left me feeling as though the poetry suffered in translation - not a reflection on the translator so much as a sense that the poetry itself was extremely difficult to translate and retain Campert's aesthetic sense. Some wonderful turns of phrases and thought-provoking images - enough to make me wish I could read it in the original."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"Without question, this is the best book available on philanthropic guidance, and I've read dozens in the field. Its rigorously analytical approach is both refreshing and essential. The research on the seven capitalist/philanthropists and their profiles present distinctly unique, high value-added insight directly relevant to the social sector. I found the development of the 7 Wisdom Points alone worth the investment of time.Moreover, the 7 educational components provide outstanding structure to understand and implement new philanthropy benchmarking.From a quantitative perspective, the discussion of the multiplier/discount effect and accompanying examples offer a competitive context to measure social sector investments, a tremendously valuable tool in a too-often qualitative environment. Coupled with the appendix' misfortunate situation examples, the benefits of the npb approach become crystal clear.In fact, the appendices alone are a reference bonanza.I recommend this resource to anyone serious about philanthropy."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"Of the vast wealth of information contained in this book, I've found the material on intersectoral practices the most fertile area for discovery. The disclosure on social enterprise, strategic philanthropy and restructuring, and social capital markets is extraordinary. Scores of examples of social entrepreneurship, capacity building, collaboration, innovative financings, social venture capital, etc. fill the main text and the appendices. The number of illustrative public companies with intersectoral missions will challenge current perceptions. Offering wise balance, the author provides an extensive sampling of social sector misfortunate situations, including NGOs, foundations, the law of unintended consequences, and wasted funds. In fact, the author urges that a risks analysis be completed prior to major social sector initiatives. I expect to be reading and rereading this book for years to come. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"As Enron and Worldcom have become sinister household names, revealing the boggling extent of corporate greed and malfeasance, the timing of &quot;New Philanthropy Benchmarking&quot; could not have been better. This thoughtful and well-researched book does more than demonstrate that there is still much to laud in the ways and means of American business; it charts an ambitious, sometimes visionary, course for socially engaged commerce, in which the core American values of altruism, community give-back and grass-roots empowerment continue to fuel the corporate engine while making perfect business sense as well. As a philanthropy consultant specializing in NGOs, I found &quot;New Philanthropy Benchmarking&quot; to be a refreshingly insightful work, replete with helpful resources and real-world examples making the case for Kazarian's innovative approach. I heartily recommend this book as much to corporate executives as to government agencies, NGOs and anyone involved in the philanthropic community."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"At last a text of scholar quality for the social sector. Theinnovative research on the seven capitalist philanthropists provides a guiding star of best practices. In depth analysis of the financial information is both revealing and inspiring. These philanthropists really do think and act quite differently than the main stream foundations and NGOs. The benchmarking framework provides the commercial sector tools to those with resources under their command. The book not only provides a series of insightful diagnostic questionnaires but also provides a working book for those with management responsibilities.The highly quantitative and analytical materials go well beyondcurrent industry best practices. The NPB Multiplier/Discount ratio and the Blended Return on Investment models challenge the sector to higher level of performance. This book would be ideal for a full year course. Definitely Five stars."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"While the author makes some interesting points at times, overall the book is a slog to get through - the book seems to be written as the equivalent of a Master's thesis. Using too many fancy words and complex sentences (and not enough facts and figures) seriously waters down the arguments. In fact, I am not sure the author will convince someone not already pre-disposed to agree with her.All of this might be forgiven if the author offered more implemenation and tactical ideas. This is not a how-to book on the implementation of new philanthropic ideas. It is more of an opinion piece on why NPB is more effective.While it makes some valuable points on this front, overall the book suffers from its intended weight, and it is difficult to recommend as an investment of time."},{"Title":"New Philanthropy Benchmarking: Wisdom for the Passionate","review":"Kristina Kazarian's approach to New Philanthropy Benchmarking is an insightful addition to the world of philanthropy. Her approach of benchmarking the successes and failures of some of our generation's most entrepreneurial capitalists, turned philanthropists, allows some of us less (financially) fortunate souls to generate significant returns on our investments, albeit on a smaller scale.The text is packed with insights, that I found enlightening and essential. For example, on p. 78, the NPB Tactic Comparison chart outlines the framework for utilizing commercial metrics for NGOs.And for those with the means, dedication, and desire to optimize their current initiatives, the appendices provide an outstanding scope of resources from benchmarking assessment questions to innovative foundations, capitalist philanthropist profiles, and fundamental concepts like those of Christian stewardship and Jewish \\"tzedakah.\\"Highly recommended as an informative initial read and a solid, ongoing companion resource. Overwhelming in the knowledge delivered to philanthropists of all levels."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"This is a richly written book. Gordimer handles the character in an interesting way--one of the reviewers said that she couldn't relate to the character, and I think that is because Gordimer is presenting her as someone who is puzzling to other people, a \\"sport\\" or new species. You don't get into the heroine's head so much as you try to figure out her mysteries. Of course, that means Gordimer is giving the reader the role of someone from the ordinary world who isn't quite as evolved sexually or politically as her heroine. I found the heroine haunting because of her self possession, her practically unselfconscious drive to grow that freed her of much of the guilt and fear of isolation that keep most of us from doing the right things."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"I do not agree with the substandard reviews of this book. If you are interested in South Africa don't be afraid of a more difficult read and pick up this book. It is a little difficult to get into but once you get used to Gordimer's writing style, anyone will enjoy it. Hillela is a very interesting character who one can not underestimate. I like her spirit, and I truely think she has a complete change of character by the end of the story."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"I have never read Nadine Gordimer before, but when I saw 2 collections of her works at 2 of my friends' houses (and rave reviews) I got curious. This book is a thickly textured look at 3 sisters and their divurgent lives and the daughter of 1 who is exposed to all 3 and then further divurges into the racial movements of 70's South Africa. Gordimer's use of setting is really good. I found particularly interesting the family of the most politically oriented sister, Pauline and her husband Joe and children where the domestic lives interleave with the sometimes violent politial terrain. The main character, Hillela, however, I found to be less than heroic -- she simply seemed to be a sensual being who floated in and out of various beds and even the tragedy which befalls her later in the story doesn't REALLY seem to have changed her - she seems like the same person on page 1 as on page 300, although the narrative implies otherwise. For a book released in the 70's I'm sure that this was a revelation, although here in the new millenium it seems dated.Despite all this, I think the author is terrifically talented in her ability to convey sensuality, to provoke thought, and to establish setting and mood. There were some passages of the book that are among the best I've read anywhere."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"This book, to me, captures what a life in exile must feel like: complete disassociation. Not only does the main character experience physical exile throughout many parts of this work, she also experiences emotional exile almost from the very beginning of her life. A main reason for the disassociation -- and why the exile continues over a long time -- is because the protagonist allows events to happen to her rather than take any concrete action. The character's experiences then make for a strange work for a reader. Thus, I'm not surprised that this book has so many varied responses. It is a challenging read with parts of pure beauty, almost a reflection on life itself."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"I have nothing negative to say about this work of Nadine Gordimer whom I continue to regard as one of the top lliving writers. I've read every novel she's written and will get on to her short stories soon. I'm a little late getting to \\"A Sport of Nature\\" and just finished it. BRAVO. Except, we don't find out what happens to Carole. Big no-no. She can certainly be considered a main character. She had her own personality and confusion. I would like to have had Gordimer at least offer a small glimpse of Carole in her adult life."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class. Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did. I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it. I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it. Well, I didn't love it. While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature. There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers. I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all. It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author."},{"Title":"Sport of Nature","review":"Check out the copyright date -- she must have been prescient"},{"Title":"PORSCHE: BROCHURES AND SALES LITERATURE - A SOURCE BOOK 1948-1965","review":"Porsche: Brochures and Sales Literature, A Source Book, 1948-1965by Susann C Miller & Richard F MerrittAre you are a Porsche person? Do you know about this book? If not, you should.Are you a researcher or historian? Is this book already in your library? If not, you are missing a worthwhile resource.Porsche Brochures and Sales Literature, 1948-1965, now in its Third Edition, has been revised and expanded twice since it was first published in 1978. As with most books of this type, the mere act of publishing brings forth additional information. Sometimes the volume of new material, coupled with the popularity (and sales) of the book, warrant these second, third, etc editions.Although the book is made up of reproductions of factory literature, the co-authors have written captions containing detailed descriptions of each piece, as well as of the individual pages of each. Descriptions begin with measurements in both metric and US, followed by physical properties and appearances including color and tone of paper and inks used. The book is printed in black and white as color reproduction and printing was deemed too costly. Yet the descriptions are sufficiently clear and detailed to enable the book to be used as a source for authenticating and differentiating a true original collectible piece of factory literature from a high-quality copy.As a reference and research tool, this book is a dream. It contains \\"all the known brochures and sales literature published or made available by Porsche from 1948 to 1965\\". The material is arranged chronologically--an accomplishment in itself since, as anyone who has examined or owns manufacturer's literature knows, it isn't always clearly dated. Finding a particular piece or item of information is simplified by a Table of Contents that clearly and thoroughly lists each piece. Better yet, these are not poor quality indecipherable reproductions. You can read every word of every item reproduced throughout the book due to the care taken accomplishing the photocopying or scanning. The book was then printed landscape format on a gloss stock. There's no eye-strain involved in reading each and every page bound between the hard covers. Lest you be concerned or curious; no rules or laws of copyright were broken or \\"conveniently ignored\\" either. That said, the reproduction of any pages in this book is restricted under Universal and Pan American copyright conventions.To give you an idea of the just how comprehensive the information is, it covers and includes; paint numbers, accessories, specifications, technical data, color charts, delivery plans, price lists, Porsche's marine and aircraft engines, the Rotorcycle, the Porsche farm tractor and more. The authors did not limit themselves only to material they had personally managed to acquire. In a show of trust and support of the project, some really rare, obscure and hard to find (thus monetarily very valuable) material was loaned to them for processing in order that it could be included too.So, what of these authors? Who are they? Well, Susann Miller has now been vintage racing her 1968 Porsche 911L for well over a decade. She has also authored additional Porsche titles including the now out-of-print Porsche Power, Performance & Perfection and the two Source Books, one titled Porsche 911/912 and the other Porsche 911. Richard Merritt divides his automotive attention and enthusiasm between Porsches and Ferraris, and has authored or co-authored books about each.With just shy of 100 different, multi-paged pieces of factory literature reproduced on its 320 10\\" x 8\\" pages, this book is veritable treasure trove of information.Copyright 2009 Helen V Hutchings (speedreaders.info)"},{"Title":"PORSCHE: BROCHURES AND SALES LITERATURE - A SOURCE BOOK 1948-1965","review":"Susann Miller and Richard Merritt put together a terrific 356 Porsche reference and source book which contains all of the Porsche Factory brochures.

Boys became men early in England in 1800, and Great Britain is in her seventh year of struggle with France. The French Revolution is over, and Napoleon Bonaparte is in power. He needs money to defeat the English and exploit the Louisiana territory where he plans to install a \\"King of New Orleans\\" under French rule, and has chosen one of the privateers that are active in the Caribbean; a vile and quite mad pirate that has promised him the money he needs. These pirates attack any ships that cross their paths, murdering the crews and stealing the cargoes.When the HMS Torren falls prey to the pirates, Peter and the charismatic Matthew Book manage to separately escape, but everyone else is murdered. Peter becomes apprenticed to a British Spy, and is reunited with Matthew. The three of them strive to outwit the pirates and French government and keep America out of their hands.This lively book has a multi-level plot and exciting characters. I thought the size of the book might be a bit intimidating for reluctant readers, but it left me wanting more. The action goes from the English Channel to Paris to the Caribbean and back again. It's a seafaring adventure on a grand scale that is impossible to put down. Molloy promises a sequel, and I can't wait...Peter Raven is one of my favorite characters. There is even a bit of romance with the beautiful, rich young American girl, Lucy Cosgrove.Reviewed by: Grandma Bev"},{"Title":"Peter Raven: Under Fire (SIGNED)","review":"Michael Molloy's Peter Raven Under Fire is set in 1800 and tells of Peter, the new officer on a Navy ship warring with the French forces of Napoleon.

With Peter Raven Under Fire, he turns his hand to historic naval fiction for young adults. Peter, the well-educated son of a clergyman is determined to go to sea and has prevailed on his father to find him a midshipman's berth. He is almost immediately swept into intrigue and espionage as he becomes the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the mysterious Commodore Beaumont. Unfortunately, Molloy has not done his homework. Or rather, he has not done it well enough. The book is riddled with howlers and inaccuracies. He makes a muddle of naval vessels (100-gun frigates, indeed!), naval ranks and shipboard vocabulary. He makes no pretense at describing ship handling -- captains simply turn their ships. There are also language issues that a copy editor should have caught, like confusing \\"feint\\" and \\"feign\\". Molloy's conception of interactions among officers and men is based more on his imagination than on research. Still, this is fiction and written to engage young adults, so maybe that excuses some liberties. The same must be said for the preposterous plot in which Raven and Beaumont pit themselves against an evil villain who, like Dr. No, plots to rule the new world from his secret island fortress. For all that, Molloy is a skilled story teller and sweeps the reader into the action. For those willing to suspend disbelief and overlook historical inaccuracies (or, like many young readers, be unaware of them), this is an engaging story. I imagine a youngster would enjoy it, but if I were choosing historic naval fiction for a young friend I would probably start with Linda Collison or Paul Doswell."},{"Title":"Peter Raven: Under Fire (SIGNED)","review":"I was actually very disapointed in this novel. I love historical fiction, especially plots surrounding the 1800's and seafaring in the British navy. However I was not duly impressed.The characters were very bland, and very hollow. Without strong, charismatic characters the story remains an skeleton of an novel; something like reading a thick, dull history book in school.I have to give Mr. Molloy one thing, he was very well researched and his plot was excellently devised; but I honestly did not enjoy it."},{"Title":"Peter Raven: Under Fire (SIGNED)","review":"I really enjoy nautical fiction. C.S. Forester and Alexander Kent are some of my favorite authors. I was disappointed with this story because of the specific passage on page 180 where the Torren comes upon the Moon Star. The resulting episode of that meeting was totally disturbing and crazy. I found this whole section to be incredibly unrealistic. I know this is fiction, but really. I will refrain from spoiling the plot. I rarely put a book down but I did in this case. I am now reading an excellent book titled Sails on the Horizon by Jay Worrell. If you enjoy historical fiction and especially REALISTIC high seas adventure avoid Peter Raven Under Fire by Michael Molloy."},{"Title":"Creative Problem Solving and Opportunity Finding (Decision Making and Operations Management)","review":"From a creative thinking/problem solving standpoint, this is a excellent resource. From a opportunity finding viewpoint, it's quite disappointing, personally speaking. Although the coverage on the aspect of creative thinking is very broad and somewhat deep in many respects, with good, useful strategies/techniques and examples to follow, it does not offer much in terms of opportunity finding approaches for the business reader. For that, you need to buy and read Michel Robert's &quot;Innovation Formula&quot;, and/or Edward de Bono's &quot;Opportunities&quot;, and/or &amp; Nigel MacLennan &quot;Opportunity Finding.&quot; Neverthesless, this book is still worthwhile to be bought/read and kept in your personal library. Reading it is like reading many creative thinking books in one go. The author drew a lot - I mean really a lot - of creativity stuff from other books."},{"Title":"Creative Problem Solving and Opportunity Finding (Decision Making and Operations Management)","review":"This book covers everything related to creativity, from techniques, to theories about creativity, to discussion about the best and worst environments for creativity. In this way the book is a comprehensive work on the subject. The author covers most of the well-known techniques and throws in a number of lesser known ones. He provides examples on how to use them, although sometimes the examples rely too much on topics from the world of computer programming, which apparently is one area of the author's expertise. Also, this is a textbook and reads like one, with the language sometimes a little too formal, often presenting so many viewpoints from other experts or academics on a particular subject that they key lesson gets lost in the forest of information. The biggest lesson taught, and not lost, however, is that creativity can be learned and acquired by the purposeful use of the techniques presented. It is not necessary to wait around for inspiration. I do wish Couger would issue a revised edition that is less of a textbook and more of a how-to for everyone. One other thing: unlike other creativity books that I have reviewed, Couger gives appropriate space and credit to Edward de Bono, one of the giants in this field."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely love this book!!!!It has an amazing story line and it is definatly my favorite book!This book will blow your socks off!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was really excited to read this book, due to all the hype surrounding it. I thought, finally, another book that will grab my attention and threaten to not ever let go until the words stop! However, I was disappointed. It's not that the novel isn't good; it is good, it's just not great. Certainly not as great as one would expect when there is so much hype.The story is definitely unique and creative. I applaud Westerfeld for coming up with this unique dystopian world where everyone is ugly until they turn 16, at which point they turn pretty and enter a world where everyone else is pretty too. The point of making everyone basically look the same to to try to create a world without war or bullying - a world where everyone gets along and everyone is happy. But, is it really better this way? Turns out, there are some things you can't change and there are some people who will still disagree and fight against the system. Though I do like the uniqueness of this world that Westerfeld created, I feel as though he should have went into more detail at the beginning. I found myself questioning things and not really knowing much about the cities and how these people live until later on. The reader will have to put the pieces together while reading in order to figure everything out about this world.The characters...hmm...the characters are okay. I didn't feel as though Westerfeld created the main character, Tally, as well as he could have. I didn't really become all that attached to her throughout the story. Maybe a little more during the end of the novel, but I wasn't as attached to her as I like to be with main characters. I can't quite put my finger on just what the problem was with these characters. They were developed pretty well throughout the story and they were likeable, but something prevented me from fully connecting with them.The writing is pretty good. Good quality of writing and it makes sure to catch your interest. Again, something was missing that was preventing me from really being captivated by the book. But it was good enough.Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of YA dystopian fiction. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but I feel it's worthy of a read if you are looking for something creative and unique. One thing that bothered me was the city names. I think that Westerfeld could have come up with some better names than \\"Pretty Town\\" and \\"Uglyville\\". They seem like childish names and are not very creative. But these are not big problems at all, just something that bugged me.You can read more of my reviews on my blog: SIK Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My expectations for this book were high, and I was not disappointed. From the time I picked this book up, I could not put it down. I rushed through it and was disappointed I hadn't picked up the second as well.Scott Westerfeld tells the tale of Tally, an ugly that wants to be pretty. She has wanted to be pretty for so long, and see's nothing wrong with it. The life of a pretty is easy. There is nothing to worry about except what parties your invited to. Who wouldn't want that? Her operation is approaching fast, and soon she will get her dream granted. Then, she meets Shay, and she suddenly she doesn't know what to think anymore.The plot takes you for loops and whirls, and there is never a slow moment.The characters are all interesting, even Peris- her friend who is a pretty. Actually, I liked him a lot. He wasn't in the book much, or even very important, but still. Through out the whole book, there were some funny moments and some heartfelt moments. Everything moved very quickly. Most books drag out the \\"chase\\" but not this one! It was actually refreshing. There's not much to say about the writing style. It is very simple and nothing special, but still it's captivating.There is so much content contained within the 400 pages, it ridiculous.And that ending! It was having me hit myself."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"So I'd seen this book around for ages and decided to pick it up on one of my book-buying shopping sprees, and I'm glad I did. It ended up being better than I expected.Uglies is about a girl who is set to have surgery to become 'pretty' which is what all the Uglies with to be. They dream about the day they become 'Pretty' and Talia is no exception. Things go awry for Talia when she meets Shay, a girl who was willing to do anything, but become pretty. She runs away leaving Talia to deal with 'Special Circumstances' which is the equivalent for the law in this dystopian world.I wouldn't say that the pace of the story was all that quick, in fact, in some ways it was kind of dull, but when it did speed up, it became quite a good book. I liked the world Scott Westerfeld made, but at the same time I hated it. The people in this world forgot that personality counted for something, and they had real self-image problems.Talia was like this as well at the start. What I liked was that I saw her grow from someone who had issues with a way a person looked, including herself, to someone who had a sense of self-worth. She was incredibly brave, but at the same time incredibly stupid. And there was no denying that at the end, she was incredibly loyal. I liked her. I had to wonder about her parents though. Kids in this world left their parent when they were around twelve. I had to wonder what kind of relationship she had had with her parents beforehand. There was no back story.David was adorable. He was the kind of person who befriended everyone. Despite the dangerous life he led, he trusted people. But, I don't think it was a mindless trust. He had been raised to survive. And, his faith in people was hard to shake. He accepted a lot of thing, like people leaving 'the Smoke' to become Pretty. I guess he had a sense of naivete about him. I like that he grew up with his family and I got to know a bit about them.And I have to mention Shay, because she was the one who started Talia's adventure. She was a character I really liked as well. Mainly because she made Talia believe that there were different options out there for her. She was the one who believed the most in Talia, until Talia did something she didn't like - even if it wasn't Talia's fault. Even towards the very end, she stood up for what she believed in.The story line for this book was okay. And, I'm really impressed that for a book that was published seven years ago, it stills hold that edge that good dystopian books do. I won't say it's as good as some I've read, but it wasn't the worst either. And I definitely liked some of the world-building behind it. It could have been expanded more, but at least I knew the theory behind them becoming a Uglies/Pretties society.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dystopian novels and who doesn't mind the pace being a bit slow at the start."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm hooked on the whole dystopian genre.

Tally's world is physically the same as ours (as in, Earth), but time and an apocalypse (an oil-destroying bacteria) have changed things. Much of the world is uninhabited, and most of those that remain live in segregated cities such as Tally's. On one side of the river are the young, the Uglies. On the other side, the Pretties.It was decided, post-apocalypse, that all of the world's problems were caused by inequality. Not only financial or social, but physical. So, upon their sixteenth birthday, everyone is given plastic surgery to become Pretty. They then spend the rest of their young-adulthood going to parties, basically.Tally is about to become Pretty, and never thought about doing otherwise before she runs into Shay. Shay doesn't want to become Pretty. She's learned of a settlement of people living outside of the city (the Smokes), and she'd rather be a part of that society than the one she's expected to join. She asks Tally to come with her, but Tally is unsure, until the decision is made for her.I thought the book had some interesting things to say about conformity and oppressive monitoring by the government. For a heroine, Tally does tend to be rather passive. Most of what happens to her is a result of what other people have either done or made her do, and I have to admit I didn't love her. But, the story itself is compelling enough that I don't have to love her to want to see what happens to her.Overall, it was just an enjoyable story. Westerfeld has created an interesting world, and I'll definitely be reading more to see what he does with it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My class started reading this book together. I realized how much I loved it and so I could not possibly resist reading ahead.Tally started off as an average Ugly missing or New Pretty friends. Then she met Shay and was lead into a life of, following akward clues, falling in love, betrayal, which made this book an interesting, adventure full, life, story that I recomend for mostly young adults butother ages too. I will be readig the next four books, Pretties, Specials and Extras.

This is a great science fiction book, especially for girls. So many Sci-fi books are written for boys, but this book focuses on the future as well as what's important to so many girls today - the way they look. I truly believe that you should be a different person after you read something, and Westerfield has done an excellent job of changing the way readers look at technology, vanity, and the future."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was such a great read! I'm a sophomore in high school and it was really easy for me to connect with a lot of the themes that came up in this novel. The story and plot was very suspenseful and it kept my attention and made me never want to put it down. However, in my opinion the book had a little too much science fiction in it than was necessary but it was still a captivating story. I think the author did a really good job of conveying the thoughts of a teenage girl who just wanted to be pretty. I know that a lot of girls can probably relate and that's why I really liked this book. It really makes you think about our society today and how fixed we are on this idea of beauty and vanity. I give this book 4 stars for being a well written novel that was also fun and interesting to read."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Would you rather be ugly or pretty? Now, I know what most of you are think, yes I would definitely rather be pretty than ugly. However that is not the case with a girl name Shay. Tally and Shay are turning 16 on September 9th. Most sixteen year olds want a car for their sixteenth birthday, which is not what sixteen year old kids want to do in Uglyville. They want to turn pretty. That however is not what Shay wants to do, she wants to run away and live in the wild like some of her older friends did. Infact Shay wanted Tally to come with her in the wild to not get the surgery to become different not like everyone else. When it was September 9th the day of Tally and Shays birthday and the day of their pretty surgery, Tally went in alone. Shay made up her mind; she was going to be ugly forever. When Tally went into the doctor's office, Dr. Cable said \\"you are not getting this surgery until you show me to Shay\\". The doctors did not want anymore runaways that is why Dr. Cable wanted Tally to find Shay. What will Tally do, will she become pretty and do what her friend wanted her not to do or will she be Ugly forever?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"How would you feel if you had to wait three months before turning pretty?

But you would then betray her and break the promise you made when she gave you directions to the place she was running away to.This book is about a 16 year old girl name Tally Youngblood. It takes place in the future 500 centuries after the twenty-first century. She lives in a place called Uglisville and when everyone there turns 16 they have an operation. This operation makes them pretty and lets them enter New Pretty Town where they party all the time and where everyone looks perfect. When Tally's best friend turns 16 three months before her she is stuck all alone. So she makes a new friend called Shay. Shay and her have the same birthday and so for three months Tally becomes very close with Shay and they become very close. The week before they both turn 16 Shay tells Tally that she is going to run away to a place where her other friends ran away to because they didn't want to turn pretty. This place was called the Smokes. Shay invites Tally to join her. Tally really doesn't want to give up her dream and becoming a pretty so she refuses and says good-bye to Shay. Even though she didn't want to go Shay left Tally directions just incase she would change her minds. Directions only Tally would understand. She also made Tally promise that she would tell no one else of the Smokes too.Then on Tally's birthday when she's right about to enter the operation, she meets this lady called Dr. Cable who is a Special, and part of Special Circumstance. She tells Tally that unless she tells her where Shay is she won't be able to get the \\"pretty operation\\" and be ugly forever. Tally then decided that betraying a friend is better than being Ugly forever. So she sets off into the wild and decodes the direction that Shay gave her. When she finally does find Shay after the long journey she doesn't activate the pendant that the Specials gave her right away. The pendant was given to her and when activates it the specials will know where she is and be there in a day. Something stops Tally from doing this right away. When she gets to know the Smokes and Smokies (people living there), she finds out some pretty scary things about turning pretty. Then she has to decide whether or not she wants to stay ugly or betray the whole Smokes.I thought that Scott Westerfeld is a very wonderful and talented writer. I love the way he describes certain objects. He's really good at making the characters seem real. The genre is science fiction. I'm honestly not too sure if it's written in a Christian perspective or not, because it doesn't talk about it. The theme of this book is secrets and not always having to be like everyone else. I give this book five stars because it's really well written and exciting. Once you start it, you won't be able to put the book down.

This book is perfect if you what to understand how special it is to be different. The main character in the book is Tally. At first, I thought Tally was drawn to the pretty world. Later in the book, however, Tally drifts away as she learns secrets and meets new people. Some conversations the characters have are believable and some are not! What I like about Shay is that she's very courageous. The language is not hard to understand, so it's also part of the great things the book promises. I like the way the book is written because you'll never want to stop reading. The plot is easy to follow and the main ideas are followed by amazing, clear details. You can guess what will happen next because of the great details leading up to the next chapter. I would recommend this book to others who love suspense and thrilling adventures. At the end it's a cliffhanger. You'll want to read the next book, as well. This book reminds me of an experience I had.

I don't really know why...maybe it was the ugly/pretty idea in a teen novel. I was afraid it would be very 'teen' in tone (if you've read enough YA fiction, you'll know what I mean. Some YA books have a very immature tone and usually have pop culture references, idiotic slang and huge leaps in logic. I greatly dislike these types of YA books).I neededn't have worried, though. Uglies isn't anything like I thought it would be. It's a dystopian world with a very interesting twist. Some of the slang is a little confusing at first, but it is explained as the novel progresses. Personally, I found the first book to be a little slow (there are large sections where not much happens, but because this is the first of four novels, the author needed time to build the world so I was OK with the slightly slower pace). I liked Tally's voice and her character. She was believable and grew in a logical way. I also liked David. I'm hoping Shay and Peris (hate that name, sorry) become stronger characters in the next novel ('Pretties').I'd say if you're on the fence about this series, you should give it a try.

Highly recommend this series!!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I first read this series in 7th grade, and it always feels fresh every time I reread them. It is so different and cool, and all four are must-reads.Tally Youngblood is an Ugly, which is anyone from twelve to sixteen who is not surgically altered, and longs for the day she turns sixteen and leaves Uglyville forever and becomes a perfect, stunning Pretty, who has nothing to do but party. While spying on New Pretty Town to see her best friend Peris, she finds out he is an entirely different person, and wants nothing to do with her until she becomes a Pretty and moves to New Pretty Town. In order to escape, Tally preforms a not-very-smart stunt and narrowly gets away. On her way out, she becomes stuck, and meets another Ugly named Shay. As they escape together, they become find out that they have the same birthday, so they will both turn Pretty together. But Shay doesn't want to be a Pretty. When Shay escapes to the secret, rebellious, anti-Pretty place called The Smoke, she leaves a set of directions that only Tally understands in case she changes her mind.Tally is soon forced to choose between perfection and what is right, because it turns out that the world of the Pretties isn't very pretty at all. One of the best dystopian novels I have ever read. Scott Westerfeld has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"this was a book sitting on my bookshelf in 7th grade that got donated to my school and nobody else had been intrested in reading it. I read and did a book report on it and there were people begging to read it when i was done.. I just bought this and im looking forward to reading it again"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I remember when this book first came out it was ALL anybody talked about. At the time I didn't want to read it but recently I decided that I wanted to give it a chance.In the beginning I wasn't drawn into the book but it didn't take long before the story picked up speed. Before long I couldn't wait to keep turning the pages to find out what happened to Tally and her friends.The book is about a future post apocalyptic world in which people exist as \\"Uglies\\" until they turn 16. At 16 they get an operation to turn them into \\"Pretties\\". Once you get the op your life consists of little more than parties, fun, and being around people who are just as gorgeous as you are. Tally's best friend in the world turned pretty 3 whole months before she did and now she wants nothing more than to join him in New Pretty Town and be beautiful.Shortly before the operation Tally meets a fellow ugly named Shay. Shay is tricky and adventurous just like she is but unlike Tally, Shay isn't so sure that turning pretty is all it's cracked up to be. It turns out that she wants to leave before the operation and do the unthinkable: live as an Ugly forever. Tally is horrified and refuses to join Shay but it turns out that her troubles have just started. Special Circumstances give Tally an ultimatum: either find the secret society of runaway Uglies that Shay has joined or live as a disgraced Ugly forever.Tally is now faced with a difficult choice to make of either betraying the trust of someone she cares about or breaking her promise to her BFF about becoming a Pretty with him. When Tally sets out to find answers to her own questions she discovers a secret about the world she has always known that makes her question everything she's ever known about what it means to be Pretty.Basically the book may start out as underwhelming but it takes you on the adventure of a lifetime. By the end of the book I promise you'll be wishing you had a hoverboard to go zipping around the city. Tally is a completely relatable character because she's flawed. In so many books you find an unrealistically perfect heroine that readers cannot connect to but Tally's downfalls are what makes her such a well rounded leading female. Tally is rebellious and quirky but she wants to conform just like anyone else but she finds out that maybe being unique is better that being pretty.The way the book ended made me immediately pick up the next book in the series and start reading."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book has all the elements of a successful YA novel: Adventure, friendship, teenage rebellion, a healthy dose of self-esteem, and even boyfriend stealing. When looking at the formula, it works. There is something in this story for nearly all young readers to latch on to and appreciate.However, the actual writing does not rise up to the promise of the plot. Westerfeld gets the job done, to be sure. But he is not a poetic or particularly poignant author. He chugs along with the story and describes the action aptly, with few flourishes or truly hard hitting passages. After just a few chapters, it became obvious that he relies on a fairly limited vocabulary and collection of phrases. (Really, what is with these characters and seeking to find purchase? They sought to find purchase more times in three days than I ever have in my life.)Westerfeld has the habit of continuously hitting us over the head with his intent to build self-esteem. Over and over again we're told how the protagonist is special, that she's the only one who understands, that she isn't like everyone else. The concept of \\"You're beautiful! I'm beautiful! Everybody is beautiful!\\" lacks any sort of subtlety. It's simply tossed in there so that even the most oblivious and jaded reader is able to walk away with the understanding that no one is \\"ugly.\\" Is this necessary? Perhaps it is for some readers. I'm sure that there are a great deal of kids out there who needed this reminder. But without even an attempt to hide this sermon, the majority will simply roll their eyes and wish for their own hoverboard."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"awesome triology set! wonderful author. great dystopian book. i would love to see those books made into movies. very entertaining. love scott westerfield books."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this.The reader was phenomenal! I have to wonder, though, who on the production team disliked the character Shay. The \\"voice\\" used when Shay was speaking was nasal, whiny and petulant, even when she was happy and she was the only character with a specifically annoying voice.I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did.The concept behind how such a society could function was hard to grasp until I read book four, but that's a discussion for another post. What I would LOVE to read, if Westerfeld wants to revisit this world, is the story of the transition -- someone who was around when the Rusties were wiped out; who survived it, and who was instrumental in building the new world. In particular, I'd love a sympathetic view of the people behind the Pretty -- how they justified it to themselves and each other as well as the tech revival that occurred in the wake of the Rusties downfall. I fell hard for this world and want more. More history, more future... MORE. Please."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First off the bat, Tally rubbed me all sorts of wrong. All she could talk about were pretty people and how she couldn't wait to become one. She reminded me of that scene from A Bug's Life...Bug one: Harry, harry no! Don't look at the light!Bug two: I can't help it... it's so beautiful.!!Zap!!That was Tally when faced with a Pretty. And when she wasn't being enraptured by the Pretty, she was full of condescension. Consider these lines/thoughts by her:pg 76 Their ugly little faces peered up at the dorm's four-story height, their eyes full of wonder and terror. Oh I hate Tally and her attitude.pg 81 \\"Don't be weird, Shay. I'm an ugly, you're an ugly. we will be for two more weeks. It's no big deal or anything.\\" She laughed. \\"You, for example, have one giant eyebrow and one tiny one.\\" Tally being the biggest jerk as she talks to her friend.pg 198 \\"What are these freaks?\\"\\"They aren't freaks,\\" Shay said. \\"The weird thing is, these are famous people.\\"\\"Famous for what? Being hideous?\\" Tally talking about people in our modern day magazines.Need I say more? Let's just say, Tally and I didn't hit it off.How about the plot? The beginning was rather rocky, and I wasn't sure I'd even finish Uglies. Once Tally started focusing on other issues beside just being pretty, the book improved. I couldn't help but be interested in what happens during the Pretty process. I had a hard time believing a child could grow up thinking they're were ugly and worthless all their life, then after a surgery which fixed the outer imperfections they'd have high self-esteem. Then the Smokies were introduced, and I had to know what that was about.Uglies also had a bit of romance action. At first, the romance seemed so fake considering it came out of the blue. But sometimes, I guess that's how it happens. Just having someone take notice can create an attraction. In the case of Tally falling for an Ugly, I'd say that's what happened. After all, she was quite superficial throughout the story.Over all, this wasn't the best read, and the presentation wasn't all that great. However, the story was unique to me. It also ended on a cliffhanger, which I absolutely hate. I'm just glad the series is over, and I have the complete collection. Now I can read (or not read) them at my leisure."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I don't give you the plot because...well its a simple plot and I rather give you an impression...an inclinationThe Series of The Uglies- Book 1- UgliesDespite the gaping holes in the plot and loose interplay with minor and major figures I do like the first book. Its a breeze to read. Give yourself a week if you are busy. Intriguing and banal at the same time. The tension is bound up in this trans-formative surgery when you turn 16 years old. Everybody becomes pretty because it eases social tensions and levels the playing field.Conceptually, the contrast between Tally and Shay at the end really play up the brain lesions in the frontal lobe. I'm intrigued by the problem of finding a cure (pills made in a hollow building with NOTHING to make them is questionable, but...I like the ideas in the series.) So, I'll buy the next book. I am not rushing for it, but I recommend buy the box set."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Could not put it down soo good read the series!So worth six ninty nine. Very good.

There was no real punch-you-in-the-face shocker or world shattering discoveries for more then half of the book but I kept plugging along, realizing it takes time to set up a trilogy, hoping at least I would be able to have my tween daughter read it next. Well, let me assure you, I was rewarded for my efforts and dedication. The last quarter of the book really takes off and sustains itself all the way through Pretties (Book 2) and Specials (Book 3). The writing is consistent throughout and I loved the moral and ethical issues addressed, as Tally Youngblood is torn between different realities and placed in situations that have no simple solution. And now that I am finished with The Uglies Trilogy, I can see the importance of the long set-up in Book 1. All of those thoughts, feeling, actions and justifications come into play, change and evolve with Tally's character as she is continually put through the ringer."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love this book, and the whole series. The point it makes is wonderful, and I love the metaphors the author makes.

Will be reading everything this author has."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A friend of mine is a 6th grade teacher who regularly reads YA fiction for ideas for the classroom. She, and other teachers, all loved this book. I was looking for something interesting, so I picked it up. I've since read all four in the series and gave Uglies as a gift to my boyfriend's 12 year old daughter. This past Christmas, she asked for the rest of the series, including Bogus to Bubbly. I very much enjoyed these books, as each one has a differnet lesson to teach. I was surprised at how invested I became in the lives of Tally and her friends and think that this book, and the rest of the series, are must reads for middle schoolers."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy. At first, when I started reading it, I thought it was just a light and fun read; a page turner yet not something I'd lose sleep over, a 3 out of 5. But as I read more, I found myself getting more and more invested in the characters. By the time it finished (and it finishes with a cliff hanger) I literally threw myself at the next book Pretties, thankful I had already acquired it. So it does get better!The book starts with the young heroine, 15-year old Tally, who is an \\"ugly\\". She has been left alone in \\"Ugly town\\" since her slightly older best friend Peris, has moved to the \\"Pretty town\\" (for his 16th birthday) to have his operation. In this dystopian future, Tally lives in a society in which everyone has major surgery on their 16th birthday, to become supermodel gorgeous. Before the operation, as a normal person, you are thought of as ugly, and thus every teenager longs for the day of the operation. So does Tally.Things change though when Tally cross paths with Shay, a girl who has opinions on the society in which they live, not completely accepting it. When Shay runs away just before her 16th birthday to escape the operation, the authorities force Tally to choose between staying ugly for life or to find and bring back her friend.Tally decides to go after Shay, and well, that is essentially where the adventure begins. I won't say too much, as there are so many surprising twists and turns in this book, it is best knowing as little as possible.There were a couple of things that I really liked about the book. Firstly, the plot of the story makes you think about the way things are in our society. Not only about our obsession with beauty and what price is worth paying for it, but it also makes you reflect on the environmental issues of our world. In the book, our society is constantly referred to, as the utterly stupid society who lived in such an unsustainable way that it nearly extinguished the world. This truly makes you think about how we live our life. One example is when someone tries to explain to Tally what \\"newspapers\\" used to be in our society; essentially books printed for a one-day-use to be thrown away the day after. All those trees wasted for a one day read. How utterly stupid and wasteful, Tally reflects. And I can't but agree.I also liked how Tally, the main character grows throughout the book, as in the rest of the series. She starts off as a quite immature girl, completely unaware of the effect her society has had on her, but gradually becomes stronger and also more likable.There is romance, but it's not the focus of the story. Actually, that happened very quickly, I did not even see it coming (and I'm usually good at spotting those things). Consequently, it's not something to swoon for, and never really made my heart racing. Still, it's kind of nice that it's happening. It sort of adds to the story rather than makes the story if you know what I mean.Finally what I liked about this book is how you gradually get to know more and more about the society they live in, as Westerfeld reveals secrets throughout the book. He keeps you on the edge, revealing bits and pieces here and there, but always leaving things out, so that you are wishing for more, and keep turning pages.Uglies does not feel like a stand-alone book, and as I mentioned before, you will most likely want to keep reading the next two when it is finished. It kind of draws you in gradually. Starting light and easy and then before you know it you will be hooked. If you like books like The Host and Hunger games, I'm pretty sure you will like this series as well."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a big fan of books about futuristic societies, and I must say that this book definitely sparked my interest. The world Westerfield created is so unique and interesting, and it really gets you thinking about the idea of beauty and the way things are today. It also makes our society's current obsession with beauty seem frightening - like is this the world we could end up in because of what we value? Slipped within the fun and amusing narrative is some great food for thought not only about beauty, but also about other issues such as environmental destruction and societies' dependence on natural resources. Overall, Uglies is an enjoyable and easy read, and will definitely leave you excited for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The story is so good that it is a joy to reread! I simply love this trilogy and wish it never came to an end (except all good things must). I wish I could find more novels like this!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a 7th grader and I had to read the book The Uglies as a reading assignment. When I read it, I found that it was very interesting.The author, Scott Westerfeld did a very good job in describing and putting picture a of what he is talking about in our minds. The story line of the book was also interesting. The plot really grabbed my attention since it included some \\"high-tech\\" things from the future, and also some words and food that we never even heard of. This kind of gave me the idea of what the future might look like if we stop global warming. This is another thing that got my attention in this book, since it's sort of a hidden moral inside the story. So now, not only is it a futuristic-fiction like story, but also a parable with an important lesson hidden in it. Another good thing that I found about this book is that it seems appropriate for anyone, even fourth graders or adults. I definitely think that people from all ages will want to read this book. Scott Westerfeld did a very good job writing The Uglies series. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a middle school student who \\"studied\\" Uglies by Scott Westerfeld at school, and one who enjoys such science fiction books, I can tell you that this book is one surely to be enjoyed by middle-schoolers, or any adult who likes science fiction.This book, Uglies, put in the setting of the future, the world of Tally Youngblood is nothing like it is here, in \\"our world.\\" 2011 has passed millions of years ago, and we, us in 2011 are called the \\"rusties,\\" known for our crazy acts of hideous things like pollution, cutting down trees, and killing animals. Something they wouldn't even think of doing.In a society of four classes--littlies, uglies, pretties, and specials--well, the name explains it. Up until you're 12, you're a littlie, then when you turn twelve--you live in the dorms of uglies, and when you turn sixteen, you get an operation that changes you--inside out. They rub off your skin, give you new, soft skin, big vulnerable eyes, perfect teeth, nose--everything, almost like being born again, as a new appearance, perfect, pretty. When you're a pretty, your only job is to have fun and party.To any ugly, being pretty and partying all day seems like the best thing to do--but is it?As Tally finds a friend who decides to run away from becoming pretty and join a \\"juvenile\\" group of kids and adult uglies who have escaped the operation into turning pretty, Tally must face betrayal, self conflict, and finding the truth to being pretty.If I were to rate this book, I'd rate it a four. Not a five--that's reserved for the best of best books, and Uglies isn't what you'd call the best of best--it's the ending and structure that ruined my thought of it.I didn't like simplicity of the book, of the plot. It was basically like almost any other science fiction book that you would find--in the future, in a society of different people, running away, protesting, etc. Many books I read are very similar to it. Another thing was the whole series. Uglies is merely the introduction. Following Uglies is Pretties, Specials, then Extras. Uglies I liked because it was the first book, and although it was similar to the others, it still had a taste to it because it, at least, had different details and plot. However, the following books were too predictable, too similar to the first book, almost the same format as Uglies, and I found myself in a guessing game with \\"I bet this is going to happen next\\" and the titles gave the away, too (if you haven't read it, you wouldn't understand). Therefore, I found Pretties and Specials boring and tedious. However, the little details and \\"mini-plots\\" were what were more interesting--which is the mere reason I continued to read (and the curiosity of what the ending would be like). I liked Extras, because it was quite different than the prior three books of the series, but it was pretty much the same thing--except instead of everyone wanting to be pretty, everyone wanted to be popular--pretty much coming across the same idea that I said before, if everyone's pretty, then is anyone pretty?I find this book would be hard to understand for younger readers in elementary schools, no matter how easy the words itself are. The meaning behind a book is what is most important, to my opinion, which, therefore, concludes to my suggestion that this book should be mainly for people at the age 11 and up. You really need to listen to the hidden messages of the metaphors and the \\"behind the lines\\" meaning to not just read this book as \\"any other science fiction book.\\"Of course, I have read this once on my own, and once again at school. One would understand that in school, you go more \\"in depth\\" of the book and \\"dissect\\" it more than you would if you were just reading it for fun. The book is a good read, full of metaphors that you can try to understand, and it is such a clever plot, how everything weaves together to form that one last ending. There was one \\"moral,\\" you could call it, that formed around the book, and if you paid enough attention to the story and \\"behind the scenes,\\" as some often say, you would realize that it also came across a very important point that applies to us today. Not just \\"don't pollute,\\" but the thought of, if everyone's pretty, then is anyone pretty? The standard of normal changes from \`ugly' to \`pretty,' so if everyone's pretty, being pretty is being normal--nothing special after all, nothing special about you being pretty. The book gave a meaning to the reader that being \\"like everyone else\\" isn't always the best idea, which is why this book suits middle-schoolers more than adults, when they are in the midst of getting independent and thinking of things themselves. As a quote on some book covers of Uglies suggests, \\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\" Tally isn't appreciating herself as herself. Being compared to those with extreme beauty isn't the best way to live, and to Tally, she and other uglies are hideous, and need the operation to become pretty. To us, this tells us not to be depressed that we are \\"different,\\" because being different is not bad at all, and in some ways, is better than being like \\"everyone else.\\"After reading this book, I thought again about how our world is right now, and how we can improve it. It made me think to appreciate myself as how I am, and also that being \\"like everyone else\\" isn't always the best thing."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best future written novels I have ever read. I love the way Scott Westerfeld made a really well rounded future world. I was awed by the fact that he was able to construct such a huge society with just his imagination and I respect him greatly for that. As for the book and storyline itself, I thought it was all very good. I was little bored and disappointed at some points but I was mostly excited and shocked by the twists and turns Scott Westerfeld added to these books. I suggest you read these books if you're ready for some changes in the way you see the world today."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What do you think of Uglies? I am a male 7th grade student and have read this book recently. I can't wait to read the next couple of books, even though the main character is a girl. I thought that the whole concept was enthralling, though the whole basis wasn't original.Uglies, even though it wasn't original, is a very good book to use with middle school students. The book is a hodgepodge of different topics. In some parts of the book there is romance, drama, action, adventure, and even terror. The book is about a 15 almost 16 year old girl who lives a secluded life and thinks going across a river to a different town called New Pretty Town is exciting. Every one in Uglyville thinks this is exciting though for Tally this is about to change. This book is filled with surprises and odd occurrences. For a lazy 7th grade class this is the perfect thing to wake them up. If it were me I would give this book 4 stars, since the idea wasn't original.Finally this book is an interesting persceptive on life in the future, although it may seem far-fetched if you really think about it there are many things this society does that we do today.

But in this book, becoming pretty comes with a price. In the book Uglies, Westerfeld's first book in his awesome trilogy, we discover a very possible future where everyone can possess stunning beauty when they turn sixteen. Everyone else is ugly. The story's main character is Tally, a girl who lives in the future and wants to be pretty more than anything. In order to be pretty, Tally has to betray her friend or forever stay ugly. Tally finds herself in this novel and what she what she really wants.I personally loved this eye-opening novel. It has a plot that is well-constructed and keeps you hungry for more. Westerfeld satisfies this hunger, seeing as to he has a trilogy to Uglies. It also has a message that everyone can relate to: True beauty lies within.

My all-time favorites are: The Giver (by Lois Lowry), Among The Hidden (by Margaret Peterson Haddix), Petey (by Ben Mikaelsen),and now THIS series! I read this book within two days, and am almost finished with The Pretties. These books make you really think about a utopian society and the flaws that accompany them when the government or \\"people in charge\\" make all of your decisions for you.

From fun pranks to running away as a spy, this book is full of adventure. Tally is looking forward to turning pretty in a few weeks (in her world you have an operation at age 16 that makes you pretty). But then she meets Shay, who is also just about to turn pretty but is not so sure she wants to. The day before Shay is supposed to turn pretty, she runs away to a place called the Smoke. But it is against the law to run away and to not turn pretty. When it is time for Tally to turn pretty, she isn't allowed to, unless she agrees to become a spy and find Shay and a group of other people who ran away. So Tally decides to go to the Smoke. And with the help of Shay's complicated directions, she is able to reach the Smoke. But while she is there she learns a lot. Not just about how to survive in the wild, but also that the operation changes your brain. After Tally learns what happens from the operation, she decides she doesn't want to turn pretty. But it is too late because the Smoke has been destroyed by Special Circumstances (the people who made Tally go to the Smoke). Luckily, Tally and her friend David get away and later free all the Smokies who were caught. Sadly, everybody finds out it was Tally's fault the Smoke was destroyed, but they forgive her. In the end, Shay had the operation and became pretty. As you can tell, this was a very interesting book. It kept me reading constantly and wanting to know what surprise would happen next. Although I don't usually like books about other worlds that have strange rules or characters, this one was an exception as it was a great book. This was not just an interesting book, but it also had a very important lesson. It doesn't matter what's on the outside, but what's on the inside that counts.

The book follows the struggles she feels with betraying her friends and what she really wants.The events are easy to follow, but Scott Westerfield fills the book with symbolism. Though the world Tally lives in does not sound too much like the one you and I live in, it symbolizes the ideals in our society.This book was a fun, easy read and the symbolism was a great addition to the story to make readers think."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have been reading Amazon reviews for years now--using them to help determine whether I would purchase a book or not, but I have never actually written one, despite times where I thought I would. I have, however, finally decided to write one of my own, all because of this book.Scott Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" series is one of the best books I have ever read. The entire time I was reading it, I kept pausing, staring at my wall, and thinking to myself, \\"Wow, I wish I could write that well.\\" I was completely caught up in the imagery of his words--I could actually see things taking place as he wrote them. The man is a master of his craft. He can manipulate words and string them together in an incredible, enviable way.As his world is set in the future, he uses words without explaining them, but it is not hard to pick up through context clues what they mean. This is especially apparent in the second and third books, though by the end of the second book, I was thinking to myself that things were quite \\"bubbly\\" and that I had definitely gone \\"mind-missing\\" when I couldn't find my keys. In the second book, after the transformation, he uses words as though Tally truly has undergone the surgery, apparent in her speech and her thoughts and choice of words. It only furthers my point at what a genius Mr. Westerfeld is, and how good he is at setting his scene.Though the concepts in the book are not new, Mr. Westerfeld never acts as though they are. The basic story is this: all people at the age of sixteen undergo surgery to become pretty. However, in the first book it is discovered that the surgery doesn't just make you pretty--it does something to your mind, too, to control you and keep everyone nice and happy. That's how the world ends war. But some of the people decide they want to think for themselves, and thus begins quite the problem for this perfect society that has been created...I read all three books in less than a day, though it tended to drag a little about a quarter of the way through the third book. Tally had gone through so many changes that I was tired of her changing, and she had chosen Zane and I had picked David, and the books are quite long and I think my eyes were tired from the low-light I was using to read. Still, I recommend reading all three books, buying all three books, and then buying another set to give to a friend. But feel free to change-up the order."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I guess I expected a little bit more out of this book. However, I really like the idea of it, and the issues that the author brought to light because they are so relevant to girls today.There were parts of the book that I thought could have been better, such as the Tally/David romance, or Tally's character development; and I think it would have been helpful to have a little bit more description of the setting and some of the technology used in the futuristic world of this book.I realize that this book was aimed towards young teen girls though (I'm 22 years old), and keeping that in mind, it was very interesting for light, summer vacation reading. Overall, it's a nice little story and I look forward to reading Pretties. Kudos to Scott Westerfeld for creating a book with a positive message for today's teens."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'd heard wonderful things about this book, and I finally decided to give in and read it for myself. It was amazing. I loved all the dynamics and characters in this story. It flowed so easily and was easy to keep reading all night long. This is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this for my kids, hoping to lure them away from video games. It hasn't worked--yet--but in the meantime, I read it and enjoyed it. Westerfeld creates a believable dystopian world where all is not as it seems.It reminded me of The Giver, although Westerfeld's character development is not as thoughtful as Lowry's.

Longer than the typical YA novel, UGLIES does not disappoint in its ability to keep the reader involved.It's not perfect, as some descriptions of places and actions are a bit confusing and tend to make the reader have to re-read a section to understand the picture that the author is trying to create. But with so much happening, that minor problem is acceptable.As for the story itself, it's a real page-turner! Starting with a unique concept of a future where all sixteen-year-olds have an operation to turn them drop-dead gorgeous, once established, this concept really makes a reader contemplate the wisdom of such a place -- racism and preferential treatment (based on beauty) no longer exists as there is a level playing field for everyone. Sounds promising...except when more information comes out -- deep into the story, where it can have the deepest impact. As a teacher, I imagine that my students would love to discuss the ramifications of living in such a society.Plotwise, UGLIES really moves and feels very much like a summer blockbuster at the movies with hoverboards, burned out cities, bungee jackets and some great quests to engage young minds who need ACTION! Character conflicts also become engaging with questions of loyalty, inner beauty, good vs.evil, and teen independence motivating the progression of plot.I wish I had time right now to immediately pick up the next two books in this trilogy because I get a sense that there's more of the same in books 2 and 3.I highly recommend this book for teen readers who want thrills on the page!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What if you lived in a world where you were ugly until you turned 16?

Shay has a hover board, something that Tally has always wanted to try out. Shay and her become friends, and Shay teaches Tally how to hover board as good as she can.I think the main idea of this book is that you shouldn't judge people by what is on the outside, it should be by what is on the inside.The ending of this book is good but it leaves you hanging, because the story continues on in the next book, Pretties; which I have also read."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Book 1 of the Trilogy.

The author Scott Westerfeld has made his point clear, but I also think that he added too much detail. All stories need good detail, but unneeded information doesn't add to the overall greatness of the book. WesterFeld gave details that were not important to any of the events or the overall point. With all the details it made it harder to read and focus on the meaning. I believe that Uglies has a good message but needs to be cut down to the important and needed information."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I saw this book in the bookstore, and thought, why would the book be called uglies when the person on the front cover isn't, in my opinion, ugly?

Cons of this book was the slang for words got confusing. If you like futurstic and semi romantic stories i would definetely reccomend this.

It was all action adventure with jumping off buildings, breaking into secure structures, hover board races and bad guys who have superhuman strength. He created a very vivid image of what the future could look like. The author gave us a lot to enjoy in the 425 pgs. He made sure that you felt the main character's anger and guilt and confusion and happiness. It didn't feel painfully long even though it kind of was.On to the bad. The first time I watched Fellowship of the Ring I was seriously ticked at the cliffhanger ending. All I need is a temporary happily ever after, but just like that movie, you don't get it from this book. The other less annoying part of this book is the feeling that you are sitting through a lecture on your carbon footprint. You hear about recycling, cutting down trees, gas alternatives, and solar power. It was just a little too much for me.Tally lives in a world of two types of people... uglies and pretties. Everyone is considered ugly until they go through an operation when they are 16. She is eagerly awaiting her turn to become a pretty and move to Prettyville with her friends and do nothing but eat, drink, and be merry. She meets a new friend, Shay, just months before her operation and learns that she is going to run away and stay ugly forever.Tally gets a hard reality check when a special unit of Pretties denies her the operation unless she finds where the runaways have gone. She hikes through the wild world outside of her protected city and nearly dies several times.Tally finds Smoke, the rough city of runaways, and is reunited with Shay. Shay has a crush on a boy smokey named David who is the son of the founders of Smoke. David falls for Tally and chaos arises.Tally feels guilt for her lies to the smokies and eventually makes amends the only way she knows how. She marches off into the horizon with only her hover board... to sacrifice herself. The end. Yep, really.Now for the romance. David falls for Tally on first sight... because she has character. Tally is intrigued by this older guy who carries himself with such ease and confidence in the wild. He gives her a gift of gloves, outdoorsman for \\"I heart you!\\" She doesn't know what to do because Shay hearts David, but within a day they are kissing goodnight and meeting his parents.I give this book a four out of ten just because I am not willing to read 2 more 400 page books to get a hopefully happily ever after. It would be fine for 16 and up, but it does mention tangled legs in a pleasure garden and the entire Pretty town eludes to partying it up and all that goes with it. Tally does some serious growing up, but she holds out until the very end to finally be honest with David.

The only thing that bothered me was the main character Tally...she had too much of a 360 change from being the brainwashed ugly to the better informed one, but oh well, I'm still excited to finish the series!I really enjoyed how three hundred years into the future things haven't changed that much. Everyone still cares about looking perfect and not being happy for who they are on the inside and not what they look like on the outside.

In Tally's world everyone is born ugly and leave their parents home when they are twelve to go to school in Uglyville and live with other uglies. When uglies turn sixteen they go under the knife and receive an operation that turns them pretty. Tally meets Shay a few months before she turns sixteen; Shay tries to convince Tally to runaway with her to a secret society called the Smoke. Tally decides she would rather turn pretty. However, when Tally arrives to have her operation she is sent to Special Circumstances. The leader, Dr. Cable, blackmails Tally into leading them to the Smoke; only then will they agree to turn her pretty. So, Tally is given a tracking device, disguised as a pendant, and sent on the long and treacherous journey. Once she arrives she is suspiciously welcomed by the Smokies. Tally falls in love with David, son of the founders of the Smoke. David brings her to meet his parents, previous doctors who performed the pretty operation, and they tell Tally why Special Circumstances really wants to turn the population pretty. When Tally decides she doesn't want the life of a pretty and tries to destroy her tracking device she accidentally sets it off. Special Circumstances arrives the next morning and captures almost all of the Smokies, except for David and Tally. Tally and David end up breaking into Special Circumstances and find David's mom, Maddy, a now pretty and clueless Shay, and a few more Smokies. They steal important information about the pretty operation from an unconscious Dr. Cable and flee. Maddy uses Dr. Cable's information to finish a cure for the problem that the pretty operation creates; she wants to try it out on Shay, but she refuses. The only way to find out if there is a cure is to have a volunteer consent to the treatment before they undergo the pretty operation. Tally returns to the city in the last page of Uglies and asks for them to make her pretty.This book is impossible to put down! As a future teacher I would definitely use this book in the classroom. It is a wonderful dystopian novel that could be read alongside books like The Giver and 1984 as a unit. This is so much more than just a story; Uglies most definitely fulfills its purpose to make readers aware of what society can turn into when it allows the government free reign in trying to fix all the problems. Only new, more devastating problems are created. People no longer value themselves, instead they conform to a society that offers to fix their problems, in this case make them pretty. Westerfeld uses an extreme example of the government controlling people to warn against the potential effects.

It just was not very high up on my list. Lately I have had a fascination with all things dystopian and the box set was cheap on Amazon so I thought, Why Not? I'm so happy I bought them!The book seemed a little slow at first. We jumped right into the world without much explanation or background but it didn't take long to figure things out. After that I had a very hard time setting this book down.The whole concept of the story and the world is completely genius! And completely frightening at the same time. This seems like something that could actually happen! I guess that's true for a lot of dystopian books. That's probably why I like them so much too. Westerfeld's world building is incredibly done.All the characters were easy to connect to and well written. At times I wanted to shake Tally but I think that is a natural reaction and one that the author wanted us to have. I felt the fear, distrust and horror that these characters felt at their situation.All in all Uglies was a fantastic read.

When Shay runs away to live in the Smoke, Tally learns more about the pretty world than she ever wanted to know.This novel raises familiar concepts about appearance versus substance in unique and interesting ways. Personally, I think the middle school and high school audience that this book was written for need to hear this message over and over again. Scott Westerfeld has built a fun, futuristic world in this book, which is the first of a trilogy. I'm looking forward to reading the second book, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"i read this book a year ago and i still remember almost every detail. i like Pretties more but this book is the bomb; the start of the new black~nicole nappi new york,"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have to say that I liked the premise of a world where no physical imperfection will hold you back in life, because every person receives an operation when they are sixteen to change them from an ugly to a pretty. Even natural pretties, if they do exist, would not have an advantage over the former uglies who were surgically enhanced. The book centers around the character of Tally, a fifteen year old girl living hundreds of years in the future, who has just lost a friend to New Pretty Town. Her friend, Peris, turned sixteen three months before she, so he has been living a new life in New Pretty Town filling his life with social events, new friends, & has forgotten to write/see her once he had surgery.When Tally sneaks into New Pretty Town to visit Peris, she is amazed by his beauty, but notices that his personality has changed. He's no longer the friend who would pull pranks & make fun of new pretties for their mindless ways. In fact, his whole opinion has changed about being pretty & even though he is still friends with Tally, he makes their relationship contingent upon her getting surgery. I guess even in a world where you are told past early childhood that you're ugly, you would still be a little shocked as Tally was when Peris made his sentiments clear. She had to be pretty to be his friend & he would see her after the operation. Crazy!Not to give much of the book away, but as we see from the first episode in New Pretty Town, Tally begins to realize, rather slowly, that there is more to being pretty than having your face & body changed. Maybe all the science & biological reasoning behind becoming pretty is skewed, in hopes of achieving a common goal outside of making everybody HOT!The series starts off slowly, that's why I give it three stars, but it does pick up towards the end. I'll be reading the rest of the series as time/interest allows."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is one of those books that I have kept putting off reading, and now that I've read it, I have no idea why it took me so long! The one good thing about putting it off is that the series has all been released already. I don't have to wait for the next one!They are YA Science Fiction and I swear that I think every teenager should be required to read these books! They are set in our world, but about 300 years in the future. The characters live in a society where you are either an ugly or a pretty. Uglies are normal people, mostly kids, and when you turn 16 you get MAJOR reconstructive surgery to be the ideal pretty. The main character, Tally, meets a girl named Shay. They are just about 3 months from their 16 birthdays and Tally is just counting down the days until she can become pretty. But Shay has a different perspective on things. She likes the way that she looks right now. Why does she have to have surgery to become pretty?This series really delves into issues that face all of us every day. It did take a little bit for me to get into this book, and that's the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But once I did it just grabs you and holds on until the last page. Then once you've read that last page you have to race out and get the next one!As a side note, for those of you who enjoy audiobooks, this was a great one.

Yes, we all want to be beautiful. But what if beauty became mandatory? Then, it doesn't sound so appealing. Yet, you know people who would do it. Don't you? Plenty of Tally's friends had done it before her. Tally's best friend Peris, who loved sneaking out in the middle of the night, causing trouble, defying authority with Tally, still went through the transformation. Even Tally considered it many times. However, she eventually runs away in order to discover what really happens when a person becomes \\"pretty.\\" Turns out that it isn't so pretty at all.Another high point was the development of the society Tally lives in. I've read a few dystopian novels, but this has been one of the most interesting. Everything appears to be simple, from the names of the towns (New Pretty Town, Uglyville, The Rusties, The Smoke, etc.), to the different characteristics of people who live there, to their slang. Yet, there are many layers of controversy and more and more to learn as Tally discovers ever places' little secrets.Low Notes: The lowest note is Tally's transformation in the third book, \\"Specials.\\" As you can imagine, Tally is an Ugly in \\"Uglies,\\" a Pretty in \\"Pretties,\\" and a Special in \\"Specials.\\" (The person in \\"Extras\\" is also an \\"Extra,\\" but that's a different character.) Anyway, you get to know and love Tally as an Ugly, and even when she is turned into a Pretty she's fighting it the whole time, so she doesn't feel all that different. However, when she becomes a Special she changes a lot; almost too much. She's harder, meaner, blunter, all characteristics of Specials, but not of Tally. It takes a bit of getting used to. (If you ever get used to it.) Nevertheless, I guess it was inevitable so it's really nothing to get too hung up on.Ratings:Character Development: 4/5Dialogue: 5/5Prose: 4/5Believability: 4.5/5Style and Grammar: 4.5/5Overall Rating: 88% Unique!For this review: [...]For my other reviews: [...]"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was definitely a surprise to me. When I first read it, it was only because I liked the cover. But as I read more I began to like how entertaining and exciting the plot line was becoming. Some very intriguing moments in this book were the parts when Tally escaped the manor in the pretty side of town and when the Smoke gets attacked by Specials. One part I found was very exciting was when Tally must help the other Smoke survivors escape after they were caught by the Specials. This book definitely did make me super confused. Throughout the story, the characters talk about how life used to be on earth before wars broke out and the whole reason was because people looked different. I never understood because the point of view from the character kept changing on the idea that people should all look the same and be pretty or if we should all be different and be unique.The reason I gave this book 3 stars and not more is because the thrilling parts in this entire book were so far apart. And all that time between went so slow. This supposed sci-fi adventure was not as adventurous as it was sci-fi. The most boring part in the entire book was Tally's journey the Smoke. It was like three chapters. In the end, though, the book was compelling and futuristic. The conclusion of the book was also very good. It foreshadowed very well and made you very interested to read the secound book in the series.By Maria Garcia"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I initially chalked this series up as yet another teenage girl coming-of-age story, but my wife and daughter kept telling me I'd love them. So I tried Uglies, and could't put them down until I had read all 4 (Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras). It's a post-apocalyptic future in which the populace is tightly managed through age segregation and chemical/surgical manipulation. It has the feel of Orwell's 1984, but with a modern flare and some eye glitter. I've had just about enough of the crappy superhero movies, and am hoping someone grabs hold of this series and brings it to film. They'll be a hit."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is unlike any YA book I've read. It captured my attention and kept it. When I was finished, I immediately downloaded the next installment, Pretties. I'd recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies tells the story of Tally Youngblood, a 15-year-old girl living in a future dystopian society where all she can do is wait for her 16th birthday when she will finally be able to have the operation that makes her (and everyone else) pretty. And by pretty I mean perfect. We aren't talking about a nose job here, but a major reconstruction via future technologies of every thing that would make a person unique (and therefore ugly). No one is fat, short, tall, thin or even has bad hair. But while she's waiting for her transformation, Tally meets Shay and first hears about people who have run away from their perfect little city and from the one thing she has been waiting for her whole life; the surgery. They have actually chosen to remain ugly - forever. When Shay runs away as well, Tally goes in search of her new friend, but finds so much more than she bargained for.\\"Or maybe when they do the operation-when they grind and stretch your bones to the right shape, peel off your face and rub all your skin away, and stick in plastic cheekbones so you look like everyone else-maybe after going through all that you just aren't very interesting anymore.\\"-- Scott Westerfeld (Uglies)This was a fun easy read and I found myself enjoying it immensely, while also finding some great themes, especially for younger readers. I also just loved the world Westerfeld created. We're talking hoverboards and walls that have the technology to give you anything you ask for. And I have to admit, even though I know others found it distracting, I got a little bit hooked on the slang his pretty-brained teens used. I still find a word or two of it slipping from my mouth on occasion only to realize that the person I'm talking to, just doesn't get the reference. At which point, I usually wish I had a copy of the book in my back pocket to throw at (er..give to) them with instructions to read it, and then come talk to me.Another thing I really admired about Westerfeld's book was that the characters managed to be sympathetic and intelligent, even though they were a product of a world which really didn't seem to care about fostering either. They enjoyed clothes and dreaming about looking beautiful, yes. But, unlike too many YA novels I've read of late, that was not who they were. It was certainly not the defining soul of any of the characters. Least of all Tally. She has a pretty huge character arc in the first book. With plenty of action. There's just so much to love, especially for young adults: the newness of the world that could easily be born of ours, the fun technology, the adventure, the language, and then the realization that there is something terribly wrong with their pretty little world, and very few capable of fixing it. This was absolutely enjoyable! I would note that while the first book alone is good, it's definitely a series read. He leaves us with a pretty tall cliffhanger at the end of the book and you won't want to wait to start the second one."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Westerfeld knows how to connect with his readers and make you not want to put his work down for a second. I read this book in two days, and I couldn't believe it. It was jam-packed with action and I felt that every other page there was some kind of hook to keep me wondering what was going to happen next. I definitely recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book. I loved it's fast pace, it's cast, and it's flying and jumping off of things.I feel that Uglies paved the way for the YA Dystopian genre. I'm sure it wasn't the absolute first (although, now I'm wondering what was?) but it holds many similarities to other dystopians I've read. Not in the writing or the characters or the plot, but in the idea that in the future, we will all be forced to undergo some sort of operation at a certain age, to make us less human. Something that started out with good intentions, like making everyone equally pretty as in this book, but paved the path for a tyrant to come in and take over.Uglies is one of those books. When one reaches the age of sixteen, in this world, you go under the knife and come out...pretty. They shape your bones and your eyes and your lips. The scrub off any marks on your skin and suction off all your fat. They make you gorgeous. Unbelievably gorgeous. Just like everyone else.More than the story or the characters, or perhaps not MORE than but alongside all of the traditional parts of telling a story Scott Westerfeld tries to ascertain whether or not this is a good thing or not. Whether or not all the insecurity and self-doubt and self-consciousness that afflicts us as teenagers and young adults can be solved by changing the way we look. This spoke to me a lot. I don't know that I would be able to turn this down even now that I'm twenty five (and have read a LOT of cautionary fiction) so it is very easy to identify with Tally, the main character. I completely understand why she wants to be Pretty. All her friends are Pretty. She has been brought up on the idea that she isn't just ugly, she is an Ugly. Her whole being right now needs to be different so that she can fit it. Authority figures have been telling her this all her life.So, the idea that she would betray a friend, especially so new a friend, when her Pretty operation is withheld from her is completely believable and understandable. And also awesome because it sends her on a hover-boarding adventure across a deserted landscape of future earth. I especially enjoyed the way the setting was described because it could have been anywhere, on any continent, the aftermath of any part of civilization. It felt the same and yet different from anything else I've read like it.The world building was exceptional in this story.As were the characters. Tally's longing to become Pretty and join her friends was palpable. It made the whole story stick together. Her complete and utter belief that she was ugly and inferior and needed to be different. Needed to have someone else change her, was, in a way, just as I'd felt as a teenager but was also a million times worse.Shay, Tally's friend who runs away from the city just before her Pretty operation, was very simple on the surface but the more I think about it, the more complex and important she was. All her appearances in the beginning seem to serve some sort of purpose to the plot. Whether it be teaching Tally to use the hover-board or being the runaway that forces others to send Tally out into the wild searching for her. But the relationship the two develop outside of the city is different and her character became more alive to me then. I can't wait to see where the rest of the series takes Shay.And then there's David, who, despite being an ugly past the age of sixteen, seemed to be the most attractive character in this book. I loved his confidence and his authority and his connection to Tally. A lot of spoilers are wrapped up in why I love David so much so I'm not going to say anything more, except if he and Tally don't end up together, I'm gong to be unhappy.After years and years of not reading this book, I've owned for it at least two yours, what prompted me to pick it up was, well, Scott Westerfeld was in town and man does he know how to put on an author event. If he is ever doing an event near you, go. Don't think twice about it. He was funny, informative, entertaining, and just had some awesome things to say. As I went to his very last tour stop for Behemoth I respect his ability to keep things sounding fresh and new even though he must have shown those same slides a million times.Stayed tuned to future Flashback Fridays when I review the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Okay, so I was already a little biased going into this book. I was already of big fan of Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan series, and think he's a wonderful writer, so Uglies already had that going for it. Then there's the fact that I've heard so many good things about it out there in the world, especially on blogs. Then, there's the fact that I'm a sucker for dystopian novels. Even since I devoured George Orwell's iconic 1984 and Aldous Huxley's famous Brave New World, I've been a dystopian fiction junkie.Uglies was another wonderful dystopian novel that makes you think and points out some fascinating truths about our society today, and give an idea of what it could become in the future.In Uglies, everyone at the age of sixteen undergoes an operation to become pretty. Not just pretty, but supermodel gorgeous, for the rest of their lives. Once you become a \\"Pretty,\\" you get to live apart from the Uglies with other Pretties, and spend all your time partying and having a good life. Young Tally is ready to go through her operation, especially since her best friend Peris became a Prettie. But, as Tally gets closer to a strange girl named Shay, her future doesn't seem so certain. Shay is different everyone else, she questions where or not she wants to be pretty, because it changes her into a different person. As Tally gets draw into the strange affairs of her society, she starts to question whether or not the pretty operation is the right thing.Westerfeld's world is well-drawn and filled with thrilling suspense. Though I think he matured a little more strongly as a writer in the Leviathan series, he still delivers a great novel in Uglies that will keep YA readers interested up until the last page."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"(from Murphy's Library -[...])I had this book on my to be read list for over four months, since I first start to follow some book blogs daily. The story caught my attention right away and I thought it was really original. I had a lot of books to buy and to read before I even could get near Uglies, but I didn't forget it.Anyway, I'm from Brazil, like you guys already know, and recently I saw lots of publicy for this book in some brazilian blogs. Turns out that the rights for this series were bought in Brazil, and the first one was published. Lots of reviews started to appear, and when reading them I got the feeling I wouldn't like this book like I first thought.What changed? Why did I finally read the book? Well, I saw a review that made me want to read it again--and after a fast exchange on twitter with the book blogger that wrote the review, I got the desire to read it again. So, thanks Juh Oliveto, from Livros&Bolinhos;, I read an incredible book.Uglies isn't just a young adult fiction. As far as the writing goes, the book is extremely well written, it has a narrative that gets you and the characters have amazing personalities. Some things are a little confusing, but overall the author made an amazing job writing it. I don't have big critics about the book, maybe a little more explanation at some points, but that's it. But Uglies is a lot more than it's writing. It's a social critic, a hard reality about how we see life, even with the author used metaphores to make his point.Uglies is a very intelligent book. Can be appreciated as just a entretaining book, for sure, but if you search for more you will find it, and that is what made this book so good for me. It's a simple book in terms of narrative, but a powerful story anyway."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"loved this book from the first page.i wasn't thrilled about the teen romace in the later stages of the book, butother then that it has a great message about how things are not always what they seemand how to think for yourself.i LOVED THE ENDING!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book, although not as good as some YA I've recently read (Unwind and Hunger Games, for instance) is still worth reading.

It is actually a kind of scary thought. I did find it funny that at one point some of the uglies see pictures of people from our time like the super skinny models and find them ugly because they look like they are starving and that was what we found beautiful.Shay and Tally are both characters. They almost seem to be two halves of one person. Shay is the more impulsive, bold half where Tally is the more hesitant side that likes to conform to what people expect of her. It will be nice to see if they can help each other grow the other half of their personality. I am excited to see what happens in the next book to see what becomes of the uglies that do not want to become pretties and where David and Tally's relationship go.I think this is a great YA book since it's pointing out that looking like everyone else is not always a good thing. What some might see as imperfections are not necessarily bad things. It gives people personality and individualism."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After recently getting back in touch with reading I have been searching for books to read. I started out with the Twilight saga and wanted to read more books that would entertain my imagination. Uglies did the trick. The book touches on a number of issues forcing the reader to contemplate them also. I liked it's commentary on self image. It definitely asserts that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that society dictates to us quite often what beauty is.It is asserting that if we could look objectively at our surroundings we would be more likely to understand that sometimes what society is saying you should do may not actually be in your best interest.I enjoyed watching Tally Young blood's character develop. Scott Westerfeld portrayed her very well. She is not some shiny wonderful hero. She is real with real mistakes and bad decisions, she feels shame about what she does and tries not to conceal her mistakes. Despite all the harm she causes she has the strength of character to try and make amends of her errors.The book touches on the issues of friendship, betrayal, love, beauty, self image, bravery, environmental impact of humans, the nature of humans, evolution, being manipulated by society and much more. I think that this book is a great, thought provoking read with lots of action. I would highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"UgliesWow this book was really amazing.

Scott Westerfield gets two thumbs up from me!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After finishing 425 pages that I couldn't put down, I'm finding myself needing to buy the next in the series as soon as possible. No wonder editors are getting copy-cat novels similar to this from aspiring writers.Uglies tells the story of a post-apocalyptic dystopia where everyone gets a surgery at age 16 to make them \\"pretty\\" with a perfect body, perfect face, and diminished personality. This surgery is supposed to prevent people from having an unfair advantage in the workplace because of the way they look and to prevent conflicts because of the color of people's skin. And when you become a \\"pretty\\" there's nothing but party after party every night. However, from the age of 12-15, you have to move to Ugly Town to live with all the other \\"uglies\\" until your operation. However, over the years, many of the uglies have escaped beyond the city to live off the land rather than to become a pretty.The author has created a different world with different rules. The city has a grid up metal under it which magnetic hoverboards and hovercrafts use to zip around the city. People look different and have different initiation rites for growing older.One of the characters spends a great deal of time following a riddle another ugly has left behind for her to get from the city to the secret world of the uglies who refused to turn pretty. These uglies have created a place called The Smoke where they have attempted to keep vestiges of the past alive with a library of books and magazines from the time before everyone's eventual fate was to become a pretty.If the other books in this series are as good as the first, I know what I'm going to be spending too much money on in the next few days or weeks"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Wow. I read this book and LOVED it. It starts out kind of slow, but gets a lot better. Once it does get better it's like high-speed drama without being tacky. I couldn't put it down. I mean how could anyone when Tally has a choice--betray your best friend, Shay and turn supermodel gorgeous, don't betray her and stay ugly for life--, Shay has a dream--to escape the pretty-making operation-- and the whole world has an awful secret. It deals with a dystopia that is so terrifying, mixed up with environmental messages and with startling specks of romance and friendship. Not to mention the detail (and the imagination) of the ugly/pretty/smoke world. David is so cool. I like sci-fi but this book made me like it 1,000 times more. I cannot wait to readPretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)!!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Scott Westerfeld's Uglies presents an intriguing view of a futuristic society; a society filled with such inventive devices as hoverboards, toothbrush pills, and interface rings. In this society, beauty is thought to be of the highest value, and behavior is carefully controlled. At the age of sixteen, residents of this city undergo an operation that transforms them from an \\"ugly\\" into a new \\"pretty.\\" Children are taught to believe that there is only one type of beauty--the kind that is decided on and regulated by the government. Thus, they all look forward to the day when they too can turn pretty and live a carefree life of frivolity.Tally Youngblood is just such an ugly. She is approaching her sixteenth birthday, and she can't wait. Her best friend Peris has already turned pretty, and she is left alone as she awaits the day she will turn sixteen. Enter Shay, another Ugly approaching the fateful sixteenth birthday. Shay is a somewhat rebellious youth, who doesn't share the same views as Tally about the supposed joys of becoming pretty. As they become friends, Shay begins to express her opinions about the city and the operation. Shay feels that the operation is wrong; that people shouldn't be forced to all look the same. She believes that people should be appreciated for who they are. Tally can't quite comprehend Shay's point of view, but she doesn't think much about it until Shay declares her intention to run away to the Smoke, a small settlement outside of the cities where people choose to stay \\"ugly\\" rather than conform to the \\"ideal\\" standards of the city. Shay invites Tally to join her, but Tally is unable to give up her life-long wish of becoming pretty, and chooses to stay. However, on her sixteenth birthday, Tally is taken to Special Circumstances, an intimidating governmental force designed to keep the cities under control. Special Circumstances informs Tally that unless she follows Shay to the Smoke and reveals its location, she will be forced to remain ugly all her life. Although Tally feels terrible about the idea of betraying her friend, in the end she agrees to find the Smoke. What follows for Tally is a daring journey, new friends, a new way of life which presents an alternate way of thinking, a disturbing discovery about the true nature of the operation, and a life-altering decision.I gave this book four stars out of five because I found it to be intriguing and thought-provoking, although it can't quite compare to the greatness of other dystopic novels such as The Giver, 1984, and Anthem. However, it was a very enjoyable read. I found it an interesting twist to have the concept of beauty being the main force behind the success of the society. I think the message this book can send to readers is the danger of placing too much importance on physical appearance, and the value of having a society where everyone is unique. What I really liked about this book was the way that Tally was able to grow and change throughout the novel. In the beginning, I actually found her a bit annoying--she was so focused on how great it was going to be to be \\"pretty\\" that she couldn't see the sense in what Shay was telling her. I liked Shay's character better at the start of the book, but as Tally grew and came to understand what it really meant to be \\"pretty,\\" and began to see that beauty could be found even in imperfect features, my respect for her grew. In the end, she was really able to prove herself and show that she was willing to fight and to sacrifice for what she believed to be right, making her a character that I and other young adult readers can truly admire. I think this is a great novel for young adults. It was able to present intriguing ethical issues in a suspenseful plot. It kept me interested, and was very well written. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"However, this was a fabulous book. It really makes you want to keep reading.

Tally is a Uglie and she is forced through the course of the book to decide to go with the flow (become a Prettie) or take another path and become a Smokie. The book is full of the meanings of self discovery and the paths we choose. It takes place in a future very advanced, hoverboards, hovercars, operations to completly change you and heal to perfection within a weeks time, turning people into the ideal citizen, tracking your every movement down to the number of breaths you take.

The Uglies is ten times worse because the issues and characters are incessantly annoying and juvenile. Many people who read this book, just end up with the urge to yell at the characters and tell them to get over their looks. It is really only another shallow book for teenage girls. When you step back and look at bad teen books as a whole, you realize that they are all the same book, repeated over and over again with different names and varying settings. Don't read too many these books, it gets boring and repetitive."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Ok, I am an avid book reader, but I have to admit, I was not impressed with this book.

This book is a sort of satire like 1984 or Brave New World looking at a future society as a means of commenting on the present. Its odd because both 1984 and Brave New World were important books by two writers with a lot of runs on the board in terms of their literary careers. Both were important books in shaping the attitudes of the times in which they were written. One would have thought that it would be rather hard to do. However Scott Westerfield seems to have done it in an effortless way.The thing is of course to make a book about a future world is not something that in itself is going to get anyone to read it. There has to be some plot to generate some interest. In this case the author has had to keep children interested. The plot of this book involves a young girl who is raised in a future society and involves her just before a coming of age ceremony which will affect what she will later become. Some things happen to her which lead her to discover some disquieting things about what her future may hold.On a superficial level the book involved the adventures of the heroine Tally as she has to travel away from her city through an abandoned wilderness. The first message of the book is something of a dig at our societies and their unsustainability due to their use of fossil fuels. As Tally travels on her solar powered skate board she passes over the ruins of an old oil based civilization known to her people as the rusties. She lives in a self sustaining city which minimizes the use of minerals such as iron.As the book goes on the adventures continue and as a background to them there is a discussion of other things of significance to young people. The importance of physical beauty as compared to other things. The ways of dealing with conflict in society and how to balance individual liberty compared to the greater good.I found the book easy to read (well no surprise it is a children's book). However it is amazing the sorts of things they have in children's books nowdays. In my youth such books were generally escapist adventures which would touch on some children's issues. The ideas of not knowing one's place or how to deal with the world. The ideas of growing up and some notions of loyalty. However no one ever did real issues. No wonder children are so much smarter nowdays."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Are you looking for a riveting novel with a lot of adventure? Well Uglies by Scott Westerfeld is the perfect one. This story is about a girl named Tally who is excited for her 16th birthday. In her world, a 16th birthday lets you get an operation that turns you pretty. But before the operation, the authorities force Tally to spy on runaways who didn't want to turn pretty in a new city so that they could find out more about it and its people. One of those runaways is Tally's friend, Shay. Tally must choose between the trust between their friendship or the operation.I liked this book because it contained contents just right for pre-teens like me, it wasn't too babyish, and it was easy to understand. This book is for 10 year olds or even older who like fiction that has some unrealistic elements in it. When you read this novel, you should be able to find this book as interesting as I did."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Have you ever wanted to be supermodel gorgeous? Well, in Tally Youngblood's world you get to when you turn sixteen. You also cross a river from Ugliville to a high tech place called New Pretty Town where the only rule is to have a really great time. If you don't believe me, read Uglies by Scott Westerfield.Uglies is a book about a young girl named Tally Youngblood. She was born and raised in Crumblyville with her parents, Ellie and Sol as a littlie. When she turned twelve, she moved into a dormitory in Ugliville. Ugliville is where all the littlies go when they become ugly, or when they turn twelve. Now Tally is about to turn sixteen and she is anxious to become pretty. So Tally goes to New Pretty Town to visit her friend Peris, who had already turned pretty. After a short pig mask incident, talk with Peris, and bungee- jacket affair, Tally is forced to leave. On her way back to Uglyville, Tally meets Shay. Shay is an ugly like Tally and Shay was born on the same day as Tally. But Shay is not sure she wants to turn pretty. She would rather risk life on the outside. So when Shay runs away to a place called The Smoke, where all the people who don't want to turn pretty go, Tally is given a risky choice; she can find Shay and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. She also learns something about being pretty, and it is not very pretty.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a suspenseful and exciting read. They should be over the age of eleven though, because this book has mild language. Any gender would like this book even though it is about a girl. And if anyone has read Meg Cabot's book How to be Popular, they should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am 37 years old and found this book to be a great read. Not only does the action keep you turning the pages but the subject itself sometimes seems a little too possible.I am awaiting the next book in the trilogy... To following Tally's life."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I picked this up because of the sample provided here, and the raving reviews given by others. The idea of a world where everyone turns 'pretty', holds so much potential in our current society.But this idea falls flat. There was no connection to the characters. They may have been well fleshed out, but I didn't care whether or not they stayed ugly, became pretty, or fell off a cliff. Also, why would anyone not want to become pretty? The author wrote up a utopia where people all had self esteem (no problems of anorexia, and etc.), where society had connected to nature and didn't destroy it, where there was no poverty, starvation, and no wars.Sure, they may all have been vapid, but it was not convincing enough that it was better to be an individual, instead of accepting all the positive changes that this new society had implemented. The author wrote too perfect a utopia to convince the reader that it needed to be broken.The selling point to this novel is the idea. The idea of making everyone look the same, not just pretty, the technological ideas of the hoverboards and anti-gravity suits, the idea of the old society, our present society, failing, being too dependent on oil, destroying nature, making way for this well-constructed new one, where everyone is in tune with nature, and have no need to wage war on each other."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've been reading this book to my seventh graders for read aloud. I hear moans and groans when time's up for reading, and they always beg me to read more. Of course, the writing provides great opportunities for cliff hangers. Students often enjoy books I read to them, but I've never had such a strong reaction before. Students are pleading with their parents to buy them the book and the sequels, and actually going to the public library on their own to check out copies. If you teach students who don't like to read, you must invest in a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I had to read Uglies as a part of a reading elective for school. Students submitted their favorite books and this was one of them. How, I'm not quite sure. Let the rant begin:*The charactersI couldn't stand the characters. Tally, the protagonist, came across as so whiny it was unbearable. Every page she was saying, \\"I'm so ugly! I can't wait until I'm sixteen and finally a pretty! My life will be complete!\\" The constant repetition of this thought was so obnoxious is was nauseating. I have never in all the books I've read hated a character as much as I hate Tally. She was so superficial. Nearly every thought revolved around how \\"ugly\\" she was. At first I thought Shay, Tally's friend that is opposed to the whole idea of being pretty, would be a redeeming element in the book, but she failed miserably. I found her views more obnoxious and condescending than insightful and worth considering. I don't blame Tally for disagreeing with Shay - she came off as a know-it-all and a person who needs to be taken down a peg. I'm worried for humanity if they are identifying with these characters and find them at all sympathetic. Shay and Tally's friendship is so typical and overdone: One is striving for beauty and perfection, while the other is against it, claiming that it is unnatural. A countless number of relationships have been based on something at least similar to this idea. Granted, almost everything has been redone by now, but there was no originality in their relationship.*The settingThe \\"uglies\\" and the \\"pretties\\" live separately. The uglies live in a place called \\"Uglyville\\". The pretties live in a place called \\"New Pretty Town\\". Really. I am not kidding. These are the worst names for locations I have ever heard. A toddler could have come up with more original names than that.*The plotI did not find the plot compelling in the slightest. The gist of it is, \\"Will Tally turn into a pretty, or will she stay ugly?\\" That was it. That's all it leads to. I enjoy science fiction if it's done well, so it's not that the plot was too \\"out there\\" (because honestly, it wasn't. Most kids thought up the idea of living in a pretty people world in grade school.), it was just so dumb. I don't understand how the idea of whether or not a girl will be cosmetically beautiful can be interesting to even the most facile of people. I can't even say, \\"Well, it had potential. If it had been executed better, it would have been a good read.\\" No. Nothing, in my opinion, could have saved this horrendous excuse of a plot.*The cheesy dialogueI am all for cheesiness. I love it, even look forward to it, but this was just bad. When Tally first meets Shay she says something along the lines of, \\"Yay! Now we can turn pretty together! We'll be best friends and never have to part!\\" Keep in mind this isn't an exact quote (I'm not going to waste my time and energy to borrow/buy this book to find this horrendous quote.) This sounded like something a five year old on the first day of kindergarten would say, not the words of a fifteen year old girl. This is the only instance where it really bothered me, but the dialogue was terrible. It was trite and forced.*The poor editingI understand that in first edition books especially (the copy I read was first edition), there are going to be grammatical errors, but this was bad on a whole other level. Some of the mistakes were so blatant (How hard is it to get subject-verb agreement correct?), I can't fathom how they could have been missed. In addition to the subject-verb disagreements, there were multiple misplaced commas. I don't expect an author to have perfect grammar, however I do expect them to have a basic understanding of the language they're writing in. In defense of the author, an editor is supposed to be editing their work, so I don't completely blame him for the lack of editing. Still, I don't understand how between the author, editor, author's agent, and the readers of the Advanced Reader Copy, these were not noticed and/or fixed.Needless to say, I hated this book - a rare thing for me. How it ever got published is beyond me."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've only seen one episode of The Twilight Zone. In this episode, a woman undergoes a battery of surgeries to look normal. At the end of the episode, viewers learn that this latest surgery has failed: the woman is still hideous. Except that to the audience she is beautiful. Online research led me to another episode where teenagers are surgically altered to live longer and conform to a unified standard of beauty (based on a limited number of acceptable \\"models\\"). \\"Uglies,\\" Scott Westerfeld's dystopic novel, plays similar games of perception.The novel starts with Tally Youngblood a fifteen-year-old girl desperately waiting for her sixteenth birthday when she will be reunited with her best friend and, more importantly, when she will finally be pretty.\\"Uglies\\" is set in the distant future after a mysterious global catastrophe precipitated changes to the foundations of what readers would call modern society. Fearful of war and violence cities now operate as independent states (think Renaissance Italy as opposed to contemporary Italy). Isolated and self-sufficient, the cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good.New technology ensures that citizens never want for food or luxury items, weapons of any kind are largely illegal, and at the age of sixteen everyone undergoes a series of extreme surgeries to better conform to societal standards of beauty. The logic being that, since humans are preconditioned to respond to certain visual cues in each other already (big eyes are non-threatening, a clear complexion and good teeth indicate that a person is healthy), applying these beauty standards will reduce conflict and create a more harmonious society.But in a world where everyone is movie-star-gorgeous (oldies like Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo are considered \\"natural pretties\\"), normal people are so not pretty. In short, they're ugly.Things change for Tally when she meets Shay, another Ugly girl, who wants to run away before the operation to a place called The Smoke where people can live like \\"Rusties\\" (that would be us basically) in the wilderness without any surgery. As the novel progresses, and Special Circumstances (a government agency) coerces Tally into finding The Smoke for them, Tally is forced to choose what means more: friendship or beauty?As the plot might suggest, this is a science fiction novel. Just to be clear, the real difference between sci-fi and fantasy is that the technology in science fiction novels could conceivably work if someone ever built it (dragons, most likely, are never going to be genetically engineered so they're a good indicator of a fantasy novel). At times this leads to more explanation of, say, hoverboard mechanics in the novel than is strictly necessary to the plot but the rest of the book makes up for this small shortcoming.What makes \\"Uglies\\" great, besides how it looks at cultural values, is Westerfeld's use of language. The novel is not pretentious or brash. Instead, Westerfeld creates a narrative voice that is really unique--especially for a sweeping sci-fi saga like the Uglies trilogy. The novel opens with Tally observing that \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" That is not, it is fair to say, a typical opening for any novel. Yet Westerfeld moves from that observation seamlessly into the story.This book is the first in the Uglies trilogy (followed by \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Specials\\") which focuses on Tally and her city. The scope of each book can largely stand alone, but to get the full story it's best to read the entire trilogy. Additionally, Westerfeld released a companion book to the trilogy last year called \\"Extras\\" which is set a few years after the trilogy with different main characters.\\"Uglies\\" is simultaneously funny and frightening, showing how overvalued beauty can be while illustrating how Tally's world has been conditioned to believe there's no other way to live. The sections where Westerfeld describes the Rusty Ruins and the end of that era are particularly haunting (and eerily reminiscent of the History Channel's recent documentary \\"Life After People\\").Sci-fi book discussions often bring up a writer's \\"world building\\" in reference to how well a writer creates their alternate universe. Westerfeld's world is built really well. The cities have their own culture, the characters their own slang, but Westerfeld manages to bring in enough references to our own contemporary culture that it's easy for readers to believe Tally's world is built on the ruins of our own."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I first read this book I thought it was good but I didn't expect it to be as good as when I was half way through it.

Is it possible that there are actually people that don't want to turn pretty? Tally's dreams and wishes suddenly disappear, as she uncovers a secret--that she doesn't want to know. A secret that could ruin tally's world. Her whole life she has waited for the operation to pretty-hood. Every day spent performing pointless tricks and dumb pastimes, waiting for the hover car to pick her up and carry her to the other side of the river.In this book, Scott Westerfeld unleashes a magical land where growing up, may mean changing more than your age, and finding friendship may mean battling difference. Uglies is a fascinating science-fiction novel that explains the difference between what you know, and what you don't. could it hurt you? Read this book to find out.When I read Uglies, I found that not only was I pushed into Tally's world, I was also pushed into believing that I too, could ride hover boards (skateboards that float on air) and trick thousands of \`specials' (pretties who know dark secrets). Scott Westerfled held me all the way to the end of this sci-fi novel, and although I am usually a realistic-fiction person, I have already reserved the second book of the Uglies' trilogy, Pretties, and have it on-hold at the library.Scott's voice is very significant, and though at some parts of the story you are wondering \\"where is he going with this?\\" it eventually all evens out, and Tally's missions seem more real than just words on paper. I loved this book, and I couldn't have asked for more adventure, tragedy, and surprise as this page-turner.

The way Westerfeld approaches the society that Tally and Shay live in is new and well awaited. The best part about this book is how Westerfeld sets up situations and adventures for Tally and Shay. The struggles are not like anything that teens can relate to DIRECTLY but there are moments where I felt empathy for the characters and their situations. This is one of the best books that I have EVER read.The way Westerfeld tries to put a spin on how teens live their lives is amazing. His creativity and tendency towards the dramatic leaves the reader wanting MORE!!! I cannot WAIT to read the sequels to this and see what happens to Tally and Shay in their High-Tech world!!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"On a trip this week I finally read a book that has intrigued me ever since I first hear about it: Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. Uglies is about a girl named Tally, who lives in a future society in which everyone undergoes extensive plastic surgery at 16. The idea is to remove the conflicts and unfairnesses associated with differing levels of beauty, by bringing everyone up to some pre-defined standard. Tally, to her frustration, remains a pre-surgery Ugly, while her slightly older friends have moved on to the post-surgery world of Pretties.The young Uglies are second-class citizens, living in dorms isolated from everyone else, constantly aware of their own imperfections and inadequacies. They run around playing \\"tricks\\" to blow off steam, but everything that they do is just marking time until they can become pretty.In the course of one of her escapades, Tally meets up with Shay, another Ugly who shares Tally's birthday. The two girls become friends, and Tally learns of Shay's ambivalence regarding the upcoming operation. This ambivalence leads both girls into an adventure, in which they meet new people, test their own limits, and confront unexpected ideas.I found the premise underlying the story fascinating. I've always had a fondness for books the explore post-apocalyptic future societies. In that context, Uglies reminded me of John Christopher's Tripods Trilogy (one of my favorite series as a young adult), Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher's Fire-us Trilogy, and Jeanne Duprau's Ember Books, all of which feature kids making their way in a world that bears only remnants of our own society. In Uglies, however, the new society that has formed includes high-tech toys, environmental awareness, glistening towers, and beautiful people. The book is a fascinating look at our concepts of beauty, and how our looks affect what we think of ourselves and others.The other thing that made Uglies stand out for me (besides the storyline itself, which would have kept me reading anyway) was the voice of Tally. Her voice is strong and engaging. She longs for the beauty that any teen would want, especially any teen growing up in her world. Over the course of the book she makes mistakes, but anguishes over them, and finds her own bravery. She feels real.Uglies is one of those books that left me wanting more. Fortunately, it's the first book in a trilogy. As soon I got home from my trip yesterday, I went out to the bookstore to buy the second book: Pretties. I'll be reading that one on next week's trip. Overall, I highly recommend Uglies. I think that it's a must-read for anyone interested in young adult literature, or anyone who likes to ponder \\"what-if\\" sorts of questions.

Throughout this fiction book, I was mesmerized by the detail and creativity that the author put into this novel. Tally Youngblood takes a chance at betraying her friends, but learns a lesson on the way that might change her decision. I thought that this novel might shed some light on what everyone thinks \\"pretty\\" is considered and what it can really mean. I guess it depends on everyone's opinions, but this book sure makes me think about it.I recommend this novel to everyone who loves to use their imagination and go on adventures.

And I was heartbroken. Heartbroken that the book had ended, that I didn't have the second book. The colorful words and suspensful scenes were highlighted by the smaller details, but even the details were amazing. Every sentence could have won a Newbery Honor. Written in third person, it tells the tale of Tally Youngblood, an 'ugly' who is about to turn sixteen. At sixteen, everyone gets an operation that turns you into a stunningly beautiful being. Tally can't wait for the operation, but when she sneaks into New Pretty town, she meets someone who will change her life -- Shay. Shay is an independent thinker and tries to convince Tally that the operation is wrong; Tally just thinks Shay is crazy. But soon enough, Shay runs to a place called the Smoke, a hidden community for other independant thinkers who want to stay ugly for life. Special Circumstances (a bunch of underground buildings with workers designed to handle out-of-the-ordinary situations) has been trying to find the Smoke for years, and when they find out that Shay is missing, they pull Tally from her pretty operation on her sixteenth birthday. They threaten to keep her as an ugly forever if she doesn't find Shay and the Smoke. Tally agrees to betray her friend and makes the hard journey to the Smoke, but once she's there, she can't bring herself to tattle. Tally decides to stay ugly with her friends at the Smoke... until Special Circumstances arrives a month later and destroys her home.

The truth in this book is powerful enough to change the way you think. The truth in this book is powerful enough to destroy lives. In a government controlled society where everyone thinks the same way, the truth will only cause problems and division. I mentioned faith to describe one of the elements in this story, but it is not a Godly faith. However, it takes faith to bring justice and restoration in a world that is hurting.Tally lives in a world where rooms talk; brushing teeth comes in a pill; communication takes place through pings; one can get in trouble for forgetting the government issued ring, skipping classes, or tricking the house into playing one's music louder than usual. When you turn 16, you get a procedure classified as becoming Pretty. Tally CAN'T WAIT to turn 16. Being pretty means freedom, being pretty means no curfew, being pretty means having fun all the time, being pretty means a new acceptance into society. Being pretty means having an extreme makeover that not only affects your looks, but it also cures bad habits like chewing your nails and repairs any scars you have. And if your friends turn 16 before you do, then you can no longer be around that friend until you also turn 16. Everyone's identity rests in being pretty and life is better for those who get the procedure.Peris is Tally's best friend, but he turns pretty a few months before Tally does and their friendship is put on hold with the expectation that she will soon follow and life will be better for both of them. But then Tally meets Shay one night and their friendship brings changes Tally wasn't expecting. Shay introduces Tally to The Ruins and what entails both terrifies and obligates Tally to change her original plans. The reader will also meet Dr. Cable who is an important character in this story. This book will teach you the difference between Uglies, Pretties, and Specials who work for Special Circumstances.It's all from Tally's perspective and I'm amazed by the perspective she has throughout the story. Her loyalty is unmatched and I believe that Peris doesn't deserve her friendship once he turns Pretty. She's a quick learner and she considers carefully every decision before making a move. Even though sometimes her actions seem reckless and she is constantly taking risks, there is purpose to everything she does. There is violence in the story, but it makes for a page turner. Only one use of the word hell was the only profanity I found. Tally kisses one boy in the story, but it's nothing sexual. The book is divided into 3 parts. I also want to point out that this is the second time I've read this story and I enjoyed just as much as the first time. I loved Tally's heart in this story and how her story gets more and more involved. This is the 2005 version of the book with the original cover art, for ages 12 and up, I got it from the library. Honestly, I DO NOT like the new covers for this book. I believe the original covers captured the story well enough, but I guess someone felt the need to update them.I highly recommend Uglies as a clean YA adventure for teens. It's not only entertaining, but also gives valuable lessons about one's identity, issues such as anorexia and bulimia, celebrities, acceptance and loyalty. Being loyal will cost you everything so be ready to do what's right even if you stand alone while doing it.The last line of this book has the reader intrigued to read the sequel immediately, but this story does well as a stand alone. Some of the questions I have for the next book are:When Tally becomes Pretty, will she be alone?How will she change mentally?Will she remember anything from before?Will she remember her friends?What will happen between her and Shay?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Didn't expect to like it but I did!

It is an easy read, by way of its well-crafted simplicity, but does not follow the hero or technology-as-man's-savior formulae. In these ways this story varies from the two sci-fi extremes of \\"pulp\\" and whatever you want to call the more elitist brands of science fiction.An active read, with \\"tricks\\" pulled against the post-operative \\"Pretties\\" consuming a good deal of the book, the real treasure is found in the book's very direct social criticism. The brains vs. beauty arguments that are constantly in the view of America's public have been vicious in the past, particularly when dealing with bulimia, anorexia, and sexism. Westerfeld addresses, not these issues, but the society that spawns and lives both sides of the argument in question. Frankly, Westerfeld has written the best social commentary effected in science fiction of the decade. Considering that social commentary was one of the first uses, and has remained the predominant use for science fiction, this is an admirable achievement.Westerfeld's first, predominant, and most obvious criticism is directed towards the social machine supporting the concept that the beauty of the human body is a necessity for success in life. He demonstrates through exaggeration the influence this idea wields from kindergarten to the retirement home. Though exaggerated, the system used by the authoritarian power structure in his book closely parallels the current social indoctrination that occurs from the first time a girl in kindergarten thinks her shoes aren't as nice as those worn by other girls in her class, through the high-schooler who is sure his girl-friend left him because his muscles were too small or his nose was too big, to the retirees whispering that the makeup their acquaintance is being buried in is not so nice as their friend's from the funeral two months ago. These things happen. We are pressed together, forced to dress alike at work, to behave alike by teachers in high-school, to respond to thoughtfully farcical questions alike in college or university, to retire at the same age, to yearn for the same cars, picket fences, and portfolios as everyone else. In Westerfeld's book, legally mandated, and near universally desired, surgery makes this pressure almost entirely successful, at the expense of the creativity and richness of life that diversity, imagination, and psychological freedom engender.The second criticism comes near the end of the book. This critical lance is directed at many of the reactionaries who attempt to combat the societal tendency to press for physical beauty to the detriment of society at large. As Westerfeld's plot reveals a potential cure for the lesions formed on the brain during the beautifying surgery mandated by the city-state's government, a \\"Pretty\\" flatly refuses the potentially healing medication. Westerfeld's point to the mind over body reactionaries is sharp, indeed. You cannot, by force, fight this social pressure to follow societal templates or you will, in the end, be just as guilty of psychological hijacking as the social machine you denounce. The ends, he infers, do not justify the means. Questions remain unanswered, and the book ends abruptly, as, in one long-chaptered entry into his world, Westerfeld shows us that there are more than two sides to every argument."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This story is about a girl named Tally and her new friend Shay.

But as I'm writing this review, I realize that the characters had no special attributes that set them apart. They were flat. Besides how Shay and Tally's views differed, they were all basically the same. They all talked the same and acted the same pretty much. I think it could've been a lot better if they each had their own individual qualities (Tally, Shay, David, Croy, Maddy, Az).I also think it would've made the book a LOT more interesting if they talked more about how the world changed and why, and when they passed Rusty cities, it would've been cool if the author had David know what the cities were called. For example, the Rusty Ruins could have been a part of New York?

I nearly inhaled this fast-paced story, and could never have hoped to put it down before I finished it.The premise may have been done before, but Scott Westerfeld breaths new life into the idea, and markets it to the fertile minds of Young Adults who can use it.Tally lives in a gorgeously complex dystopia, set in a future that seems all to far off and yet at the same time all to near, that appears very simple up front. 'At the age of 16, you get a surgery to become beautiful', what could possibly be wrong with that? Everything.

The world in which all the \\"uglies\\" and \\"pretties\\" live is very well developed, with original details, innovations, and flaws. The writing is effortless and I enjoyed the characters.

Do we really base such a large amount of our opinions of looks? Do we really cut down trees for useless things? Do we really encourage wars over material objects? With a futuristic spin that leaves you wondering more about the way we might live in the future, Uglies is a book that is refreshing and a good read.It is similar to the book Exodus, as it points out flaws in the way we live now and what effects it might have in the future. It takes a while to get used to the enviroment that the book portrays, but you soon get used to it.

What I enjoyed most about this work is I had no idea where it was going to go; I just let the story take me there. I liked that I wasn't sure where it took place, or when; what had happened to the world ('the panic') to make things this way; and, really, what the rest of the world was like. Somehow, Westerfeld was able to pull things off without too much backstory, which left the plot to rocket forward. I also liked that while this book is probably categorized as 'dystopian', it's really it's own twisted version of 'utopian,' which is very tricky to pull off. Now, it's hard for me to read things nowadays without comparing them to 'The Hunger Games,' so I have to say what was more troublesome for me about 'Uglies' was the skill of the writing was solid but not on a par with L'Engle or Le Guin, and the slang was a little difficult to get used to. But on a whole I thought it was sharply done and look forward to reading the next one."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Reads fast, carries a message without beating the reader over the head, and pushes the imagination out in all directions.

This book is set in the future in a tightly controlled city where the youth population is eager to receive their surgery that makes an individual symmetrical and beautiful. This surgery serves as a way to control the whole adult population in an effort to make them docile and compromising. Our heroine Tally must readjust all of her values when her friend Shay escapes from the city to the secret \\"smoke\\" village. Tally is given a tough choice, help the \\"specials\\" (government agents) track down Shay and the Smoke or never receive her surgery that she has been wanting forever. This is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy. The 2nd and 3rd are just as riveting and action packed as the first.

When Tally's best friend Peris reaches the age of sixteen and undergoes the pretty operation before Tally, she feels as if she has been left alone in the world.

It has plenty of great characters and is a real page-turner, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. The best aspect of this story, though, is the haunting truth underneath underneath all the prettiness and technology of its future world. It really makes you question what humanity has become, but at the same time wonder if a \\"perfect\\" world would really be so perfect after all.

Another good book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The PlotMeet Tally, an almost-16-year-old Ugly. Yes, Ugly. In Tally's world, people are considered Ugly until they become Pretty. And they become Pretty on their 16th birthday. How do they become Pretty, you ask? Via an operation, of course. This operation allows everyone to conform to to the ideal standard of beauty in order to keep the population on equal terms. When someone becomes a Pretty, they are shipped out of Uglyville into New Pretty Town, where they party the night away and have no responsibilities. Sounds like an ideal world, no? Wrong. Underneath all the glam and beauty lies a secret. Because we all know you don't get something for nothing...Tally accidentally meets Shay, another ugly whose 16th birthday is also right around the corner. Shay doesn't really see any problem with staying Ugly. She voices these opinions to Tally who is horrified at such a thought. Shay urges Tally to come to the outskirts of their world to the Rusties' ruins. Yes, they refer to former civilizations as Rusties due to the corroded cars and broken down buildings. They find such waste atrocious. At the ruins, Shay lets on she knows someone on the outskirts, someone who isn't part of their civilization, someone who doesn't believe in being Pretty just for the sake of fitting into society. In fact, there is entire village of people, living in a place called The Smoke...Shay makes a run for it. Unfortunately for Tally, she gets noticed by Special Circumstances, who knows of her connection with Shay and the Smokies. Special Circumstances demands that she assist them in finding the Smoke. Their ultimatum: Help us or remain Ugly forever.Will Tally betray the Smoke in order to become Pretty, or will she realize that all that glitters is not gold?The ReviewI love books with satirical themes. It is very obvious that this book brings to light the ridiculous nature of our society. We are so over the top about what beauty is, and so many young people struggle with looking like a Victoria's Secret model or David Beckham, when chances of looking like that are 1 in a mil. Young girls starve themselves and young boys become attracted to mostly model-types. We've forgotten what really makes someone beautiful. I also love the intense environmental destruction theme in the book, which is most definitely a call to how we're treating Planet Earth.I loved the riddled directions to the Smoke that Shay gave Tally. She had to decipher the meaning and it turned into a great adventure. I also think Tally grew up a lot during that very long, lonely and dangerous trek to a new society. Once she arrives at the Smoke, no longer do you see the self-centered, materialistic, naive young girl. Instead, a mature young lady has emerged, one who realizes there is more to life then just herself.I really loved reading about this future society. Their technology far surpasses ours. They have a metal grid running under the city so they can use hovercars and hoverboards. Hoverboards FTW!! Where can I get one? They also have something called a bungee jacket, which we get to read about in action more than once.David = AwesomesauceDystopian fiction is the best. Seriously. I do love it so.I look forward to the next in the series, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Recently, I finished a book called \\"Uglies by\\" Scott Westerfeld. It's about a girl who lives in a world when you're 16, you turn pretty. But when you're not extremely pretty, you're considered ugly. All of the Uglies can't wait until they turn 16, and have a happy, pretty life. Well at least, most of the Uglies... Some of the Uglies know what actually happens when they turn you Pretty... what they do to your brain. This book is exciting and very eye-catching. Once you start to read, you can't stop! I really liked this book because of the interesting and exciting ideas. For example, the story was supposed to take place in the future. It has cool inventions, like things called hover board (which is a board that hovers.) The cool thing is that if we tried to build these things it would probably work. His realistic ideas make the story so hard not to believe. Also, it didn't have one boring part in it, and it really gave you deep questions.This book is in a series. The other books in the series are; \\"Pretties\\" \\"Specials\\" and \\"Extras\\" I recommend this book to people who are in middle school, and up. Scott Westerfeld has written adult novels before so he has a sophisticated style of writing.In conclusion, I give \\"Uglies\\" a five star rating. It is a wonderful book and I hope you consider reading \\"Uglies.\\" I assure you that you will enjoy it. I know I did!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a little torn about this book being written for a YA audience: it either made it amazing because it didn't overwhelm readers with too much world building and typical scifi junk, or it dumbed down an interesting and original storyline to where it suffered from lack of development.Regardless - fantastic novel. If you can get back the teenage girl telling us the story and deal with words like \\"bubbly\\" and \\"bogus,\\" then it's an excellent novel. It is easy to see why so many adult readers like myself fell for this book. It's fascinating!Tally is an interesting character. She's always asking questions, always trying to do the right thing, always trying to make someone else happy. She thinks she knows what she wants, but gasp! shock! she doesn't, because she's a 16 year old girl. It makes the brain washing done to the uglies and littlies seem less real, less damaging. Like I said: the YA either saved the book from being an explosion of word vomit or shackled it to the constraints of a genre written for angsty teens.The world building is left slack a bit in this installment, but it does pick up a bit more in the second book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a great read, way better than my expectations.

Not deep and meaningful but excellent entertainment!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Definitely an easy read, but throroughly enjoyable at the same time. While the plot itself is decently predictable the premise is something that makes the reader think.Tally Youngblood lives in what is today's postapacalyptic world. Her world is self sustaining and anything that you want is available from the her wall (basically an advanced version of touch screen computers). In this futuristic world everyone starts out as an Ugly (how you're naturally born) and then at 16 you are surgically turned into a pretty, to make everyone more or less the same.What I found to be most thought provoking though (SPOILER) the (not particularly surprising) discovery, that not only did the surgery make someone pretty, but it also changed who they were, to make them more docile and agreeable creatures. While this is not portrayed as a positive thing, it made me wonder which exactly was a better way of life. The Rusties (us) destroyed themselves with anger, jealousy, wars, discrimination and all of our modern technology. In Tally's world your personality is made a little bit duller and shallower, but there is a noticable lack of people destroying each other, and themselves.I will say that it was intriguing enough to make me want to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first two chapters did what every good book should do, sucked me right in. I loved the dystopian idea of uglies and pretties and all the strife in-between. Such a gold mine for self-examination and real beauty (although my 12 year old daughter just wanted to see them all turn pretty). Westerfeld's creative world is inventive, easy to visualize and just plain fun.But after Tally, the main character, meets Shay, the plot unfolded somewhat slow. I'm a bit of an impatient reader so that's not likely to be other readers' impression. I was disappointed by a whole chapter of hoverboard training that just as easily could've been integrated into the plot. Tell me how stuff works while you're doing something, just like the first couple of chapters. The many journeys were, again, creative and fun but became tedious. There weren't a lot of unexpected turns in the plot which made for an easy read but not all that satisfying. And at times, I couldn't get a grip on the characters. Is Shay in love with Tally?I'd give it 3.5 stars, but nudged it to 4 because it's well written with some original content."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I picked up this book, it was not in the youth section. False advertising!!! I really felt there should have been some warning before I wasted half a day reading this. The writing is completely one-dimensional. This could've been an epic novel, but instead it is a predictable teen love story/clich&eacute;d action adventure. If you are an adult looking for a really insightful book, keep looking.

Lets just say I couldn't get into it. Some of the chapters were slow, ecspecially in the beginning when you first meet Tally. Overall it was not a bad read, but it could've been a little more interesting"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies, I had heard, was an absolutely awesome book. \\"You'll love it,\\" my friends said. Well, I'm not quite sure what book they were referring to, but it cannot have been the book I reluctantly trudged through only to decide to skip to the second book.Admittedly, I am a notorious anti-Sci-Fi person. I don't like it in books or on TV. But light Sci-Fi I can tolerate. And I've been known to become impatient with wonderful books and skip to the end first. I did that with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I got to about page 20, decided it was boring, and skipped to the Chamber of Secrets. Harry Potter still ranks as my favorite series ever. There has been books and trilogies and sequels and such I've liked more, but HP ranks as my top series.So, maybe my liking of fantasy and my dislike of science fiction justifies why I'm looking through these lists of praise of this book that was torture to read. Obviously, I stumbled upon the heavy-duty science fiction lovers' reviews. Can anyone direct me to the normal persons' reviews?From the moment that she meets Shay, I was filled with confusion about Tally's person. Throughout the book, I was disgusted with her, sorry for her, and apathetic towards her. Maybe some people enjoy that; I, however, do not. She doesn't stay constant. She starts out a rebellious ditz, but by the end she's a heroine? And, in between, no really life-changing experience MAKES her a heroine. Are we expected to assume that she had it in her all along, but it just came out in the end? In which case, why was she so RIDICULOUS at the start? It doesn't make sense. Maybe this is sci-fi, but if it is, I am disgusted not only with the book but with the whole genre.When I mentioned my disappointment in Uglies to my friend, she said, I didn't tell you to check it out. I read page one and hated it.This may be off the subject, but I like Pretties much better. I skipped a bit to the end, and thought it got worse, so maybe Scott Westerfeld just can't keep up a good book for long. Or maybe I just can't handle heavy sci-fi, and can only enjoy light-hearted romance and adventure, such as between Tally and Zane. I just read a review of Specials and am now not goint to read it, either. It seems like this series, though the whole lingo is light-hearted and all, is just too much heavy sci-fi for Fantasy and Historical Fiction lovers like me.And to romance lovers, I have to say, Tally's romance with David is too dry. There is no real connection or mutuality between them. She just flirts around the idea of going steady with him, then gets \\"distracted\\". That is another instance of her character, not changing or evolving, but just practically forgetting who she is and changing personas completely.To people who are wondering how Harry Potter and Twilight lovers would like this, I am one, and I cannot reccomend it. The only reason I can make myself give it a two is because I reserve ones for really terrible books, and Westerfeld isn't a terrible author, so that is something.If you're the kind of person who likes Darok 9 and such, read this. Otherwise, find something else. You won't find what you're looking for in Uglies."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies &iexcl;V Scott Westerfeld(Uglies Trilogy #1)I judged this book by its cover. The older one, that is. It just looked so wickedly awesome, that I thought, it must be a wonderful read! However, although I was right, the book was nothing like I thought it would be. The language of the future world was at times annoying, such as the term Uglies, Pretties, and yuck, Littlies. Or even worse, Rusties. Yet, the language slowly grew on me, and I accepted it. Perhaps it was just my &iexcl;Rusty&iexcl; (those from the past. You know, those of us who chop down trees and are hideously ugly?) ways getting the best of me. I should be open to new slang. After all &iexcl;cool&iexcl; loses its desired effect after some time. Bubbly is so much better; and that&iexcl;s what this book is, totally bubbly! In other words, it rocks and it really makes you think.In the society we inhabit now, looks are pretty much a major thing. Even if you don&iexcl;t want to admit it, there&iexcl;s been at least one time someone made you feel ugly. Or at least, not as pretty as you thought you were. Or maybe you just know you&iexcl;re ugly, because you&iexcl;re not as skinny as the girls on magazines or even the &iexcl;normal&iexcl; girls at school. You wear size 14 or even larger, your skin is bumpy, and you&iexcl;re eyebrows are uneven. After all, even proportions are important. In fact, most people in society we consider &iexcl;pretty&iexcl; or &iexcl;handsome&iexcl; are very well off symmetrically. (I learned that when I studied aesthetics in Philosophy! ) Scott Westerfeld acknowledges this fact, and its one of the main components of being a Pretty.The society in Uglies is almost unbelievable, but when you look at how much we focus on looks&iexcl;Keven airbrushing models and celebrities when they already appear perfect to us. Perfection is what most strive for. I currently struggle with self-image difficulties, and I can&iexcl;t name a single friend who can honestly say they are perfectly happy with how they look ALL THE TIME. Plastic surgery is a must for some, but what if it became a law? What if at the age of sixteen, you had to have a surgery or sorts to change your whole body, so you will be perfectly beautiful?The idea may seem a relief, but while you&iexcl;re waiting to become Pretty, you&iexcl;re stuck with other Uglies. You lose your friends who are older than you. Pretties don&iexcl;t associate with Uglies after all. Uglies are hideous freaks. If you&iexcl;re the kind of person who respects you&iexcl;re freedom of choice, you probably don&iexcl;t like this idea at all. Well, there are people like that in Uglies. Uglies who want to escape from surgery, who wish to live as Rusties did. That&iexcl;s where The Smoke comes in.Tally Youngblood is just about to turn pretty, when a friend of hers runs off to the secret community called The Smoke. It&iexcl;s where Uglies live together in a Rusty society; a way of life similar to our current one.

When I read the summary of the book, and looked up the reviews on here, I was really excited to start reading it. I love the concept behind it, but the author did a HORRIBLE job at expanding on it in an intelligent way. I literally felt like I was reading a book written BY a ten year old. The book is insanely repetitive (When Tally was trying to talk about of uglies and pretties and Shay kept incessantly saying she wanted to ride the hoverboard?? I felt like ripping my hair out, so annoying!!!) Honestly, I can't even begin to say how boring and repetitive this book was. I abide by the \\"50 page rule\\" and with this book I barely made it there. I even skipped ahead chapters to see if there was anything interesting, anything about the actual process of turning pretty.... any type of sci-fi futuristic parts, but nothing!!Also, the part with the machine just SO conveniently shooting a mask out?

Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm astounded by this book after hearing so many good reviews.It started off okay if a little...young. I mean, uglyville, new pretty town is something you expect to hear on cbeebies, not YA.However the book just went from bad to worse. I wish I could say it was stocked with cliches like Twilight butit wasnt. It was just weirdly...empty. For a plot that could say so much most of the book was dedicated to hoverdrones. It's kinda baffling really.The breaking point comes when Westerfield basically kills his own character. It FRIGHTENS me when I hear peopeople saying Tally is a good role model for young girls, especially when I hear teachers saying it. I never thought I'd say this but she's actually worse than Bella Swan.Bella was an empty, blank slate, sociopathic character. Tally has a lot more personality to her but it is a HORRIBLE one. She betrays her one friend for a boy she's just met and then betrays him further on down the line. She knows its not right or fair but it's acceptable to her because she's in love with this boy...who she's known for a few days.Yep, fans of this book may have you believing that Tally is a better role model, the plot is more mature and the writing better but dont be fooled. Its just more of the same thing.Tally's former friend Shay is the only real role model in this book. Her motivation for turning against the system was a deep belief that it was wrong to be judged on looks.Tally met a boy she liked and decided to give up everything she wanted for him. Seriously. Shay gets shafted and Tally gets rewarded.It's twilight set in the future and nothing more."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've only seen one episode of The Twilight Zone. In this episode, a woman undergoes a battery of surgeries to look normal. At the end of the episode, viewers learn that this latest surgery has failed: the woman is still hideous. Except that to the audience she is beautiful. Online research led me to another episode where teenagers are surgically altered to live longer and conform to a unified standard of beauty (based on a limited number of acceptable \\"models\\"). \\"Uglies,\\" Scott Westerfeld's dystopic novel, plays similar games of perception.The novel starts with Tally Youngblood a fifteen-year-old girl desperately waiting for her sixteenth birthday when she will be reunited with her best friend and, more importantly, when she will finally be pretty.\\"Uglies\\" is set in the distant future after a mysterious global catastrophe precipitated changes to the foundations of what readers would call modern society. Fearful of war and violence cities now operate as independent states (think Renaissance Italy as opposed to contemporary Italy). Isolated and self-sufficient, the cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good.New technology ensures that citizens never want for food or luxury items, weapons of any kind are largely illegal, and at the age of sixteen everyone undergoes a series of extreme surgeries to better conform to societal standards of beauty. The logic being that, since humans are preconditioned to respond to certain visual cues in each other already (big eyes are non-threatening, a clear complexion and good teeth indicate that a person is healthy), applying these beauty standards will reduce conflict and create a more harmonious society.But in a world where everyone is movie-star-gorgeous (oldies like Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo are considered \\"natural pretties\\"), normal people are so not pretty. In short, they're ugly.Things change for Tally when she meets Shay, another Ugly girl, who wants to run away before the operation to a place called The Smoke where people can live like \\"Rusties\\" (that would be us basically) in the wilderness without any surgery. As the novel progresses, and Special Circumstances (a government agency) coerces Tally into finding The Smoke for them, Tally is forced to choose what means more: friendship or beauty?As the plot might suggest, this is a science fiction novel. Just to be clear, the real difference between sci-fi and fantasy is that the technology in science fiction novels could conceivably work if someone ever built it (dragons, most likely, are never going to be genetically engineered so they're a good indicator of a fantasy novel). At times this leads to more explanation of, say, hoverboard mechanics in the novel than is strictly necessary to the plot but the rest of the book makes up for this small shortcoming.What makes \\"Uglies\\" great, besides how it looks at cultural values, is Westerfeld's use of language. The novel is not pretentious or brash. Instead, Westerfeld creates a narrative voice that is really unique--especially for a sweeping sci-fi saga like the Uglies trilogy. The novel opens with Tally observing that \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" That is not, it is fair to say, a typical opening for any novel. Yet Westerfeld moves from that observation seamlessly into the story.This book is the first in the Uglies trilogy (followed by \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Specials\\") which focuses on Tally and her city. The scope of each book can largely stand alone, but to get the full story it's best to read the entire trilogy. Additionally, Westerfeld released a companion book to the trilogy last year called \\"Extras\\" which is set a few years after the trilogy with different main characters.\\"Uglies\\" is simultaneously funny and frightening, showing how overvalued beauty can be while illustrating how Tally's world has been conditioned to believe there's no other way to live. The sections where Westerfeld describes the Rusty Ruins and the end of that era are particularly haunting (and eerily reminiscent of the History Channel's recent documentary \\"Life After People\\").Sci-fi book discussions often bring up a writer's \\"world building\\" in reference to how well a writer creates their alternate universe. Westerfeld's world is built really well. The cities have their own culture, the characters their own slang, but Westerfeld manages to bring in enough references to our own contemporary culture that it's easy for readers to believe Tally's world is built on the ruins of our own."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally Youngblood grew up in a society where everyone got an operation at age sixteen that made them supermodel gorgeous. Tally had always dreamed of becoming a Pretty, and fully planned on joining her best friend Peris in New Pretty Town after the operation. But then Tally met Shay, a rebellious Ugly like Tally who wanted to leave the city, something unheard of in that day and age. Sure enough, the day before Tally and Shay were going to turn pretty, Shay disappeared, leaving Tally with only a cryptic note telling her how to get to a place called the Smoke. Despite her friend's disappearance, Tally went to get the operation anyway. But she was intercepted by a government group called Special Circumstances, who gave Tally an ultimatum: either she tracks down Shay for them, or she remains ugly for the rest of her life.So Tally left to find the Smoke, and Shay. She found the Smoke, and soon grew to treat everyone there normally, despite their \\"ugliness.\\" One person in particular was a boy named David, whose parents had founded the Smoke years ago after finding out a secret about the pretty operation. Apparently the operation alters your brain to lose its natural curiosity and essentially brainwashes you into thinking that the Pretty way is the way everything is supposed to be. After meeting David's parents, Tally and David found that they were falling in love, and Tally threw her heart necklace (which was secretly a tracking device given to her by the Specials) into the campfire. The next morning, she awoke to a Special invasion. They were capturing Smokies left and right, but Tally managed to escape. She found David's mom, but they were eventually captured as well, and taken back to the city, where Shay had already been turned into a Pretty. Tally and David's mom broke out, and brought as many Smokies, including Shay, with them in a search for David. He was found, and the Smokies camped out, still in hiding from the Specials, when David told Tally that his mom had found a cure for the brain problems in Pretties. So Tally went back to the city with Shay in order to become pretty and provide herself as a test subject for the pill.Uglies was a very intriguing novel with a plot that really surprised me.I loved this novel because it was unexpectedly suspenseful and action-packed. One wouldn't normally think that a book about someone becoming pretty would have a very good plotline, but this one caught me completely off-guard. The action sequences were extremely captivating, especially when Tally was hoverboarding through the wilderness, and also when she was caught in the brushfire while searching for the Smoke. I was gripped by the Special invasion of the Smoke, especially when Tally was caught by the Specials but she got away, and she found David's mom and they ran off together.The action sequences were very suspenseful, but the emotional factors in this novel accounted for a lot of my later nights, like the tension between Tally and Shay, and their love triangle with David. And the impact that David's parents had on her, especially the part about everything she's ever known being a lie, and that the operations that she had thought were the best thing since sliced bread were really just a way for the Specials to control everyone. I mean, it\`s got to be easy to control people if they have no idea what's going on, right?But this book was more than action and romance. The plot definitely took me by surprise, meaning that I didn't expect for a book about \\"uglies\\" and \\"pretties\\" to be suspenseful, not to mention a sci-fi novel. But it is, and I positively adored it. I wasn't too sure about it at first, mostly because my friends all recommended it to me, and I still wasn't completely convinced. But I am extremely glad that I did read it, because it was the most thrilling sci-fi novel I've read in a long time. My friends all recommended it to me, and now I'll recommend it to all of you. It really is a great book, and it's also a fairly quick read, so pick it up!-C.

While everybody is panicking Tally grabs a parachute and jumps off of the roof. She flops onto the ground and everybody points at her and yells because she is ugly. Before the guards can see her, Tally runs to the river and quickly crosses it, returning to uglyville.This book was really good. It is definately among one of my favorite reads. It was very detailed and intriguing. I read it every night because it was so interesting. I recommend reading this book if you like reading sci-fi, action-filled books."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm in love with this book! In fact, I'm in love with this series! It's a must read."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book for a 15yr old - and she got attracted to it right when she got it - the plot is very interesting, and unique...allows for contemplation and personal debate on the sense and value of the words: \\"pretty\\" and \\"ugly\\" - so sensitive topics for all teenagers nowadays.Go for it - it's a good buy!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies by Scott Westerfield is a great book filled with it's fair share of obstacles, misunderstandings, and plenty of close calls. This story is about a young girl named Tally Youngblood who can't wait to turn pretty. Tally lives in a very condensed and small town filled with tall buildings side by side everywhere. With tons of out-of-this-world gadgets the people living in Pretty Town and Uglyville are living a dream, or so they think. In Uglyville (where Tally lives) when an 'ugly' turns sixteen they get a surgery that transforms into a drop-dead gorgeous 'pretty'. 'Pretties' have big bright eyes, symmetrical faces, and perfectly proportioned bodies, far more stunning than any ugly like Tally. But her new friend Shay questions this system, and forces Tally to look at her perfect world in a whole new way.One of my favorite parts of the book is when Tally meets her friend David's parents, and she learns the truth behind those pretty faces. It's a point in the book where everything around Tally seems to be falling apart, but it's where her feelings finally come together. This scene made the book so much more involved, adding a whole new element to help connect the dots. That is the reason why I loved this scene, it added a lot more depth to Tally's world.When I read this book it made me think more about the world we live in, and how our systems work. It made me feel very glad that it's the way it is here, and that we don't have to worry about our leaders completely brainwashing us. Even though Uglies dealt with some pretty deep subjects it was still light hearted and fun to read. I can't wait 'till the sequel comes out."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"So picture this: you live in the future and you are fifteen going on sixteen in three months. When you turn sixteen, you are turned pretty, literally. Tally's best friend Peris has jus tturned pretty and is living in new pretty town. Tally is all alone now.

A week later, on her birthday, Tally is told that she cannot have the operation. She is taken to special circumstances. They tell she can either find Shay and the Smoke and betray them all, or be ugly for. From here on Taly is faced with the most difficult discision of her life.I thought UGLIES was the best book I have ever read. It was awesome. I think anyone who loves adventure and suspence should read this book. I loved it. I can't wait to read the next book.-Katelyn Sather"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Cinematic in its storytelling, UGLIES truly delivers a YA futuristic action tale that engages the reader right from the start. Longer than the typical YA novel, UGLIES does not disappoint in its ability to keep the reader involved.It's not perfect, as some descriptions of places and actions are a bit confusing and tend to make the reader have to re-read a section to understand the picture that the author is trying to create. But with so much happening, that minor problem is acceptable.As for the story itself, it's a real page-turner! Starting with a unique concept of a future where all sixteen-year-olds have an operation to turn them drop-dead gorgeous, once established, this concept really makes a reader contemplate the wisdom of such a place -- racism and preferential treatment (based on beauty) no longer exists as there is a level playing field for everyone. Sounds promising...except when more information comes out -- deep into the story, where it can have the deepest impact. As a teacher, I imagine that my students would love to discuss the ramifications of living in such a society.Plotwise, UGLIES really moves and feels very much like a summer blockbuster at the movies with hoverboards, burned out cities, bungee jackets and some great quests to engage young minds who need ACTION! Character conflicts also become engaging with questions of loyalty, inner beauty, good vs.evil, and teen independence motivating the progression of plot.I wish I had time right now to immediately pick up the next two books in this trilogy because I get a sense that there's more of the same in books 2 and 3.I highly recommend this book for teen readers who want thrills on the page!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I liked how this book makes the good point that real beauty isn't outside of you, but inside. Uglies was very suspenseful, and dealt with issues of truth and betray as well, as Tally struggles to either join the others in Smoke, the rebel town, or turn the rebels in to Dr. Cable so she can have the operation to be pretty herself. I look forward to reading the next book in the series. I also recommend two other thoughtful books for science fiction fans, An Audience for Einstein and The Giver."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"UGLIES, a book by Scott Westerfeld is one of the greatest I've ever read. It might be because the characters are around my age and experience the same things that I feel deep down inside, but the author adds a lot of mystery and excitement into his work also. The story begins in a city called Ugly Town with a character named Tally. There are two different towns. Ugly, which you live in until you turn sixteen, and Pretty, which you move to after you have a total body makeover. It interests me on how this fact is very similar to our world; people usually go through stages during their lives where they are ugly and pretty or in between at numerous times. In UGLIES, once you turn sixteen and are accepted to become gorgeous, you are taken to the hospital in pretty town. Once you are there they take your measurements, grind your bones down to be the perfect shape, replace cartilage with programmable plastic, trim your muscles, and sand down your skin to be just the right texture. They also laser-cut your eyes so that you have a lifetime of perfect vision and insert reflective implants under the irises to add sparkling gold flecks. All of these operations are performed, and then the main character describes the symptoms as only a painful sunburn. If only real life was that simple, everything would be as easy as pie!One of the biggest differences between this book and other fantasy/science fiction books is that everything is so original. There are interesting names, the strangest scenarios, and complex but down to earth characters. One of my favorite things in the book was an object called a hover board. It was described much like a skateboard or surfboard that flies a bit above the ground, but it doesn't work unless there is metal underneath the ground or water onto which you are driving it over. Tally, the main character, and her friend, Shay fly around on these boards numerous times during the story. It was exciting to read about some of Shay and Tally's adventures on the boards, and sometimes I felt like I was on one along with them. Later in the book Tally is dependent on her hover board to get her to a place called Smoke. This book definitely shows how much future technology, and also the technology we have created to this day makes a big impact on how people live their daily lives. Computers, transportation, and other electronics are definitely things that we strongly depend on today and also into the future.Out of all of the books I've read, UGLIES is definitely one I would recommend, especially to people in the early teens to mid-twenties. There is also a sequel to this book, which I haven't read yet, but strongly believe it will be just as good as this one."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I first heard about this book from my Honors Language Arts teacher when we did Lit Circles. I chose the book because it looked interesting, and I was astounded when it turned out to be better than I thought it would. Scott Westerfeld has a way of creating characters that are down-to-earth and have their own share of flaws.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading adventure books with a touch of romance. Since there are some scenes that may be inappropriate for younger children, I would guess anyone above the age of 12 could read this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I liked how this book makes the good point that real beauty isn't outside of you, but inside.

Uglies gave me a fantistic view on that subject. After reading this book, I sat down and reflected for a couple of hours. Is perfection really worth it in the end? I looked in the mirror and finally really started to see who I really was and how I was beautiful in my own way. Uglies gave me a new outlook on life. Now I don't spend as many mornings worrying about how I look.I think it's a great read for people of all ages. It's full of adventure and truths. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat.

The book really sucked me in through the plot twists and I can't wait to get the second one! Yesssssssss!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies by Scott Westerfield is a fiction story. It's about how Tally makes a new friend who runs away. Tally is blackmailed into finding her, and turning her in. Will Tally be able to save her friend from a horrible fate or will she turn her in so Tally can live a perfect life?Even though many lies are told and many tears are shed what I liked best about this book is that it shows us that even what everyone thinks would make a perfect life isn't true. Uglies makes you find the real beauty in yourself. Although Uglies has a wonderful moral I didn't like the fact that it ended in a critical point of the plot.The reason Tally Youngblood is my favorite character is because me and her have a lot in common. We both realized what was important in life through different adventures. I used to think my life would be perfect if I looked better but after going through this journey with her it helped me realize even more that life isn't perfect even if we try and make it. This is proven in these sentences: You can see the world clearly, even if you did grow up spoiled. Tally looked into his eyes and saw that his face was glowing again- touching her in that pretty way she felt before. \\"That's why you're beautiful Tally.\\" (pg. 276) This scene of the book meant something to me because this is when Tally realizes for the first time that she is beautiful even though she hasn't turned pretty yet. Also it really shows the connection between her and David.This is an amazing book. It made me realize even more how glad I am to be me. It's adventurous, romantic, and extremely realistic. Uglies really gets you thinking about if we could ever end up like that? It makes you see that the future isn't that far away. Uglies is such a wonderful book , with everything you need for the perfect book. Young teens and adults will all enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"So, I took this out of the library thinking it looked a bit weird was not at all sure whether I would like it or not. However, it's a great book with a really unique and interesting plot. The only niggling worry at the back of my mind is that from my experience, authors that write their books really quickly and write an entire series at once tend not to have such great books. An example being the Daughters of the moon series. But Scott Westerfeld has recently written the entire series of Uglies, Pretties, and Specials, the Midnighter series and another new book, Peeps, which I just got from the library. So far all of them have been great though, (pretties and specials haven't been published yet). I've enjoyed all of his books even though he must really write them quickly.Anyway, back to Uglies. This book is great because it takes a interesting spin on prevalent issues in society today, like the need to be perfect and pretty. In this book \\"everyone who is normal is ugly\\" and everyone has extensive plastic surgery at 16 that completley changes their appearance and makes them pretty. This book was great, after finishing it, I kept thinking about it and can't wait untill Pretties comes out.Give it a chance and I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies is one of the best books I have ever read.

What a surprise! I had an inkling that this book would be engaging like Westerfelds' other books, but I had no clue it would grab hold of me as hard as it did.The Story: Uglies is set in a highly technological world where at the age of 16, citizens go through an operation to make them \`Pretty'. The narrator, Tally, is just about to be 16 and can hardly wait for her operation, but her plans change when her rebel friend Shay runs away the night of their operation to a place where supposedly no one is Pretty. From there, Tally has to decide how much being Pretty really matters to her.My Thoughts: Westerfeld has done it again. Although, I found some of the story elements predictable, Uglies is a great read. Tally is annoying in the first half of the book, but I found myself warming up to her in the middle, and totally standing by her in the last few pages.Which reminds me... As of this writing, I am waiting for my hold on the Pretties to come through. Uglies ends in such a way that if you liked it, you'll want to read the sequel, Pretties, as soon as possible.

I think that this goes for a lot of sci-fi novels. [Harry Potter, Ender's Game, etc.] After I got the initial concept and writing style of the author I enjoyed it. Suspense and action made up a good deal of the book, but not in the usual science fiction manner. It was more geared towards teenagers [something appealing to me]. The only downfall of the book was, well, it was geared towards teenagers."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"This whole game is just designed to make us hate ourselves.\\"In a civilization roughly 300 years from now Tally Youngblood is about to turn 16 years old. In her culture, when a child turns 16, they are subjected to a brutal operation that shaves away excess bone, eats away the layers of skin (including any scars, freckles, or age lines), and replaces any unattractive features with beautiful, hard plastic, pretty features. This is known as becoming a \\"Pretty\\".As an \\"Ugly\\", Tally has looked forward to this all of her life. Born and bred in a culture that loathes unattractiveness she is taught from a young age to embrace the upcoming change as a means of combating the horrible ego crushing things that generations of children long past had to deal with, things that included racism, depression, and eating disorders to maintain some warped ideal of beauty. She, like other young Uglies, spends her days in school in a sheltered compound, learning from the histories of her predecessors the \\"Rusties\\", an ancient civilization who erected metal monuments to live in, cut down trees as a means of producing paper and wasting more than their fair share of it, and teaching their youth that in order to be beautiful you had to torture yourself. The better part of Tally's time leading up to her birthday is spent playing pranks on the younger Uglies and sneaking into New Pretty Town. Here, she spends the time yearning to join the New Pretties, including her former best friend Peris, and tries to stay out of trouble long enough to make it to her operation, which is only a few months away.One day Tally meets a skinny young woman named Shay, and discovers they both share the same birthday. They immediately bond as they share their experiences and Shay teaches Tally to hover board. What they do not share is their viewpoints on becoming a Pretty. Whereas Tally cannot wait for the operation Shay seems to think it is unnecessary, largely due to her interaction with an outsider named David who has lived in the wild all of his life. Tally tries to soften her mind to the operation, but does not succeed. When Shay decides to run away to the Smoke (the place where David is) she attempts to convince Tally to come with her, to little success. Tally wants the operation, and promises Shay she will not share where she went with any others.The day of the operation comes, and much to Tally's dismay there is a problem. She is taken before the Special Circumstances Committee. Here she meets a Dr. Cable, a woman whose beauty is so sharp it is almost cruel. Dr. Cable knows about Shay, and forces Tally into a bargain with her. Unless Tally finds Shay, and as a result the Smoke, Tally will never become a Pretty. Tally, naturally, feels like a traitor, but she agrees to undertake the mission to infiltrate the Smoke and bring the Specials to it, with the help of a pendant with an optical sensor in it. But, will Tally's heart and mind change once she is in the company of her old friend, and more importantly, once she hears what David and the others really have to reveal about the Specials, the Pretties, and the ever important operation.\\"But first you see my face. You react to symmetry , skin tone, the shape of my eyes. And then you decide what's inside me, based on all your reactions. You're programmed to!I'm not programmed. I didn't grow up in a city.It's not culture, it's evolution!\\"This book has all sorts of thematic levels to it. There is, of course, the conformity issues that arise from everyone having an operation to have their features changed to fit to a certain standard. Along with this, of course, the personalities are altered as a result of the sudden ego boosts. Now, this may seem a little similar to \\"The Stepford Wives\\", but to me it has more of an apocalyptic \\"1984\\" quality. While the current culture has their troubles with the operations it is only a result of what the previous, less ecologically and biologically friendly culture did to the environment and the people as a result of their own evolution. I was surprised and a tad ashamed to have this look at what a culture might think of when they look back at ours, even if it is only through the lens of a fictitious novel. What I gleaned from this book overall was that this is a fantastic premise, storyline, narrative, and tremendous achievement overall for Westerfield, and I intend to read the subsequent books in the near future, likely after I have had some time to process this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"i loved the trilogy!!!!!! i could berly put it down i think its the best ive ever read i would defenatly recomend this this book to people it keeped me intertained the whole way throw"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After reading the first couple of chapters, I wondered how Westerfield could possibly have made this a 400+ page book.

This is coming from someone who doesn't care for fiction. But more than enjoyable reading, this is possibly the best work of dystopia ever written - better than '1984', better than 'Brave New World', and better than 'Fahrenheit 451'. Westerfield presents his razor-sharp critiques of our society and what it could well become thanks to our obsession with beauty at any cost, woven in prose that is rich but never florid. He is a master of suspense - even if I didn't always feel the characters' emotions, there was always a surprise within a few pages. And in the end, all his points were made magnificently. A trilogy may be too much material to change the paradigms of Western society, but this series should be required reading in high schools."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Human instinct is to be part of the crowd-to fit in. If I find myself in the presence of people I want to like me I try not to stand out. I want to be cool, to fit in, to be liked. This book really focuses on that. Everyone wants to fit in. But what if fitting in is the wrong answer? What if it causes people to be hurt? Do we do what is right or do we try to fit in? Uglies really stresses these questions on the main character. We all know what should happen- the main character chooses right over fitting in with out a second thought, but then we have a perfect character. A person who does everything right. Then the book is predictable to a fault. We may sometimes choose right over fitting in but it is always more complicated then that. There are more things to consider in life then \\"is this right?\\". In fact that is probably the question most often ignored. This book shows humanity's faults as well as our strengths.

At no point of reading this book was I ever bored. The author's style was refreshing and unique, a nice breather from authors with good ideas but a poor way of putting those ideas in an interesting and clever way on paper. I found that Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" was a book that had both of these important qualities.This book is fun and light, it's meaning obvious yet not so obvious you wan to put the book down due to boredom. Reading it requires little to no re-reading (you know what it mean, having to read a paragraph over and over again to understand it in full).This book could easily be compared to \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowrey (parden me if I spelled her name wrong). Both books have their main characters growing up in utopian societies and realizing that these societies are not all they are cracked up to read.

A world full of beautiful people sounds like Heaven. But as I got into the book more and more, it sounded more like you know where!

The story is based around Tally Youngblood, an ugly about to turn pretty. She meets Shay, an ugly that doesn't want to turn pretty. Shay runs away and Tally is forced to bring her friend home or never turn pretty. The events that follow start building up to the climax. After the climax, the story doesn't really slow down. The last sentence in the book will chill you to the bone and make you very excited about the next book. After a slow start, I really started to care about Tally and her friends. I can't wait to read the next book in the series, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"With three months until Tally Youngblood turns sixteen, she sneaks into the pretties world to find her best friend. He is glad to see her but shocked that she is there. Uglies and pretties never mingle. She will return after her surgery to make her pretty and then they will resume their friendship. Emergency sirens and spotlights speed her exit from the perfect society. While waiting for her birthday, she meets Shay who shows her a world of blissful imperfections. Shay invites Tally to stay as she is and escape with her to a world where appearance is never seen as ugly.I have to admit, I held off reading this because I thought it would be a new version of an old Twilight Zone episode. Although the initial concept is there, it does not follow the same plot line. UGLIES explores the depth of the pretty-making-process and the unseen damage that is within the realm of acceptable failure.Mr. Westerfeld's writing is superb. The reader is swept into his world as if it were their own. The pace and timing are spot on with no sluggish moments and the tension builds perfectly.Although UGLIES is set in a futuristic world, the setting is not far removed from reality. There is never a distanced and cold feeling, except when Tally jumps into an icy river. The characters are believable and enjoyable and portrayed as intelligent teenagers who still face the awkward transition into adulthood.All elements for a good story are here and told in an enjoyable fashion. Scott Westerfeld has easily become my favorite YA author.CarolASpradling.com author"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally Youngblood has waited her whole life to turn sixteen. In Tally's world, sixteen is the age when you receive an operation that turns you pretty. Before that you are an ugly, separated with the rest of the uglies from the pretties who live in paradise across the river. Every ugly looks forward to the operation because with it comes a life of high tech luxury and no problems whatsoever.Tally's best friend, Peris, has just become a pretty, moving to the paradise of New Pretty Town. Tally, left alone and miserable with another three months to go before her turn, steals across the river to spy on the new pretties, in particular, Peris. A typical ugly trick, Tally does not expect to crash a party, jump off a building, and set all of New Pretty Town into chaos, however. Along with the experience, Tally meets a new friend, Shay.Shay is a trickster and a daredevil; she knows every ugly trick in the book. Hover boarding, tricking the interface ring, and making it out to the Rusty Ruins. The two become good friends as the time passes.Unlike Tally though, Shay does not want to become a pretty. Like her friends before her, Shay wants to avoid the operation by escaping to the Smoke, an old Rusty town, where people hunt animals and burn wood. She tries again and again to convince Tally to go with her, but Tally wants to be pretty. Shay leaves a few nights before her sixteenth birthday leaving with her a coded message in case Tally might change her mind.The days go by and the day of Tally's operation finally comes. Unfortunately for her, the evil doctors at Special Circumstances want Shay back and the Smoke terminated. They refuse to give Tally her operation until she has located the Smoke and set off her tracker so the doctors can find the location of the Smoke.Tally sets off one her adventure to find Shay. Traveling days in the desert, mountains, and savannah, Tally finally manages to find the Smoke.Tally's experience at the Smoke opens her eyes to what the operation really does to you, and how controlled her society really is. She realizes that she never wants to go back to that life.The tracker that she has been told to use, lies unused for weeks, and Tally thinks she may never use it. She makes one mistake though, that she will forever regret.I think that the book Uglies is well written. Scott Westerfeld makes the book intense and action packed yet slightly laid back at times. It was an excellent Science Fiction read and I recommend all who liked this book to read The Giver another story in which the main character lives in a controlled society. I enjoyed this book because it was action packed and exciting."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally can't wait the three months until she's sixteen and her surgery transforms her into a pretty. She is sooooo sick of being an ugly. In the meantime, she daringly travels from her dorm in Uglyville to New Pretty Town in order to see her best friend, Peris. When she finds him, newly pretty Peris seems annoyed, asking why Tally couldn't wait the three months to see him. Just as troubling, the tiny scar on his palm matching hers, from their rite of blood brothership, has vanished --- replaced with perfect beautiful skin.Escaping from New Pretty Town, Tally meets Shay, another ugly waiting to become pretty. The two become great friends, hoverboarding and plotting practical jokes together. When Tally shares her choices for her upcoming transformation (she favors a sultry Cleopatra look), Shay amazes her with her attitude. Shay hasn't even bothered to decide how she'll look as a pretty.Tally buys the party line taught in school: a world of pretties is the only way to make everyone equal. It solves the long-ago problems of judging people by appearances and waging wars based on skin color. Besides, everyone wants to go through the rite of passage.Shay persuades Tally to sneak into the restricted area outside the city where she discovers a wild stretch of white water, mountains, trees, and the ruin of an old city. Shay confides that she hopes to meet a mysterious person named David here. Shay's talk troubles Tally. Shay maintains that she not only doesn't want to become a pretty but that the operation is in fact unnatural. She even swears that she and Tally are not freaks as uglies.As Tally approaches her sixteenth birthday and her transformation, Shay invites her to travel to David's home, the Smoke --- a place where everyone lives together in freedom, where there are no uglies and no pretties.Naturally, Tally refuses to go. But when her long-anticipated operation day arrives, she is confronted with the frightening Special Circumstances team. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she learns that she must spy on runaway Shay in order to become pretty. Tally plunges into an amazing quest in which the ante constantly ratchets upward, plunging her into one impossible situation after another.With extreme makeover shows like \\"The Swan\\" transforming people into pretty clones, Tally's world seems creepily not all that far-fetched. UGLIES is not only timely food for thought, but is a breathless, can't-put-it-down read, leaving readers impatient to get their hands on the second book in Scott Westerfeld's trilogy, PRETTIES --- immediately.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Pretty. Not just an adjective but a state of being. A world unto its own. A world entered on your sixteenth birthday.The first book in an enticing new trilogy, Uglies by Scott Westerfeld catapults you into the high-tech future, a world separated by the uglies and the pretties. These people live in a society designed by the idea of a utopia, where everyone would be equal, happy, and most importantly to them, pretty. On the day of your sixteenth birthday the idea of getting a license is nonexistent, because that is the day of your operation. The day you leave Uglyville and move across the river to the party towers, to spend years doing nothing but have a really spectacular time.Tally, an ugly rapidly approaching her sixteenth birthday can't wait for the operation. She'll finally become just how she had always imagined herself to be as a pretty; or at least how she imagined to doctors would make her look. Being one of the only uglies her age left to turn, she's elated to become friends with Shay, another ugly that shares her exact birthday.But Shay isn't sure if she wants to be pretty, and she'd rather risk leaving the world they know. After Shay runs away, the \\"specials\\" come looking for Tally. They know she can find this place called the \\"Smoke\\" where it's rumored many unwilling pretties-to-be escape to. They offer her an ultimatum; either she finds Shay and turns her in, or she'll never become a pretty. Shays faced with a decision that will alter her world forever, no matter which choice she makes.This novel instantly captivated me into a world of high-tech gadgets and twisted views on how society should be maintained. It also got deep into personal morals and really makes you think about how your government or society can brainwash you into having certain beliefs that are so obviously absurd. It truly is one of the best books I have had the opportunity to read and I couldn't set it down for an instant. With its adventure and even a touch of romance it will instantly become a favorite of any reader."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies is well written,inventive and has a real statement to make about our current obsession with image and superficial qualities."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a really good book.

After finishing it, I found that our views on it were clearly different.The good:-Theme: The importance of appearance in our world is always something interesting to explore. The book also highlights the importance of individualality.-The plot: A girl has to decide between becoming pretty like she's dreamed of her whole life or staying loyal to her friend and remaining 'ugly' forever.The bad:-Tally: While this is partly due to the world she lives in, it's obvious one of the most important things to her is beauty. She's even willing to betray her trusting friend if it means she gets the operation. Tally knows Shay likes David, but only ignores this besides when thinking that Shay might get jealous. She comes off as whiny, unsympathetic, and rude. She's not the kind of character that you can feel for, relate to, or support. This might work for a supporting character, but definitely not the main character.-Shay: While Shay started off as a great character who wanted to be herself, not a pretty, her personality and role quickly changed. Instead of being the girl whose best friend took her crush, she's the whiny jerk who won't accept that the person she likes is interested in someone else. By the end of the book, she's a pretty, which ruins what was her main character point. She was the only one to care that Tally had been a spy all along. Everyone else was surprised, but quickly got over it and accepted Tally.-The romance: I didn't understand the romance between Tally and David. You get tiny hints that Tally's attracted to him, large hints from David, then BAM! She goes to meet his parents. I felt the romance was flat, as after they were \\"a couple\\" the only attraction they showed to each other was kissing. Then, at the end of the book, they're in love. It felt rushed and fake.Overall, the book isn't worth rereading in my opinion. It was streched out and rushed at the same time, had dull character interactions, and just fell flat. Midnighters was better. Enough said."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It was great! I loved it. The story was great and amazing sentence structure!

I enjoyed the \\"Hunger Games\\" series very much and watch for similar series that will catch my interest. This one did and I am now on the third installment, \\"Specials\\". This was originally planned as a three book series, but the popularity of it convinced the author to write a fourth book which I have already obtained for my pleasure after reading the \\"Specials\\".I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced exciting read with well written but not preachy attitudes of how our past world (the world of today) wasted and destroyed our environment.I am not what one would call an environmentalist, but I do feel that we should use what we have without waste and plan for future needs. This story does bring some of this up in a fantastic story that moves along and keeps one glued to it to find out what will occur next. I hardly ever pay full price for a book and will get one at the library if at all possible, but I was unable to obtain the second of the series in any way but to purchase it. This in itself shows how much I wanted to continue reading. By the way there are NO VAMPIRES which is unusual in YA novels these days. Thank goodness for that!

I put off reading these books for so long because I thought a story about a bunch of vain people would be dull & wouldn't be for me. I was so wrong. You really don't get an idea of the Uglies world from the summary. The books were so exciting, and the world that was painted was creative, imaginative, and everything else you want of a good dystopian. The characters are rich and original as well. Tally Youngblood isn't very likeable at first, but as she changes your love for her grows leaps & bounds.

Unfortunately, most of the time the writing is too immature and easy to read now that I'm older(23). I didn't have that problem with the Uglies series at all! It was a fairly fast read, but not too quick. I was totally engrossed in it, and it's an eerily truthful representation of our society today, or at least where it sometimes seems to be heading. A great introduction to dystopian novels, I'd recommend this to all readers, from junior high and beyond."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies is a great book for people who love science fiction novels. It is an easy read and keeps you wanting to read more. In Uglies there are 2 different worlds; Pretty and Ugly. They are both separated by a bridge that connects them both. Every teen turns pretty by an operation at 16 and that boy/girl can enter the Pretty world. The Pretty world is high-tech and the dream place to be.In Uglies, the main character is Tally. She dreams about her \\"operation\\" and cannot wait to turn pretty. A few weeks before Tally's operation, she meets a new friend Shay. Shay is very adventurous and rather live life on the edge. Shay shows Tally a different perspective on the pretty side. One day Shay runs away and Tally is the only one who might know where she is. When the authorities find out, they give her two options: 1. to find Shay and turn her in, or 2. Never be able to turn pretty at all."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed reading Uglies. I haven't read any other books from this author but I think I will now. Uglies was a very adventurous and exciting book. It was a book with drama also, which made it very interesting. I recommend reading Uglies because it was a kind of book you couldn't put down. I love to read books that are full of action because I don't want to be bored. I have to admit I like movies better but reading this book put a movie in my head; like I was actually watching that movie in the movie theater. I have to say my favorite part of the book was when Tally and Shay went in the Rusty Ruins and went on their hover boards and rode the \\"rollercoaster\\" and then Tally fell through the gap. It gave the book action and it gave me a picture of them on a rollercoaster and Tally falling through a gap. The one thing I disliked about the book is when Tally lies to Shay just because she looked ugly; that is not being a true friend. I think Uglies is worth buying; it is a fun and if you end up loving it you can read the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a 13 year old student who is reviewing the book Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. The book Uglies was a very well-written novel. I loved how the adventure captured the reader, and lured them in closely. This book was about the future time where a girl named Tally lives as an \\"ugly\\" waiting to be transformed into a \\"pretty\\". She goes through a long line of mishaps and an excitable journey after meeting a new friend, Shay. The story was very interesting (in a good way) and I would recommend it for people who are probably in their teenaged years. I rated a 4/5 because it was a really good story, but I just wasn't as fascinated in the beginning as much as I was in the end. If the beginning was a little more explanatory, I might've understood it better. IF you have read the book \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" by Madeleine L' Engle, you may love this book as well!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I highly recommend Uglies. It's a book about a girl named Tally and she's about to turn 16 as if turning 16 is enough drama having your sweet 16 and all but wait, turning 16 is like entering a whole new world you ... become a pretty.Tally is so excited. On a trip to sneak into New Pretty Town to find her best friend Peris she finds all kinds of pretties on the way yelling and screaming. She hides in an elevator and finds... Peris. She makes a promise to Peris that she will become pretty and not do anything bad, on her way back she finds another ugly named Shay. Tally talks to Shay and finds out that she has the same birthday as her that means she turns pretty on the same day! Shay teaches Tally how to ride a hover board, she takes Tally on a lot of fun rides. But when Shay tells Tally about her old friends and how they never turned pretty and she told her how they ran away to a place called Smoke and Shay wants Tally to go with her. Tally doesn't want to break her promise to Peris and she doesn't want to let Shay down. Shay gives Tally a piece of paper that only she could understand Shay said, \\"if you choose to come with me here are the directions to get to smoke.\\" When a girl called Dr. Cable wants Tally to follow her friend so that she can find all of Shay's friends and turn them pretty but then Dr. Cable let's outs the news and says, \\"If you don't find Shay and her friends, you won't become a pretty.\\" Will Tally betray her friend so she can be pretty and so she can see Peris or will she break her promise to Peris. You will have to read the book to find out!My favorite part of the book was when Tally went into New Pretty Town and she puts on a pig mask to disguise her ugly face she walks into a place called the Garbo Mansion and the pretties were all wearing suits and dresses. When she walked in people started chasing her all around the mansion calling her piggy!I've learned that when you make a promise you should keep that promise, also do what you think is best for you and not what anyone else says.I would definitely give this book five stars because it's the best book I've ever read you should read it because it's a great book!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I know many people will hate me for saying this, but after reading the Uglies Series I felt unsatisfied by what I had read. It was such an amazing idea to go on, but it felt like the author barely scratched the surface of what it could be. Normally I can fall into any book and read it very quickly, but every time I sat down I had to reread because I wasnt truly enjoying it. Maybe Uglies just wasnt my kind of book. The story does not flow beautifully or keep you on edge, it jerks you around and not in a good way."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally Youngblood is just shy of turning sixteen and looking forward everyday to becoming pretty. Becoming pretty isn't some state of mind or anything (except for very rare circumstances) predetermined by genetics; when you turn pretty, you undergo cosmetic surgery to conform your physical features into something that is supposedly universally appreciated as beauty: big doe-y eyes, plump lips, soft features. The alternative is living the rest of your life as an \\"ugly,\\" something Tally's determined not to do. Uglies are \\"gawky and nervous, unkempt and uncoordinated\\" (p 77). In fact, uglies sound just like regular adolescents struggling in the limbo of puberty and lashing out with hormones by doing \\"tricks\\"--childish stunts pulled only by uglies.Unfortunately, one of the worst thing Westerfeld's invented government has done to our futuristic dystopian society is brainwash everyone into believing the ugliness of everyone who doesn't undergo the surgery. And ugliness is bad. Being an ugly also means being natural and subject to the whims of genetics, which also includes physical markers of ethnicity and race. The government has decided race and ethnic fighting must be stopped and so at some point in the past, have convinced most of the population that the operation to turn pretty is really an effort to find world peace. With everyone more or less looking the same, whatever do they have to fight over? Organized religion or personal beliefs aren't taken into account--I guess when you make everyone look the same (I couldn't find if Westerfeld ever mentioned what skin color everyone gets to have once they've changed), ethnically associated things (except food) go by the wayside.So really, the operation is an exercise in convenience and a seemingly successful attempt to rid the world of unnecessary evils by reducing the things we can choose to fight over.Tally's fallen for this 100% until she meets Shay, an ugly who shares her birthday and is counting down the days with dread. Shay doesn't want to turn pretty. In fact, she's got a plan that will help her avoid it forever and wants Tally to join her. But it involves leaving the security of Tally's small, sheltered Uglyville and the pampered life she's lead. She doesn't believe that pretties are just docile pets who live only to party and have fun. Tally sees her best friend Peris, who's already turned pretty and left her behind, having fun without her and living, if possibly, even more of a pampered life. But could Shay be right? Could there be more to life than just being pretty?With the rising popularity of cosmetic surgery and especially with teens wanting to undergo the knife to fix physical problems that may inevitably fix themselves, I liked the idea behind Uglies. What I didn't like was the constant references to the world ugly. I almost forgot the \\"uglies\\" were actually quite normal and began to believe in them as being Ugly with that capital u, marking them as distinctly problematic. This hit me the most when Tally watches the new uglies (called \\"littlies\\" up until they go to live in the dorms around age eleven) stepping into her building, their \\"ugly little faces\\" (p. 76) being nothing more than the faces of scared children coming into a new, alien environment.But I think Westerfeld intended the reader to disassociate the word ugly with its normal definition to give it an alternative connotation however much it remains a shallow translation of the original. Ugly is an ugly word and Tally is quite repulsed by all things ugly.Despite everyone's eagerness to turn pretty, there are exceptions. Some people don't have to have the operation. Just like a weird translation of reality where the subjectiveness of beauty disappears for certain models, celebrities or other people who look attractive to a large percentage of the population, pretties can be born Pretty. Some people have all the luck.There's also an emphasis on pretties being somehow more significant than uglies. The childishness of uglies is played up against the important, \\"grown up\\" pretties (the fact that they party all day long is overlooked because well, they're pretty). This propaganda is supposed to inspire loyalty in the uglies, to stay and have their operation so they too can grow up and be important and do more important things than going around pulling pranks with each other to blow off steam. Like partying.Of course, there are darker implications to this and if you read the book, you'll find out all the twists in the plot that force Tally to continually lie to her friends. The twist was interesting and made the book worth finishing. I even want to finish the rest of the series, but can wait awhile. Westerfeld's writing is extremely accessible, so accessible I wondered if he intentionally lingered on certain things longer than necessary just to cater to a younger audience. Tally's journey out to the Smoke went on far too long and the between time from her arrival and the inevitable invasion was an eyeblink--too short, but I understand the focus wasn't supposed to be on the interval. It was the interruption that mattered.In any event, it's the story that's important here and the implications Westerfeld writes into the plot that make the book interesting. It bothered me that he was too presumptuous and condescending of today's society, easy to condemn and criticize with blanket statements of wasteful practices and ignorant behaviors (without explaining the mechanics of his world that does not rely on oil, but still has plastics to mold people--all people--into pretties), but if you want to enjoy the story for what it is, you have to unhinge your own belief and buy into his for the duration of the book. I did and I winded up liking the book. It could have been shorter, the characters a bit more relatable and sympathetic, but overall it was a good fun read.In the end, I was left with this very important thought from Tally: \\"If only people were smarter, evolved enough to treat everyone the same even if they looked different. Looked ugly.\\" (p. 97)"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Have you ever tried to find a wholesome, positive message in the YA section of the library lately? It's like finding a needle in a haystack! The cover of the book didn't look promising to me, but the title was intriguing and the reviews encouraged me to take a deeper look.Westerfeld has presented an awesome, balanced book that will appeal to a huge body of readers. It is sci-fi fantasy with realistic proportions; it is suspenseful; it is about ethics and loyalty; it is about integrity; it has a romance that has boundaries; it presents the possibility of a healthy parental relationship; it promotes an environmental message without extremism. Most importantly, it helps young people redefine the qualities of beauty.The book begins in a futuristic society where Tally awaits her 16th birthday - a milestone when she will be ready to have the operation to make her a Pretty. As a Pretty, she will enter the world of the Pretties - full of fun and happiness. She meets another Ugly who tells her about a world outside the Utopian system and who tries to entice her to escape. She wonders why anyone would want to avoid a world of happiness and the opportunity to be beautiful? Their friendship results in a terrible choice for Tally. Which will bring more sorrowful consequences - to betray her friend or remain loyal and lose her personal hopes and dreams? This young girl's choice unravels a dark secret and changes society as she knows it.Uglies is very well-written with characters that are gradually and skillfully developed. The plot unveils at a consistent pace so that there is never a dull moment.One caveat - like Lays Potato Chips, you cannot have just one. While sufficiently resolving the first novel, the author has built-in a device where you will be compelled to read the sequel. So, I'm getting ready for another weekend on the couch to read Pretties next."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I picked this up after reading recommendations by other SF authors, like Cory Doctorow. I'm way out of the target demographic for this book (being a middle-aged man) and, I'll have to admit, it's something I might be a little embarrassed reading in public due to the cover and obvious target audience, but I'd still heartily recommend it (and the rest of the series) to just about anyone of any age or sex. The book's cover and blurbs kinda hide the fact that this is pure, good SF - lots of action, intriguing moral dilemmas, with interesting cultural insights and satire.I described it to my wife as an update to Logan's Run, where people live in isolated cities where their every needs are taken care of (not domed, but quite insular nonetheless). Instead of being terminated at the age of 30, like in Logan's Run, you are turned into Paris Hilton at the age of sixteen - made physically beautiful, but somehow turned into mindless party people. Like in Logan's Run, the protagonist, Tally, against her will, escapes the city right before being turned \\"Pretty\\" and discovers a whole world of dissidents and refugees who are fighting against the system, including old \\"Uglies\\" who live in the ruins of \\"Rusty\\" cities. The social issues are blatant and there are even metaphorical asides, such as the mutant orchids that have taken over much of the wild - smothering environmental diversity with their self-similar beauty. I admire the author, however, for never having a character say, \\"Oh, the orchids are like the Pretties\\" even though it is obvious, he never beats the reader over the head with the metaphor.The later books move through the strata of these new societal levels, the \\"Pretties\\" and the \\"Specials\\" and you meet other isolated human societies, including a violent engineered \\"zoo\\" of \\"primative\\" humans. It would have been easy to portray all of these levels as simplistic social morality plays, but he keeps it all fairly realistic, or at least believable, with plenty of moral and ethical dilemmas that have no easy answers - is it correct to make choices for people who have been engineered to reject those choices? How much can you engineer the human psyche and still remain human? Each of us changes as we grow and mature, and we reject and alter our mindsets as we grow - does that make us different people? The \\"Pretty\\" cities have been existing in a productive, peaceful state with a level of environmental coexistence that the most radical \\"tree hugger\\" would love, for centuries, but at a severe loss of freedom of thought and under the control of those who think they know best for everyone. Is that OK? How much individual freedom can you abandon and still be free and human?As I said, if you examine the cover and read the blurbs on the back, you would think that this is near future teen social novel, with plastic surgery enhanced teens vs. \\"normal\\" ugly teens, like the publisher is afraid that teen girls won't pick up a \\"real\\" SF book, but it's actually set centuries in the future with nano-technology, bioengineering, hoverboards, and a rebellious cyberpunk feel that should also appeal to boys and a wider SF audience. Of course, as sales results and critics have begun to point out, the teen/young adult market is very hot right now (led, in large part, by the Harry Potter phenomenon) and as many adults as teens are buying, reading, and enjoying these books. You should too."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a middle school student and I had to read this book for my English class. At first, I thought that the book was very confusing, but all of my questions got answered. The book takes place in the future, and there is a lot of futuristic technology to get used to in the book. Bungee jackets, which let you jump off a building and come out unscathed, and hover-boards, skateboards that float, are just two of the many futuristic objects in the book.The story is about a girl named Tally who is \\"ugly\\". When she turns 16, she will get an operation that turns her \\"pretty\\". When you are \\"pretty\\", you move to New Pretty Town, where you party and have fun all of the time. Tally wants to be \\"pretty\\", but her friend, Shay, ran away and government won't let her turn \\"pretty\\". The Smoke, the place Shay ran away to, is a place that \\"uglies\\" that don't want to be \\"pretty\\" go to. The government knows about The Smoke and wants to destroy it. So, the government told Tally that if she ever wanted to be \\"pretty', she must find the smoke and activate a tracking device that gives the government the location of The Smoke.Uglies by Scott Westerfeld is great book. I can't wait to read the sequel. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a female seventh grader. Uglies by Scott Westerfield is a realistic book set at least 300 years into the future in a world of extreme beauty. Everyone follows an ideal standard beauty and when teenagers turn 16, they undergo an operation to make them pretty. These teenagers move to Pretty Town where they can party and play without worries, schools, or rules. Teens younger than 16, otherwise known as uglies, look from Uglyville at Pretty Town. Bored with nothing to do, the uglies scheme roguish tricks on each other.Tally Youngblood, the main character, yearns to be a pretty. After her best friend moves to Pretty Town, Tally was left friendless. Really lonely, Tally schemed her largest trick ever, sneaking into a Pretty Town party. She crashes the party, runs aways, and meets Shay, another ugly. The two become best friends. But not everything goes well. Shay disagrees with the city's system so she runs away to the Smoke, a rebellion group that lives in the wild. For years, some uglies have run away to the Smoke to avoid turning pretty. Special Circumstances want to capture the Smoke but they need Tally to follow her enigmatic directions from Shay to the Smoke. Tally is forced to travel to the Smoke on a betrayal mission or stay ugly forever, a difficult choice between friendship or desire.While reading the book, I realized a very important message: life is more than superficial appearances. Beauty does not fix everything. Even a seemingly perfect world like Pretty Town has its dark secrets. Therefore, one should be true to oneself and not blindly follow everyone else. Especially during the teenage years when our bodies and minds grow, and emotions blossom, we should not hide our individualism because our individual experiences make our lives truly beautiful."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a seventh grade student and have read this book two times. I also read the rest of the series, the same as my sisters. We all loved these books, but furthermore, we all agreed on one other thing. Uglies is the best book in this series. Here is a little summary.Uglies is about a 15 year old girl, Tally, who lives in a world where once you turn 16, you turn pretty. When you become pretty, you can party all day and night and almost do anything you want. Tally has been very enthusiastic about turning pretty and she has been waiting all her life for the day she turns 16. Soon almost everyone her age has gone to New Pretty Town, right across the river, yet so far away, and Tally is nearly the only one left waiting to become what she has always wanted to be. Before long, she meets Shay, a girl the same age as her, to the day. They become fast friends, teaching each other new tricks and waiting to become pretty together. But before they turn into the party-all-day-all-night people new pretties are, Shay seems to be having doubts about what Tally has been planning for since she knew she was ugly. When Shay disappears, leaving Tally a coded message of how to find her, the Special Circumstances agents, dangerously beautiful inhabitants that mysteriously run her city, take Tally and tell her to find the hideout Shay has run away to. Or else... she'll never be pretty.This book is amazing, using superb word choice to express what the characters are feeling, and a wonderfully inventive idea of hoverstruts, talking bridges, and bungee jackets that catch you a split second before you hit the ground to create a world that could very well be ours soon. Although the first sentence in the book, \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit,\\" may repulse some readers, it is actually a great simile that clearly shows how Tally is feeling. If anything else, the rest of the book makes up for it completely. Some parts of the book are a little confusing with their complexity, but as you read on you discover what they meant. Symbolism is a big part in this story, from the beautiful flowers taking over, to the whole book showing that people need to fight for diversity, which is falling away in their own world. Scott Westerfeld portrays Tally and Shay in a way that can almost make you see them in front of you, and everything is described so perfectly that you feel as if you were there, secreting your way to New Pretty Town alongside Tally. The plot twists and turns like a roller coaster, and when something surprising happens, you feel as if the monstrous metal frame has just fallen out from under you and you are gliding out into thin air until that trusty, just about unbreakable track is supporting you again.Overall, this book is breathtaking in how it is written and is great choice for readers who love fiction. Younger readers might become a tad confused with the words, but when they are a bit older, they will understand it perfectly. It's a great read you won't put down till you are done flipping those pages. Even then, you'll want to pick it right up again and start from the beginning!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"2/27/11Who should read Uglies by Scott Westerfeld? Every middle schooler who wants to learn about bias in the world and how it relates to themselves. This book was assigned to my 7th grade Honors English class. Uglies is a futuristic, science fiction novel geared to teens to help them establish a good self image. This story has adult themes, but is written on a level that is appropriate for tweens to understand.Tally, the main character, has always dreamed on becoming a Pretty, but then she meets Shay. They plan on getting the operation, to make them pretty, together until Shay runs away like others have done. Tally is sent by the Pretty operation team, the Specials, to track down where Shay and the rest of the runaways are.This book has it all, drama, adventures, love, and a nice moral. Not only does Uglies teach a lesson about beauty's price, but also includes a thrilling story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Now, I don't read HUNDREDS of books, but this one made me want to read more. I would recommend this book for kids 12 and up since there is some content that may be inappropriate for youngsters.So what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"i loved this book! it was perfect in every way. the characters were good in addition to the emotions they expressed. i aso like how the book included romance but not so much that it made the book boring. there was a good balance. i also love that through every page you stay hooked. you never want to put the book down, there is just so much excitment. the one thing i didn't like about this novel is that it left you hanging at the end, although it did have a second book so all ended good. overall, i LOVED the everything!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am in the sixth grade an I thought this was an amazing book.

The things many people want to critique i see as a central part of a story. Tally Youngblood is one of the most dynamic characters I have ever come across by the time you have finished you will have been on the most amazing emotional roller coaster of your life.I have read a lot of books and I doubt i will ever read a book with the level of character transformation as Tally. It has many deeply thought out questions that will make you view beauty in new way. and maybe make you truly appreciate every persons individual uniquesness. Because if the world was truly pretty would you be willing to lose everthing unique about yourself to be accepted? I think that is a question many ask themselves even today. We are so wiling to spend money on the hottest clothes to spend hours on hair and makeup just to make others happy but if that is not the true you will you ever be truly happy? there are many other questions series asks that many others need to ask themselves that i feel everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If I could name any one book that had everything I looked for in a good, fascinating read, this would be it.All ugly Tally wants to be is pretty and join her best friend Peris in New Pretty Town. I'll admit, the names just sound silly. Uglies, Pretties,Littlies, New Pretty Town, Rusties, they remind me of something my four year old cousin would say. There's a lot of other slang that takes some getting used to, but don't let it put you off! Uglies is set in a society where everyone has an operation to become pretty by a certain age. Peris has already became pretty and Tally makes one last trip to see him before her operation in 3 months. Uglies and Pretties don't mix, so you can imagine she gets into some trouble which is just the start of her adventure.I like Tally, she's not my favourite character ever, but she's not overly annoying. The only thing that bugs me is her obsession with being pretty. She goes on and on a few times about it, but she's been brainwashed to think anyone who hasn't been made pretty is automatically ugly. I guess I can forgive her for that, because she does, eventually, start to see the world differently.I don't want to go into the story of Uglies, or what Tally gets herself into, but in a nutshell, she has to decide if becoming pretty is worth the price of betraying her friends. I like the adventures she has, I like the cast of characters, I like the setting, basically there's nothing about this book that I dislike. I am really surprised at how gender neutral Uglies is, I was not expecting that and you could say I got a little frustrated with the lack of romance. Westerfeld's writing more than made up for it though.With the ideas presented later in the story, it's almost eerie to think about something like that happening in the future. I definitely recommend this one to anyone."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The book came in a timely manner, and was as described. I would definitely do business with this group again."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I had the first 2 books for a while before I actually ever read them. I'd started the first one, Uglies, a couple times but couldn't really get into it. I decided to give it another chance and this time just started where I left off the last time. I'm really glad I did pick it up again because I really enjoyed it and the rest of the trilogy. I really like how it's set in the future, but it alludes to the 'Rusties', which is what they call the people of the past, which I presume is right about this time. I think the author did a really good job of mixing the parts of the story without putting too much emphasis on one. There's some romance, but the books not centered around it so you get a good taste of the romance but you're not trudging through Tally (the main character) obsessing over a guy like other books tend to do. Also, there's lots of talk about how the Rusties destroyed nature, didn't recycle, used too much oil, etc. and it really makes you think about what we're doing to our planet. Of course, that's what the author intended and he really did a good job of that. And I really think the whole operation-to-be-pretty thing is just brilliant. You also get the controlling, futuristic society but in this case, the people in the city aren't really aware how controlling it actually is. And the writing was very well done. Lots of imagery. Overall, I really enjoyed the series and I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a great book that draws you in.

I was convinced by my friend to read the book and I am glad that I did. It was a great read and I could hardly put it down. A few parts were a little slow but for the most part it was an exciting read. You follow Tally through every decision she makes after being turned down for the operation because her friend Shay has run away.Scott Westerfeld does a great job with scene setting, character descriptions, and describing a believable future. I would like to read the whole series soon. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves creative story lines and exciting twists."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My son had to read this book for a summer reading project. We'd asked him how he was enjoying the book and he was telling me about. I thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did. This was a really inventive story. The whole concept seemed to mock our society and the way we view beauty, then twists it off into a whole other dimension. I could totally see the author poking fun at ourselves. Uglyville and New Pretty Town, where if you aren't Pretty and perfect then you're nobody. He totally made a statement and I honestly applaud his creativity in doing so. The characters were well rounded, Tally's point of view was deeply set, so I saw everything right along with her. It kept me reading. I couldn't put it down and made me care enough that I am now looking forward to heading to the library tomorrow to read the next book, Pretties. This is completely out of my normal genre, so I found it a very fun read.Some of the descriptions were a little hard to follow, they weren't quite precise, so I had trouble picturing what he was trying to get me to see, and some of Tally's descriptions of the \\"Rusties\\" stuff, such as the Helicopters, were confusing. It isn't until Shay explains what they are that you finally understand what Tally was looking at, but I found I didn't really mind. And yeah, the plot is uber simple and very easy to guess at. I had it figured out about a hundred pages in. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the book because I got very into the characters. Make me care and I'm yours and he did that. Great read."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a homeschooling mother teaching a dystopian literature class to my grade 9 son and this is one of the young adult selections we are both reading. We both enjoy reading dystopian stories.I liked UGLIES for its fast action and how it serves as a great \\"escape read\\" that pulls you in and carries you away. It is an easy fast read. You feel like you are in the action. The action dominates the story rather than character development though, which is a disappointment for me.I liked the book, I didn't love it, thus I give it 4 stars. The problem with the book in my opinion is that Westerfeld jumped too fast into the action without having done that magic thing that some writers can do where they inform us about who the character is, who they are as a person, while also making us really care about them.Tally, the main character is turning 16 but we don't know a lot about her, what we know is she is a superficial non-thinking person who has been brainwashed. She doesn't question the status quo and is a blind follower. When the book starts off she is an unquestioning drone, happy to finally have approached the day when she will turn from an \\"uglie\\" to a \\"pretty\\" with cosmetic surgery, which is what the government does to everyone when they turn 16.This is a hero's journey tale so I was disappointed that when Tally was forced with a moral dilemma to turn in a former friend in order to gain access to the surgery to become a \\"pretty\\" she quickly agrees (thus making me not like her so much). Furthermore, Tally's lack of common sense and her inability to always think logically to piece together what is really going on shows she is not as bright as I like hero book characters to be. Although her character evolves as the story goes on, and she eventually starts doing more of the right and best thing and to grow into being a non-conformist and a rebel, I would have liked Tally better if she showed those traits from page one. Her stupidity gets people hurt or killed, which was a turn-off. I kept wishing that Tally would just stop and think and put the pieces together but she often did not.What I liked about the book's story is the issue of a society who has decided that its number one priority is external appearance and has gone to extremes to perform many cosmetic surgeries in people over the course of their lifetimes to keep them looking pretty and good looking and thin and perpetually young. I couldn't help but think about how we are partially there already in America and how even in the USA people are starting to look at the fake created body parts and thinking those are the normal way to look then feeling self-disgust at their natural and normal bodies, and the same for changes in appearance due to natural aging. Thus this book brings up important topics to think about and to hopefully discuss.Of secondary importance is the issue of eternal partying and pleasure at being drunk for fun which seems to provide total personal fulfillment to the new pretties. Again this is good food for thought for teens.I enjoyed the aspect of some rebels having left \\"civilization\\" in order to live the old-fashioned way and to live off the land. I liked that the others who are called \\"Smokies\\" have leared the value of hard work and have developed a strong work ethic.The book is full of action which is the type that puts it into my category of \\"this will make a great movie\\". That also makes it good for reluctant readers or those who desire that their reading be fast paced action stories. However, due to lacking a deeper character development it made me put it in the category of \\"this may make a better movie than the book is\\".My last issue with the book is that I felt that Uglies didn't truly wrap up as a \\"full book\\" by the end because I suspect the author's plan from the beginning was to make this a series. At the time I am writing this review, there are five books in the series.I rate this book 4 stars = I Like It."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Fantastic dystopian story that had me from the first chapter. I can't imagine living in a world such as Tally's where you get a pretty operation at 16 and and you get to go live with the pretties. I mean I would really hate living in that kind of world because what one perceives as pretty is not always anothers opinion and Tally soon comes to the conclusion that the dream she has had for so long of becoming a pretty may just be a nightmare instead. I rooted for her 100% when she rebels and takes off to find her friend Shay and to discover what is beyond.... Well actually she wasn't given much choice in the matter at first as she was given the choice of giving up her friends location or never being able to become pretty which at the time was what Tally thought she wanted...it was only later she came to see that things were not all as they appeared."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"i really loved this book i could not set it down! i wish more people would read! i mean if you find books like this you would really want to read more! i mostly read romance and stuff but this book is awesome i have read the whole series i would recamend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is like nothing i've read before.

Tally can't way to become Pretty. Then the summer before her 16th birthday she meets Shay, another Ugly her age, and what happens next challenges her ideas not only about ugly and pretty but about everything she's ever known.Tally is not the most sympathetic protagonist. She spends much of the book arguing with or lying to her friends, and much of the rest trying to fix the problems that those arguments and lies caused. And yet I find myself empathizing with her. She's continually confronted with ideas challenging her entire worldview; it's hardly surprising that she unreceptive at first.The story has a frantic pace from the beginning, which seldom lets up for more than a few pages. If the characters aren't arguing about something, they're hoverboarding at breakneck speed or planning their next \\"trick\\" or worrying about getting caught.Uglies is a great start to great series; it presents a disturbing post-apocalyptic, dystopic world without being quite as dark or gritty as books in those genres tend to be."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Let's just get this out of the way: I will read the rest of them. That being said, the dialogue is horrible. Westerfeld clearly does not know how real teenagers talk to one another.

If it were to be made into a movie, the screenwriter would have to create brand new dialogue, or heavily edit what he has to work with. Dear Mr. Westerfeld, go visit a high school campus.

This book was very interesting and kept me turning the pages. I read the entire book in three days. I've never read a book that fast in my life! That says something right there. Tally, the main character, was well developed and entertaining. I really identified with her (as I think many girls and even boys will too) because she wanted to be beautiful like everyone else, she was self conscious of herself just like most teenagers in today's society, especially girls. We're brought up to think that we're all supposed to look like pencil thin movie stars and guys should look like weight lifters but what people don't realize is that imperfections are what make is human. They're what make us special, interesting and different from everybody else. If we all looked the same life would be extremely boring. Right? This book really made me think about how much the American culture focuses on looks and outer beauty and not enough on inner beauty. Your personality is a major part of who you are and it's more important that what you look like. Not only was this novel insightful but it was also an interesting science fiction book as well. It explained how a society like our own could be turned into a \\"perfect\\" world. It also made you realize that an entire world could cease to exist because of one person's mistake. Life is valuable and you shouldn't take it for granted. The biggest lesson I've taken from this book though is that our society needs to learn that looks aren't everything, personality is key. I'd recommend this book to everyone of all ages. Although it's categorized as a young adult novel, I think that boys and girls, young and old, will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully written book.

When Shay herself runs away to the Smoke, leaving Tally behind to have the operation she is so looking forward to, the authorities (Special Circumstances) offer Tally a terrible choice: go after Shay and turn her and the Smoke in, or never.

Should she betray Shay and her other new friends, or stay with them and be an Ugly forever? This book's exciting plot twists and the controversial subject of everyone being physically beautiful in the same way makes it perfect for teens, but most anyone will enjoy this thrilling novel."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A futuristic teen adventure book that will keep even adult readers enthralled from the first page.Tally is ready to be pretty.

Five stars!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Are you looking for a book filled with adventure, technology, and betrayal? Then read this science fiction book called Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. The setting is in the futer with thing I have never even heard of. What is turning pretty? What are hoverboards? What is the Smoke? All of this and more will be answered if you read the 1st book in this exciting new trilogy, Uglies. Tally, Shay, and David are the main characters who help each other to survive and figure out things they didn't know were possible. In the book Tally has to decide to either betray people she loves and get her life-long wish, or never get her wish at all.I enjoyed this book very much. Science-fiction has never really interested me but Uglies has changed my mind. In this book there is never a dull moment and always a question that could be answered. I plan on reading other books by Scott Westerfeld like Pretties and Specials. Read this book as soon as possible because a whole new adventure and world await you."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought myself and my 13 year old sister a copy of this, we read it together. It was awesome. We couldn't put it down and would discuss each chapter as we went along. We couldn't wait to get the other books in the series and were disappointed when it ended. I'm looking for something else to spark her interest. It was so great to see her reading like that. Since she has really started reading a lot more, Steven King and such, I'm looking for something we can both enjoy together again. I loved this series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"If you are looking for an interesting book that you can't put down, then I have the perfect book for you: The Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. From fun pranks to running away as a spy, this book is full of adventure. Tally is looking forward to turning pretty in a few weeks (in her world you have an operation at age 16 that makes you pretty). But then she meets Shay, who is also just about to turn pretty but is not so sure she wants to. The day before Shay is supposed to turn pretty, she runs away to a place called the Smoke. But it is against the law to run away and to not turn pretty. When it is time for Tally to turn pretty, she isn't allowed to, unless she agrees to become a spy and find Shay and a group of other people who ran away. So Tally decides to go to the Smoke. And with the help of Shay's complicated directions, she is able to reach the Smoke. But while she is there she learns a lot. Not just about how to survive in the wild, but also that the operation changes your brain. After Tally learns what happens from the operation, she decides she doesn't want to turn pretty. But it is too late because the Smoke has been destroyed by Special Circumstances (the people who made Tally go to the Smoke). Luckily, Tally and her friend David get away and later free all the Smokies who were caught. Sadly, everybody finds out it was Tally's fault the Smoke was destroyed, but they forgive her. In the end, Shay had the operation and became pretty. As you can tell, this was a very interesting book. It kept me reading constantly and wanting to know what surprise would happen next. Although I don't usually like books about other worlds that have strange rules or characters, this one was an exception as it was a great book. This was not just an interesting book, but it also had a very important lesson. It doesn't matter what's on the outside, but what's on the inside that counts. If you are looking for a suspenseful, exciting book, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was blown away by this book, and will be recommending it to all readers I know with anything in common with my tastes. Part of its impact on me is due to the low/moderate expectations I set out with. I'll also be singing its praises to younger readers, especially my nieces and other young girls (not excluding boys - but the body image themes are often more relevant to young women. Research shoes that this is changing dramatically to include men, however).I'm an adult reader who likes a bit of a challenge, so I must admit to needing to adjust my expectations a little bit - but that became very comfortable in a short time. A book to really settle into and live in for a while. The advanced and mature themes are as sublime as any I've encountered in other reading - and it would be a real boost for the culture if this book continued to gain popularity.Light sci-fi, beautifully written characters. 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Unfortunately, this book was poorly written. So poorly written I could only read a couple of pages at a time before putting it down and coming back to it another day. Sure, I initially picked up the book understanding it is a young adult novel - probably not a literary novel - I can give it some forgiveness. But the writting was so immensely juvenile I felt I was reading a book meant for 8 year old children. My forgiveness can only extend so far. I am curious why this book is so popular. Sure, I can give it 2 stars for originality."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My 12 year old daughter's first book review:I was very shocked after reading this book.I thought I would have enjoyed it more after hearing good things about it. But it was definitely a disappointment. I found it shallow, slow, and well- boring. The book was drawn out way too long considering it's a series. I was definitely not happy with the main character, Tally. I found her whiny and couldn't really relate to her. I was also upset about how easily Tally and David developed feelings for each other. It seemed like the Author was just trying to force a romance to make the book more interesting.I was expecting the Author to make a point about beauty not being skin deep. Although there were some highlight worthy sentences I was a little let down.I'm also not a fan of the way the book was written. In the beginning, I found the way the Author jumped from Tally to Shay narrating confusing. I'm a fan of having feelings deeply described and that is something else this book lacked.Although, this wasn't a horrible read I'm not going to read the rest of the books. I am a little interested in how Tally will look pretty, but it's just not worth it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The concepts and the heart are great--one might read it as a non-religious meditation on Proverbs 31:30 and 1 Peter 3:3. Maybe that's why it seems that so many Christian women seem to like this series.However, the writing isn't great. To be fair, it isn't horrifyingly ugly, but it isn't especially pretty, either.Writing: 3/5Plotting: 3/5Concepts & heart: 4/5"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the second book I've read by Scott Westerfeld now, and I can tell I will be thoroughly enjoying the rest of his books. The first book I read was Peeps, several months ago. The only reason it's taken me this long to pick up another one of his books is the ever-increasing stack of material on my bookshelves. For comparison's sake, I'm not the target audience of this novel; I'm 30 years old as of this writing.I won't give a synopsis, as there are plenty to read already. Uglies was a dense read- that is, it felt like a richer book than the page count would indicate. The world felt fully-formed, and the writing served that world well. As a reader, one of the things that is hardest to define and yet the worst thing to experience is when the style of writing pulls me out of the story. That never happened to me throughout Uglies. The use of its unique slang felt natural, not clunky, and the main characters were well developed. Some of the secondary characters lacked slightly, but this was not a huge detriment to the experience.I devoured this book in two days. I will be getting the second one in the next couple of days, because I can hardly wait to see what is in store for these characters next. It is a social commentary as much as it is a sci-fi novel, though those two do often seem to go hand in hand. It is rare that I give myself permission to reread a book, since there are so many others waiting to be read, but this will be one series I plan to revisit.Some standardized book questions I'll be asking myself on each review:Was it worth my time AND money?Totally.Will it be seeing a trip to the local used bookstore as a trade-in?Nope!Was there ever a point where I groaned because I just knew X-event had to happen?Yes, but only once, really.Was there anything truly incredible or surprising about this story?Many things caught me off-guard as unexpected, particularly in the YA genre.Did the characters ever act in a way that felt forced or inconsistent with the rules of the universe as the author has presented them? (Or, did the author in any way hijack the characters and sacrifice their realism for the sake of a plot point?)No.Since it is the first in a series, the most important question I can ask is: does it feel like a complete story?I passionately hate books that try to bribe me into reading the second one by not having a complete story. What I mean by this is not that there are no loose ends, but that there is enough of a resolution for me to feel like I bought a complete book. Uglies is bewildering to my psyche because it has such a cliffhanger ending that it's really horrible to not have Pretties on hand, knowing that there is a continuation. However, I don't feel cheated out of a resolution, if that makes any sense at all. I like that it didn't tie everything up neatly, and I feel like the novel could stand solidly alone with my imagination filling in the rest of the events. So, the short answer is that it does feel complete enough.Is it a guilty pleasure?No, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone in the target age group and other adults alike. The story may not be to everyone's taste, but the writing is solid.Two word summary:Mesmerizing, futuristic"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book had been on my recommended list for a long time, but I usually only pick up a YA novel if comes highly recommended from a friend. I came across an advert offering the ebook of Uglies for download and also free. It was a great marketing tactic, because I am definitely buying the rest of the series and probably the other books that this author has written. Uglies was a wonderful book, set in a believable and well thought out world.Tally Youngblood, the protagonist, is not exactly the most likeable character that I have read, but her growth and awareness suck you in, and while might not make you love her, breeds respect.In its entirety the novel is well written, the story line is well laid and the characters possess a depth that is usually lacking in most young adult novels. I also appreciate that romantic entanglements were at a minimum, even though there could have been a lot more. The author focused on the plot and left the other side plots left up to the reader's imagination.I would recommend this book to teens and adults alike who enjoy sci-fi. It is a thought provoking book, with of course that main \\"beautiful\\" theme but also an underlying theme of government interference and conspiracy. I can't wait to read the second installment."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies:This is a great book in a great series. Someone told me that this book was not that great but I thought I would read it. I saw where my friend was coming from but this was not that bad of a book. It kinda had a confusing begging but as it got deaper into the story it grew better and better. I would recomend this book because there is just something about it that makes it great. I have never liked sci-fi I could never finish a sci-fi book. Not saying that their are not any great sci-fi books but this one is one that you just get hooked on. The author at the end of each book leaves you craving more. This book is so intriging. But this is a series you shouldn't give up on. If you don't like the first book I am almost positive you will like the next books. The books get less complicated as you move on.

So much in fact I had to go buy the whole series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Yep. That's right I don't read sci/fi. I like the movies and stuff, but I've never gotten into the books. Also take into consideration I don't like anything this author has ever put out. I always start, but I can never make it past page one-hundred. I like this book. Even with silly little towns like: new pretty town, uglyville . . . I enjoyed this novel thoroughly! It only took me two days to read it.The writing is Ok, just like the book. NOthing great or award winning, but not terrible. What got me caught on this novel though was the idea. That in the future people all become pretty. This means no one is jealous or greedy. Pretty much everyone becomes the same. While the plot is not mind blowing, but the idea and the way the main character finds herself in a world full of brainwashing is nicely done. The end of the novel, is actually, the most gripping part. Leaving you dieing to read the next book.****Fans of sci/fi, future books will love this. But those who only pick it up because a lot of talk about it, will probably just want to get it from the library. The idea is rich and refreshing and worth a try. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What I liked about the book:1. It offers an interesting commentary into society's perception on beauty, which is particularly relevant in an age when people take pictures of Angelina Jolie's lips to their plastic surgeons and say, \\"Make my lips like hers.\\" It's great food for thought and conversation.2. The plot was tightly woven and believable. Westerfeld saved his surprises for the right moments and created a world of extreme fantasy that somehow seemed very real in the context of the book.What didn't completely sell me about the book:1. As a female reader, I didn't identify with the character of Tallie as much as I have with other books in which the main character is a female. I didn't feel like she was enough like me or enough like any of the girls I'd ever met. It had nothing to do with her being a tomboy or a risk-taker or anything like that, it was something more subtle about her interactions and thought-processes that I can't quite pinpoint. I think it might've been that she was portrayed mostly in two ways in the book: 1. as the risky, devil-may-care hell-raiser with not a feminine bone in her body or 2. desiring to be a shallow, plastically beautiful, worshipped Pretty. The truth is most girls are somewhere in between those two.Anyway, all that to say that she isn't as easy to identify with as, say Meyer's Bella in the Twilight Series. I just didn't feel like I really \\"knew\\" her by the end of the book.Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but those of literary sensitivity should know that it is primarily plot driven and doesn't delve as deeply into character development."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"An OK book. Quick read, but not the most original concept. A chapter from the next book, \\"Pretties\\" is included at the end, and I swear the number of times the word \\"bubbly\\" showed up was enough to put me off the series entirely. I understand it's the whole point of being a \\"pretty\\" and how they talk, but I refuse to read dialog that sounds remotely like listening to a slang-ridden tween who can't speak properly."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Have you ever just taken a moment to think of the future? Like what it would be like and what rules we would have to follow? Just imagine at 12 years old having to leave your home and family to go live in a place called Uglyville, and then from there, at age 16 having to go from an \\"Uglie\\" to a \\"Pretty\\". What's your opinion on this? Do you agree or disagree? Agree, or can't make up your mind, maybe reading down further will help.The Uglies is a sci-fi book and the first one out of 3, written by Scott Westerfield. The book takes place in the future of America 300 years from now. In the beginning, in what now is our world was called the \\"Rusty World\\", because at the time we used to much metal and the world rusted and became ruined. From there on, villages were made, starting out the \\"new\\" way of life in different communities, but mainly a community, called Uglyville. Tally Youngblood, our narrator, is an outgoing 15 year old girl just waiting for her birthday to come so she could undergo her transformation. That's all she is waiting for. To become a \\"Pretty\\" and live like a \\"Pretty\\"The whole thing behind the \\"Uglies\\" and the \\"Pretties\\" is that from the time you are born to age 12, you live at home. Then once your 12th birthday hits, you have to move away from home to live in the society of Uglyville. Most of the kids there are just anxiously waiting til their 16th birthday where they will finally undergo their transformation. This transformation that I have been mentioning is that once you turn 16 you are required to get a major plastic surgery done, to change your looks to be what the society thinks to be pretty, but not just that. There are things that not everyone may know about and even things the human eye isn't aware of. Once you get the tranformation from and \\"Ugly\\" to a \\"Pretty\\" you again are required to move into a community where you are with all other people that have gone through the same things you have.Tally Youngblood is one of the kids living in Uglyville that just can't wait to undergo her transformation to a \\"Pretty\\", but her friend Shay, feels entirely different about becoming a \\"Pretty\\". Shay, she has some special information...she has a connection with and outside, rebellious group called the Smoke. Shay soon runs away to join the Smoke, leaving Tally alone in Uglyville. But, she doesn't leave her totally in the dust, which is a plus. Shay leaves behind clues and hints about the whereabouts of the Smoke. Tally then promises to not rat them out.Once Tally soon hears, by a \\"Special\\", (the secret police organization), that unless she reveals the territory of the Smoke, that she is forbidden to getting the surgery; 16 or not. Now, Tally has a decision to make. Will she become a \\"Pretty\\" and betray her friend, or, will she stay loyal and stay an \\"Uglie\\"?There are 2 main themes in this book. One, I'm sure you may already notice, is change. Physical and emotional. Changes happen all throughout the book by the \\"Uglies\\" transforming to \\"Pretties\\" and changing their ways of lives. Not only do their looks change, but their personalities change and the surgery even creates lesions in the child's brain. The other one is \\"the general truth of life\\" and that \\"looks aren't everything\\". That you don't have to undergo a surgery to become pretty, that you have a inner beauty just how you are. This is a quote that I think goes along the lines of the themes:\\"All that you know is that you are, and all that you are is nothing; and as sad as it seems, it is not sad at all, because all that you know is everything\\"Later on, the Smokes did get captured, leaving free only Tally and David. (David is Tally's love). David's dad is dead and his mom has made a cure for the lesions in the brain. Tally tries to get Shay to use the cure, but Shay refuses to take the cure because she has not proven herself. Now, what will Tally do? Will she make the right decision in the end? Will she make the decision to become a \\"Pretty\\" and be the test for the cure, and help out Shay? Or, will she leave Shay hanging without a cure? I guess you will have to find the book and read it...all the way to the end to uncover the question that lies on the table now: What does Tally do?Personally, I can't tell you my favorite part of the book, because it is a spoiler. I will say that in my favorite part I liked the honor and courage that Tally showed, even in the harder times. Also, sadly, I haven't read any other sci-fi books to compare this to, but I think I can say it is a sufficient one.Overall, I think the author did a great job writing the book and getting his point across. He had great writing techniques and good usage of figurative language. If you like a good book with twists and turns, some interesting things that you could imagine in our future, some romantic and action scenes, then this is the book for you. For me, reading isn't number one on my list, but this book, I didn't mind reading and I didn't want to put it down, so if you're like me, then this is also a good book for you to read!Enjoy!

It reminded me of Orwell's 1984 without being so dark. The idea of mind control, Big Brother and so-called utopian society are interesting to think about as we continue the shift toward bigger government in this country. It also addresses relevant ideas about the perception of beauty."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book. While I was hesitant to give it five stars, (I'd say it's a four-and-a-half star book), the entire book left me excited to read more. I bought this book after remembering that a few of my classmates had read it back in the day, and immediately after finishing it, I ordered Pretties. The concept is incredibly intriguing. The characters can get muddled and confusing, such as all the people besides Tally, Peris, Shay, David, and maybe Croy. A lot of the Smokies did not seem like whole individuals to me. Other than that, I think Tally, while unlikable at many points in the story, is realistic because of her flaws. The pressures of her society cause her to put being pretty above all else. If she were entirely perfect and always made the right choices, her character would seem much more fake. The romance was surprising and exciting, like it should be.

This book is appropriate for middle school and higher, but older elementary students can still enjoy it.

I did like this book generally I thought the writing could of been better and the descriptions of things could of been thought out and more descriptive. I have read the synposis for the other books and I don't like the direction of where these books are heading. I think it totally goes agaisnt the whole premise of the book and what you are suppose to take from it. I also would like the author to not think I am a total idiot and I don't need everything spelled out for me. I understand the premise of the book and what he is trying to convey to people, but I feel as though he is shoving it down my throat and not letting me figure it out on my own.This book is for young adults you can tell by the way he writes, so I do recommend it just realize it is a very bland way of story telling to me."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A searching book that asks the reader, \\"How much would I go through, how much would I give up, just to be like everybody else?

Little does she know that her perspective will change as she meets another, a special person who grips her attention.One day as she tries to destroy it, she unintentionally sets off the tracker she had brought with her and ends up betraying not only her friend, but a whole society of people that she had grown to love.

I agree that it was a little predictable at times, and I had trouble connecting to some of the characters, but all in all I loved this book.The author worked hard to create a subtle blend of science fiction and reality, and left a lot to the imagination in the way of what actually happened to our civilization, the \\"Rusties\\".While some of the \\"futuristic\\" lingo and lifestyles got a little irritating at times, I loved the two heroines of the tale, Shay and Tally. They are startlingly real and as independant as any teenage girl who wants a different life. Their search for \\"the truth\\" if you'll take the cliche, leads them somewhere you might not expect.I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, and want to see what will come next in this fantastic and sometimes frightening world of the future."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In Tally's world, you're born ugly. But that's all right, because when you turn sixteen you get a complete makeover, and you become pretty. And being pretty equals happiness. That's what Tally always thought, especially since her best friend Peris turned sixteen and left her for New Pretty Town.So Tally has three months to wait until she herself can join him. In the meantime she meets Shay, a rebel that has the same birthday as her. But Shay's not excited about getting the operation at the same time as Tally. She doesn't want it at all.Shay proves it when she runs away to the Smoke, a place where people can live how they want, without the pretty operation. Tally lets her go- but then she is blackmailed into bringing her back, and she learns that there's a dark side to her town, called Special Circumstances. And there's also a dark side to becoming pretty.Uglies is amaginzly imaginative science fiction, and Scott Westerfeld plays mercilessly on how much we judge by looks. He keeps his book reasonably well-paced, though there are points where he needed to go into description. Special Circumstances was \\"bad\\", that was nailed down. But why? What was up with those people?He also falls into a young adult literature trap- Tally's romance. Though Shay's reaction was classic, believable, and good, Tally's \\"love\\" is not typical teen, especially not for one that's willing to turn in her friend to become pretty. He seems to forget at some points that he's writing teenagers, not old married couples.I have yet to read \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Specials\\", the two sequels, so some of my criticism might be off. But I really did enjoy \\"Uglies\\". It's a good slap in the face to wake us up at how there are so much more important things than looks. There's something real about the world Westerfeld had created- at times you can even wonder if someday we'll actually be living in it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I didn't like this book personaly because it was about a girl named Tally trying to be pretty.I dont like books on people trying to change their image.In the book,on your 16 birthday you get and opperation and it makes you pretty.Well Tally's friend Shay didn't want to be pretty so she ran away.Tally couldnt get her opperation done until the police found Shay.So her life was a nervous wreck for the time being.Tally also had to choose to be with her friend Peris or Shay because one was pretty and one was not.Tally had a big burden on her shoulders.I gave the book 4 stars because it was very good and descriptive and had alot of emotion.I would recommend this book for others to read because it was good but,not a book I would read normally.I wouldn't have changed anything in the book because it was and original well written book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and have begun recommending it to my junior high students. The topic of the \\"perfect\\" person is definitely one of interest in society in recent times and Westerfeld does a wonderful job of describing and implementing how much people actually lose when they gain their beauty. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of ending. I know that it was a cliff-hanger. You need to read the next book to see what happens and there isn't very much closure on the first story. It is as if Westerfeld is telling one story in two books.

This isn't a book; it's a product.No doubt The Uglies raises issues that are important for adolescents to talk about, but they don't need to read a badly written book to talk about these issues. Why did I, an adult, read it (or try to)? Because my son and his friends were complaining bitterly about being assigned this work. Fortunately these kids like to read, but being assigned this book struck a blow against that precious enjoyment.With hundreds of well-written books in print--some of which raise similar issues--why would schools assign this artless and punishingly long production?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Personaly I did not like this book. it is about a girl named tally thats about to turn 16.

After around 20 pages, I was hooked and devoured the rest of it. Soon after I bought the sequel and read the whole series very quickly.Set in the future, Uglies is a suspensful story about an almost 16 year old girl named Tally who is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her birthday. This is when she will get a special operation to make her pretty. She soon discovers that she doesn't want to become pretty. Instead, Tally joins a rebel group called &#34;the Smoke&#34; and meets new people, discovers new things, and gets wiser about the world.I would recommend Uglies to any pre-teens or teenagers ages 10 and up who enjoy a suspensful, fun to read science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Could you imagine a society where everyone looks the same and no one is ugly? In Tally's world, everyone gets to be pretty at the age of sixteen.Or do they? I thought this book had some thought provoking material and was an easy read. The story was realistic even though there were some parts that seemed a little far fetched like the attack on the Specials in the end. There are a couple of themes to the story as well. I felt the characters in the story were likable and easy to relate to. They had ideas and feelings of teens today. I would recommend this book to others and am looking forward to reading the next in the series, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, is addicting. A social satire/ sci-fi story that depicts a world where all people over the age of 16 are made super perfect pretties, Uglies takes the concept of \\"fitting in\\" to the extreme. The main character, Tally, just wants to be a pretty, but then she meets Shay, who doesn't, and things change. When Shay runs away, Tally discovers that being pretty may not be so wonderful. She must traverse the land outside the cities, find Shay, and decide for herself if the life of a pretty is the life she wants.The combination of Tally's internal and external conflicts makes a fast, but not too fast-paced adventure filled with secrets, danger, and even some romance. Uglies sudo-future will appeal to anyone who loves The Giver.I loved this story. The teenaged characters were easy to relate to and the drama kept me at the edge of my set. Tally's conflicts with her friends and her own desires mixed and blended until I had to try just as hard to come up with an answer as she did. I felt Tally's hurt at Shay's angry words, and her slight regret at her final decision, which is the main reason why at the end of the book I was left thinking, \\"What? Where's the rest?\\"Mrs. Sage's ClassCeCe"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Westerfeld's imagination and writing is extraordinary. Every person wishes at some point in their life that they were more beautiful or that they could just change something on their body. Westerfeld takes this idea and turns it around on us.

Uglies is about a girl named Tally Youngblood who is forced to live in a world obsessed with beauty. In the story all teenagers must wait until their sixteenth birthday to get the operation to become a pretty, but before the operation they are known as Uglies. While Tally is waiting for that day to come she meets Shay. Her and Shay have the same birthday so they can get the operation the same day. While they waited for their sixteenth birthdays they did a lot of pranks that they would not be able to do after they were Pretties. So the day before the operation came and Shay had decided she wanted to stay an ugly and run away to The Smoke where all Uglies could stay ugly for the rest of their lives and she had begged Tally to go with her but she wanted to become a pretty. The day of the operation, Tally was not allowed to get the operation unless she turned in her friend. So Tally had to choose over her friend and the operation. This book really relates to the world now and how it is obsessed with beauty. In the book the author also mentions how it was all because of the war and obsession over beauty of our time."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book, and the other ones (Pretties, Specials, and even Extras). These books have a story that constantly demands your attention, while making you question society and your own life. The characters are relatable and loveable.

In the future, as portrayed in Uglies, we won't need such things as we'll be told almost from day one that we are, in fact, Ugly. But never fear, on our sixteenth birthdays we'll be fixed! Every scar we got in falling off our bikes as kids? Erased when they replace our skin with new perfect skin. Our bones molded and shaped to perfection. our eyes? The same. We'll be molded into something oh so pretty.Unless, could the rumors be true? Could there be people who dare to live out in the ruins of the old world, aging naturally, and UGLY? Living as people used to do before we wised up and learned how to be so perfect?This book examines how important it is for us all to not only look but also think differently. At what price does perfection come?Yeah, yeah... a fictional book with messages. Not something everyone will like, but I don't usually like books tagged with \\"Science Fiction\\" and \\"Adventure\\" as much as I like books tagged with \\"Fantasy\\" and I loved this.

Everything was done just right, never too much of any one thing.

You won't be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is what young adult fantasy fiction should be: imaginative, clever, philosophical, character-driven, exciting, deep, and poignant. In Tally's post-apocalyptic world, those ages 12-16 are referred to as Uglies as they wait to turn Pretty through surgery at the age of 16. Then they live lives of mindless partying and pleasure. When Tally's best friend, Shay, decides to run away from their totalitarian city and into the wilderness rather than become pretty, Tally is forced by the Specials to follow. But will Tally be able to betray her friend when she learns the truth behind her beauty-obsessed world? Being pretty might be more than just trying to make everyone equal and create peace. This book is a brilliant, clever, and imaginative fantasy allegory of our own beauty obsessed world, one that is particularly significant to early adolescence. There are no easy answers, but certainly the awful danger of conformity, especially in the case of physical appearances, is powerfully and refreshingly highlighted. The allegory goes further, as well, as it tackles the very issue of moving from the world of childhood and into adulthood (from late high school to college). The book wonderfully and powerfully captures the psychological world of the early adolescent, trying desperately to understand the changes not only in their body and world, but also the daunting future that lies ahead of them as they move out of adolescence and into early adulthood. A great book, absolutely perfect for ages 10 to 16, an easy read, but one that is deeply engaging and meaningful. This book definitely deserves a place on the shelf beside The Giver, and is one of the best fantasy books written for young adults, particularly to capture the psychological world of the twelve year-old. Grade: A"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally lives in the future, when everyone is pretty. Well, not everyone, of course. Babies start off normal enough and grow into normal kids. Those kids grow into awkward adolescents who live in dorms in Uglyville, counting down the days until their sixteenth birthdays.The day an Ugly turns sixteen, he or she is whisked away for the surgery that will turn him or her Pretty. Then the fixed-up adolescent will be allowed to live in New Pretty Town across the bridge, where the only necessary tasks are looking great and attending all of the best parties before growing up into a Middle Pretty and settling down with a partner and a career.Tally is sad and lonely that her best friend, Peris, has turned sixteen and turned pretty before her. She can think of nothing except her own birthday and joining him in New Pretty Town. Then she meets Shay. Shay is also approaching her sixteenth birthday, but has confided that she doesn't want to turn pretty. In fact, she knows of a small village of rebels who ran away rather than having the surgery. Nothing seems more horrifying to Tally, but Shay is convinced that keeping her own face is important.I liked the concept behind this book, and really liked the setup for the next story. I liked the idea of our current civilization breaking down and being replaced by something else, and of the ruins of our cities being fascinating for the children of the future.I didn't much like Tally herself. She was whiny and allowed herself to be thrown into situations instead of making choices about what she wanted. She was stronger at the end of the book, which is a good sign that she might continue to grow throughout the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was one of my first books for young adults based on a dystopian society and began my exploration of this explanding genre. As an adult reading this book well after the series was popular, I wasut to fascinated that teenagers took such a strong interest in such a dark topic that makes the future look so dim. After reading more teen focussed dystopian books and discussing with librarians and teenagers, I have learned that the current generation of teenagers were raised in a world that witnessed 9 - 11, a long foreign war, Columbine, worry over the greenhouse effect, environmental disasters (hurricanes, tsuanamis, earthquakes) and reading these books helps focus their concerns on the future. They don't expect the world to stay a safe place and believe that they will be the generation that has to come to terms with the problems in society and fix them to save the world. That theme is very apparent in the Uglies and its sequels. Conformity and beauty and the most valued traits in this futuristic town. Once adolescents become 16, they undergo an operation that makes them beautiful, separate from the \\"Uglies\\" who are have not undergone the operation. Once the operation is complete, the individuals have no cares or concerns beyond the next party and the current fad. However, a group of teens end up discovering that it is more than appearances that get changed in the operation and work to undercover the reality of their society, creating friendships they never expected, taking risks that bring them even closer together."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I generally don't like anything with a sci fi theme.

It was seriously amazing"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The style of writing reminded me a bit of the Twilight saga, fast-paced, with lots of teenager-style lingo mixed in. I loved all the the little details that created the world of \\"post-Rusties,\\" such as the groups of people - Uglies; New, Middle, and Late Pretties; Special Circumstances; Smokies and New Smokies - as well as the shortened version of names - Tally, Ellie, Sol, Croy, Shay, Peris, Astrix, etc. The way that our world is portrayed in comparison to the world in the book is also interesting in various details such as telling the difference between roller coasters and railroads, Tally's reactions to eating meat and making clothing from animal skins, David still referring to his parents as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\", and Tally finding David's name odd. The reader sees the negative aspect of the way we presently live, as well as the positive and negative aspects to living in the extreme opposite of \\"Rusty\\". It seems that neither extreme is the answer, but rather finding the \\"happy medium,\\" which is rarely ever easy. This post-apocalyptic world fits right in with works such as 1984, Anthem, and Brave New World. I look forward to continuing the series with the next book, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read this book and i will sure be reading the next one.

Tally(She is the main character) can't wait to turn sixteen and get her operation to turn pretty so she doesn't have to live in Uglyville anymore. However, her friend, Shay doesn't want to change how she looks, so she wants to run away to a secret town called \\"The Smoke\\" where nobody has to feel bad about themselves if they aren't pretty. When Tally refuses to come with her, Shay gives her a poem to read and solve the secret message in it that shows how to go to the Smoke if Tally somehow changes her mind. The people who give the operations; called Specials, won't let Tally have her operation until she finds Shay because they don't want runaways. Tally goes on a big adventure to find Shay, and you'll never believe what happens next! The beginning was confusing for me since I didn't know this story took place in the future. There were a lot of exciting surprises that you would never think could happen. I expected a lot from this book, and it was better than that!

Several of the students went on the the sequel, \\"The Pretties\\". I recommend this book to fans of \\"Among the Hidden\\", \\"The Giver\\", or \\"Truesight\\".

At first, I thought it would be a modern book about our twisted high-school society. But it was so much more.Taking place in the future, Tally Youngblood is about to turn 16. She lives in an area where the 'Uglies' and the 'Pretties' are seperated. In this odd town, anyone normal is ugly, and they are brainwashed to believe so. Once Tally turns 16, she will be able to get a surgery to make her 'pretty' and then she will be moved from Uglyville to New Pretty Town.Tally gets anxious as her best friend, Peris, gets his operation and moves to New Pretty Town. She doesn't hear from him, and Uglies aren't allowed to go into New Pretty Town. After attempting to see him, Peris makes Tally promise not to do anything stupid.But Tally soon meets Shay, who doesn't want to be pretty. Before both of Tally and Shay's birthday (which is on the same day), Shay runs away, but not before telling Tally where.Shay is fleeing to a mysterious place called 'The Smoke', where the people of Uglyville who don't want to be pretty go. She leaves Tally directions that only can be comprehended by her, just in case Tally changes her mind and wants to join the Smoke.But Special Cicumstances soon finds out about Shay. They confront Tally, then tell her that the only way they will allow Tally to become pretty is if she tries her hardest to find her friend.But Tally knows Shay doesn't want to be found. But she has to choose soon. Tally has two promises to keep. Her promise to Shay, saying she wouldn't tell. But there's also her promise to Peris, saying she wouldn't be doing anything stupid, and that she would turn pretty. Which is more important? Being pretty or keeping a best friend?And maybe something else happens when you turn pretty... something that's not only skin deep.A great read for ages 12 and up, and recommended to anyone who's looking for a book that will keep them hooked, all while being well written."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think this book was awesome.

If I were writing a review about the book itself, I would give 4 or 5 stars. This review, however, is just for the Turtleback School and Library Binding Edition and intended for librarians.When my previous library-bound copy was lost, I had to order a new copy. I chose this version because it was the only library binding edition at a reasonable price. When I began to process the book, however, I realized that the title cannot be displayed on any surface of the book if I place my barcode and spine label stickers in their usual position. I place barcode labels in the upper-left of the front cover. If I do this, the already hard-to-read title (it is written in a different color, but in line with all of the other titles in the series (ugliesprettiesspecialsextras)). The title on the spine is in the lower portion of the spine in fairly small letters. This is right where spine labels in every library I have ever seen go, and it is completely covered.So in summary, I have to choose between placing my stickers in a different spot for this book, or not being able to see what the title of the book is.

Can't wait to read the next book!!!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I think it brings up a lot of great questions about how we perceive ourselves and others, and I liked the environmental ethics angle as well. Westerfeld did a nice job with the world building here. The whole concept of creating \\"pretties\\" completely freaked me out, and I felt a distinct sense of horror every time the characters spoke so casually of the horrific procedure that leads to becoming pretty.I did feel that some of the characters were a little flat throughout most of the book, especially Tally, but I did see growth there by the end of the book. For most of the book, I was more invested in the plot than the main character, which is unusual for me. Tally struck me as selfish, shallow and one dimensional, and I just couldn't make myself care what happened to her. It really bothered me that the most important thing in her world was getting this ridiculous surgery, so much so that she was willing to betray her only friend to get it. I was more invested in Shay, who seemed to have a lot more depth and frankly, a more appealing personality. By the end of the book, however, I noticed that I had started to identify with and care about Tally. She changed so much over the course of the book and I found myself hoping that she would be able to outrun the consequences of some of her bad choices.At the end of the day I thought this series had an amazing premise, but to me this book was good, not great. It was fun to read, and it was definitely a page-turner, but I didn't feel like it was the kind of book that I would still be thinking about weeks after finishing it. It was really the dramatic ending of the book that compelled me to give Pretties, the next book in the series, a shot. As you'll see when I post that review, I am so, so glad that I stuck with this series!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thought this book was good. It had a great premise.

This book is about Tally-a fifteen year old girl who is about to turn 16 and become \\"pretty\\". Becoming pretty in this civilization is a part of life. When you become pretty you get a surgical procedure to be a certian body size and new facial features. Tally is ready to become pretty and meet up with her friends who have already become pretty. She wants to be friends with Peris- the one best friend she had- again. Now that Peris is pretty and living in New Pretty Town, she is alone to pull tricks while she is still an \\"uglie\\" until she meets Shay- a girl set on running to the Smoak and not become pretty. Shay and Tally become friends in no time. When Tally lets Shay leave in search of David- the one person to take her to the Smoke- alone, she plans on becoming pretty once she is 16, but Dr.Cable- a Special Circumstances worker- tells Tally she either go look for the Smoke on her own or be ugly forever, Tally goes searching for the Smoke. Join Tally on her journy to the Smoke, the people she meets and what happens when the one thing she decides she does not want to happen happens. In my opinon this book was great. It kept my interest and was an easy read. Also the storyline kept moving with twists and turns along the way.This book starts with Tally as the trickster who can break into New Pretty Town without getting caught, to when Tally heads to the Smoke insearch of turing Shay and the other people at the Smoak over to Dr.Cable, to when she causes the biggest problem the Smoak has faced. I found that once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down. I wanted to know what was around the next corner and where Tally would end up. I always thought I knew what would happen next but there were big suprises at the end. I also found the book to keep my attention whether I was around people or by my self, I didn't wan to stop reading until it was over, even then I wanted to start the next book in the series right away.The storyline progresses as Tally starts to think about how life will be after she becomes Pretty. How she wont have uglie problems and life will be a big party. The book changes as Tally learns new things about the place she thought she new so well. There are bigger problems that occure then what Tally initially realizes. As she meets people in the Smoke feelings and trust arise. Tally makes moves that she thinks are small and helpful but become huge and harmful, but the ending of the book is the biggest change you would expect Tally to make.In my opion this book gets a thumbs up because it was a book I really enjoyed reading. I would recomend it to anyone who asked me. I think you should definetly read this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK!!

If you really like books like Hunger Games, Matched, etc. then you'll probably enjoy these books, otherwise it might be a waste of time."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a middle school English teacher and enjoy reading Young Adult literature. I also have seen the Twilight Zone episode, with a very similar story line, and it was an episode that has lingered hauntingly in my thoughts....so when I heard of this series, I was very eager to read it. I don't frequently write reviews, but I had to react to the negative reviews that I saw on this site. Though the story line may not be original, the author writes beautifully, using specific vocabulary and beautiful similes, without, at least in my opinion, holding back the story line. Tally is a well-developed character, thoughtful and fully understanding the consequences of her actions. I saved this book for a three-day weekend but read it all last night and this morning. I was unable to put it down and am planning to read all three books this week. I highly recommend this book for readers who enjoy thinking about what our future will be like. I plan to share the first chapter with my Junior Great Books class. I think it will be great fodder for intellectual discussion."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have not read other novels by the author, but I will be after reading this one. This was an incredibly well written book. The setting was well created and the characters were believable and well developed. There are no great leaps of faith that one has to make with some science fiction attempts. The story line makes sense. You're wondering how could this all work, and just about when you get to the point were you have to have some type of explanation or you're going to get frustrated, the author gives it to you. And I liked the explanations and the logic behind how the world got to this point.Uglies reminds of The Giver, in that the people feel as though they are in a utopia, and the reader thinks this is great to start out with, and then it all starts falling a part at the seams once you begin really thinking about the plot. I like this book because it raises some of the same questions; how much control should we give the people in power, should you question the world around you, what's with all the rules, conformity, but it does it with the whole idea of receiving cosmetic surgery and hoverboards. The science and technology added to this story make it easier to swallow then The Giver."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book on the recommendations I found online and I'm really glad I did. The synopsis has already been well described here. I just want to add my \\"thumbs WAAAY up\\" to all the other glowing reviews. As I read this book, I kept thinking of how the concept of beauty changes so much over time. I wonder what will be considered beautiful in 300 years (about the time this series is set). I was also wondering who got to decide what was beautiful when the operations started, and had it evolved over time. Interesting things to ponder as you read...but making you think is what really good fiction should do."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In this futuristic world, when you turn 16, you get an operation that turns you beautiful. Everyone pretty gets a new house in the glamorous part of town-New Pretty Town. This is where Tally Youngblood wants to be. How can she help it, when all anyone learns in school is how much better life is when everyone is beautiful, and when all the people you know don't call you by your name, they call you by your main imperfection? Tally's best friend Peris has just turned pretty,too. After a daring escape into New Pretty Town(no Uglies allowed-after all, why would the plastic -surgeoned people want to look at a real face?) she meets Shay, who shares Tally's birthday. This means neither will have to leave the other for a single day while she becomes pretty,which makes Tally happy. But Shay is a little unusual. She hates the operation, and wants to keep her own face. Despite tally's protests she runs away to a mysterious place called The Smoke, where runaways can be safe, and stay ugly forever. Repulsive, at least to Tally, who Shay begs to come. But she won't. In just a few days, it's Tally's birthday, her ticket out of the Ugly dorm and gazing out the window at New Pretty Town. She'll be a Pretty. Then, on the long-awaited day there's a problem with Tally's operation. A barely believed group called the Special Circumstances takes the reins, giving Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find Shay and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. And Tally wants to be pretty so much... I could not put this book down. It's not pure unbelievability like some sci-fi, giving good reasons for why society is like this, but it's not boring either, fraught with hoverboard chases and things exploding. I'm totally hooked on the trilogy, and will definitely be reading more of Scott Westerfeld's books in the future. Uglies should be recomended reading."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This a review for the audio book version of \\"Uglies\\" performed by Carine Montbertrand.This is geared towards young adults, but believe me it's a book for any age. Scott Westerfeld is one of the few male authors out there who can successfully tell a story through young girl's eyes and get it right. This book is about a world divided into two parts, just as humanity is, ugly and pretty. Up until your 16th birthday you are considered an Ugly, you go to ugly schools, live in ugly dorms, reside in ugly city all the while dreaming of that one day when you will become pretty and get to live the good life in pretty town. Young girls and boys are told they are ugly by their parents and the government, they think they are too fat or skinny; they have big noses and squinty eyes. All they have to look forward too is that day when they turn sweet sixteen and get to shed their Ugly skins to be \\"normal\\" and pretty. The Pretties live in gorgeous buildings, throw parties all day; they seemingly have no worries and are always happy.I know it seems just too literal, okay young people think they are ugly and when they \\"grow up\\" they will be able to do whatever they want, and pretty people always seem happier. It goes beyond that. Tally Youngblood is our heroine, her best friend Paris has been turned and she cannot wait to join him. She meets Shay and thus begins a quick friendship. Shay soon shows Tally another world, taking her to the \\"rusting ruins\\" on their hover boards (yes I said hover boards you back to the future freaks!) The ruins, are what is left of the \\"rusties\\" which you figure out are basically us, but so far gone and abandoned now its all being taken back into the earth, rusting. That world, the Uglies are told, had wars and famine and everyone was unhappy, so the scientist \\"cured\\" all that by mandating the surgery and therefore \\"saving\\" society.Shay doesn't believe this is right, and tells Tally of another society, a secret one called the \\"Smokies\\" and she is joining them before turning 16. Tally is shocked! How could Shay WANT to stay ugly forever? Shay leaves, but not before asking Tally to go with her, but Tally doesn't want to be an ugly anymore...she wants to be happy so she stays, Shay does give her a map just in case she changes her mind. The government on the other hand connects Tally to the Smokies and blackmails her into finding Shay, if she doesn't she will stay Ugly forever.I won't give everything away, but I will say that the rest involves Tally finding out who she truly is, and what she is capable of. You get to find out what the Pretties actually are, and why, and what exactly lies outside of Ugly and Pretty town. You also get to hear about the \\"Specials\\" which are Pretties but with deadly skills.I cannot recommend this book enough, it's a quick read, its not Kierkegaard but its pretty darn fascinating nevertheless. The reader of this audiobook does an excellent job! I cannot wait to read the second in the series \\"Pretties\\"."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first sentence of this book nearly lost me. \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit?\\" I nearly missed the very decent prose of the next paragraph because I was still reeling from the shock of that first line. I mean, if you want to use a metaphor to evoke color, please use something that has a definite color. Might as well have said the sky was the color of a smelly beach towel.By the end of the first page I realized that \\"cat vomit\\" had nothing to do with the sky but was more a metaphor for how the point of view character felt about life in general. It isn't hard to see why she feels wretched. She's been waiting all her life for the operation that will make her pretty: gorgeous features, perfect body shape, big beautiful eyes, so that she can look like all of the other sixteen-year-olds and join them in their eternal pretty party across the river. Right now she feels ugly and petulant, and has nothing better to do than sneak out and break the rules by trying to find her best friend, who already turned pretty and lives in that other glittering world she is waiting to join.Then she meets someone else, someone who isn't sure that turning pretty is all it's cracked up to be. Pretty soon our heroine is entangled in intrigues, underground resistances, espionage, betrayal, and even gets to do a little smooching on the way.The book is full of interesting ideas. Hoverboards are REALLY COOL. I wish I had one. The issues of body image and judging people on looks are dealt with in a thought provoking manner, and there's also some environmentalism and remarks on the evils of totalitarianism thrown in there. I enjoy Westerfeld's prose, direct and colorful. He is endlessly inventive with his imaginary technology, and the world he has created is interesting to consider as a fable if not entirely believable as a possible future.On the other hand, it wasn't a deeply satisfying read. The constant hair-breadth escapes are fun at first, but eventually grow tedious. By the end I wasn't even paying attention to how they \\"got out of that one.\\" I knew the author would contrive some way for them to manage it. The characters all seemed a little thick: good guys, bad guys, everyone seems to be thinking far too little about what's going on and what they really ought to do about it. The pacing in the middle was so slow I put the book down for a whole week. The second half did draw me along well enough, but at the end I was once again questioning everyone's competence.It was a good book, don't get me wrong. It was well worth reading, but it had some problems. Nothing really offended me, but younger children wouldn't understand a lot of the issues. I recommend it for ages ten and up."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\"How can you beat that for an opening sentence?!? I laughed when I read it!I've heard great reviews about this trilogy (Which I recently found out actually has a 4th book. To my knowledge it was planned as a trilogy.). I picked up all three off of Craigslist for $3. I have to tell you, I read the back and wasn't sold. It sounded totally stupid to choose between having an operation to turn you pretty or betray your friend forever. I was wrong. It was so much more complicated than that.Life for Tally is in a post-modern world where everything has changed. We are the \\"rusties\\" and children go and visit the \\"rusty ruins\\" on field trips. I thought that was great!. The world changed because of prejudices. People who were taller, prettier, with flattering figures got all of the jobs. They were held higher in society. So things began to change. Now in Tally's world, at the age of 16, everyone has \`the' operation. They are made pretty. It's a pretty horrific process involving drastic plastic surgery of the whole body. Everyone has the operation. If you don't, you have no place in society.When the Specials tell Tally that she can't have the operation if she doesn't help them find Shay, it isn't such a simple, petty thing. They send her back to the dorms to live with all of the other Uglies. She can't even go and live with her parents. She basically has to give up life to protect her friend. Hurting and affecting not only herself, but all of her friends and family. A hard choice for a 16-year-old to make.I loved the imagination involved in creating Tally's world.I did have a hard time getting into the book. In fact, I set it aside to read L.J. Smith's The Vampire Diaries~ The Awakening and The Struggle. It wasn't bad in the beginning, I just didn't get into it at first. It was slow-moving.Once I got to the end of Part I, I was hooked. I'm glad I stuck it out. Tally's point of view totally changes when she realizes more about the Smokies (the Uglies who have run away) and what really happens during the operation. She learns to love the Smokie way of life and finds herself feeling beautiful as an Ugly. It really is a dig at the social biases that effect our lives today and a \`what if' future if we continue life this way. For me, the book dragged a bit at the end as well. Overall though, it was a very well thought-out book and was enjoyable, once you get past the slow parts.Please come and visit me at my blog, Between the Lines, at [...]. I'd love to hear from you!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The whole premise and plot of this book and series is very interesting. However, the narrative itself is pretty terrible. Good YA books relate to the concerns of the audience without dumbing down or being fake. Then, on the other hand, there's those condescending authors who think of teenagers like another, inferior species of animal and construct some poor and slightly insulting bad caricature of what they 'think' they are like for purpose of their books and narration.Another problem: It's nice to show the fun activities Tally gets up to like hoverboards and rollercoasters. But some huge distracting scene of them messing around with them is suddenly dumped in as she gets distracted, whenever something critical with the plot recently happened and SHOULD be being advanced instead, and often these are near-useless or unnecessary scenes.Seriously, the teenagers - particularly if they are 16, like the protagonist, reading this book probably don't have 'ADHD' and do NOT want to be led off on some 'distraction' about hoverboards and rollercoasters every time some critical development in the plot - a cliffhanger - demands further advancement. You'd also think Tally herself would be mature enough by now to also not be distracted away from the more pressing concerns (that risk her life!) every 5 minutes.For a perspective, I thought Twilight was pretty mediocre and not deserving of all the accolades it got, but its narrative in terms of actually connecting to the reader and target markets is light years ahead of this. I think this book will only be non-annoying to the really young 'young adults', not ones which are the protagonists' actual ages.Also, a good book set in a time other than the present, shows the common concerns of the character for the reader to relate to, but does seem like they do live in that imaginary other time or society. Tally seemed a bit to me like a teenager from our time suddenly sent to some weird 'summer camp' with cool technologies since maybe a year or so previously."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Mr. Westerfeld has established a very good reputation as a writer of imaginative and engrossing YA science fiction, and this book is a prime example of how he has earned that reputation.The palette for this book is a society that has declared that everyone must be pretty, and achieves that goal through a set of medical operations at age sixteen, so that no one will end up with the misfortune of having less than stellar looks, thereby eliminating many of the conflicts associated with people who look \`different'. Those in the \`tween' years of 12 to 15 are, of course, comparatively ugly, and are typically known by that moniker, as opposed to the \`littles', the \`middle pretties' - those in middle age, and the \`crumblies' - still pretty, but old. Pretties get to party all night and all day, with practically whatever they want delivered on demand through the convenient service outlet in their rooms. The uglies, of course feeling somewhat left out, often try to trick their minding sensors and crash the pretty parties, with some more successful than others.Tally Youngblood is one such ugly, an inventive, bright fifteen year old, only a few weeks away from her pretty operation. Her \`tricks' to enter the pretty society across the river and her friendship with another ugly, Shay, eventually lead to her being noticed and unwillingly being recruited by the Specials, a shadowy group that seems to actually be in control of this society, to help find and destroy a small group of renegades from this utopia who live in the wilds. Her travels in pursuit of this goal eventually lead her far from the city and just as far from the mental viewpoint it encapsulates.Tally is well drawn as a young girl with perfectly understandable goals and emotions. The problems she faces have immediate and forceful impact on not just her worldview, but on the reader's. The challenges are not small molehills of little larger relevance, but in fact have great import in her development while at the same time allowing the reader to see and think about the problems of such a society and what the alternatives to it are. All of this is done without any preaching or overt philosophizing, in very clear prose.I did have a few reservations about just how the economy of this society actually worked, as only hints were given about just what the middle pretties did, how things were manufactured, or just what technology was really behind some of the gadgets. But these were pretty small quibbles compared to the presentation of Tally's character and those around her, both those sympathetic to her and those wishing to control her.This is only the first book of this trilogy (actually now four books), so the end of this book leaves a lot of threads hanging, but it does manage to conclude the initial scenario quite well, and shows us a Tally who is a far cry from the Tally at the beginning of the book. It perhaps is not a great sf book, but it's a whole lot better than some of the \`adult' material being published today, as it is quite accessible by people who don't have Ph. D. in rocket science, while still being both quite inventive and with quite a bit of meat hiding behind it's story of one girl's growth.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I liked UGLIES quite a bit. It's like Brave New World, a book about the hidden dark side of utopia, but written in shades of gray instead of Huxley's black and white. In Westerfield's world, social control and brainwashing leave citizens with enough independence that the benefits just might be worth the costs. Life is pretty good - everybody is provided with all the material goods they may need, surgically crafted physical beauty suited to their age and station, the freedom to indulge in youthful tricks and, later, adult pleasures.Almost everybody is happy - and, tell the truth, who wouldn't willingly trade a few brain cells for a lifetime of happiness? I sure would. But the few people who prefer a hard life with their own looks and their own thoughts to brain-damaged, supermodel paradise escape to found a city of their own, called The Smoke. Unfortunately, the kind of people who are drawn to The Smoke are exactly the individuals that the City can't afford to lose - the smartest, the bravest, the toughest. That's not ok, and the city will do anything to get the escapees back and integrate them into the system.Tally Youngblood is smart and brave, but she's also fifteen years old. She's easy to identify with, but she makes some horrible choices, all of them born out of the desire to fit in that motivates most teenagers most of the time. She's a kid, and you can see her learning from her mistakes and trying to do better, but she's been forced into a dangerous game and the stakes are very high.The plot's been summarized elsewhere, so I won't repeat it here. I liked the fact that the bells and whistles of Westerfield's future served the story, rather than becoming the subject of the book. I liked the fact that Westerfield is playing with a lot of really big ideas, but never becomes heavy-handed with them. I liked the fact that Westerfield doesn't coddle his characters. And I really liked Westerfield's writing, which is utterly brilliant."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What I love most about this series is Westerfeld's voice through his characters. The characters are different than those written by women and it shows in many of the personalities. For example, while most books in this genre have in depth detail about the way the girl feels while a boy is holding her hand, Tally seemed to have a stereotypical males take on the world. She wasn't giddy while daydreaming about her next kiss. She was more about action packed scheming and uncovering the truth, and she used her relationships to further her own agenda. I love this personality in a heroine as its quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is your classic Brave New World rewrite. It is YA, but I couldn't get through it all the way, and neither could my teen daughter. The writing is fairly good, the idea is pretty cool, but somehow it just doesn't get anywhere. For a long time, the main character doesn't really have a goal they are trying to get to. And as they \\"go off the grid\\" and start meeting people in other circles, there's this strange feeling that comes over the reader that the author doesn't really know how his world works. It feels like he is making it up as he goes along, and could have used an outline."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Honestly, I did not think that Uglies sounded very intriguing when I was first introduced to the book; I only started to read it because of my friend's great persuasion skills. However, once I gave it a chance, I was pulled into the plot swiftly and could not put it down. Westerfield's creative ideas fascinated me! They forced me to ponder on how our world might be in the future, and the oppressing reality of society's definition of \\"beauty\\" that women and men alike have to put up with in order to gain some precedence in the world.Usually when I read a book, it's most annoying if I can predict the entire plot within reading the first chapter or two. That did not happen when I read Uglies. I hardly knew what would come next, and only twice was I able to predict the next move.Uglies is 425 pages long, but a very easy read. Even with my busy life, I was able to finish it in a day and a half. It kept me anxious to know more, and when I closed the book at its end, I felt a hint of disappoint that I had to give it back to my friend.To anyone who likes a fast-paced, easy-to-read, creative narrative, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like this book.

Tally has a friend named Shay, who doesn't want to turn pretty. Shay runs away to a different society that lives like we do today. Then Tally is forced to find Shay under the treat that if she doesn't bring her back to the city, she will never turn pretty. Tally is torn between turning in Shay, but turning pretty and not turning Shay in, but not becoming pretty. If you want to find out what happens to Shay and Tally, read this book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Book ReviewUgliesScott WesterfeldIn a twisted futuristic world one dream holds Tally from insanity: to be Pretty. But a mysterious disappearance, a myth revealed, and a long journey are in her way. Could she ever change her mind? This was an excellent, intriguing book that kept me guessing and interested and left me wanting the next in the series. It has a good point, a great description, and interesting characters. It has a wonderful plot and a slightly romantic side. Uglies describes how our world could be like if we continue obsessing over looks. And that is not a good thing. But the main character, Tally, has a great personality so you really get to know her. You get so involved in this book, you can't put it down, and then there are 2 others you just have to read. So I would definitely recommend reading Uglies, if you want a thrill and a mystery and anything in between.Review by Kaylie Crowley"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies by Scott Westerfeld was an exceptional book! A teenager by the name of Tally is exited for her 16th birthday when she will become pretty. Everyone does and anyone who hasn't had the operation is thought to be ugly. However, she meets a new friend Shay who is very independent and not so thrilled to look and act like everyone else. At first Tally just thinks she's absurd and doesn't pay attention. Unfortunately, she is forced to when Shay leaves and Tally receives the ultimatum to find Shay or never turn pretty. I found myself asking what I'd do in her situation, betray my best friend or live with what I thought was a horrible punishment? What would you do? In addition, Tally discovers secrets she never thought possible. There was a quote I thought related to this in the story. \\"There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.\\" -Francis Bacon. I especially enjoyed how it was science fiction yet portrayed so believable. I loved this book and can't wait to read the second and third books in the trilogy, Pretties, and, Specials; I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"...to read and enjoy young adult books, especially this one!

It was a little weird at first, but I got really into it and finished the book within a week or two. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's into dystopian romance. The romantic part of this is nothing crazy - just a high school kid crush really."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a fun and quick read for me. The future world that Scott Westerfeld created was very intriguing and described so well that I felt I could imagine it perfectly in my head. There was clearly a contrast between Uglyville (dull, boring, etc.) and New Pretty Town (fun, colorful, exciting).The premise of Uglies is very sad: Tally spends her whole life pining for the time when she turns 16 so she can be \\"pretty\\" and go live in New Pretty Town to finally have fun. It's a representation of the importance society puts on looks, but it also reflects the feelings of teens who just want to fit in. Tally doesn't want to be the prettiest girl after her surgery, she just wants to look like the rest of the popular kids who live in New Pretty Town. Sameness is desired while uniqueness is seen as ugly with no exceptions.I think Scott Westerfeld did a good job making his point though I wish there was a little more explanation of the world Tally lives in. For instance, I'm not sure what the deal is with the adults in this world. Her parents and teachers seem to be just as clueless as Tally. Apparently that's just the way life is in this world, but I'm still wondering why?A great idea for a book, this story just needs a little more fine tuning for me."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'd heard about the Uglies series through one of my cousins and while looking for something new to read, I decided to try it out. Set in a dystopian city that is likely way-past-post-nuclear LA/Hollywood, children or \\"littlies\\" are raised with their parents until they reach 11. At this point they become \\"uglies\\" and are sent to some dormitory to live out the next 5 years of their ugly existence on the outskirts of the city. On their 16th birthday, they get to have a massive full body plastic surgery operation that transforms them into a \\"pretty\\". Then they get to go live in New Pretty Town and just party and drink and go nuts.It's obviously a pretty disgusting concept and something you'd expect from such a superficial city like Hollywood, which is what made me think it was located there. Later books seemed to confirm it.The protagonist of the story is 15 year-old Tally Youngblood, a girl who can't wait to become pretty, but ends up faced with being ugly forever when her friend gets her into trouble.Although the book was a page turner, I didn't feel passionate and obsessive about the characters. In fact, I barely cared about any of them at all, which is confusing because I can't really figure out why I read all three books in the series so fast. Perhaps it was the world Scott Westerfield created that kept me captivated. I found Tally to be annoyingly shallow and indecisive and the book was pretty predictable at times. I had a really hard time envisioning the hoverboards, too.All in all, this was what I would call a great \\"summer beach book\\", but not something that would make me to visit fan sites or go crazy over a movie version."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The premise was interesting, but none of the characters have any personality! Everyone in this novel is 2-dimensional, making them utterly boring. I can't take any more of this, I won't continue with the rest of the series"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm sure I'm close to the last person in the blogging world to read the Uglies series but that's ok. I am now and I'm loving them. Uglies by Scott Westerfeld was a great read for me. I enjoyed it so much that when I finished it I moved on to Pretties right away (already finished that one too-review on it's way). What a great series! Anyhow, on to what I thought of Uglies.Uglies is about a post-apocalyptic world where everyone is changed to a pretty when they turn sixteen. The purpose is if you make everyone pretty then nobody can be judged on their appearance alone - everyone is on equal ground. The rest of the world, our present world presumably, has been destroyed; they called the people of this world the Rusties. The Pretties are pretty much mindless people living life to the fullest or as full as you can when you really don't do any thinking anymore and the worst thing is they don't even realize this is what has happened to them.The book centers on Tally Youngblood. She's fifteen and living in the dorms for uglies while waiting to become a pretty on her sixteenth birthday. She can't wait; she longingly watches out her dorm window towards where the pretties are always partying. As well her friend Peris turned pretty before her and she's lost without him. They were best friends and she can't wait until they are together again.Then Tally meets another girl with the same birthday as her - Shay, and they become fast friends playing tricks together and causing the normal 'ugly' trouble. Shay is different from Tally's other friends though. She questions becoming pretty and takes Tally to the Rusty Ruins and tells her about some mysterious place called the Smoke where uglies live like normal people. This makes no sense to Tally. Why would anybody not want to become pretty but it seems that Shay doesn't.On Tally's sixteenth birthday she is ready to go and have her operation and be a pretty. Imagine her surprise when she's told she can't become a pretty until she finds Shay who ran away and leads the Specials to the Smoke. At first Tally resists but then realizes that there is no way she'll have the life she wants if she doesn't do this. So, she agrees to find Shay and the people of the Smoke.What Tally doesn't expect when she finds the Smoke is that these people aren't so bad and neither is this life. Unexpectedly Tally finds that she cares about these people and doesn't want to expose them but is it too late? Is it too late for all them, including Tally?Uglies is a great look into what a society would be if people were manipulated into what those in higher power wanted for them. This book is action packed and keeps you turning the pages until the early morning hours to finish. Keep an eye out for my review of Pretties coming up soon as well."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought the book after a friend push me at a book store and it is not a book I normally would buy. The title and the cover put me off but this turned out to be a great example of do not judge a book by its cover.I loved the book and could not put it down once I started reading it. The story just kept me hooked. End up having to buy the rest of the book so I could get the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The government has found a new way to control the masses - make them all pretty! Who would want to rebel or cause trouble when they are beautiful and can party all the time? In Scott Westerfeld's novel \\"Uglies\\" we are introduced to a dystopia society where at the age of 16 everyone grows up by undergoing a surgery to become a \\"pretty\\". Society has been separated into categories of littlies (0-11), Uglies (12-16), Pretties, Middle Pretties, and late Pretties.The only thing Pretties need to worry over is how to look good and have fun. Tally Youngblood, an Uglie, only dreams of turning 16 and becoming a pretty, that is till her friend Shay runs away, to live outside the city with rebel Uglies in a town called Smoke. When time comes for Tally to finally to become her dream of a Pretty she is informed if she doesn't betray her friend she will die an Uglie!Torn between her dream of being a Pretty and her promise to her friend, Tally must decide which is more important her loyalty to her city or her friend. Tally is hurled into a journey of discovery of herself and the horrid secret of what being a Pretty really means.Over all this novel was an enjoyable read that left me wanting to keep reading the tale of Tally Youngblood. The storyline is well written and is a novel way of showing how being beautiful could be taken way too far in a society. I enjoyed the story and the characters but for some reason toward the end of the tale I became disinterested in going on. I think maybe it was because the shift in Tally's behavior or maybe the story lost something, I am not sure. I still finished the book but I don't think I will probably get the second in the series. I think most people will love this story and want to read all the books in the series just from what I know of my friends tastes. So I will be sure to recommend this out as a good read."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I recommend Uglies and the next book, Pretties. I'm not an avid reader, but these books were so interesting. The series is about a girl named Tally and her society. If you're like me and love books with societies that take concepts to the extreme like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, you'll like this book. I feel we can learn a lot about ourselves by examining different and warped societies.I love reading the adventure and seeing Tally learn and change. It isn't a light tale. I don't want to give too much away, but the premise is this: Tally's society priority is beauty and the technology they have allows them to be, but at an expense. I really enjoyed the books and I hope you will too.Pretties linkPretties (The Uglies)All 4 books linkUglies (Boxed Set): Uglies, Pretties, Specials (The Uglies)"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought the audible version without knowing anything about the book - just thinking that it was something my teenager daughters and I could listen too. Although it took a bit of time to get used to the reader's voice I think she did a good job. I love how the voices changed as the characters evolved. On balance, I would recommend reading the book rather than listening to it because the series is so thought provoking.

This series is amazing as well. Fun and fast reading."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a dystopian, taking place in a world where everyone was \`Pretty.' Becoming pretty was as simple as a medical procedure immediately after a sixteenth birthday. Until then, everyone was an Ugly, no matter what they looked like. When Tally's new friend Shay ran away to The Smoke, Tally had to track her down and turn her in or she would have ended up Ugly for life. I found the plot to be unique and thought Westerfield presented it in an interesting way. He made it seem like this was a normal way of life for these people, not just some weird science experiment.The dialogue was different, though not hard to follow. There was a lot of invented slang (i.e. crumblies, middles, littlies) and futuristic things (i.e. hoverboards and bungee jackets) but the basics were easy to get. The kids didn't have much respect for the authority figures in their lives and it showed in the way they spoke. The characters weren't remarkable or even unlikable. They were just...average. Tally was desperate to become Pretty and I found her level of commitment to having the procedure a little over the top. Although, in a world where this was simply the norm, that made sense. Shay and Peris were underutilized, I thought. I never really learned much about Shay or why she chose to join The Smoke. Peris was almost a noncharacter and I didn't understand why Tally wanted to join him so very badly. I thought David was the most complete character in the book, and he was also my favorite.There was a bit of romance and I thought it was realistic and sweet. There were lots of adventures and plenty of action, mostly after Shay disappeared and Tally set off to find her. The trigger that led to the final battle was so predictable, I didn't appreciate that. As soon as it happened, I thought \\"Well, that was stupid. That's going to end badly.\\"I liked the narrator okay. Her voice was slightly grainy sounding, but I got used to it quickly. I liked that she didn't try too hard to make the male voices sound low. Sometimes that can really backfire but she just lowered her pitch a tiny bit and I thought it was perfect.The cover is fairly unremarkable, not giving away anything or hinting at what the book could be about.As reviewed on [...]."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I got this book because I heard it was somewhat similar to The Hunger Games which I liked. I did like this book overall because I thought it had great plot points and the 'underlying' lessons were very real to today society. It really makes you wonder if it is something that could happen 300 years from now with advancements & the way the described the falling of our current world could be a very real thing with the wars, crimes, & trying to scientifically engineer EVERYTHING.I would have rated it 5/5 but some of the plot points were very unneccesary such as the whole \\"you stole my boyfriend\\" thing. While reading it I literally thought \\"Really?! PULEASE!!!\\" Although it is something that happens in high schools and even middle schools, & this is a young adult book, it seemed VERY childish with, actually, a very mature storyline.

Tally is extremely excited and is counting-down the days until her birthday when she'll be able to go to New Pretty Town and be with all of her friends who have become pretty already, until she meets Shay. Shay and Tally have the same birthday and become friends in the time just before they turn 16.

Shay asks Tally to join her, however Tally declines and is totally ready to become pretty, until she is sent on a secret mission by people in her society.

But the harder decision comes when Tally learns some unsettling secret information about the Pretties and is faced with a decision to either betray Shay and her new friends, to become pretty and party, or to stay loyal and keep her friendships, but never turn pretty at all.My favorite part of the book is when Tally escapes from the smoke when special Circumstances arrives. I like this part because I think it really shows how smart and courageous Tally is. And I think that is \\"action-packed.\\" I also like it because it is unclear as to what will happen next and how things will turn-out.I highly recommend this book. I think it is great and is awfully hard to put down. It is definitely an action filled book and is quite exciting.

It is engaging, thought provoking, and will keep the reader wanting more.The third book was my least favorite. Compared to the first two, I expected, wanted more. With that said, it is still a very good book, just not as powerful as the first two. For me, it didn't give me the same connection with Tally as the other two. The others books just seemed to have a stronger personal outlook through Tally's eyes than the third.Again, excellent series and definitely worth the great adventure it will take you on. So, you are probably wondering where the BUT comes in. I had just finished reading the series on New Years Eve day.

For me, it kind of took the \\"originality\\" out of the series. It was merely just an expansion of ideas put out there by Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. Imagine my disappointment!The trilogy I give 4 stars because it was excellently written, and it expanded on a concept plainly laid out in the Twilight Zone, but I could not give it 5 stars, because it now lacked originality and the series lost its \\"uniqueness\\" and isn't that what this series is truly about: finding your own \\"specialness\\"?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was wonderful and intriguing until the very last page I can't wait to read the second one!!!!

The rationale for this radical surgery is that having big eyes, full lips, flawless skin and a perfectly symmetrical appearance makes people like you. It's simply human nature. Therefore, a society of people who all like each other at first glance will be peaceful, happy, and most of all, beautiful. Which is why the pre-teen Uglies are literally quarantined in their own school, with Pretty Town just across the river, beautiful and mocking.In my estimation, the Junior High Years were awkward enough without society constantly reminding you that you are 'Ugly' and therefore worthless the way you are.Needless to say, Tally is pretty excited about turning 16, becoming Pretty, and starting her 'real life'. She sees herself as flawed and terrible and worthless until that exciting surgery. When a new friend of hers disappears instead of undergoing the operation, Tally is implicated as a witness. Sure enough, Shay gave her cryptic instructions to follow her to The Smoke - a place where people can live how they want, and oddest of all, stay ugly forever.When Tally decides to betray Shay by infiltrating the Smoke for the Specials (read: scary bad guys responsible for keeping this seemingly perfect society in line), it doesn't feel like she had a choice at all.How could she stay Ugly?And then, out in the wild, she starts to discover her own mettle and worth. She learns to rely on herself and others. She begins to see Real Humans as... well, normal. People. Pretty or not. She discovers the real reason that everyone undergoes an invasive surgery, and decides she's never going back.Until the Specials show up.I loved the salute to 1984's Newspeak, which gets even better in the sequel."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When Amazon says three stars means \\"it's ok,\\" I take it at face value. This one was neither good, nor was it bad. Probably better for slightly younger readers who may not be able to handle something like The Hunger Games and can overlook the sometimes strained dialogue.This book boiled down to 75% repetitive description of hoverboarding, 15% description of how ugly/pretty people are (using a very limited set of vocabulary words), and 10% something actually happening. I liked Tally's sense of adventure, and her opening scene visiting the pretty village was riveting. At first it seemed like a pretty good world was being built and it definitely sucked me in quickly.However, after the initial climb up the hill, instead of a thrilling ride down, there was a mild decline that provided some interest but nothing spectacular. The setting plateaued and was unnoticeable for the remainder. The characters began verging on being cliches of what teenagers \\"should\\" be like. The story was solely responsible for advancing itself because the characters had little depth beyond thinking about outward appearance and a forced romantic relationship. Even when Tally starts realizing she likes it better in the Smoke, the author doesn't truly let the reader in on that process.I'm very much an advocate that readers need to have a moment where they consider whether a character is well-drawn/makes sense in the world they have grown up in. While I can see where she would be obsessed with little other than becoming a pretty, there was something off. Maybe it was that Tally actually felt a little too much like she could have been from our world? I can't really put my finger on it.Now, I have to grant this novel that it was ahead of the curve on teen dystopians. I'm sure without the great books that have followed in recent years to compare it to, it would have been more spectacular for me. Overall, certainly a decent addition to the YA canon, but not stellar."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Book one in this series, Uglies, was an enjoyable enough beach read. It wasn't great literature (the author seems determined to never use a word that would send even the shakiest reader to the dictionary), but there is a place for \\"junk-food\\" books in this world. Uglies is the sort of book that one reads to relax after Crime and Punishment or The Grapes of Wrath. It's like pulp fiction: it offers comfortable, escapist, insubstantial fun. And it was fun"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I found this book slow to get into at first but once you get through the boring beginning of the book it is such a wonderful adventure.

I was interested in how the story would turn out, but it took quite long for me to really get into the story. In the beginning, I thought I'd only want to read this first book of the series, but now that I have just finished the book I do want to continue the series, just not right now. So my mind changed a lot during this book. It was not bad at any point, it kept getting better and better from the ok start. I would've given the last half of the book 4 stars.So I liked the story. But I would have wanted a little bit more out of the characters. In the beginning I also felt that at some points an event was rushed to get to another point in the story. If the story would have been written a little differently, with the emphasis on the events that were written at the last half of the book and a little more introducing the characters, I would have given it more stars. If I did not too many books to read right now, I would continue the series immediately because the ending of this one..well you know how they make these books! :)"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A bit slow but the premise is really interesting.

It looked like just another dystopian, but it was something more than that. It's what set the stage for these zillions of other dystopian YA novels to follow, and many have had a tough time measuring up to it.I think I had a hard time with the story at first because it seemed to follow the same structure of so many other books I've read. And then it dawned on me that this was actually written before nearly all those books! I still found the plot somewhat predictable, but enjoyed it more so after.It was kind of hard to connect with Tally at first because of how warped her views were, but as she learned more about the real world, she became much more relatable. On the other hand, I really liked Shay from the beginning, but as Tally grew more distant from her, I began to like Shay less.The world held many familiar elements from our world, but everything was so skewed. The way that people had been taught to think was really foreign and strange. And after learning some plot-spoiling secrets, I found myself dying to learn more. I wish there'd been more explained behind how the world came to be this way, but I guess that's what the other books are for!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read this entire series very quickly. The few weeks after reading it I kept finding myself saying things like \\"This is dizzy-making\\" and adding -wa to the end of everything. This is an amazing book and is much better than the Hunger Games."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Like Matched and The Hunger Games, Uglies takes place in the future. First, you are a littlie and you live with your parents. Second, you are an ugly. When I say ugly I don't mean it was an adjective. I mean it as a label. You become an ugly when you are about eleven or twelve and then you go and live in the dorms in Uglyville. When you are sixteen years old you become a pretty and go to live in New Pretty Town. To become a pretty you have surgery done. Like an ugly, pretty is a label and not an adjective. After a new pretty, then you become a middle pretty, and finally an old pretty. Old pretties go and live in Crumblyville. The people have hover technology and the buildings are also high-tech. Uglies is about a girl named Tally Youngblood who cannot wait to turn into a pretty. Like all uglies, Tally loves to pull tricks because once you turn pretty you stop doing all that kind of stuff. One night when Tally goes off to see her friend Peris in New Pretty Town she meets a girl named Shay. The two of them become friends quickly. In so many ways the two are alike yet different at the same time. They teach each other all the tricks they know and Shay teaches Tally how to ride a hover board. Before the two are going to turn pretty Shay decides to run away. The day Tally is supposed to turn pretty she gets into trouble and has to betray Shay. Tally decides to go and find Shay. When she finds where Shay is, she stays for awhile and meets new people but becomes unsure if she should betray Shay and get all the people who live in the Rusty Ruins (outside of the city) in trouble. Tally discovers what really happens when you have the operation to become pretty and what it is like to live without all the city luxuries. I would recommend this book to those who enjoyed reading The Hunger Games, Matched, or The Giver. There are 3 books in the series and a companion novel. Right now I am currently reading the second book in the series called Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies by Scott WesterfeldI have always been fascinated by dystopic tales, be they novels, films, or episodes television. I have loved The Twilight Zone - the original version - since I was a little girl. That being said, it is no wonder that the synopsis of Uglies intrigued me.Tally is a typical teen: that is, typical for the time when and the place where she lives. She's waiting for the operation everyone gets at age sixteen - the operation that makes a person pretty. Oddly enough, this tradition of cosmetic surgery seems to have made society a better place. People are more accepting of others and more cheerful as a general rule.Not only that, but the world seems to be pretty peachy for most people. There are fewer arguments and more agreements, less poverty and more technological improvements than in past generations. War is but a distant memory, and things are relatively peaceful.Then Tally's friend Shay knows vows to evade the surgery - and asks Tally to come with her to the Smoke, a special place that accepts people who don't want to have the surgery. Tally thinks this sounds blasphemous. After Shay escapes, Tally is approached by the authorities, who know of Shay's plans - and tell Tally she must follow her friend and reveal the secret location of the Smoke. Tally wants to refuse, but when told that she'll remain an Ugly forever if she doesn't comply with their wishes, she is forced to go on a journey she never could have imagined.As with some of his previous novels, Scott Westerfeld combines science with fantasy, creating a futuristic world whose architectures and inventions seem plausible. This could very well be our world, evolved - for better or worse - with the passing of time. This fast-paced story held my interest from start to finish. I couldn't wait for the next book, Pretties, then for the final book, Specials."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After reading the Midnighters trilogy I wanted to read more by Scott Westerfeld. Uglies was a great book. It takes place in the future. They try to prevent destruction like the people before them called \\"rusties\\" by making everyone beautiful when they turn 16. The rusties are basically us now, as I see it. All of Tally's friends have turned pretty, and she can't wait until it's her turn. All was going well until her new friend Shay runs away to a place called The Smoke to avoid being turned pretty. Tally thinks nothing of it, after all it was Shay's choice, until she is forced by Special Circumstances to find Shay and destroy The Smoke in order to be turned pretty.This book was very creative and awesome. It's full of twist and turns making the reader want more. I think everyone can relate to Tally in one way or another.

It also shows that you can be beautiful without surgery and makeup and stuff, and about how some people are too appalled by the \\"ugliness\\" of a person and can't see a nice human being standing three feet away.

In a dystopian future, all \\"uglies\\" (people unaltered by plastic surgery) look forward to their 16th birthdays when they will become one of the envied \\"pretties.\\" Tally Youngblood is counting down the days until that magical birthday when she will at last become pretty and join her older friends for endless parties and fun in New Pretty Town. Her new friend, Shay, does not share her desire for prettiness. Just before their shared birthday, Shay leaves Uglyville behind and runs away to live outside the city. The authorities want Shay back, and they plan to use Tally to get her: they will turn Tally pretty only if she turns Shay in.Westerfeld's book is a riveting read, with plenty of action and an engagingly well-developed main character in Tally. Below the surface story, though, is an important commentary on the lengths people will go to in the pursuit of physical perfection. Westerfeld's book may be set in the future, but it deals with the same issues that young adults face today, such as the media's portrayal of perfection, body image, and peer pressure. In this new world, prettiness for all is meant to put everyone on equal footing. Perhaps the pretties are equal to one another, but the average are taught to focus on their flaws and hate themselves in order to preserve the status quo. In Tally's case, the idea of remaining average is so abhorrent that it is used as a weapon. Will Tally find the strength to resist societal pressure and find the extraordinary within herself? Or is being pretty and popular more important than integrity and true friendship?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"[...]Genre: Science FictionCharacters:Tally- a young girl desperately wanting to undergo a beautifying operation but can't until she finds her runaway friend, Shay.David- a young man who has lived in a society of people, \\"The Smoke\\", who didn't want the operation all his life.Peris- Tally's childhood friend who becomes \\"pretty\\" before her and is waiting for Tally to get the operation.Shay- a friend Tally meets while waiting to become pretty and who runs away to the Smoke not wanting the operation.Dr. Cable- a member of Special Circumstances who blackmails Tally to find Shay or stay ugly.Maddy- David's mother and a former surgeon and finds a terrible secret about the operation.

Scott Westerfeld has managed to write the most original science fiction novel, in my opinion, since the Hitchhiker's Trilogy. He's melded together a mixture of suspense, drama, romance, and humor in the best way. Tally is a most unique character- one only created by a mastermind.

However, there was more excitement than that. You are set in a future period where they have cool things like hoverboards and dehydrated foods that rehydrate to regular size in seconds (SpagBol, anyone?). They make references to a previous society (very similar to our own) that lived in large steel buildings, cut down trees and ATE ANIMALS! (Oh, the horror!)The premise is that all people have a special operation to turn them to ideal beauty when they turn 16. They are all brainwashed to believe that they are hideous until after the operation, and that life as a \\"pretty\\" is better and less worrisome.The main character, Tally, is the last of her class to turn 16. Right before her birthday, she meets Shay. Shay really doesn't want to become pretty, and decides to tell Tally about a secret camp, called the Smoke, where people never have to become pretty. She gives Tally a code to help her figure out where Smoke is if she decides to change her mind before going through the operation.The cool part is right before Tally's operation, a secret power group like the FBI called Special Circumstances, forces Tally to infiltrate the Smoke and root them out. They threaten never to make her pretty if she doesn't. But after she finds Smoke, she realizes she doesn't want to rat on them. She falls in love, but can't bring herself to tell everyone the truth about why she originally came. The original members of the Smoke tell her about the truth of becoming pretty - they cut your brain and damage it. Tally tries to destroy the homing beacon the Special Circumstances people gave her, but accidently activates it in the process.

I kept thinking it would get better but it didn't and the end couldn't come quickly enough.The writing was like that of a middle schooler with this being the first sentence: \\"the early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" I know some will argue that the choice of words was just for a \\"deeper meaning\\" and to \\"set the tone\\" but I believe it is just a prime example of his inadequacies as a writer.I found none of the characters likable nor relatable and just wanted all of them to stop complaining. I really just cringe every time I see the name Tally in anything because she is, to me, one of the most detestable characters in fiction.

The reader has a good voice and can do accents well but I absolutely hated the voice she did for Shay. It was annoying and kinda sounded like Susie from Rugrats.The story itself was okay. The concept is really interesting. I'm not gonna duplicate it here, you can just read someone elses summary. One complaint is, it was way too describey with action scenes just stretching for minutes and minutes and minutes. I really don't need to know Tally's every single move, it got boring.

It was assigned for school. I had looked at the book previously, and thought it might be interesting, but the first chapter lost my interest. Although we have dissected this book and all its metaphors, I still see no brilliance in this book. In my opinion, it's a poorly written and boring Science fiction novel. I've read lots of great dystopian novels, and this came nowhere close to them.So, why didn't I like it? Firstly, it was dull. The first third of the book was us getting to know Tally Youngblood, the main character in the novel. We met her and she spent a long time going on about how everyone who wasn't pretty was so ugly, and so on. She soon grew sickening to listen to. The book split the next part into Tally's journey, which was long, tedious, and EXTREMELY boring. Everything else was boring and predictable.The characters. I did not like Tally, and I didn't like the other characters much, either. They were flat and one-dimensional, with cardboard personalities. Even Shay, who you were supposed to like didn't seem realistic or very well fleshed out.If you don't know the plot of this book, here's a summary: Tally Youngblood lives in a world where on your 16th birthday, you get an operation to turn you \\"pretty.\\" She befriends a girl named Shay, and when she rebels against the tradition, Tally is forced to either find her friend or never become pretty.Don't waste your time on this book. There's many better books to read than this."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Recently I have been reading a lot of YA sci-fi fantasy and future dystopian society books and so far this has been the best one with the exception of Divergent. I loved how the main character Tally was so like other teens now and is struggling to determine whether she wants to be different or blend in with the crowd. I feel that even with the potential downfall of the *spoiler alert* lesions in the brain from the 'Pretty' surgery many teens would willingly choose to be pretty and oblivious then have to be ugly and have to live with those secrets. Many of the opposing reviews have stated that their main reason for disliking the book was because of Tally's careless and cowardly behavior but as a YA myself I can see others of my age acting in the same way as she did. The plot was very creative and it kept me reading until the very end, the romance was...interesting and sweet but not as intense which was nice for a change. I do agree that the book was very predictable but I think it was made to be that way, where the author wanted us to know Tally's fate even before she did. I also enjoyed the fact that humans of the 21st century were made to seem impulsive and unintelligent because of our habits of burning wood, cutting down trees, not recycling, etc. It was great to have a book that gave you an insight on what our possible future could look like. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys an adventurous main character and I would also give it to someone who usually sides with the popular opinion. This book opens up your view on what being 'pretty' actually is and whether it truly comes from the outside or the inside. It makes you ask yourself \\"Which would I chose?\\" I am looking forward to reading the sequel 'pretties' and I'm diving in with even higher expectations."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"We work with kiddos who don't fit into a box and highly recommend this book.

At sixteen, everyone has an operation to turn them into beautiful people and tally is the last. But until then, she has to kill time in Ugly Town, without her friends for company. Desperate to see her best friend Peris again, Tally sneaks over to New Pretty Town to see him and in the process meets Shay, another Ugly who is waiting for her sixteenth birthday. The two become quick friends, but when Shay disappears before her surgery, everything changes for Tally. The authorities insist that Tally help them find Shay, or she will have to stay Ugly forever.Westerfeld does a masterful job of taking society's obsessions with beauty to the extreme. He is particularly good at showing how flawed the obsession with beauty is and how brainwashed people are about it.Tally was a realistic character who, unlike most book characters in these types of dystopian societies, is not a rebel. She likes to play some pranks, like any Ugly does, but at heart she truly does want to become a Pretty. It is only circumstances out of her control and the friends she meets that makes her begin to question this chosen path. (This makes her somewhat passive in the beginning, but she grows into an active character.)The weakest point of the novel is a stretch of time where Tally is on her own. Having no conversation and companionship, though important to the story, makes things go a bit slowly for that section. However, any loss of pace there is quickly made up in the excitement that follows.I would like to find out more about the country as a whole (we get a little bit of it, but for the most part we only really see Tally's community) and what adulthood is like in this dystopian world. Since it is a four book series, I am sure there is more to come and already I have begun reading book two. This is definitely one of the better dystopian novels out (and came out slightly before this new obsession with this genre) and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wasn't a big fan of dystopian novels when I began reading this, but I am now. He created a believable world filled with misunderstanding, mixed messages, and teen angst even for an adult reader like myself can relate to. The MC's journey to the discovery of the truth is an interesting one to follow. There's a message that reflect the current view of what teenagers and adults find attractive and how important it is to our self-esteems. But he didn't do symbolism to death. Also, the author did an excellent job of writing the voice of a 15-year-old girl. I'm his new fan now. I'll be reading his books again."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First, let me say that I wasn't real excited about his book and it took me quite a while to get into it. I just found most of it rather boring. But the second half picked up and by the end I was seriously glad I had the second book!Tally lives in a futuristic world where people are born ugly. Once you turn sixteen you receive and operation to make you \\"pretty\\" and will then reside in New Pretty Town where the only thing that happens are non-stop parties. The Pretties care about nothing other than their parties and their looks and can even add upgrades. Her best friend Peris has already had his surgery and she can't wait to be with him again.Shortly before Tally's sixteenth birthday, she meets Shay. Shay has different feeling towards the Pretties. She has no interest in becoming one and Tally learns she is planning to run away and join a group of Uglies called The Smoke. When it becomes clear to Shay that Tally is not going, she leaves some cryptic directions for her if she changes her mind.On the day of Tally's surgery, everything goes wrong. Instead she is taken to \\"Special Circumstances\\" where she is told she will not be able to have her surgery until she finds Shay and transmits the location of The Smokes.When she finally arrives, she learns information that is not made public concerning the surgery to become pretty and its side effect. She meets David who has lived this way his whole life and does not understand why anyone would want to have surgery to become pretty. He is able to see past looks and place more emphasis on the person themselves.After a tragic accident changes everything for The Smokes, Tally will make a sacrifice in order to save the current and soon to be residents of New Pretty Town while protecting The Smokes.By the time I got to the end of this book, I was absolutely hooked! I started the second book \\"The Pretties\\" right away and will have a review up soon.I have to say that the series is definitely worth trudging through the first half of this book. I would have given this first book a higher rating because it got totally addicting at the end, but there were soooo many boring parts in the first half. I really, really like this series and think everyone should check it out!Reviews for books 2 and 3 are coming soon!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I only read this book by chance and loved it. Once I started I couldn't stop. This series is a great read among young readers and adult readers. I definitely recommend reading the series, because once you start you can't stop."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the stories that stands out the most for me this year is The Uglies by Scott Westerfield. The book is about a society where there are \\"uglies\\" and \\"pretties.\\" The \\"uglies\\" are the children who are under the age of sixteen. The \\"pretties\\" are the \\"uglies\\" who have been transformed into being \\"pretty\\" when they turn sixteen. This transformation happens to everbody in \\"The Pretty's City.\\" The main character of the book is a girl named Tally who has not turned sixteen and longs to be pretty. Her best friend Paris has already made the transformation and has almost completely forgotten about Tally. Tally likes to spy on the \\"pretties\\" and pull pranks on them as a past time. While spying on the \\"pretties\\" one night she meets another \\"ugly\\" named Shay and they become best friends. Shay introduces Tally to a place called The Smoke outside the city of \\"pretties. \\" The Smoke is a secret hideaway for people who reject the requirement of becoming \\"pretty.\\" The Smoke people believe that conforming to other people's ideal of beauty is wrong and they have formed their own society. By visiting The Smoke, Tally begins to understand why some people would want to stay themselves and not change how they look and who they are. At first it seems like it would be so much easier for Tally to just become pretty because, on some level, this is what we all want for ourselves. Most people would love to have beauty handed over that easily. But as the story progresses, we see that the way people live at The Smoke is happier. They have remained their true selves and are ultimately more free. The novel explores the theme of not changing who you are just to be like everyone else. I liked this book because it shadows what society is like today. Everyone is supposed to be skinny and have the right make-up and hair. Just like in the novel The Uglies, it feels like there are such high standards to live up to. Tally is a character we can all relate to."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'd been eagerly waiting to read this book and when I finally found a copy, I couldn't wait to get into it. I love dystopian novels and this one fit the bill perfectly. It had all the great components; characters, premise, plotline. Definitely a good book to read.Tally is an Ugly eagerly looking forward to her 16th birthday when she will be able to have the surgery that makes her a pretty. You see, new pretties get to have all the fun, and well, they aren't ugly. There's no reason to not look forward to that time. At least for most people. Tally's friend Shay has decided instead to run off to a secret place where no one has the surgery. Tally doesn't understand why Shay would want to do something like that, but when the government forces Tally to go look for her friend or not receive her surgery, she is taken to a world where things are not always what they seem. Tally isn't sure whether spying is the right thing to do at all.Tally isn't wishy washy like some characters can be. Sure she changes her opinion a bit but its done in a very believable way. She has a lot of growth in the novel and while she has superficial tendencies, she's a good person. Shay on the other hand I think gets all the bad luck. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her throughout the whole novel. It was interesting to see the comparison between the \\"uglies\\" and the \\"pretties.\\" Something very different is there and its fascinating to read about.For a plot I think this one had a really good premise. The book starts out a bit slow in the beginning but you're quickly enveloped in the storyline, and if you're like me, can't set the book down. Westerfeld has also done a great job of incorporating new language and slang for the time his book is held in. The little nuances make everything believable and he treats the new technology like something that's been around forever; which in the character's eyes, it has. Since this book was written for young adults, there isn't strong language or heavy adult themes, but it is still not a book I picture a younger child being able to read just because the writing is more sophisticated.I can't wait to read the next book in the series. An extra trip to the bookstore is in store for me I believe.UgliesCopyright 2005425 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I hated this series so I'll keep the reviews short and to the point. I've reviewed more than few dystopian YA novels on this site, but I've never encountered a writer that I have hated more than Westerfeld. I was really intrigued by the premise but the premise ended up being just that a premise. The premise is that everyone at the age of 16 under goes a surgery to become \\"pretty\\". Pretty is an agreed upon standardized version of beautiful formed by the government.The Ugly series follows Tally Youngblood a mischievous teenage who is about to turn 16. Tally as she becomes closer to the surgery date is torn between wanting to become a pretty and join her best friend who has all ready gone through the surgery or following her new friend Shay to \\"the smoke\\" a place that supposedly exist where everyone ::gasp:: stays ugly forever! Cue dramatic music. Who would want to stay ugly? Is it because the people who live in \\"the smoke\\" know something sinister about the pretty surgeries. You've read enough novels to answer that yourself, or course there is.Out of the series Uglies was probably my favorite out of them. This explains why I attempted to keep going. Uglies, however, is by no means a stellar contribution to dystopian YA."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book has an amazing plot and will keep you reading.

The book is so intriguing it was a real page turner."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What a great book, I was totally engrossed--original, great story and characters. 5 * Plus. This book SO needs to be made into a movie. Now I'm on to Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"To be completely honest, the first time I picked up this book, I read one chapter and put it down. I don't know why, but the book didn't really flow for me, and I couldn't wrap my head around the aspect of what we consider pretty as being ugly in their world. But then. I found this book on my bookshelf a year after I had first tried to read it, and so I cracked it open and began to read. And this time I couldn't put it down.Once you get past the slighty slow-moving first part of the book, you are whirled into a world of insecurity and uglies. At the age of sixteen, every Ugly gets a surgery, becomes \\"Pretty\\", moves to Prettytown, and starts having the time of their lives. Tally Youngblood is as excited as anyone to become Pretty and to be able to see her already-Pretty friend Peris again. Yet, in the last couple months of her Ugly life, Tally meets Shay, a girl with the same birthday as her who has a different opinion about becoming Pretty. As Shay and Tally grow closer, Shay begins to show Tally things, things that will change her life forever. And when a week before their birthday, Shay runs away, Tally is faced with two options: find Shay and become Pretty, or stay Ugly forever. As expected, Tally chooses to hunt down Shay for the creepy \\"rulers\\" of her city, called Specials. But when Tally arrives at the Smoke, the place where many Uglies go for refuge from the Specials and becoming Pretty, she finds a world much different than she expects. And suddenly, Tally is faced with more conflicts and options than she has ever been before. But sometimes the obvious choice isn't the right one....I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I devoured it and immediately moved onto its sequel, Pretties, after that cliffhanger ending. But it wasn't just the plot I enjoyed, it was the world Tally lives in. I'm a huge fan of dystopian novels, and this one did not disappoint. I thought it was intruiging how, to stop war, which many believed was based off of jealousy and differences, everyone now looks the same. And to bring global warming to a halt, the city has obvious borders and uses eco-friendly materials overall. This should seem like a perfect world. But, as always with dystopian books, it's not. There's a part of the surgery that, Tally discovers, not only alters your body, but your brain. How come all the Pretties seemed, as with sterotypical pretty people, dumb and slightly vain? Tally has an answer, and it makes her, and consequently the reader, look at her world in a new light.Overall (22/25):Plot: 4/5- The beginning was a little slow, but once you get past that, it's amazing!Characters: 4/5- Shay's character was interesting and her development as a person was so well-crafted, yet frustrating at times.Setting: 5/5- I loved Tally's world!Romance: 4/5- Tally and David's romance seemed a little hurried, yet I really liked the twist at the end.Teenage Factor (because I am one): 5/5- Any teenage girl would gobble this up!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love the cover of this one. I can't really pinpoint why this is, but it just always catches my attention. I also like the tagline of, \\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"Uglies started out a little slow for me, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed the story. It really made me think about what it would be like if everyone in the world turned \\"pretty\\" at the age of 16. In one way, it would be nice in the sense that potentially no one would be judged by their looks, but on the other hand, it takes away any individuality. It really is a difficult situation to imagine.The world Westerfeld created seems pretty fun to live in, if you take away all of the creepy Special Circumstances people. The idea of hoverboards and bracelets to make sure you never plummet to your death was such a cool idea. I would need those bracelets for sure. I am not the most graceful person on the planet. I also have been loving dystopian novels lately.I think this one could potentially be a good book to be read in a high school class. It teaches a lesson without being overly preachy and it is pretty \\"clean\\" for a teen book."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a great start for this series. Westerfield does a great job of combining the teen mindset with his post-apocalyptic world. Finding out certain things about the world -- like the way the Uglies insult each other, and even the fact that they're called Uglies -- is disturbing, but it's necessary to set up the sense of how the world works.Since there are so many reviews that give a plot synopsis, I won't repeat that here. I will say that I enjoyed the world setup and the characters. Tally isn't perfect, by any means (which is great, honestly), but she's smart enough to know that the world as presented to her doesn't quite feel right to her. Sure, she wants to be pretty like everyone else -- a few years of looking at New Pretty Town, plus teen hormones, would do that to anyone. But she doesn't swallow everything hook, line, and sinker, and when the big bad guys try to manipulate her... well, you'll just have to read that for yourself.It's a fun ride, and that's all I was after with this."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is hands-down one of the best series I've ever read. I always go back to these books and they never fail to pull me right in. The world that Westerfeld creates is an intriguing and unique one, and his style of writing is wonderful. Uglies is a fantastic way to start off the series.What I loved most about this series is Westerfeld's talent in making you see both sides of the story, and reasoning behind what the cities do, and what the rebels do. Often times I found myself switching sides because his writing is just that good.Uglies is a definite must read for all age groups."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as well as the other books in the series. I felt like the plot was believable, the characters interesting and well-developed, and the writing very fluid and compelling. This book explores some difficult issues and inspires a lot of thought about what beauty means, and how important we make it. There is a little romance, enough to keep it interesting without being Twilight-y.

I've read everyone in the series and this one is still my favourite because you get to read about both sides uglies and pretties. I;m not going to write a synopsis on the book because I don't want to spoil it and I think it should encourage you to read it for yourself. I recently bought this for an 11 year old girl who loves to read and I think she will like it. Now I'm not sure if it will appear to older audiences because of the language used for the book but it's worth a read if you like action and futuristic stories. As a side note, the cover of the book has changed and I don't really like it because I feel it looks very girly and the other one didn't so now it doesn't appeal to a wider audience."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a series made up of 4 books about a society obsessed with beauty, and is on the top of my list. What makes this one great is the fact that on the outside this future seems kind of perfect. Everyone is beautiful and there is no more poverty, but there is a price to perfection. Tally and Shay go on the adventure of their lives and discover a dark secret that brings their perfect world crashing down. This book, along with many dystopian books, is perfect for girls and boys because of the action and adventure along with a bit a light romance."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This review discusses portions of the story line but will not reveal major plot portions. Westerfeld weaves a captivating tale about human nature, specifically the desire to be beautiful. Interestingly, the author specifically tackles psychological hypotheses (backed by many published research articles) that what humans find beautiful is evolutionarily significant, for examples large eyes speaks to innocence and symmetry speaks to healthiness. Humans innately pick up on the cues, and this is why humans place significant value in beauty. He does this by creating a world in the future that surgically makes all humans \\"pretty\\" at the age of 16. The problem is that some humans do not want to be become \\"pretty\\" and choose to stay \\"ugly\\". Of course, this dissention has consequences.Westerfeld included much science in this story, and I appreciated it as a scientist myself. Although, there were inconsistencies, such as the idea of primary succession taking 100 0 years due to presence of genetically engineered flowers is silly considering primary succession (new growth) occurs in 100 years after lava flow kills all living things. Also, the idea that a surgery could make people \\"pretty\\" (perfect in every way, not just facially) and then can be gradually digressed as the people age is ridiculous. My point is that if science is utilized in a novel it needs to be accurate. If not, I get annoyed. I am sure others do as well.Overall, I will be reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original \\"end of the world\\" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Uglies is yet another one of those series I started without any idea of the plot (I have got to stop doing that. It's really going to backfire on me someday). All I knew was that it's yet another YA dystopian. I know, I know, the genre is flooded with mediocrity right now, but before you immediately tune out, let me just throw this out there: this one is actually good.PLOT:Uglies follows Tally Youngblood, a 15-year-old girl living in a futuristic society that has decided that the main thing wrong with the world is that attractive people have unfair advantages over the unattractive. The solution? Everyone undergoes cosmetic surgery on their 16th birthday, modifying all their facial and physical features to fit a common standard of perfect beauty.Once the procedure is complete, these former \\"Uglies\\" are now allowed to live in beautiful cities with the \\"Pretties,\\" where their every need is catered to via a hole in the wall (think replicators on Star Trek: TNG), and their only concern is what to wear to the next fabulous party.Tally is eagerly awaiting her operation, passing her time with harmless pranks on the Pretties, until she meets Shay. Shay is also 15, and therefore also an Ugly. As a matter of fact, she and Tally share the same birthday, which means they will have their procedures at the same time.The difference is that Shay doesn't want the procedure. And after unsuccessfully trying to convince Tally to run away with her, Shay disappears. All she leaves behind is a set of cryptic instructions, in case Tally wants to join her.While Tally is concerned for Shay, she doesn't fluctuate in her desire to become a Pretty. She hopes Shay got what she wanted. But soon, Tally will get what she wants too.However, on the day of Tally's procedure, she is presented with an awful choice: go find Shay, and the rebels she has run away with, or stay Ugly forever.Thus begins Tally's journey to the Smoke, the secret rebel hideout that Shay has fled to. All Tally wants is to put this all behind her and become Pretty. Until she finds the Smoke, and starts to question everything she ever believed.MY THOUGHTS:I'll admit, I was a little wary about starting a series that revolves around being pretty. I mean seriously, how much more superficial can you get? I was prepared to be super-annoyed with the shallowness of it all.But once I started reading, I found myself completely absorbed in Tally's world. Mr. Westerfeld actually made me understand how Tally would want nothing more in life than to become Pretty, and managed to do it without making me hate her. No small task.There were a few things I could nitpick about the plot. The endless hoverboarding, for example, made me think someone bet Mr. Westerfeld that he couldn't write an entire book based off of the chase scene in Back to the Future II.Also, I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how anything actually got accomplished in this world. What I surmised was that the inhabitants of Uglyville go to school, then turn 16 and party hearty for a few years until they hit \\"Middle Pretty\\" age and actually start contributing something to society. Not that I could imagine any of them actually wanting to contribute, since it sounds like the Pretty lifestyle was the epitome of luxury and indulgence. Maybe you or I would get tired of living like that, but the Pretties don't seem to mind in the least.Is a workforce consisting entirely of middle-aged ex-partiers (as it's implied that the elderly, or \\"Crumblies\\" -- ouch -- also do not work) enough to keep this advanced society running smoothly? Maybe not in the world you and I live in. In the world of Uglies, though, it works.When it comes to YA fiction -- or any fiction, for that matter -- I can almost always poke holes in the logic of the world as it's written. The question I have to ask myself is, \\"Did I care?\\" If the answer is yes, it pulls me out of the story and diminishes my enjoyment of the book.With Uglies, the answer was no. I didn't care that not everything made sense. What I cared about was Tally. Was she a perfect character? Heck no. She drove me nuts at times (this is also one of the main downfalls of reading YA lit, period. The protagonists are always teenagers. I am not). But she was fun to read about, her journey was exciting, and I couldn't put the book down until I knew what happened to her."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This series got me back into reading after Harry potter and introduced me to my love of dystopian novels. I finished the series quickly, recommend it to all my friends and even named my cat after the main character, Tally! Unfortunately, the other Scott Westerfeld novels have not drawn me in like this story."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My students love this book ... especially the girls. They devour the series. I finally decided to read it, and I have to say I was sorely disappointed. The story is good. The narrator is likable. But the whole premise is ridiculous. The way to equality is to make everyone pretty? I know it's more than that, but I don't want to spoil the book for anyone reading this review., The whole thing is silly. I wrote a review of Unwind by Neal Schusterman. For the same reason I disliked that, I dislike this. Dystopias should be chilling and, although farfetched, they should seem possible. Also, the writing is brutal. Sorry to all those who enjoyed it, but I was actually cringing in parts. Calling the ugly Uglies and the pretty Pretties is fine, but why call the little ones Littlies? Little doesn't end in an E sound! And Crumblies for the older Pretties? And he couldn't come up with better town names than Uglyville and New Pretty Town? The one truly cool dystopian image Westerfeld created was the idea of the flowers that had become like a plague on the environment and needed to be regularly burned to contain their growth. That is realistic. And a great idea. Otherwise, thumbs down from me, a dystopia-loving adult, but 3 stars for all the kids who read books because of this series. Can't take that away from Mr. Westerfeld. He seems to have captured the imaginations of many a teen girl."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think this book is interesting enough, but it isn't done well.The world Westerfeld created isn't fully fleshed out. You don't get immersed in it like other authors have accomplished in creating an alternate/new/unknown world (J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter being the obvious example, Hunger Games being a more recent example). It feels blanker than it should, and very hard to connect with because it isn't expounded upon in key ways. I had a hard time feeling like I could \\"see\\" this book, even though there are lovely small descriptions of the physical environment from time to time. The universe in it was just too much like ours with futuristic examples that didn't fully make it organically new (as though you could feel the natural evolution of humanity through the time that passed), different, or authentic feeling. It's almost as if the author had spent so much time imagining or thinking about his new universe that he had learned to assume or forego key elements of it that needed to be explained in the book in order to make it seem real; like someone who's seen a movie and tries to explain it to you without going into detail.Things also happen in vague or unexplained ways, furthering the feeling of gaps and missing information. For example, someone will stop laughing without there first being a description of them starting; or someone opens their eyes, well, I don't remember you closing them. Small things like that that leave you a little confused and not entirely sure what happened. This criticism is related to the mechanics of writing, not the content. Another example: when Tally and David plan the escape, we know the captors had gathered an entire community of people. When they complete the escape, the party is only 7 people. What happened to everyone else and why did it seem like they knew they were only going to get a few people and no discussion was given to the whereabouts of the rest? I suppose you are just left to assume what happened to them.Besides Tally (who is barely fully developed as a character in any way herself), very few of the other characters are rounded out. The closest are David and Shay, who spend more time in the plot, but any tertiary character outside of that is not really individualized or personalized in any way. Yet another flaw that makes this book feel undigested and half-done.Toward the end of the book, things take on a summarized feel, to wrap up loose ends and get to the conclusion, which seems like a strange misstep given that this book was the first of a planned trilogy. I think the pacing was off. I didn't have any investment in the story besides idle curiosity until midway through.As far as the story itself, it is fresh and interesting enough to capture your attention, and I wasn't entirely or exactly bored while reading. In fact, the premise itself is probably the book's most/only redeeming factor. I will read the next book based on the curiosity the story generates, but I will still be hoping it improves. A good comparison of what the author tried and failed to do is The Giver. The general theme and subsequent universe is very similar only it's painfully obvious that Lowry's just works effortlessly and Westerfeld's is clunky and... bad. This series could have been as big as Hunger Games in the hands of a more capable writer - dystopian YA being the new thing now, it seems - but it couldn't deliver on its potential."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I had been wanting to read this series for a very long time, but I never really got around to getting a copy. My friend Tasha is a huge fan of the series and finally lent me hers and I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I started reading UGLIES in the middle of finals, BEA, and the end of the semester which meant that I really did not have much time to just sit down and read. My reading experience had been extremely choppy and it made it difficult to really get into the book. However, despite my personal setbacks, I was still able to enjoy UGLIES overall, and it definitely made me think.Tally lives in a society where at sixteen, you turn pretty. Initially, I found many, if not all, to be extremely shallow. Uglies called each other terrible names like Zitface and Squint that basically pointed out their flaws. There is this obsession with facial symmetry and looking perfect, and Tally could not wait until she turns pretty herself and moves to Pretty Town across the river. I didn't think that I was going to be able to relate to Tally at all, but she does grow as a character as the book progresses. We learn the secrets behind becoming pretty - secrets that still make my mind boggle - and Tally realizes that the whole world that she had known growing up may not be as perfect as it looks.Other than the issues of self-image, beauty, and plastic surgery, Weseterfeld also brings up many topics that makes readers think. The book is way more than just about a teenager in a world where everyone turns pretty. He also makes readers think about issues such as genetic modification and experimental medicine. Like a good dystopian novel, he made me think of society today and how our actions could impact the world in the future.There is a bit of romance in the novel, though it is far from the main focus. I did feel that it was a bit rushed, but there is some chemistry between the two characters. The romance does play a bigger part toward the end of the novel, and I am curious how it picks back up in the second book.UGLIES definitely gives readers a lot to think about. Westerfeld is a fantastic world-builder and he absolutely makes you stop to think while reading. UGLIES is a fantastic example of what a dystopian novel should do: it should entertain but also make you question your actions and today's society and how it could affect that future. The scariest part about the UGLIES? While the concept seems outrageous, there are probably many people out there who wouldn't mind living amongst beautiful people.I can't wait to continue the rest of the series! I hope I can get to them all before school starts up again in the fall. UGLIES by Scott Westerfeld is definitely recommended to fans of dystopia and science fiction."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"My 13 year old daughter read this in about 3 days. Every night after homework she had it in her hands. She thoroughly enjoyed it and wants me to read it now....And I am already being pressured to buy her the second one in the series! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I lost sleep over this book. I purchased it and read it all in the same evening, refusing to go to sleep until I'd read the last page. There are so many things I enjoyed about this. The unique little twist on a rigidly controlled, dystopian society by including an operation to make everyone uniformly beautiful made this a step up from others which simply mimic '1984.'The two things I enjoyed most about this were definitely the suspense and the characters. My relationship with the main character, Tally, was very touch and go to begin with. I found myself loving and hating her during the exposition, where she sometimes acts like a charming daredevil, and then conversely a whiny, petulant child. It was during her journey to the Smoke, after being blackmailed by Special Circumstances, that I truly came to love and understand her. She was willing to go to such lengths to get the things she wanted, and that made her transformation during her time in the Smoke that much more riveting. Her development resonated with me.Lately, I have also been finding the romance plots of YA fiction to be contrived and superficial, but I really enjoyed her relationship with David. Due to the very nature of this book's premise, it's immediately apparent that these two characters are not attracted to one another for looks alone - they respect each other for those qualities which are more than skin deep. David admires her for her resolve and ability to take her life in the Smoke seriously, while she respects him for his maturity and competence in living without city luxuries.The other thing I must also compliment is the author's ability to show both the pros and cons of both societies - the tyrannical city versus the natural village of the wilds. Neither are painted as pure good or pure evil. That the people living under tyranny are HAPPY can't be overlooked - there is definitely an allure about a world that lacks war, pollution and discrimination. The ethical issues raised are controversial and I look forward to seeing how they're handled in the sequels. I hope to see real reasons why such a society SHOULDN'T exist when it functions more happily and peacefully than our own, and that these things aren't dismissed as irrelevant, OTHER than the fact it's naturally repugnant to people like us who've lived with more liberty than the people of New Pretty Town.If I had one complaint, it was that the plot was a bit predictable, and David's reaction to Tally's admission of guilt seemed unrealistic. There were also a number of plot holes that had me puzzling over the competence of Special Circumstances (it's referenced multiple times that some uglies run away to the Smoke, then decide they don't like it and return to be made pretties... Why doesn't Special Circumstances instruct these kids to lead them to the Smoke instead of sending Tally with her cryptic little code? Doesn't seem to make sense, since Special Circumstances also alludes to having known about the Smoke for awhile now... I also found it unusual that Special Circumstances doesn't notice the flares going up in the Ruins when uglies go to meet David there...) Otherwise, this story gripped me and carried me straight to the end, and I was willing to overlook these setbacks because the ride was worth the bumps. A very enjoyable read, easier to slip into than your favourite pair of shoes."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really loved this book.

Her best friend Peris had already turned pretty, and Tally was itching to be in new pretty town with him. Tally's mind was set on having the operation that turns you pretty until she met Shay. The idea of having that operation in Shay's mind was completely different than Tally's. When Shay's runs away from the operation with her older friends, Tally has no choice but to follow. They run away to a secret place called the Smoke where there are no pretties. In Tally's time there, she learned something from the parents of one of Shay's friends. She learned something about the pretty operation that changed her mind on wanting to be pretty. What she learned made her want to change every uglies mind and help the people that had already went under the knife. In my opinion, Scott Westerfield did an amazing job describing the characters' emotions in the story. He used lots of great similes throughout the entire story to describe all of their mixed feelings and problems.

This is an exciting series and I can't wait to see what happens to Tally and her friends."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The book Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld was a terrific grab. The novel had exciting tributes and very thought holding adventures that made you want to read more and more. The tween in the story, Tally Youngblood, gave a sense of a home town friend. She had a smart personality and was always thinking up ways to entertain herself. The story itself hooks in the reader mainly in the second chapter when the plot starts to unravel a little more and adds a sense of resolution to Tally's oncoming problem. Tally knows about the Rusties, but she doesn't know if she dare try to hover board her way there. What would happen if she was lost, or worse hated what was there, her new home? Being pretty seems so simple when you've been such an ugly... but does it really have the appeal that you see? Oddness is key in this journey of words. Many new and mind challenging actions turn about in the middle of the jam packed story line. A promise is a promise and Tally intends to keep the two as long as she can possibly hold onto her sanity. Like normal young adults, embarrassment and drama comes into play but no one can bring the infamous and braving Tally to do anything her soul won't possibly accept. Further more, loyalty is an engraving moral in this novel that brings numerous amounts of loose ends together. Torn between two friends and whose world keeps her, has your imagination bouncing. Enchanting thoughts fill Tally's head about the special events that are on arrival, but the heart wrenching facts she has so suddenly learned will make you yearn to read on and on until every last sentence has stopped you in your tracks."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I let this book sit on my shelf for awhile, figuring that I already knew after a few glances what it was about, and that it was so long it was bound to get preachy on the prettiness theme.Once I started reading, however, I was hooked until the very end. The scenery was varied, new characters were introduced often enough to keep me interested, and the ending is a great setup for a sequel. I especially liked how the futuristic technology had definite rules and limits: they made the action sequences all the more exciting and suspenseful.I give this book four stars instead of five because we know right from the first chapter who the good and bad guys are, and where right and wrong lie in the book. I would have liked it to be a little more ambiguous for me, as it was for the main character. What if the \\"policers\\" weren't so obviously cruel and controlling-- what if their paternalism was a little more convincing, because they believed they were doing what was best? That would have added more complexity to the book, and put me in a mental space more like the main character's.This book was long without running out of ideas. There's a short excerpt at the back from the next volume, and it's intriguing. I'm long past teenagerhood and enjoyed \\"The Uglies\\" a lot."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is an extremely wonderful read!

Its about a girl named Tally, and she lives in a futristic society. In this society on your 16th birthday everyone has a surgery that turns you supermodel gorgeous. Everyone else who hasn't turned 16 is ugly. Uglies live in seperate cities and count the days untill they can be pretty, well... almost everyone does. Tally's new friend Shay doesn't want to be pretty and generic, so she runs away to join other who don't want to be pretty. The \\"specials\\" know Shay has run away, and that she isn't the only one. The Specials know they run away to a place called Smoke only they don't know where it is. They offer Tally a choice, help them find Smoke, and betray her friend, or never become pretty, ever.

When you have the opperation to become beautiful, they don't just change your looks.This book is wonderful! It really makes you think about the cost of beauty. Uglies reminds me of the The Giver. It is really good. It makes you think about how a society can brainwash you into thinking that your not good enough. Uglies has action, adveture, its science fiction so if you like that genre you've got your technology fix, but if you aren't really intereseted in that genre it doesn't matter because the book has a much deeper meaning.

The idea behind the story was pure brilliance, and of course I fell for the boy- how could I not? He led me through the novel and towards the sequel (which honestly proved itself to be equally unimpressive).The main character failed to move me, I usually take to girls instantly, yet something in her voice was frustrating, dull, and almost incomplete. I think it was the way all of her thoughts were so superficially oriented-the time it took for her to open her eyes was painstaking. Nothing was as deep as it could have been, and unimportant things were unnessicarily elaborated upon.I don't know&#8230;I really hate bashing a sucessful book, but the writing was in truth one of the greatest let downs I have ever encountered. Everyone's self orientation almost drove me to abandoning the book out of frustration. Unwillingness to accept that everything you grew up believing was a lie is understandable. Still, when someone continues their completely oblivious mindset even as truth stares them in the face (in the form of a cute guy)&#8230; as I said, its frustrating."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I tried giving the first novel a try when I saw it on clearance at a shop for a huge bargain price and I hear so many people talking about it.Okay, so the prose is rather basic.

So everyone in the society, once they hit age 16, undergoes extensive surgery to drastically alter their appearance and their only job, as stated in the novel, is to party and have fun. How does the economy work?? They seem to have so much material things, like all sorts of toys and clothes.If they party all the time, who mans the machines? The crops? Extracting metals and materials from the earth? If you say it's set in a futuristic era where most things are taken over by robots, even in a few hundred years, they can't do everything. Like teaching. Or, at least, humans are needed to manufacture these robots and maintain them.Who are the doctors? The teachers?Are they just given money?

It's almost anything but.Tally Youngblood has been waiting all her life to turn sixteen. In her society, sixteen is the age when you recieve an operation to turn \\"pretty.\\" Before this operation, you are considered an \\"ugly,\\" separated with all the other uglies from the pretties. Every ugly goes through the operation and looks forward to it because when you become a pretty, you move into New Pretty Town where you spend the rest of your life having fun.However, Tally learns the darker side of the operation when she is forced to find her runaway friend, Shay. Shay has runaway because she does not want to be pretty like everyone else. It is through the small town that Shay runs away to, that Tally realizes how horrible the society she once lived in really is.In the operation, the doctors purposely give the patients brain legions, in order to prevent opinions from forming among the masses. Also, by preforming the operation, everyone already looks the same, so racial and ethnical differences are completely eliminated. In short, the authorities were controlling the civilians by damaging their ability to think for themselves.Subject matter like this, is very similar to the material that Louis Lowry showed in \\"The Giver.\\" This was a very serious, dark book that gave the reader alot to think about. Like a good science fiction book, it showed what mistakes humans should avoid and where we do not want to be headed as a society. Subject matter like this is best handled seriously in order for a book to reach its maximum potential. Scott Westerfield, did anything but.The book was light-hearted and felt a bit \\"lightened up\\" in order to sell more copies and appeal to more readers. It felt like he was trying to appeal to a younger age group that could not fully comprehend the seriousness of the subject. It even felt like he did not understand how serious material like this is. Honestly, I cannot believe how he presented the subject in such an innocent, ignorant way.If you want a good plotline and some pretty decent characters, I highly recommend this book. Sure, Scott did do a good job in that department. The setting is believable and the characters are very well done. The only unbelievable thing is how David fall in love with Tally almost instantly to the point where it seemed like a fairytale. Otherwise, it's full of action, drama, and plot twists. The only problem is that the tone of the book does not match the subject matter.If you like more mature, dark books, don't look for too much in this one.

The defenition of 'ugly' however, is 'not being extremely beautiful.' Children in Tally's society are taught that they are imperfect, and not worth much until they reach the grand age of 16, where they receive a horrible operation in which skin is rubbed raw, bones stretched, and plastic inserted to transform them into a 'pretty.' They then leave the sheltered life of an 'ugly' behind and start the glamorous, and rather phony, life of a 'pretty.'Tally is just about two months away from her operation that will deliver her from her life of lonliness, now that her best friend has become a 'pretty' when she meets Shay. Shay is rebellious and open-minded. A girl who sees another way of life.

It also showed what kinds of problems people face in their everyday lives. This was a book about Tally Youngblood, a girl living in the future. She lived in a place called Uglyville. This is where all the uglies lived. When you turned 16 you got an operation that made you pretty and you joined all the new pretties in New Pretty Town. In this town you can talk to the elevators and ride on hoverboards or in hovercars. In New Pretty Town all you did day and night was party. They didn't have to go to school or go to work (until they became a middle pretty). In this town you have to wear and interface ring that gave you an identity. Without it you would be no one. People wern't allowed outside the town because the athorites would get mad. In the begining Tally is waiting to become pretty because all her friends were older than her and turned pretty sooner than her. Then she meets Shay a girl also waiting to move to New Pretty Town also. Shay is a little different because she isn't sure if she wants to become pretty. At the last minute Shay runs away to a city called the Smoke. Leaving Tally directions in case she wanted to follow her later but Tally had to promise not to tell anyone that Shay ran away. Then the athorities find out. They give Tally 2 options eiether to betray her friend or stay ugly for life. Now Tally must make the hardest choice of her life. She ends up going to the smoke and was supposed to activate a tracker but decides to wait a little longer. Eventually Tally tries to destroy the tracker but it sets off anyway. The next day the athorities are there rounding up all the runaways. Tally escapes and frees her friends. She eventually becomes pretty. So now everyone is happy and they all live good lives."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I recommend this book because it is very thriling and exciting. At the end of every chapter the author leaves you hanging, trying to make you anxiouse to read more.

This book is realistic fiction and probably just about anyone that is adventures would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was WAY better than I expected it to be.

While I found the concept to be interesting, I found the book to be lacking. The characters weren't likable, and I found the main character to be annoying. While romances in these books are never believable, this one was just awkward and disappointing. I figured I would give this YA book a chance because I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and despite my criticisms for it the Twilight series was actually an enjoyable, quick read. Maybe I've exhausted the list of YA books that I would find enjoyable."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book because I had purchased the authors previous novels, both being in the \\"Midnighters\\" trilogy and enjoying them both very much. This was an amazing novel, you start off thinking that society has finally gotten its stuff together and created harmony. At the age of 16 you are given an operation that turns you from an \\"ugly\\" to a \\"pretty\\" and all the uglies want to to be one of the pretties.Makes sense, I would hate having to be called \\"ugly\\" for my life. Then everything fall around the greatness of being a pretty. Tally the main character of the book runs into a person who becomes here best fried. Shay want to never have the pretty operation and runs a way to this place where everyone is ugly and lives like they did in the old times, which the people of that time are called \\"Rusties\\" as all the stuff they created has turned to rust or rubble.Shay does run away to the \\"Smoke\\" and Tally is upset that she did not go along with her(a little), but then she is forced to go to the Smoke because of the other breed of people thata round besides the Pretties and Uglies, they are the \\"Specials\\" or Special Circumstances and they want to destroy the smoke and all places similar to it. Tally complies, because they say they will make her stay ugly forever, which is the most devastating thing possible in her mind, so she goes to spy and reveal the location of the Smoke.Then she learns to love it, but eventually she does some tings which bring down the Smoke and lead her to becoming a pretty only as a chance to help the problem with a Pretties mind, which is VERY severe. Which leads directly into the second book \\"Pretties\\"."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I know this book is pretty popular, but I don't understand why. I normally love this type of book, but I found this book completely lacking. The characters were dull and not developed. I had no interest in finishing the series."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I blazed through this book in about 2 1/2 hours. Once I started reading I was immediately sucked into a fantastic world of hovercrafts, dried foods and the adventures of a \\"Bad girl\\". So why didn't I give it four, or even five stars?A few things. First, you can definitely tell that this book is written for young adults. Even more so than other young adult novels out there. It's simplistic and full of moral preaching. \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" and \\"Don't pollute\\" being two of the biggest messages being told. There's arguments for (or against, if you take the Pretties side) eating meat, thinking for oneself, etc. It's almost overwhelming and makes the story a bit less enjoyable for me, so.. take away one star.The second is the quick resolution. Seriously? Just.. boom, a confession and then everything gets turned around? It just felt all too neat and tidy. So much so, it feels like the cliffhanger at the end is more like.. a downwardhill-hanger. Sure, I'm interested in getting to the bottom of the story, but I'm not propelled to the next book like I was for say, the Harry Potter books or The Hunger Games novels.Is this a bad book though? Not at all! It's an enjoyable, fun read with lots of adventure, interesting characters and a vibrant world.

Why? Well once she turns sixteen she will be reunited with her BFF Peris, but more importantly than that, she will finally be pretty. That's right, at the moment, Tally is living amongst the Uglies.\\"Uglies\\" is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious global catastrophe has pretty much wiped out most of the planet as well as its inhabitants. Several hundred years later, the survivors (or at this point generations later) fearful of war and violence - now cities are known as independent states. These cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good. For instance at the age of sixteen you undergo major plastic surgery and are moved to new living quarters in a town known as, you guessed it, \\"Prettytown\\" - where you live it up with other pretties just like you - partying and just having a grand ol' time.A couple of months prior to their sixteenth birthday, Tally meets Shay. They become fast friends and tend to hang out and play tricks together. But after several weeks Tally realizes that there's something different about Shay. For one, she doesn't want to be pretty, she actually thinks she's not ugly. Which to Tally is quite surprising since everyone knows you are ugly before the operation. Secondly, she keeps talking about a secretive place called the Smoke and a mysterious friend named David. Shay eventually runs away to the Smoke the day before her sixteenth birthday leaving Tally behind with a set of cryptic directions in case she decides to forgo her dream of being pretty. But Tally has no intention of running away - her dream has always been to be pretty. That is until Special Circumstances (an organization like the FBI) gets involved and gives her the ultimatum of being pretty or staying ugly forever but in the process she'll have to betray her friend and all the inhabitants of the Smoke. That is, of course, if she can decipher Shay's directions and makes it there alive.Although I did find it a bit difficult at first to understand what was going on, once I actually started understanding about pretties, uglies, etc., I really enjoyed this dystopian future. I love anything post-apocalyptic - and reading about a world where technology surpasses ours, where there's a magnetic grid running beneath the surface that allows the residents to travel via hoverboards and/or hovercrafts, is a treat. I liked the fact that it had an underlying thread about recycling and taking care of our planet. And like most teens today - Tally and Shay were facing some of the same issues - low self-esteem, peer pressure, etc. I loved when they would mention the Rusty's (the people who were living before the big catastrophe... or us). It was a mystery that little by little unraveled itself on what and why the world was the way it is in their time. I will forewarn that it ends rather abrubtly, but do not fret as there is a sequel.With that said, although a bit confusing at first, stick through the first couple of chapters and you will find yourself completely immersed in a unique world full adventure, suspense and even a little romance thrown in there for good measure."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I got this book I didn't realize there were such different reviews on it. Most people either loved it or hated it. I thought it was a terrific read. Interesting story that held my attention throughout the book. Good characters and the dialogue was well done.I thought some of the ways things were referred to were kind of dumb (uglies, pretties, littlies), but other than I enjoyed reading it.I was disappointed that it isn't a stand-alone novel. There is absolutely no ending in the book, it just stops. There are a few book that are written that way, so it's not all that unusual, but books like that at least resolve something, they don't just end abruptly."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Plot/Storyline: 3 1/2 StarsThe plot is an interesting one with a society split by Uglies and Pretties. You are an Ugly until you turn sixteen, when you get an operation to make you a Pretty. However, a few Uglies rebel against this thinking, wanting to keep their own appearance.This book is not just a story, but a commentary on society today. It actually has valid arguments for both sides. The author did a decent job of hiding most of his preaching within the storyline.I wasn't thrilled with one portion of Tally's journey to become a rebel. There were some inconsistencies in her learning curve.I felt like the ending was a bit rushed. .I found the description of the society to be rather simplistic, even for a YA book. It didn't really explain how the society maintained itself within the structure of age groups.Character Development: 4 StarsTally's character was very well done. She was a deep thinker without appearing to be too wise beyond her years.David was not done nearly as well. There was no real explanation as to why he trusted Tally so much practically on sight, when almost everyone else was suspicious. Considering that he should have been one of the more interesting characters, he was very shallow.Writing Style: 4 StarsThe first sentence was written to attract thirteen year olds. After that, the writing does get somewhat more mature. It never quite reaches adult level, but I do think it would take a middle teen to catch all of the nuances and references.The constant usage of childish names, littlies and grippy shoes, did get rather annoying after awhile. I think a teenager might even question the \`baby' terms for everything.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsI got this book from the publisher's site for free. That version had some very bad formatting. So, I downloaded the sample from Amazon; the sample looks fine and had no discernible problems.Rating: PG for mild violence and mature situations"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book had been on my wish list for awhile, and I finally picked it up when we were on vacation in Florida a couple of weeks ago. I started it yesterday afternoon and found myself already finishing it earlier today. The book had me intrigued (and laughing) at the first line: \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" Tell me that doesn't catch your attention. Admittedly, as I continued reading, the story took a bit of getting used to and felt like it was off to a slow start, but that was mainly because Westerfeld had to devote many pages to what I call the backstory before he could really get into the action and crux of the adventure.Westerfeld has created an interesting story that focuses on topics that teens (and former teens and probably tweens, too) can relate to: body image, peer pressure, self-worth and self-confidence. But with Uglies, he's done this in a very creative, captivating way. Westerfeld's writing style isn't earth-shattering and his futuristic ideas take some getting used to, but overall the book was a very easy, fast read, despite being over 400 pages. I really liked Tally and grew quite attached to her--Westerfeld did a great job with her character development. I could see it coming when she unwittingly notified the authorities (the \\"Specials\\" or Special Circumstances) of her whereabouts with Shay (and other uglies, known as the Smokies) and was interested to see how her apparent betrayal would be handled. I was not disappointed. The book closes with Tally making a difficult but necessary choice that sends her back to become a Pretty. And naturally, that's where Uglies leaves off and Pretties begins.(Additional Note: My actual rating is 4-1/2 stars but I round up for sites like Amazon.)I really wasn't sure at first if I was going to like this book, but in the end I really did. I was a little turned off by Westerfeld's treatment of various issues that may or may not have led to the Rusties' (that's us, if I'm not mistaken) downfall, but was able to separate that from the real story that was being told."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have to start saying that this is probably my favorite cover of all times. Really! I mean, you can guess by my blog that green is my favorite color, so that has to do with it. But also, I've always love half-face pictures, the tricky part is.. can you actually tell who it is from it? Not really, its hard! But anyway, I love the cover art. Way too much!!The plot was terrific. This has been one of the best scenarios that an author has managed to stick in my head. The whole ugly-pretty thing, wow! What a concept! When I was not reading, I was thinking about the book, the world, the story, everything. That's the power of a great book. It was excruciatingly hard to stop reading. The characters are great, I love Shay.Maybe at first it took a while to get me interested, but then I figured he has too much to explain. The way Westerfeld makes you look at the world today, is priceless. It has definitely been more than just a novel for me. It has a message of equality that screams out of the story. I had never read his books, but he just became one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Even a few weeks after read Uglies, I'm still not sure if i liked it or not.This book is definitely an easy read. It follows the story of Tally Youngblood, an ugly whose only thought in life is about turning pretty and joining her friend Paris. That is until she meets Shay who doesn't want to turn pretty.I liked the concept of this book, but was put off by the writing style that was definitely intended for younger children. (7th graders maybe). I felt like the author tried too hard to explain things about the characters and plot that I already understood. Even though the book is \\"young adult\\", it didn't have to be as dumbed down as it was. There are tons of young adult books that are enjoyed by people of all ages.Although I thought the plot of kind of slow and boring for the first section of the novel, once Tally reached The Smoke, the story became more interesting. I enjoyed reading about her relationship with David, but at the same time, felt bad for Shay who was always in love with him.Overall, I did enjoy reading this book. I would have liked to see it written for all ages instead of just middle school students, but there were parts that I thoroughly enjoyed. I will be purchasing Pretties with the hope that it will be as good, if not better than Uglies"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big fan of books in a series, like Harry Potter and Twilight, when I was informed of Westerfeld's saga I jumped right to it; for his first New York Times best seller, I would say a superb job. Books about an alternative reality are always intriguing, especially when they confront everyday questions. For instance, have you ever thought you were ugly and that the world would be better if you were as pretty as your favorite celebrity? What if I told you in the secluded city that Westerfeld created you could get just that? Unless, however, you are Tally and your new best friend Shay decides she doesn't want this and will run away. Then what?The novel is almost like a slap in the face to our modern world. At sixteen, ever citizen is given an operation to be pretty; their only responsibility is to have a good time. The concept? To rid everyone of jealously, war, hatred, and all the \\"negative\\" qualities that makes us human.Similar to our government, Tally and the citizens of Ugly and New Pretty Town have no idea what is going on and it takes running away to understand. You see, once Shay runs away the FBI of Tally's town, called Special Circumstances, and their agents of supernatural individuals, Specials, blackmail Tally to get her friend back or she can't change into a pretty. Imagine your dreams being crushed and of course you would do everything to get what you want, to life a life of fun. Tally risks her life on a journey to The Smokes, a city for runaways, Uglies; and she is opened up to a world of history, one her school never told her about.It's good to be not only educated about your history but everyone's history. What you want might not entirely be the right thing for you, how can you decide until you know all of the details? Feelings of being trapped, complications of love, betrayal, risk, and sacrifices are just some of the occurrences Tally encounters.A couple things did bother me though. The novel didn't suck me in until about one hundred fifty pages in, the beginning of the story is the building friendship between two Uglies, Shay and Tally, but that gets thrown out of the window once they reunite - why have them work so hard at this friendship for it to end. Especially...the downfall of our society...to Love, Shay's love interest, David, whose parents were runaways, begins to lose interest in her and falls for Tally.Also, seeing as we are forced to like the protagonist, when she arrives at this new city of Uglies, we expect her to call the Specials to come get her out of there, get the job done, but no...it's not that easy of course. The antagonist, Dr. Cable, who is pretty much in charge of the operations, is obviously crazy for trying to hold all the power and maintain balance in the world.This page-turner will not do you wrong and keep you intrigued, it is one of the books that you tell yourself, \\"Just one more chapter,\\" as your fighting yourself out of sleep - well for me anyway. Oh, did I mention that of course there is controversy and of course everything is not perfect as the Specials want the Pretties to seem?"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally Youngblood lives in a world where at the age of 16 everyone undergoes an operation and turns super-model gorgeous, and if your not gorgeous your ugly.

Headstrong in her ways Shay runs away a few days before the pretty operation and cannot be found anywhere. The thing is, Tally knows where she is, and she herself cannot turn pretty until Shay is found. Tally will make a treacherous trek to go and find Shay, but when she finds her will she herself still want to go back and become pretty? To what ends will she go to preserve herself? Why doesn't Shay want the operation??If I answered any of these questions it would spoil the book, so I will refrain myself! This book was amazing, and was definitely a page turner. There is even an essence of romance in the book, that many girls, including myself, just adore. The book also portrays a wonderful message about not having to be absolutely gorgeous to be smart, and even pretty in certain people's eyes.

There's plenty of action, suspense and questions to keep the pages turning to find out what's going to happen.

The characters aren't thoroughly fleshed out, but well enough so that I have a connection to them. Truths about our society as it stands today are highlighted, even touching on our reliance on oil and our destruction of the environment.

Tally goes on intense adventures, struggling through living in the wild by herself. She meets both frightening and friendly people who make huge impacts on her life.I loved this book so much that I've read it over and over again and it still keeps me excited and entertained. This book provides loads of surprises and adventures that will keep you reading for hours."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Scott Westerfeld's Uglies is a fantastic book. I know it's an older series but I hadn't read it and after I enjoyed Leviathan so much, I decided to give it a shot.As in Leviathan, Westerfeld shines when he's creating an alternate reality. In Uglies he throws us into a dystopian world where anyone that isn't literally perfect is considered hideous and shunned to live a life isolated from the freewheeling hyper-advanced \\"New Pretty Town\\" - until their 16th birthday transforms them into the picture of perfection.Hmmm...Too skinny! Throw her in with the leper and the guy with the hunchbackTally Youngblood, an Ugly three months away from her operation, is a likable character - spirited, crafty, and kind - but the quality that really stands out like a sore thumb that constantly pokes you in the eye to remind you it's there is her obsession. It is REALLY annoying.Every few minutes Tally likes to remind us how she can't wait to be Pretty, or she points out the flaws of every Ugly she sees in excruciating detail.I understand that living in that world with nothing to look forward to except your prettifying 16th B-day could cause mental ailment, and this is her character flaw that she must overcome, but that doesn't make me want to hog-tie and gag her insecure thoughts any less. I got it after the first 100 times she went on and on and on about it.Unfortunately her new friend Shay (who has the same birthday as Tally) runs off just before their operation talking about about a secret organization called \\"Smoke\\" where nobody is Pretty and lives without the comforts and oppressions of the city. Shay tries to convince Tally to come with her but she refuses and Shay leaves her cryptic directions just in case she changes her mind.Tally is refused her operation by the mysterious \\"Special Circumstances,\\" and must choose between betraying her friend or becoming Pretty (which as you may remember is her only conscious thought...occasionally...just behind breathing).The technology is one of the highlights. Our heroine's (and everyone else outside of the cities) main mode of transportation is by way of hoverboard. Hover technology keeps everything upright and stable. Almost everything is solar powered or self-sustaining in some way and any kind of unnecessary overuse of resources has been banned. I loved this futuristic feel because while it wasn't so advanced that it seemed completely out of touch.I liked the way Westerfeld took good things about out society - conservation efforts - and had us develop them in a positive way. But then he took our obsession with youth, physical beauty and aesthetic perfection and evolved it way into the negative.The characters are realistic and have plenty of depth - no faceless mannequins whose only purpose is to be a blank canvas for the reader to project themselves upon. But again, Westerfeld's writing is excellent.Uglies is good for younger or older teens as there is no sex, language or violence to be concerned about. It's thought provoking about how much emphasis we put on looking good. Sure it has a message but it doesn't bog the story down.Uglies is beautiful entertainment!Cover: It's uh...it's colorful? I don't know, I'm not crazy about it. It doesn't really give me a clue as to what the book is about.First Line(s): The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.So...probably not the most appealing, but its got some definite shock value. You almost do a double take. It grabs you, just...not in a good way.Review by Jake Kirk"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Hey, this book, Uglies, is one of my favorite books now, it intertwines connections of love, sacrifice, action, and adventure into a 400 page book!

This quote appears on the front cover and really grabbed my interest. Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, was one of the best books I've read in a long time. This book is a social battle between ugliness and beauty. It grabs your attention from the start and the cliff hanger ending dares you to read the next book in the series. I would recommend this book to any teen who likes fiction, futuristic and adventurous books.Tally Youngblood is almost 16 years old. In her world, when you turn 16, you must have an operation that makes you \\"Pretty\\".

This quote appears on the front cover and really grabbed my interest. Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, was one of the best books I've read in a long time. This book is a social battle between ugliness and beauty. It grabs your attention from the start and the cliff hanger ending dares you to read the next book in the series. I would recommend this book to any teen who likes fiction, futuristic and adventurous books.Tally Youngblood is almost 16 years old. In her world, when you turn 16, you must have an operation that makes you \\"Pretty\\".

At first I thought it was a weird title and that the title was a little odd but it was worth it.

This book allows you to realize that everybody looks good in their own right.

Westerfield's vision was so clear, and the story line was amazing. The concept of the book was so different from anything I have read so far. There was never a dull moment for me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!Tally Youngblood is counting down the days until she turns sixteen. While most girls would be planning parties and getting new cars, Tally is looking forward to becoming a PRETTY! Her best friend Peris has already transitioned to New Pretty Town, the place you get to go once you become a pretty, and is able to do all the things pretties do. They throw extravagant parties, dress in the best clothes, and people actually like them. Uglyville is nothing like that. The uglies usually keep to themselves and refuse to venture out until they have their turn to move to New Pretty Town once they turn sixteen. Tally cannot help but sneak away one night and try to meet up with Peris in New Pretty Town, even though it is against the rules and can probably get her in a lot of trouble. She has been so lonely since he left. This changes on the night she surprises her long lost best friend. He seemed so angry with her for being there, and makes her promise she will not get caught and will not do anything to keep her from becoming a pretty again. In an attempt to flee after being discovered, Tally meets up with another ugly, Shay. She has been sneaking out at night also. Shay and Tally become fast friends, and realize they have more in common than most. They share the same birthday. This means that they will be turned together! They will not have to watch the other one leave without the other. This is why Shay's news of running away to a rebel camp shocks Tally beyond belief! Who does not want to become a pretty?! Although Shay tries to convince Tally to go, in the end Tally decides to stay. Shay leaves her a set of directions just in case she changes her mind, makes her promise to keep everything a secret, and they part ways. Will she ever see Shay again? Will she ever make it to The Smoke, the rebel camp she left for?Tally cannot believe that her surgery is finally here! This is what she has waited her whole life for! She is going to be a pretty and do all the things the pretties do! Right.... WRONG?! The surgery is put off and Tally is escorted to a place called Special Circumstances. Once here, she meets up with Dr. Cable and is presented with a proposition. She has to infiltrate The Smoke and spy for Special Circumstances in order to become a pretty, or she can stay an ugly for the rest of her life. But what about the promises she has made? Can she keep both promises to both friends? She has no choice. In order to get what she wants, she has to rat Shay out. As Tally embarks on her journey, she begins to speculate about The Smoke. What if she cannot figure out the encoded instructions? Thanks to Special Circumstances, no one even knows where she is! She travels for days until she reaches the field full of beautiful white flowers. Is this the place the letter describes? The smell of fire is what jars her awake the next day. In an attempt to flee, she is \\"rescued\\" by a helicopter full of.... PRETTIES!? They call themselves the rangers and are from another city. Although they are part of the clue, they have never seen The Smoke.\\"Don't you know? The location's a big secret. Smokies don't trust pretties. Not even us rangers. We'll take you to the usual spot, and you know the rest, right?\\"At last, she makes it to The Smoke. Still at odds with herself, she explores the runaway camp. Never does she expect to change her mind about revealing the camp, nor does she plan on falling for a guy her best friend likes! After a couple of days at The Smoke, David, the crush, takes her to meet his parents. Tally is shocked to discover they used to be the operational doctors for the pretties. They share some information that may turn the tables for good. While doing some research, they discovered that they pretties are technically being turned into mindless robots. Suddenly all the rave of being pretty in not enough for Tally. She has found love and a place where she belongs. But happiness is short lived when Special Circumstances appear out of no where. What has she done?! In an attempt to retrieve the pendant, Tally escapes the clutches of Specials. She makes it to a secret hideout and finds non other than David! Thank God they did not catch him! This would be the perfect time to tell him everything. He deserves to know, but Tally just cannot do it. She cannot lose him too! David and Tally know they have to attempt to save the smokies. Without their help, they will all be forced to become mindless pretties.After a couple of days, they make it back to Special Circumstances and with the help of some uglies cause a diversion and make it inside. What they find is quite a shock! Who will be left standing in the end? Make sure you grab this book and find out!

The writing is beautiful, thoughtful and most importantly action-packed. The characters face surreal problems, such as enormous government conspiracies, and also with issues we each must face in our lives, such as feeling inadequate, or the complex relationships we have with our friends, or having to make the choice between doing what is right and what is easy. It also makes us question our own society and the emphasis put on beauty and fame, our unsustainable lifestyles, and the hidden price of living in a sheltered 1st world society.In particular, I love this book best out of the entire series, because of the way that it begins: Tally isn't out to upset the status quo. She isn't trying to rebel against the system. She just wants to be with her friends, to be older and able to have more and do more. Slowly and believably, she starts to realize that there might be bigger concerns, some of which are worth fighting and sacrificing for. She learns what a true friend is. She learns how unimportant physical appearance is in comparison to creativity, critical thought, and deep emotion. She grows so believably from a typical (if a bit mischievous) teenager into someone determined to change the world, from someone who is mostly self-centered to someone who is mostly self-sacrificing.The series as a whole give us the full scope of the dystopia society so closely based on the ideals of our own. I recommend reading them all. But for those who really seek a character-driven story, this first book gives us a heroine and a coming-of-age story not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I chose this rating because the book is Interesting.

There is plenty of action to keep the pages turning and the world is strange and intriguing."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"Tally Youngblood is an ugly awaiting her surgery that will transform her into a pretty and send her on her way to New Pretty Town. All of her friends have already turned pretty, but since her birthday is in September, she is the last one waiting in Ugly Town. While turning a trick one night(not the kind of tricking you are thinking) she meets Shay, who believes there is something more to life than being pretty and partying all day and night. Tally has never heard of someone reluctant to be turned pretty. When Shay runs away to the far off land she has been mentioning, Tally is worried. But then the authorities give her a choice - find Shay, or never turn Pretty.I enjoyed this book. It certainly isn't my favorite in the world of dystopian books, but it did hold my attention from the beginning. It is a very interesting premise that everyone must be pretty to avoid conflicts. In a perfect world, this would simply make people equal, which would eradicate jealousy and judging someone from their looks. But it's not quite as simple as it all seems. I can't say much more without giving away spoilers, and I don't usually like spoilers in reviews. For me, there are two major morals to this story: 1) Looks are not nearly as important as we make them out to be, that your imperfections can make you beautiful, and having surgery to make you look more like someone else is not the answer. 2) Forcing someone to do something just because it is the right thing to do makes you no better than someone with bad intentions forcing someone to do something so that they fit into their idea of the world. I hope that makes sense. I don't know how else to word that.The one thing that did bother me is the secret that Tally holds on to the whole book. I was constantly holding my breath to see if she was going to let it out, or if the other characters would find out some other way. If she had told the secret earlier, I may have given it 5 stars. But the fact that she kept it made me look at her a little differently. I was nervous, knowing that the secret would ruin her and I was anticipating this the whole time, not able to really focus on the relationships she was building with other characters.This book definitely has a cliff hanger ending that makes me want to immediately start the next book to see what happens. Some people appreciate these endings, some don't. As long as the next book is already released by the time I am reading it, I am fine with them. That is why I wait until a whole series is finished to start reading them. Now, onto the next book:Pretties!(I encourage you to comment and vote on my reviews on whether or not the are helpful.

Most people wouldn't have an issue about being turned pretty. Some things are worth staying ugly for...The characters were easy to relate to. Shay is carefree and doesn't think about the ramifications of her actions. She's indecisive, and fun. David is sweet but can be a jerk, not that I blame him. I would have acted like one too. He acts like he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. Teenagers shouldn't be that stressed. Tally was a refreshing main character. It's nice to see female characters that aren't over-confident. Some of her actions are also completely selfish. I know those aren't great traits, but there's only so many times you can read about a character that's self-sacrificing from the very beginning. It can get monotonous. So it's nice to see a character with weaknesses we all deal with on a mostly daily basis.The story line was slow paced. I didn't mind this because Westerfeld did a great job with the world building. I could picture the rusty ruins easily. Most of the focus is on how Tally deals with the decisions she's made and her growth as a person.This wasn't the best dystopian I've read, but it kept my attention and I'll be reading the sequel, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Title: Uglies by Scott Westerfeld, ISBN: 0-439-80611-9, Scholastic Press, NY, 2005, 425 pp.Genre: Science FictionCharacters:Tally- a young girl desperately wanting to undergo a beautifying operation but can't until she finds her runaway friend, Shay.David- a young man who has lived in a society of people, \\"The Smoke\\", who didn't want the operation all his life.Peris- Tally's childhood friend who becomes \\"pretty\\" before her and is waiting for Tally to get the operation.Shay- a friend Tally meets while waiting to become pretty and who runs away to the Smoke not wanting the operation.Dr. Cable- a member of Special Circumstances who blackmails Tally to find Shay or stay ugly.Maddy- David's mother and a former surgeon and finds a terrible secret about the operation.

Scott Westerfeld has managed to write the most original science fiction novel, in my opinion, since the Hitchhiker's Trilogy. He's melded together a mixture of suspense, drama, romance, and humor in the best way. Tally is a most unique character- one only created by a mastermind.

Set in a future after the death of our own culture (to denizens of this dystopia, we're the Rusties because we built so many things with metals), society focuses on becoming beautiful. At age 16, every child undergoes a major surgery to meet the standard of beautiful: wide eyes, full lips, perfect skin, even a standard height. Before the surgery, they're called \\"uglies\\"; post-surgery, they're called \\"pretties\\". The stated goal of the surgery is to make everyone equal by making everyone meet a predetermined and narrowly-defined standard of beauty.Tally Youngblood is a 15-year-old girl who is just shy of her 16th birthday. Her best friend, Peris, has already had the surgery, and she misses him fiercely. She makes a friend in Shay, another girl who is missing her friends. Shay is missing her friends for a different reason. Instead of submitting to the surgery, Shay's friends have run away from their city to go to the Smoke, a community of other Ugly runaways. The night before Shay's surgery, she runs away too, leaving a note for Tally in case she wants to join her.Tally chooses to stay and become pretty. On the day of her surgery, she instead finds herself in the hands of Special Circumstances, a frightening enforcement agency that most Uglies and Pretties think doesn't exist. Special Circumstances wants to know more about the Smoke, and they give Tally a terrible decision: go find Shay and betray her and the Smoke, or never become pretty. Tally finally agrees to go to the Smoke. When she arrives, she meets David. His parents, both doctors, founded the Smoke when they discovered the horrible secret behind the surgery. Tally, shocked, decides that she will stay in the Smoke, and destroys the homing device that she was given by Special Circumstances.Destroying the device activates it anyway. Special Circumstances comes, rounds up all of the runaways, and takes them back to their city. They first turn Shay pretty, which verifies for the runaways the horror of the surgery. Tally admits to David and his mother that she was the cause of their discovery, and sets about making it right. The book ends there, leading to the next book in the series.I came to read \\"Uglies\\" by a recommendation in the blog of John Scalzi. His recommendation made me pick it up when I stumbled across it a few days later. I started reading the novel at 9pm that night; at midnight, 300 pages in, I had to force myself to put it down so that I could get at least some sleep before work the next day. I couldn't wait to get home to finish it, and now I'm disappointed that I didn't have time this evening to buy the next book in the series. It's been a long time since I've been unable to put a book down. I hope that the rest of the books in the series are as good as this!"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a 28-year-old, I didn't expect to find this book as enthralling as it was - the title lacks subtlety, and I figured that a book meant for teens might not be complex enough to truly draw me in and make me think. Not so! This is one of the most enjoyable reads I have had all year.Tally is an \\"ugly\\", a person under 16 in this society where people are turned \\"pretty\\" on their 16th birthday. Uglies, AKA adolescents, live separately from their parents in this world, existing in a loosely-controlled boarding school where they are relatively free to break out at nights and explore on their hoverboards.When Tally's best friend Peris becomes a pretty, Tally is hurt that she doesn't hear a word from him, and takes up a friendship with Shay, a rebellious young woman who questions whether she even wants to be pretty, a subversive and rare quality. When Shay decides to escape to \\"The Smoke\\", the deeply hidden rebel community where nobody turns pretty, Tally is forced by her government into deciding whether she wants to betray her new best friend and the community, or whether she wants to live her entire life stuck inside pretty town, but forever ugly and forever shunned.What happens next is the real story.This was a fast-paced, thought-provoking book that was a pleasure to read.

This book brings on so many unspoken issues that we see as problems, but are truly trivial issues in our day and age. I love how he incorporates it all into a futuristic and believable plot. This is a classic in the making (like 1984 and The Giver), and if you loved those books, you'll love this one, too.

I mean, a critical look at and deconstruction of our appearance obsessed culture and a dystopian glance at the extremes to which it can be taken - YES PLEASE. As the mother of two very young daughters, my heart withers daily as I see the glorification of impossible beauty standards and the ridicule of those not conforming them, always knowing that this excessive obsession with appearance will damage them, the question is just how much.However, I'm very sorry to say that I just couldn't get into this book. First off, I found Tally to be completely unsympathetic. While I understand that she is the product of her culture and society (aren't we all?) and I enjoyed her adventurous side, I found her cowardly, untrustworthy and just dull. Maybe if she was just a bit more like her friend, Shay, in the beginning at least asking questions or wondering about the status quo and how it's all supposed to make sense - because it doesn't, not really, how can a society like that function? - before being thrown into a situation where she's shown how it doesn't make sense, I would have felt differently? I can't honestly say.I also found the plot desperately predictable and unsurprising and the writing mostly uninspiring. While I did enjoy the other characters Tally met during her stay at Smoke (Yay, Croy!) and the conversations with David about appearance, it was all very predictable and formulaic. Even the \\"shocker\\" cliffhanger-ish end was something I saw coming from miles away.I feel bad for giving it only one, but I really just did not enjoy the book at all."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Predictable story lines, simple characters.

Enjoy"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was recommended this book by a good friend. I was expecting an innovative story with interesting supporting science. I was disappointed.This book tackles an important issue, peer pressure and focus on physical beauty. The characters, (while not particularly complex), were somewhat sympathetic. (David's immediate infatuation with Tally grated though.) I enjoyed the premise, and the story was interesting. The trouble was, that every time they brought up a new technology I winced and had to stop reading for a few minutes.The vast majority of the science in this book is horribly wrong. (Although, the science of beauty was correct and very interesting, it was cool to see it applied in a story.)Most of the gadgets were based on magnetic levitation against veins of metal in the earth. This is possible. In theory. However, a magnetic field strong enough to levitate a person say, fifteen feet in the air, would pull all their fillings out. The energy required for that would be enormous! Since Tally's long distance board runs on solar panels, this is impossible. Solar panels are not energy efficient enough to produce such a massive amount of electricity. Bungee Jackets and Crash Bracelets have the same problem, although bungee jackets have the added problem of vicious acceleration.The petroleum eating virus was also hard to take. A petroleum devouring bacteria is possible. A virus works in a completely different way from bacteria. Bacteria works like any living organism: taking in resources and using them to reproduce. Viruses, on the other hand, cannot reproduce without a living host. The concept of them eating the petroleum was impossible. If the author had switched it to bacteria, that would be plausible.All in all: Good emotion, interesting premise, awful science, okay characters. This is a good book for fourteen and under, but not for older teens or science knowledgeable kids."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy by Scott Westerfield. The book follows Tilly and Shay, two Uglies who are waiting to turn 16 so that they can get their operations and become Pretties. Pretties are all beautiful and get to live in New Pretty City where life is a party and beautiful all of the time. Everyone becomes a Pretty when they turn 16 without exception. While Tilly yearns to become a Pretty Shay wants to escape Uglyville to see what lies outside of the city. Shay is worried about the Pretty operation; what if more than just your appearance changes?Does the above sound like a shallow premise for a story? Well it is kind of. Although it makes you think a little bit (and I mean a little bit) about what would happen if everyone was perfect and beautiful. Although the story really isn't about that and maybe if it talked more about that it might have some substance.I realize being 30 I am not the main market for this young adult novel; but it seemed like surfacey and overused material for me. I think even young girls reading it will figure out what is going by the first chapter of the book. In tone it reminded me a little (tiny) bit of the Tripods Trilogy by John Christopher; except with young girls, and it was all about being pretty and identical, and humans actually have it pretty darn good, and there was a little love story, and I guess it's been about 15 years since I read the Tripods so maybe it wasn't all that similar. I really think it had a similar tone to it though.By the end of the book I am still not sure if people being turned Pretty is all that horrible. I think you were supposed to think it is the worst thing in the world but I wasn't all that convinced.All the above being said. The book was simply written, easy to read, a very quick read, and entertaining enough that I finished it. Given all I have heard about these novels I already purchased the next two so...I will probably read the next book in the series even though I am not all that enamored with it. It gets 3 stars for an \\"It's okay, I guess\\". It didn't offend me but it didn't work my mind or thrill me either.karissabooks.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tally Youngblood has been brought up in a world where people are considered ugly after age 12, when they are sent to live in Uglyville. Everyone is given an operation to become pretty at age 16. Tally is almost 16 and can hardly wait to get her operation, but she makes a new friend who feels differently. While it seems a minor problem, it evolves into something much bigger. Suddenly Tally questions everything she has ever believed in. And now the only thing that seems important to her is the horrible truth she has learned about becoming pretty.Uglies is a phenomenal example of how distorted society's idea of beauty is, and what happens when normal isn't good enough. It reminds us that beauty comes from within, and it also explores the fact that we must listen to our instincts when it comes to knowing what's right, even if that means not always trusting the authorities. I would recommend Uglies to everyone as it has a very important message and especially to anyone who enjoys exciting, futuristic books."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Flash three hundred years into the future where mankind has been propelled into a chilling dystopian vision. In one act of terrorism, an engineered petroleum bacterium has brought the world to a standstill. Free thought, free will, industry, culture, diversity and imagination have now become things of the past.In its place resting on the ashes of the 21st century and all it encompassed, is a world shaped by scalpel. This is the world that Tally Youngblood unknowingly lives in. As a fifteen year old \\"Ugly\\", Tally looks forward to her 16th birthday. That is when she will be whisked off to complete her transformation from an \\"Ugly\\" to a \\"Pretty\\"-where beauty's specifications are cunningly determined by the Pretty Committee.But what she doesn't know it's that that not only her body will be changed, but her mind. Just mere weeks before her operation date, she meets Shay, another Ugly in the dorm. Shay seems to know of a world that operates outside of Uglyville and New Pretty Town-a mysterious backwoods utopia known as The Smoke-where the government can't get at you. But getting there might end up costing too much. And what Tally and Shay don't know is that the government will do anything to crush The Smoke and its rebellion. Including using her and Shay to their own ends.Westerfeld knows the intricacies of humanity's foibles and he exploits them in his terrifying vision of the future, where everyone looks alike, acts alike, thinks alike, and only a select few are chosen to think freely. The human race is depicted as operating with such diminished capacity that readers will cringe, and Westerfeld manages to encapsulate the conflict and pressures of superficiality that plagues society today. What could be scarier: A future where the government controls your actions or where they actually tamper with your mind? The Uglies Trilogy is an inventive and captivating YA series, reminiscent of Stephens' The Big Empty, and Orwell's 1984 with a little bit of Logan's Run thrown in.Copyright(c)Nicola Mattos"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When a book has a \\"point\\", some kind of after-school special message to send, the story suffers. A lot.This isn't one of those books.Maybe Scott Westerfield didn't mean for there to be a message, but his writing skills are good enough that it simply doesn't get in the way.In this far-future world, everyone is \\"ugly\\" until the age of 16, when an operation turns them into an idealized \\"pretty\\", appealing to all in an anime-esque version of _Harrison Bergeron_ equality. Tally is wholly a part of this world, until she's forced into an adventure, blackmailed with her \\"prettyness\\" held hostage until she betrays a friend.Westerfield's ability to write compelling characters continues to shine, creating a believable world with fascinating characters. It's a testament to his skill that this book - the first in a trilogy - is not his best (hence the 4 stars on my review), but remains far better than most books in the field. My major gripe (such as it is) is that Tally is a female protagonist. Not that I have a problem with THAT, but he shares a flaw with Robert Heinlein - his female leads act... well, awfully butch. Still, if sharing a flaw with Heinlein is the worst you can say, you're doing quite well. Recommended for teens and up."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I borrowed this book from the library at my school, which just happened to get it. It was awesome, one of the few great books I have read; and I've read a lot of books. I inquired about the second book and the librarians reasearched it for me: Pretties. It comes out later this year, I think. I can't wait. Anyone looking for a great read should pick up this book. It's got enticing characters, a great plot line, is very descriptive, and wonderfully put together."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love to read young adult books- some are so brave and they address issues adult books haven't gotten around to yet. This is that kind of book. The set-up, the world created, is great-very imaginative. There are some problems though. Tally is beyond innocent at the beginning of the book- she is...well...kind of stupid and annoying. Also, the plot went the way I expected. All this might mean that I would rate the book lower. However, Tally does slowly get a bit better character-wise. In addition, the well created and imagined world in which the book takes places deserves revisiting. Therefore, I would recommend the book with some reservation, while I myself will move on to reading Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It held my interest the whole time. I kept on wanting to know what was gonna happen next. It was definitely a book you could read in one sitting from it holding your interest"},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I still can't decide how I feel about Uglies. I finished it a day or two ago, but I find that when I think about it, a riot of emotion just overwhelms me. I'm a big ball of worry, sadness, disgust, curiosity, hopefulness, admiration, and a couple of other feelings. (Notice how I didn't include happy on my list. There's a reason for that and I'll talk about it in a bit.)Uglies is another spectacular dystopian novel, and reading it has increased my love for this particular genre. Scott Westerfeld created a world that was both realistic and surreal all at once, simply using a concept that modern day society makes a big deal out of - beauty. It literally took my breath away how he managed to wrangle this concept into something so seemingly definable, and how he used it to delineate between what kind of people the characters were. His writing is masterful and, best of all, I loved that it made me reflect and think about things I never would have thought about.Final verdict: This book is another brilliant dystopian novel, and personally, it definitely lived up to its hype. It also made me think a lot about beauty and society's pressure for a certain kind of beauty to prevail amongst all others - and that definitely made my mind whirl. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Pretties."},{"Title":"Uglies (Uglies Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thought that the book was absolutely amazing in every way it was a little long but reading it on the KINDLE was a breeze!This book definitely earned 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"Despite the one star review, for more than 300 pages I was really enjoying this read. It was so unusual, with such a dream-like quality. This is not at all the typical romantic suspense, and I found the surreal mood fascinating. But then, Devine pulled the rug out from under me so thoroughly that I feel completely cheated. (Spoiler alert--I'm going to reveal the big surprise ending.)At the very end, Devine reveals that a character the reader has become very fond of--especially if she has read Satisfaction, in which this character is the hero--is a truly despicable, skin-crawling villain. I felt as devastated as the hero of this book, which granted made for a very effective, emotional scene. But this is not the effect I'm looking for in a romance novel!! If this novel had not been labled a romance (and if this villain hadn't been the hero of a previous book), I probably would have applauded Devine's ability to provoke a reaction in the reader. As it is, I wish I'd never invested the emotional energy in this book.Although I enjoyed Devine's writing, I will never read another of her books because I feel I can't trust her to give me the happily-ever-after ending I expect in a romance. (Yes, the hero and heroine end up together, but because of the hero's brother's betrayal, it feels very much unlike HEA!) What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"For those who have read SATISFACTION (the first story of the Galliard Brother - Lujan) avoid this book at all costs. I bought SENSATION believing that Ms Devine, would explore Kyger (Lujan's brother) and pick up where SATISFACTION ended. The story is boring, the suspense is non-existent and so convoluted that it did not make sense (I had to re-read so many pages believing that I may have skipped parts...) as to how the \\"hero\\" in the previous book is now the \\"villain\\". To add insult to injury there was less sex in this book (in comparison toher other books) and what sex it did contain (because of how the lead characters are created in this book you could not careless about them)seemed cold and unemotional.When looking for a Romantic suspense, I am for the main element (Hot & Passionate) ROMANCE, SUSPENSE, some context surrounding the story. Ms Devine missed the opportunity to develop all the Characters from both stories.Those new to Ms Devin, read \\"The Forever Kiss\\" as an example of how good her books can be."},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"I own all of her books. For years I kept saying she wasn't that bad a writer. Then came this piece of cow pile. This sucks. The writing is amateur and sloppy the characters are purile and annoying. Most disgusting of all is she makes the brother from the previous book the bad guy, and the brother and his wife disapper. What happens to them? I'm not wasting $14 more to find out! This was the first book I ever took back to the store. Avoid it at all costs."},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"Now, I am a lover of historical romance and I have previously enjoyed Thea Devine's books. My favorite book was Satisfaction--the book that precedes this one and involves the same characters.This was the WORST book I've ever read by Ms. Devine and I was so frustrated, angry, and disappointed when I read it that I returned it to the store the next day, and I then wrote Thea Devine a letter detailing why I loved Satisfaction and why I was so disappointed by this book. Of course, I never heard back from her or her staff.This book takes my favorite character from Satisfaction--Lujan Galliard, the hero--and makes him the VILLAIN in this book. How can you sacrifice one hero, one brother in order to support the other? I like Kyger, but this book did not even have the strength of Ms. Devine's other books. The plot was not as good, she heavily digressed into vulgar, unsatisfying sex scenes involving brutality against women, and there was little or no sense of love between the main characters at the end of this book. It was poorly done.In the previous books that I've read (Desire Me Only, Seduction, Satisfaction, and one whose title I forgot but whom readers will recognize when I mention \\"The Eye of God\\") all ended with a sense that the main characters were in love. This book was based on a very fragile romance. It also destroyed the female lead of Satisfaction--Jancie--who was one of the most likeable heroines of Ms. Devine's books.I also realized something when I read this book. The guilty party is always a close family member!! In every book of Thea Devine's that I've read, the villain turns out to be a mother, a father, a brother, a sister. While in the previous books the villians were very despicable characters, this one tops the cake!It takes a character who goes through a large amount of growth in the first book, who learns lessons of love, responsibility, and family and turns him into an evil, dispicable man who is incapable of feeling kindness or any likeable human emotion. He is beyond saving in this book and it makes it seem as if her first book were a complete farce, which makes the readers feel like idiots. The worse thing you can do as an author is make your readers into fools, and as I wrote to Miss Devine, I am highly doubtful that I will ever want to read any of her books published after this point.Save your money, or make sure to read one of her earlier books and beware of anything published after this book!!! Or, if you MUST read it, get it from the library. Then it doesn't cost anything and you can take it back!"},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"A huge disappointment for all. What could have been a beautiful story equal to that of Devine's previous novel, Satisfaction has been marred by Sensation's unhappy ending, confusing/messy plot whereupon many questions are left unanswered. Sensation revisits the characters of Satisfaction whereupon we are reunited with Lujan and Jancie. The book is intended to give Kyger (brother of Lujan) his own story but does this half-heartedly. More attention is on the mysterious plot rather than on him. Readers of the previous novel will find Sensation an unpleasant surprise when shocking revelations and damning suspicions are cast about the favoured character of Satisfaction (previous novel). The book switches between the relationship between Angilee & Kyger and the mystery that Kyger is trying to solve abruptly and the relationship is left undeveloped and their coming together as a \\"happy\\" couple is sloppy and seen as a \\"plug\\" to end the story quickly. The plot does not flow smoothly and is confusing at times. There is much that could have been done to improve the novel and it does not live up to expectations. It was expected that Kyger would have his own happy ending and the story would flow more harmoniously by taking its cue from Satisfaction. However, the author has succeeded in thoroughly confusing & shocking readers and leaving them to wait for the answers to many questions. The only ray of hope is that the shocking revelations & suspicions are all a ruse and that equilibrium will be restored with a happy ending in a new book to finish off the saga to the Satisfaction of us readers."},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"I used to read all her books, but the last couple of books have been just terrible. What happened to one of my favorite authors? In this book, she makes the brother of the hero into someone I don't even recognize. Maybe that gets resolved in another book but I know I won't be reading it.

I'm sorry to say this: Don't buy this book, save your money for somthing else."},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"I used to love all thea devine's book and satisfaction is one of my favorite. I love the characters Jancie and Lujan, especially the way Lujan realized in the book how much he loves Jancie and happily throw away his jaded ways to be with her. I want to buy Sensation because I would like to see what happen afterward with Jancie and Lujan. Now, normally, I would read the customer reviews on Amazon first to see what I am getting into, but I was in a hurry this time so I didnt. At the book store, I sort of scan through it and flip to read the ending first (hard to break a habit). OH MY GOD!!! I was aboslutely horrified of Thea's revealing of Lujan's character! And the dissapearing of Jancie and Hugan!! I was so horrified that I drop the book right then and there. There's no way I buy and much less read it now. I have just one question to Ms. thea: WHY?

Don't waste your money!!"},{"Title":"Sensation","review":"I am one of her biggest fans and this was terrible. What was she thinking with that ending? I guess the hero in the previous book was a bit nasty and cold and it could be believable that he would turn out bad but hey no one wants to really read that when all is said and done. Lujan was no saint, far from it but to make him out to be a villian in this book was pretty bad.As far as this book. Forget it. Boring. Very boring.

However this sequel to Sensation if called that was HORRIBLE and SHAMEFUL in it's destruction of the redeeming and healing way Janice love transforms Lujan, the brother of this books character Kyger. To use this book to destroy her,and her life. Was shameful. Kyger, in this story if called that was not even defined or left to grow and flourish. Rather he was hidden in the pit literally of the scam of what is Lujans life. Do Ms Devine make this up to your readers by letting us know that all was not in vain for Janice or Lujan. Who both disappeared in this fiasco of a book. HOW you can bring about the phoenix and restoration of Lujan to his Janice. NOW that's a story. The power of Love. How about it?

However, I just couldn't resist reading Kyger's story after having read Lujan's, and I was prepared for the worst. I was amazed! This book had me reading from cover to cover in one night. I already knew who the villan was thanks to reviewers who have to spoil the ending, but I was still so surprised when I got to that part that I screamed out loud. I think I enjoyed this book more than any other I have read of Thea Devine's. I love the emotional growing that Kyger goes through in this book and was very happy to see that he gets his happy ending. I agree with other reviewers that this book should not be considered a romance but as an erotic mystery it is top notch.

Two days later Tony is dead with a fishhook engraved on his chest.In Bullhead Manor, while he was visiting prostitutes, Kyger Galliard thinks of his beloved Jancie, who married his older brother Lujan; everything changes when an American stranger Angilee Rosalyn offers him money if he takes her maidenhead. Her wealthy father is forcing her to wed odious Lord Wroth for his title. She figures the arrogant aristocrat would never marry a deflowered female. He takes her virginity, but is shocked that he did not think of Jancie.Top government official Lord Wyland wants Kyger to find dirt on the assassinated Venable because he fears for its future if people do not move beyond the assassination. The only clue is Bullhead Manor which Tony allegedly frequented. Kyger investigates but hears how Tony was a hero and rumors of a Sacred Seven are somehow involved in his murder. As the danger mounts, the \\"Bullhead Bull\\" and the \\"edible virgin\\" fall in love, but someone wants Kyger dead and her father has chosen the odious Wroth.Readers will enjoy this erotic amateur sleuth investigation filled with twists and turns although the final spin will disturb some readers. The lead female is a courageous individual risking all to avoid an odious marriage while the puzzled hero is delightfully human as he is unsure what to do for the heroine and how to proceed with the case. Though the final dispatching of the bad guys is too easy considering how deadly they are supposed to be, fans will receive much SATISFACTION from this fine Victorian romantic suspense.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"The Song of Roland is the most famous of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; (songs of deeds) of the Middle Ages. It provides a fascinating view into the spirit of warriors of that time and their motivation. The Song of Roland gives an idealized picture, of course, and if we can believe the historians, the medieval knights never lived up to their chivalric ideal.The Song of Roland is not commonly included in the canon of must-read classics. Except in France, maybe. I assume the reason is that people in our time do not trace back their roots to the feudalism of the Middle Ages, and that they consider the chapter of chivalry closed after Cervantes's satirical portrait of knighthood in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In one respect, however, this gory tale of slaughter, martyrdom and revenge is very contemporary. It illustrates the mindset of crusaders who see the world in terms of Good and Evil, and the language they use to incite contempt of the other party.Apart from its historical value, the Song of Roland is also worth reading as literature - as an outstanding example for the heroic epic and as a piece of art whose &quot;simple yet elevated style and tone of high moral purpose&quot; (R. Harrison) is reminiscent of the Old Testament.The three most easily available translations of the Song of Roland in the market are:W.S. Merwin's 1963 prose translation with introduction, re-published in paperback by Random House's &quot;Modern Library&quot; in 2001 (ISBN 0375757112). His nine-page introduction is a succinct but sufficient overview of the historical events of AD 778 that became the basis of the Song of Roland. The translation stands out for its readability, and Merwin's choice of modern English makes the descriptions of violence even more direct and graphic: &quot;And Oliver rides through the battle, with his spear shattered to a stump, charges against Malun, a pagan, breaks his gilded shield with the flowers painted on it, knocks the eyes out of his head and brings his brains tumbling down to his feet.&quot; (page 43).Robert Harrison's 1970 translation for Penguin Book's budget line &quot;Mentor Books&quot; (ISBN 0451528573) captures the throbbing, urgent rhythm of the verse form best: &quot;Olivier now gallops through the fray - / his lance has snapped, he only has a stump - / and goes to strike a pagan, Malsaron. / He breaks his gilt, fleuron-emblazoned shield, / bursting both his eyeball from his head - / his brain comes tumbling downward to his feet - &quot; (page 93). &quot;Fleuron-emblazoned&quot; is quite enigmatic compared to Merwin's clear &quot;with the flowers painted on it&quot;, but Harrison redeems himself by choosing &quot;bursting&quot; to emphasize the violence of the attack. The big plus of Harrison's book is his 42-page introduction. He explains the logic of medieval chivalry, why cruelty coexisted with sensitivity, and butchery with prayer. One interesting concept is the medieval &quot;ethos of success,&quot; or in other words the idea that the outcome justifies the means: When a knight killed another knight it was the will of God that this had happened, no matter by what means. Make the opponent trip and chop off his head - see, God is on your side. Harrison goes to quite some length to introduce the instruments of war, the armor and weapons, which is very helpful since the main body of the Song of Roland is about the glory and slaughter of battle.Glyn Burgess's 1990 translation for Penguin Classics (ISBN 0140445323) is the most recent translation of the three. He stays closest to the form of the original, which gives his translation a certain wooden inflexibility but also a not entirely unbecoming pathos. His translation of Olivier's attack on Malun is quite telling: &quot;Oliver rides through the thick of the fray; / His lance shaft is broken, only a stump remains. / He goes to strike a pagan, Malun; / He breaks his shield, wrought with gold and flowers, / and smites both his eyes out of his head. / His brains come spilling out over his feet;&quot; (page 72) While the use of &quot;wrought&quot; and &quot;smite&quot; sounds a bit old-fashioned, &quot;spilling&quot; is an excellent choice. Burgess added a 19-page introduction to his translation. It focuses mostly on the literary qualities of the Song of Roland; for the first-time reader of the Song of Roland, Harrison's introduction is more helpful. The additional value of the Penguin Classics edition lies in an Appendix with about one third of the original version of the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; - the key passages of the work in Old French.While all three translations have their pros and cons, I tend to recommend Harrison's book over the two others. It strikes a good balance between the clarity of Merwin's prose translation and the wooden feel of Burgess's more literal verse translation. In addition, it impresses with its useful introduction and its unbeatable value for money."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"I have had a chance rather vividly to contrast this version with the Glyn Burgess translation, and Harrison is not only more readable, it's better poetry. I use the book in a class of eighth grade boys in New York (who love it), and by mistake a bought a slug of the Burgess translation. Then I had some boys with Harrison, some with Burgess, and the howls from the Burgessites were considerable. Harrison is just a better, livlier, even funnier translation."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"Cost being a factor in determining books to be purchased by students, I strongly recommend this translation by Leonard Bacon (1914). The lines are mainly in iambic heptameter (seven beats per line) with a clear caesura, which facilitates a student's oral reading of the poem. Though the original French used assonance more than end rhyme, Bacon does rhyme his English lines. Compared to the iambic pentameter of the Dorothy L. Sayers translation, Bacon's is a little faster paced, but one senses the hoofbeats of the horses with two more beats per line, which isn't altogether bad for an epic poem about a military massacre. Though a good choice in terms of price, Bacon's translation lacks glosses of archaisms (e.g., the word \\"eme\\" is not explained as an archaism of \\"uncle\\"). Still, the teacher can supply these as necessary. For [the money], you can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"This is an old translation and it shows in its maddening inconsistancies. For example, rather than simply referring to the protagonist as Roland, he is called \\"Rollant,\\" \\"Rollanz\\";Ganelon, the treacherous Frank, is referred to as \\"Guenes\\"; Charlemagne goes by at least three other names (Carlun?). Other archaic spellings dominate too, like \\"Mahumet\\" for Muhammed, and gafaluns for whatever they might be.The syntax and diction are stiff and unnatural and line breaks are not noted. Here's a taste:\\"His arms to bear has shewn great lustihead; In vassalage he is well famoused; Christian were he, he'd shown good barronhead.\\"So, it is a great story, but the best thing about this version is its price."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"The translation is very good, but there are some formatting errors that I found irritating.

It appears not to be a literal translation that sometimes falls flat. The richness of this little French epic is wonderful.The Song of Roland is a great introduction to the great epics of the world because of its shortness and richness. It follows all the epic rules with the exception of lenght. There are a host of characters outside the main cast. Each one is given a few lines of description to cover the basics: where, who, and what they are doing. Sometimes the how and why come in as well, but not always.As most epics go this one is really a great story of valiance and deception. It was meant to be spoken. This can be seen even in the english translation. The cadence is excellent most of the time being easy to read. It tends to be a bit repeditive, but that is a partial flaw of being an epic. The characters being so many tend to be described in the same way such as the Knights being describe as the best vassal as ever was or he mounted on his destrier a swifter one there was not. Phrases such as these tend to repeat, but this is just the story being told aloud for a few centuries before being committed to paper. Some phrases just come up more than once. I know it has happened in both the Odyssey and the Illiad, so if it was okay for Homer, well, its okay here too.I tend to take my time when reading books of this sort, but it could be read in a weekend if one was so inclined.

The narrators are an ensemble cast with different voices for each major character. This includes some sound effects such as sounds of battle, horns blowing, and some music.Overall, I enjoyed this recording. The audio quality was marginal, which detracted from a good performance. Having different voices helped differentiate who was speaking and the sound effects also were useful and did not distract from the story. I did not give this audio book 5 stars mainly because of the audio quality.I found the translation to be easy to understand, though I have never read another translation with which to compare it.The book itself was a very interesting look into the medieval mind. The violence was graphic; the Christians were all good and the Muslims were all bad. The title character was an amazing fighter, who passionately loved his king and his friends. There was treachery and many other elements of a good story.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this time frame. Obviously, it does not fit in with our current political correctness, but it is a fascinating glimpse into our history and what western culture was like 1000 years ago."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"The Song of Roland anonThis historical battle occurred on August 15, 778. Nobody knows who wrote this poem. Charlemagne attacked Spain. Upon his return, the rearguard was attacked and killed to the last man. Saracen Spain was a constant threat to Christian France. So too the separatist Christian Dukes of France. This poem must have been written before the 12th century. Some say the episodes in this poem were copied from real events in the First Crusade and other literary works. Carolingian society was based on a primitive form of feudalism. The Oxford University version of the \\"Song of Roland\\" is the oldest known version, 3998 lines of verse divided into 291 paragraphs. It is written in Anglo-Norman French of the early twelfth century. There are other versions of the poem. [Interest in Roland seems to have waned in modern times.]King Charles of France had conquered most of Spain except for the mountain city of Saragossa where King Marsilla ruled. Marsilla's advisor Blancandrin suggested giving wealth to Charles so he would leave Spain. It is better to lose hostages than a kingdom. Count Roland says Marsilla can't be trusted and Charles should continue the war, but the others disagreed. Charles wants to send an envoy to Marsilla. Roland suggests his stepsire Ganelon. Ganelon is angered by this perilous task. Ganelon and Blancandrin speak together. Ganelon tells Marsilla of Charles' wishes, the latter is angered. But Blancandrin tells Marsilla what Ganelon told him. Ganelon says the conflict would cease after Roland died. Ganelon advises paying tribute so Charles will return to France. Then Marsilla can attack Roland in the outnumbered rear guard.The treaty will mean peace in their time. Charlemagne accepts the tribute and Marsilla's promise, then leaves for France. Roland will command the rear guard in the narrow pass with just the soldiers given to him. The Saracens plan a great victory to discourage Charlemagne. Olivier sees the mighty army of the enemy and asks Roland to sound his horn so Charles will return with his army. Roland refuses to call for help. There are individual attacks at first, the Franks win. Then the enemy forces close in for sword fights. At this time there is a raging storm in France, a sign of turmoil. Now the Saracens win, continuous battle whittles down the French forces. Did Roland make a mistake in not calling for help earlier? King Charles orders his army to return. Olivier is wounded unto death yet fights on. Soon only Roland is left, but he is also wounded, and dies. When King Charles arrives in Roncesvals he finds the ground covered with the dead. The Saracens retreat to Spain, then with reinforcements, they attack Charlemagne's army. But Charles kills their leader and the Saracens flee. The French attack and conquer Saragossa. After this victory Ganelon is tried for treason. He says his quarrel with Roland was personal, based on a grudge. Trial by combat settles the question. Ganelon is a traitor and is torn apart by four horses. Next Charles has to invade a new country. He is growing weary of his life."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"although the song of Roland is a very poetic, i just could not follow the story, this rating is my own opinion, i know many historians that believe this is one of the most beautiful stories ever written."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"Yes it is true Frenchmen appreciate Bravery too. A little missed fact by many people calling them sissies due to politics and sheer American pride, is that they conquered many empires at one time.And the fighting was more brutal than any American combat(except possibly Vietnam) This political talk should be irrelevant except while I was reading this book, as a proud american, I came to the realization that French people dont totally suck. Amateur(and very amateurish) political thought aside, the book Songs of Roland is masterfully written. It is fast paced, and an enjoyable( as opposed to SOME classics, not going to name anything mr German Ne..) If you have ANY interest in medeival literature, then you should own this book. Its only 7 bux."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"There's no denying this long epic poem was written at a certain place and time, and many of the lines reflect that. Unlike some other epics of this nature, there doesn't seem to be a lot of equanimity; the French Christians are depicted as the good guys, epitomes of courage and bravery (apart from a few instances of pride, vanity, and hubris, but those are individual characteristics and not attributed to their race or religion), while the Arab Muslims are demonised and made out to be horrible \\"heathens\\" and \\"pagans\\" who deserve to be murdered in really graphic ways, routinely depicted as worshipping Mohammad (which is completely untrue), Apollo, and Tergament, and having their souls carried away by Satan. Obviously most people in Europe at this time weren't very enlightened about other religions and cultures, and while I agree it's ridiculous to want people of another era and culture to think and behave exactly like people of the 21st century, it is still pretty hard to read a lot of these passages with slander against Islam and the Moors in Spain. I was actually rooting for them and not the French, and wished it could have given a more balanced view, showing the faults and virtues of both sides, or letting the reader make up his or her own mind about which side is the righteous side, or if neither side is any better or worse than the other. Particularly chilling is the passage towards the end, after the battle is over, when Charlemagne and his remaining army go through the city destroying all of the mosques and synagogues and force-converting the remaining civilian population. Still, as uncomfortable as such things are to the average modern reader, it's still a quite good story, with a lot of good descriptions and poetry, and as one-sided as it may be, as well as having some probable exaggerations or falsifications in order to make the French and Charlemagne seem even more victorious and virtuous, it also does a good job of depicting politics and warfare in the later part of the early Middle Ages. Most of the classic works of Medieval literature most people are most familiar with hail from after the year 1000, but this takes place in the 700s."},{"Title":"Song of Roland, The","review":"well worth the time.

His book combines religious, family, and social experiences. The book reveals that man can revive himself only with a relaxed (free) mind. Maeba is full of hope for man if certain 'boundaries' are kept.

We loved the illustrations so much, that we wrote to Ms. Isadora and asked if she would sell us a piece of art from the book! The book simply but thoroughly explains ballet to a young child but to a novice as well. I am just thrilled that such a book is available!"},{"Title":"Lili at Ballet (Paperstar Book)","review":"The illustrations are gorgeous!Unfortunately, in picture after picture (not ALL, but way too many) the arms are in the wrong position in relation to the legs, which is a very unbalanced thing for a young child to try to imitate... and the beautifull illustrations are so engrossing that it's hard to explain to a youngster that the picture is showing either the wrong leg forward or the wrong arm up...The so-called story is lacking any real plot, but then, that isn't why you buy this book anyway. Any young child will really really love the artwork. And unlike many other books on ballet, this one shows children, so little girls relate to it in a more personal way.Buy it for the pictures, but for a how-to of steps and positions, get a different book that is more accurate."},{"Title":"Lili at Ballet (Paperstar Book)","review":"I just loved this book which I shared with my students at my ballet school.

When I am finished with it I will read it to my granddaughter. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Song","review":"This novel is a prime example of how the most specific of stories can have the most universal meaning. Vassanji brings to life a small piece of India -- a shrine to a Sufi mystic -- and the experience of a boy who grows to manhood full of doubts about his father's beliefs and his longing to see the world. What son has not gone through this with his father? The relationship between Karsan and his brother also resonates deeply with men who have younger brothers -- and the tensions that arise when they follow different paths, even as the eternal bonds of brotherhood bring them together.These universal struggles -- father and son, brother and brother -- are set against the fascinating backdrop of Indian nationalism, the deadly Hindu-Moslem conflict and the story of a medieval Sufi mystic whose life and teaching are shrouded in tragedy. All the while, we're aware that the Sufism as practiced by the father -- the Avatar -- sets the family apart, and Karsan feels the apartness no matter where he goes, either to a Christian school in India, to Harvard, to Canada or back to India. Are all these differences really just illusion, and if so, why do people persist in preserving them? Vassanji does a wonderful job of putting the reader inside Karsan's life thanks to effective description, a gripping plot and wonderfully drawn, tragic characters, from Karsan's movie-going mom to the truck driver who opens Karsan's world to the MIT student with whom Karsan falls in love."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Song","review":"Imagine your life being planned for you without considering your feelings. Imagine being denied the opportunity to explore your talents because they conflict with this plan. Unfortunately we all bear this burden at some point in our lives. The extent differs, but the burden is there nonetheless.The Assassin's Song is narrated through Karsan Dargawalla who is heir to the 700-year-old shrine of a 13th century Sufi Nur Fazal. The shrine is in Gujarat, India. It is expected that Karsan, like his father and his ancestors before him, will be keeper of the shrine dispensing blessings and wisdom to all those who visit, regardless of their race, caste or religion. Karsan has an opportunity to move away from the restricted life at the shrine and explores the world outside. Later, he returns to the shrine to become its next Saheb (the role his father played before him, and the role he rebelled against).The book begins with Karsan at the shrine after his parents are dead, the shrine is destroyed, and his brother has become a militant Muslim and is wanted by the authorities for some unknown crime. Karsan says, \\"I, the last lord of the shrine of Pirbaag, must pick up the pieces of my trust and tell its story... .\\" Thus the book begins at the end and through flashbacks it pieces together the life of Karsan Dargawalla as he sees it. Interspersed are chapters that tell the tale of Nur Fazal (also known as the Wonderer). Could it be to show the imperfect symmetry between the lives of Nur Fazal and Karsan?The narrative is not poetic but contains simple truths. Karsan's teleological question is \\"Do we always end up where we belong?\\" As are questions of duty, faith, and self-awareness. It seems that there isn't one resounding truth, but a plethora of small complexities that envelope the characters - with all their contradictions. This book requires patience, empathy, and curiosity. The glossary does not offer a complete list of Indian words used through the text. The story is slow to start, but picks up about halfway through.The book explores the conflict between ancient loyalties and modern desires through Karsan Dargawalla's painful struggle to maintain a fine balance between the earthly and the ethereal.Armchair Interview says: The story is about cultural balance."},{"Title":"The Assassin's Song","review":"In this novel Vassanji attempts to convey an appreciation of the holy man tradition in India, while writing the story of a man who rebels against a life serving this tradition, instead becoming an English professor in Canada. In structure, there are parallels between this novel and Vassanji's \\"The In-Between World of Vikram Lall\\" (which I loved): both consist largely of a character looking back on his life, but, almost as a surprise to the reader, an important part of each character's life occurs after the period of reflection. Historical events play a role in both novels; here it is the ethnic massacres which are also a part of the Indian tradition, euphemistically referred to as riots. Surprisingly to me, some occurred long after Indian independence, without state authorities acting to suppress them.This is a successful, ambitious novel, but not as enthralling as \\"The In-Between World of Vikram Lall\\". Having said this, it is easier to deal with politics than the spiritual, and Vassanji does succeed in making Karsan's final life choice credible. He also makes the breakup of the marriage credible, but I would like to have heard from his wife, as a married woman, more; as a minor criticism, why didn't they double park to get their boy's drug since both were in the car, instead of spending so much time looking for a parking place? Karsan's childhood friends are not developed even as minor characters. Conversely, Karsan's coming of age during his Harvard years is done beautifully and is the best part of this novel."},{"Title":"Heartbreaker","review":"i have read better books! karen Robards is generally consitant in providing one with a good and even great story. however, she missed the mark here. i found the characters shallow and the story predictable. come on karen ... you can do better!"},{"Title":"Heartbreaker","review":"This was such a nice mix of adventure and romance.

She knows dialogue, how to make the story flow and how to create scenes but this book doesn't deserve more than 3 stars because the characters are so unlikable and the plot goes to the ridiculous. Not that the plot COULDN'T happen, I guess, I just think that the way it was tied up so neatly in the end was totally unbelievable. I don't mind delving into fantasy every now and then while reading about the H&H's derring-do to make the book an escape but I DO want my H&H to be likable and the possibility that the plot COULD happen. I didn't get that in this book. I wanted to smack the heroine throughout the entire book. She's so totally self-absorbed that even the love she had for her daughter rang false. As for the romance - well, let's just say that that was unbelievable too. After days of no sleep, no food, no bath, no brushing of the teeth, lying under moss and whatever else is on a forest floor, rolling in a dirty river and let's not forget the bullet wound the hero is sporting, they have mind-blowing, marathon sex in a cold, wet, hard cave while lying on a ledge.

The first half held me in its grasp, making me want to read faster and faster but I could only shake my head once the good guys and bad guys met. From that point, it became unrealistic.

For example, when the good guys were cornered and going to be killed, oops, the rock plateau falls and all but one terrorist is killed and this one happens to think that maybe his associates might have been mistaken in their beliefs.

This book scared me to death, (I have a fear of falling) and the words seemed so real I had to put the book down at one point; take a deep breath, leave it for awhile and then come back to face the suspense. I laughed at the humor of the city bred high achiever trying to fake it in the wilderness and enjoyed the romance between the two main characters. The message I took from the story if there was one - is to not judge a book by its cover and even if we don't always triumph the quest to protect and serve (i.e. the ATF and Waco) is an honorable one."},{"Title":"Heartbreaker","review":"This book is a page turner!

I only read it now because I had just finished a heavy novel &amp; was looking for fluff in contrast. I agree with the other reviews- This book has a decieving title, a ridiculous cover and should certainly not be in the romance section.

I would recommond picking up this book and reading it."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"If you are interested in American pop culture and teenage life in conflict with the suburbs and cities, this is for you. Girl is one of my favorite books. I first read it in 8th grade, when I noticed its hot pink color in the library. I promise you, even if things about the story bug you (it's written the way teens talk, pretty much), you'll still have trouble putting the book down till you've read the whole thing. Blake Nelson, if you're reading this, Puhleeease write a sequel!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I have probably read this book 15 times. Sometimes I remember a specific part and just want to read it, and i have my favorite passages underlined and dogeared. It is just such a coming-of-age story, and i relate to it so eerily, because i am even from portland, oregon, where it is based, that he describes the hangouts i went to! (named differently, of course). so anyways, i totally recommend this book to anybody, but mostly girls."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"It's an honest book, in which everyone can find something from their years at high school. The language is necessarily not a masterpiece in terms of literature but it's REAL, you can feel it, and I highly reccommend it to everyone along with his second novel Exile which I loved even more than this one."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I read Girl only because I was supposed to have coffee with Blake Nelson and I wanted to see if he was a total wack job or not(he's not). I just loved it. I loved Andrea, I loved every thought that passed through her head, I loved every situation she got herself into. I only wish I hadn't read it so fast. I wish Blake would write ten thousand more books in Andrea's voice, I really do, I would read every single one."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"wow, I guess a lot of people knew about this book. I did not. The most a accurate and realistic representaion I can think of not only youth culture, but culture in general. Reminded me a bit of the movie Election, in it's painful reality factor. Maybe not quite A Catcher in the Rye, in terms of literary merit but a very important book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I just read this book for the fifth time and I love it so much. And I am not even a teenager! This book talks about my life and my highschool years the way no book ever has. Every generation has a book like this. This is mine."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I think girl was the best book I ever read I was totally captivated by it the first time i read it which was when I was only 13 years old I would love to be able to meet Blake Nelson and tell him to his face that I loved this Book"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"The is the most fierce and honest book ever written about what it is like to be a teenage girl. The sucky part is it took a man to write it. I've never read anything so lyric, real and touching. I could be Andrea. I felt, thought and behaved the way she did. I loved how sensitive Nelson was in treating the whole nature of being a sixteen year old girl. I loved how she behaved like someone you might actually meet on the streets. It's probably the first piece of realistic young adult fiction I've ever read. I far cry from the so-called realistic fiction of Norma Klein and M.E. Kerr. If you only read one book, it should be &quot;Girl&quot;. It made me laugh, cry, hurt and yearn to be back in high school knowing what I know now: high school isn't the prequel to real life."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I was at the bookstore and saw it way up on the shelf. I read the summary and it actually seemed like a good storyline: a teenage girl who has to choose between conformity and rebellion. But then I bought it and started reading it. The writing style was horrible. The author claims that it was not meant to be a diary, yet it reads just like one! And believe it or not, most teen girls do not use the word 'like' every five seconds. Andrea turned from respectable to just plain pathetic. It's about as dramatic as a Brittney Spears song and it reads like something in an insipid teen magazine. Absolute trash. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because the storyline seems somewhat intresting, but even that plot has been mercilessly recycled. I can't believe anyone actually thinks that all teen girls are airheads who are eager for sex with anyone. Shame on Wally Lamb for saying that &quot;Girl takes us to the front lines of modern youth!&quot; &quot;Girl&quot; was certainly no &quot;She's Come Undone.&quot; The only front line that you are taken to in this novel is the front line of stupidity!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I understand why people wouldn't like this book because it's not that greatest portrayal of teenagers today or whatever but it was addictive to me and when wondering if you should buy or read this book, read the little intro and if you want to know more/read on or can relate and think you'll like it I say go for it but be prepared to deal with one of those girls who doesn't fit in a high school clique and was probably a groupie in a past life."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I first happened upon this work in the now-defunct &quot;Sassy&quot; magazine, where it appeared in a series of three or four excerpts, highlighting what eventually turned out to be the most telling portions of this book. However, I later found the book at a bookstore, and eagerly purchased it, hoping that the novel would be as warm, engaging, and true-to-life as the excerpts had been. I was somewhat disappointed. The novel's voice does resemble that of a teenaged girl, except that the novel's heroine is slightly more shallow than I remember being at 16, 17, and 18 years old. Also, there were simply parts of the novel that seemed to drag on (ie- the constant descriptions of grunge rock shows, various articles of clothing, and the seeming ambivalence that Andrea demonstrates when dealing with sex). At any rate, I would recommend this book to teens who are looking for a quick, sometimes-entertaining read. For more depth and realism, I would try the new classics, &quot;Catcher In The Rye,&quot; or &quot;A Girl's Guide To Hunting and Fishing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Why can't I ever find a book that speaks directly to me as a teenage girl? Either it's me, or it's these authors who get these sterotypes of teenage girls in their heads and then blow it out of proportion. That's what happened to this book. Hey, it had the potentional to be good. It took place in the Pacific Northwest during the early '90s, and revolves around the underground grunge scene. That interested me, since a lot of my favorite bands came from that era. I thought maybe Andrea would join a band, but she just remained an unoffical groupie throughout the entire novel. I found it rather unrealistic that her parents did not know anything of her wild social life. Even more unrealistic was how she was so involved in being a groupie, yet she managed to score high on her SATs and got into a good college. Yeah right! Like that would happen. And whats with all these books about teenagers having sex 24/7? Maybe for some people, but in reality that's more of a sterotype. Two stars for the potential it had and for the setting (which was more interesting than other teenage books I've read), but for the most part I couldn't relate to this book at all."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I first heard of the novel Girl through a magazine review. It called it, \\"out of this world.\\" And so it is. Out of my world anyway. I found the carachters to be brazen and un-caring, with a holier that thou attitude. The characters (signaling Andrea and Matthew) participate in sex with just about anyone. The part that really made me mad was when a card of some sort was passed around the class room, for and sick student, and classmates blantly refused to sign it. I found that the characters moved through people to stay ahead of the game and only thought of themselves. Is this teenage life? For some, yes. For me? No, it never was and never will be."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I was, and I absolutely hated &quot;Girl.&quot; I am a teenage girl and I consider myself fairly intelligent. When I saw the Amazon reviews and the description of &quot;Girl&quot; by Blake Nelson I was stoked to read the &quot;Catcher in the Rye for the 'Grunge' generation.&quot; But it only disappointed me. I thought the writing style was amazingly simple (how did Nelson get it published?), and the main character not a realistic teenage girl, more what a teenage boy would HOPE a teenage girl would be like. Anyone could know from listening to &quot;Loveline&quot; for an evening that for women (unlike for men), sex is more than merely physical...an emotional connection has to be there for a sexual experience to be enjoyable. Andrea Marr's reaction to sex is really a male's opinion (hope?) that women yearn for sex like men do, which I haven't found true. I find it disgusting that people actually think teenage girls are this shallow and this unintelligent, and I just want to let you know that we aren't."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"If i had read this book at 14 and had not yet seen the movie i would have loved it. however the movie is my all time favorite and the book does not live up. I feel like he tried to hard to sound like a teenage girl. And Andrea come off as sounding stupid at first. I really had a hard time with a male author trying to write like a teenage girl. Some times he pulled it off, sometimes not so much. Bottom line if you saw the movie chances are you wouldn't appreciate this book as much as if you could have. However most people will fall somewhat in love with the story and really root for Andrea. Even if you get annoyed with the book along the way."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Girl follows the downtown, whirlwind life of Andrea Marr of Portland, Oregon. The book starts with 15-year-old Andrea beginning to explore the world of boys and guitars and ends a few years later with her getting ready to go to college. Andrea's breathless narration is kinda reminscient of Holden Caulfield but her half cynical/half giddy with wonder tone is completely fresh. As Andrea does all those things that slightly outsiderish teenage girls do like finding the right shops to buy vintage dresses, becoming obsessed and involved with Todd Sparrow (the charismatic yet toxic singer in a grunge band) and having friends who always seem cooler than you, it's almost like the reader has got a hotline to Andrea's soul. So the fact that Girl is written by a man makes it all the more staggering. I discovered this book on a holiday to NY and have read it countless times, bought copies for all my friends and beg you not to be put off by the decidedly icky cover. Girl is one of those obscure little books that will end up changing your life."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I was psyched about ordering this book when I saw that amazon compares it to The Perks of Being A Wallflower. I am horribly disappointed. This book is completely inaccurate. I don't know why people keep saying it is a &quot;very realistic point of view&quot; etc. etc. If anyone accepts that teenage girls are this shallow, trite, and just plain asinine they are sadly mistaken. Not to mention that is this book is horribly written. It's one long, boring, pointless run-on sentence. I hate this book. I recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower of this novel any day."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read. When I was through with it I passed it around to all of my friends and they agreed. I don't see how anyone could have not liked it."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I discovered this book when it first came out and have read it over and over again.Each time i read it , it gives me the same wonderful feeling as it did the first time. I have shared this book with all of my friends which have felt the same way about it and have also read all the other blake nelson novels which have been splendid reads also. I just can't seem to put GIRL down."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"It's refreshing to find 'teenage fiction' which spotlights an alternative to the glossy 'he-let-me-hold-his-football-and-I-almost-died' novel. If those fluffy romances are cherry-ade, then 'Girl' is Budweiser. It's not perfect - occasionally the references and ideas are embarrassingly misguided and self-aware, but it's so easy to read, and such a welcome break from the norm that I recommend it totally."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"A tale that all of us can relate to growing up. Torn between becoming her own independent person or just fitting &quot;in&quot;, Andrea struggles in the grunge era of Portland. Fully captivating and heartfelt, you cheer her on as she takes courageous steps on her way to becoming an adult."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"but I haven't read it yet. After reading all the comments so far it sounds like a great book. How did I happen to find out about it? Jonathan Kahn directed a movie based on this book. It stars Dominique Swain (Lolita), Sean Patrick Flanery (young Indiana Jones), Tara Reid (American Pie), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Portia DeRossi (Ally McBeal), and Christopher Masterson (for those of you already hooked to Malcolm in the Middle). From what I can tell after reading the reviews, the characters have been changed a bit but the basic message is there. I think those of you who have read the book first will be the lucky ones because of the nature of...oh blah. What this boils down to is I recommend the movie and I thank all the reviewers of the book for enticing me to read it."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the film 'Girl' based on the book by Blake Nelson. It was cute, funny, and had a nice sense of female independance and self discovery. I was disapointed when I bought the book afterward. I found the narrative style very offputting and I was not able to identify with or care about Andrea. What girl speaks like that? The constant repetition of &quot;and then,&quot; and the lack of emotional depth made me finally put it down without finishing it. Usually after seeing a film i.e. The Virgin Suicides or The Ice Storm I am so eager to read the book and find out how much richer and complex the written word is. 'Girl' isn't all bad but there are much better books of its genre out there, and as an avid reader of women's fiction I feel like 'Girl' has missed it when it comes to describing what it is to grow up middle class and female in America."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"according to the back of the book's jacket blake nelson used to be a writer for sassy. this is exactly how the book reads: like a contrived and unoriginal article for a young girls magazine. andrea's exploits are that of your average adolescent girl with no fresh angle or any sort of keen insight into life. if i wanted to experience that, i'd go to the local trendy coffeeshop."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Did you ever look around you in high school, and feel completely displaced? Are you out of high school, but still catch yourself watching &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; once in a while? Then this book is for you. I'm 19, and first read it when I was 15. Every teenage girl out there will, at some level, identify with Andrea Marr, the protagonist. The awkward moments, the realization of what boys will do to have sex, the search for who you are and what you believe. Older girls, who've maybe been out in the big world for a while, can remember the innocence when you first take the plunge into the big world, how everything is either SO COOL or so lame. 'Girl' is about learning to live your life not in black in white, but in color, or at least seeing the many shades of gray. This book, 'Wetzie Bat', 'Go Ask Alice', and 'Girl, Interrupted' made up my reading material in high school. At one point I went through my copy and highlighted every sentence or paragraph I felt was written specifically for ME and my life. However, once you're past 30, I'm guessing the naivete and breathlessness of Andrea's life might get tiresome or just plain annoying. Read it now, while you're still young. You can look back at it later, first with fond memories, then with nervous laughs."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Blake Nelson is my God. I picked this book up by chance about three years ago, and I haven't been able to put it down since. I lost count on how many times I've read on number seven. This book speaks words to me that I never knew existed. Even though Andrea's character can be seen as foolish, experimental, or just uncaring, she still feels like the sister I never had. I have yet to read Nelsons' second book, though I am curious to see if it captures real life feelings and experience much like Girl did. I feel like I'd be betraying Andrea, though, if I read it before a sequal to Girl comes out. (hint, hint)"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I picked this book up in the store because I was attracted to its cover -- 45 minutes later, when I realized I'd been standing there reading non-stop I knew I had to buy it. There's little I can add to the copious praise other reviewers have heaped on this book, but let me say that this man is a very talented writer and we should all support him by buying this book."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Allthough the writing in novel left a lot to be desired, it really did transport me back to the early 90's. I started out with a more straight crowd as a freshman but then I discovered alternative music and thrift store shopping. This led to punk rock and a totally different crowd. By the end of high school I was this scenester chick that wrote a zine and probably would have never hung out with the nerdy freshman I used to be. The book really does show how that time was. There's a line when Andrea is telling someone that they were going to a \\"show\\" not a \\"concert\\". I remember those conversations and trying to explain that to people. Andrea reminded me of myself (I was in the school paper and did a column about fashion, fell for the wrong guy in a band, etc.) I am surprised I never found this book when I was a teenager. Fans of MSCL will dig it or anyone that was different in high school will relate."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This book is so good. I hadn't read it in a two years and I just read it again and everytime I read it again I see new things and little parts that seem so right on. The weird thing: I love all the characters, even evil Bobby Wingate and the ultra-evil SCOTT--Girls, attention, there are SCOTT's beyond highschool, lots of them. In fact all the people in this book are found in the so called real world which is one of the things I really love most about it. it is the whole universe in one public highschool. I would give this book ten stars if I could. Bravo Blake Nelson whoever you are."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I guess I expected more from this novel since its narrator is touted as &quot;a Holden Caulfield for the grunge generation.&quot; Not even close. Yes, she did speak candidly about phoniness and sex and her self-proclaimed lack of coolness. She was frank and honest and I admire that Blake Nelson could somewhat get into the head of an adolescent female. However, I was disappointed with the voice Blake Nelson gave Andrea Marr. He seemed to give her a general lack of intelligence, yet apparently she was smart enough to get into Wellinton. Believe me when I say that I'm no prude, but I thought B. Nelson portrayed Andrea Marr as a little TOO laissez-faire about sex. You'd figure an adolescent girl would have a few more issues to grapple with other than &quot;Yeah, and then we did it.&quot; One of the realizations Andrea Marr expressed that I thought was right on was when she talked about how no matter how much you hated the &quot;popular&quot; kids, the minute they liked you, you liked them back. All in all a good effort, but I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I have read this book no less than 10 times. There is not one instance where Blake Nelson is not dead-on. Absolutely everything about Andrea Marr is correct. How did he do this? How does he know those exact teenage girl feelings? How does he KNOW almost the EXACT story of my life (local rock star and all!)? Andrea reacts the same way I would have, does the same things I did, the similarities are uncanny, so of course this is my favorite novel of all time. And yes, I am a college graduate with a degree in Metaphysics.The ending, when Andrea goes away to college and says, &quot;..But that's not what happened...Not even close&quot;, has me hoping and praying that there is a sequel in the works. &quot;Exile&quot; was good, but good at best. &quot;Girl&quot; is my bible."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"All though this book consists of a girl's completely typical high school experience, there's something extremely captivating about this book. It somehow manages to encompass all the things we think/thought in high school without sounding ridiculous. Like how it seems so important to make your mark and stick out in school and be unlike everybody else but in deity every person should really just be who they want to without fear of retribution. And j think that'swhat Andrea did, or at least tried to do, which was very admirable of her. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the writing style. The way Nelson narrated it made it seem like he was really just putting a teenage girls thoughts down on paper, with run on sentences and incorrect grammar and all the right mannerisms. I seriously respect him for that because often times when a person is writing they go out of their way to make everything overstated and obvious. I seriously enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling to find themselves or simply wants and interesting, unadulterated perspective on life."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I'm in my 30's but I could so relate to this book from being in my final years at school and trying to fit in!!! Great book and really tells the tale of how life moves on and so do you, growing up and evolving!!! Really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I found this book in high school and could completely relate to it in EVERY way. I am ordering again because I can't find my original copy that had a better cover, anyway. Can't wait to read it again, 15 years later. This will be my third time. I think every teen girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I seriously could not put this down, and there were several moments in the book where I excitedly exclaimed things like, \\"Wow, that Blake Nelson can really write!\\" and \\"Holy crap, Blake Nelson is a genius!\\" I may not be a young adult (in fact, I'm far from it), but you don't have to be YA to appreciate what this book has to offer."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I've read this book OVER and OVER again. I love it and I would really recommend it. The book really captures the feelings of girls and it was realistic. The only problem was the style of writing which, at times, got annoying. Other than that, I absolutely loved it."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"ILOVED this book so much. I have read it numerous times and each time I get something new and different out of it. Andrea is &quot;cool&quot; her adventures and experiances are so right on that you find yourself cheering her on. Todd Sparrow is a jerk though to be so casual with her about everything!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"As a 21 year old girl who has felt like a groupie more than once i totally identified with this book. Nelson somehow captured the confusion and disallusionment of being a 16,17 and 18 year old girl in todays society."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"i loved this book so much that i read it in 2 days! i couldn't put it down! i recomend this book for everyone!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I had a lot of trouble getting into the book at first because the writing is very i-read-seventeen-magazine-as-a-hobby, and the narrator, Andrea, is perhaps one of the most appearance-oriented, obnoxious high school &quot;rebel&quot; ever printed. The character of Cybil, however, who enters the story directly after having shaved her head in a moment of indecision and the overwhelming influence of an older, intriguing rock star, made me cry at so many random places. Little things about her really touched me, the way that Andrea describes her picking grass out of her socks... Andrea's character has no bulk, no substance, but Cybil transforms from a semi-popular jock to a completely independent,lost teenager... SHE is who i identified with. I would be in love if she were a real person."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"When I read this book, I couldn't believe that the author was a man! Andrea's thoughts were so like the thoughts I've had, it was extremely believable. In both books I've read by Blake Nelson, I can honestly say he is a laudable author. I hope to see more books by him on sale very soon."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Girl is a 15 year old who is bored with her monotonous day to day schedule. Girl and her friends experience exciting adventures that will blow your mind. One of Girls wild adventures was with a good friend Cybil. Cybil called Girl hysterically crying because she had just butchered all her hair off. The book is filled with quite a few dramas to keep you glued to your seat. All you teenagers here's a book you can easily relate to."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Andrea Marr and I are the same person! It's nice to read a book that can put your life into perspective. I loved every page. It was fast reading and a really good story for adolecent girls like myself. Isn't Andrea in college now? When's that book coming out??!!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"My own girlhood was little more than a blur until I read &quot;Girl,&quot; which brought it all back to me. I hate to admit this, but I, too, marvelled that a man could imbue a character with such an identifiably feminine, teen-aged voice.Also, &quot;Girl&quot; has the one thing missing from so much fiction these days -- humor! A definite must-read."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I read this when it first came out and really liked it though I read it really quickly. I just picked up a friends copy and also read it very quickly but liked it even more. I forgot how real Andrea Marr is and how totally you root for her even though does all sorts of stupid but understandable things. Also liked the grunge rock stuff. Already dated but doesn't matter. it's almost fun looking back. Remember nirvana?"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Early into my teenage years, I grew disenchanted with the &quot;young adult&quot; fiction that was on the market. I just could not relate to those twins of Sweet Valley, nor to their counterparts in other teen novels. NO ONE lives their lives the way those characters did! I enjoyed reading, and it was a big disappointment not to be able to identify with any fictional characters of my age group. (I often wonder if this is why so few teens like to read). Two years ago, long after I moved into my 20s, I found &quot;Girl&quot;, and was completely blown away. I didn't think it was possible that Andrea could be purely the creation of Blake Nelson's mind. She speaks like a real 16 year old, experiences things that happen to real 16 year olds, and has friends who are like the ones real 16 year olds have (I want to meet Cybil! I wish I had known her when I was in high school). I'm sure that many parents and teachers would like to believe that their little ones do not say or do the things that Andrea does in &quot;Girl&quot; (what first sparked my curiosity about this book was reading a review in a magazine in which the critic said this would be a good young adult novel if not for the graphic language), but you need only spend half an hour in a high school cafeteria to understand that there is nothing in this novel that any teenager is not already aware of. Many readers have expressed amazement that Blake Nelson, a man, could capture so perfectly the essence of a young woman. I admire him for this too, but am even more impressed to find an adult writer who still remembers what it's like to be a teenager, and can make others remember as well."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I first read this book 10 years ago, when I was 15 years old. I just finished it again for the 21st time. Yes that is right, I have read Girl, by Blake Nelson 2 times a year for 10 years.When I started reading this book I instantly felt like someone finally understood me. I was young, dating an older musician and going to night clubs instead of school dances. Yet at the same time there was a part of me that wanted to be like everyone else, studying, joining school clubs, getting ready for college.Andrea Marr completely encapsulates the most common teenage fears and desires. The desire to find love, to be different yet accepted. To find freedom from both your parents and school. The desire to figure out WHO you are, by constantly changing.When you read Girl you will find that it is not like reading a book, it is like you are reading 3 years worth of a teenagers diary. Boyfriends, break ups, friendships fading and changing. Surprizingly honest and heartfelt. By the end you will feel like Andrea Marr is your best friend. I am amazed at how well Blake Nelson takes on the voice of a 16 year old teenage girl. I only wish he had written a sequel, because I would love to know what Andrea is up to now."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This book automatically gets five stars just because it was written so well in the voice of a teenage girl by a grown man. Not a moment rings false as you delve into the life of Andrea Marr, a high school girl coming of age in the early nineties &quot;grunge&quot; of Portland. She faces the familiar pratfalls of life, including all that is important to a teenager...boys, friends, school, clothes, music and sex. Everything is fresh and real; just reading it can take you back to the day when you yourself were sixteen and every single moment contained so much importance and angst.Blake Nelson nails his portrayal of a teenage girl dead on. I still find it hard to believe, like other reviewers here, that this story was written by a man. 'Girl' reads like a few years of a personal diary, one that the author of such diary never really meant for anyone but herself to see. Andrea grows realistically, not from a good girl gone bad overnight, but as a true person finding herself and her identity. If this means making new friends who shave their heads, shop at thrift stores and start their own bands, then so be it. As the books states, it's only a brief glimpse into her life. Who knows what happened after high school?I was lucky enough to actually get to read this while I was still in high school myself. While it is not difficult to get into or terribly deep, it rings so true to real life that it is impossible to put down. Just reading it again can transport you back to your youth. A highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I happened upon GIRL about four or five years ago (at a buck a book, no less) and have reread it (or just parts of it) about a thousand times. This book reads like I (used to; hey, I'm not 16 anymore...)talk; run-on sentences replace unending spoken lamen- tations on guys, sex, shopping, guys, sex....you get the point. GIRL was a fabulous, if quick, read. How a man wrote this, I will never understand! The author paints a vivid truth not to the typical &quot;teen-angst,&quot; but to how a teenage girl speaks, acts, and thinks (which is where the &quot;typical teen-angst&quot; usually developes, although most authors fail to realize that it is actually a response to emotional overhaul, not a common act of shallow rebellion, as it is often portrayed), which, especially from a guy, is pretty rare. Everything about the book I could relate to, mostly because I had done it or had known someone who had; even Andrea's revelations about the blatant differences about making love and being (because you're a woman) &quot;f---ed&quot; (which apparently made other readers realize that a MAN wrote the book)were right on. She's female and she realizes that, at some times, it can be a little disheartening in this modern-day, feminist era. Because she had these revelations does not make her weak, it was just something she REALIZED, as every woman on the planet might, and the fact that the author could portray this honestly helped make the character, and, ultimately, the book, that much more believable. Fun Fact: My friend who never &quot;read for fun,&quot; picked up the book one night and could not put it down! She read about 50 pages right there in my room, before she went home and spent the rest of the night reading it! She could not believe how great the book was (and she really couldn't believe that a man had wrote it!)!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This is a good book that tells the truth about high school and teenage life. It doesn't sugarcoat things like drugs and sex. The only thing that I didn't like was the way it is written, in rambling paragraphs with little dialogue. It reads like a teenage girl's diary, which is I suppose what the author was going for.I think this is a good book for older teenage girls."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I read Girl, by Blake Nelson, over a month ago and I find its scenes still playing in my head. I hate reviews that give away important plot points, so I won't get specific. I grew up in Cleveland, where the club scene isn't as great, so I'm a little jealous of Andrea. But I can see it, I've known people like her. Her actions, her thoughts really ring true. Trying to grow up and keep up with what's cool, and doubting success. All the intrique of that age.I read this book in one sitting: it's one of those books, \\"I'll just read a couple more pages, and then put it down\\" that never gets put down. There was always a reason to keep reading just a little bit longer. I'm not a girl and almost not a teenager, but this just seemed so real, so like the life my friends and I wanted to lead in high school (Shallow? Who cares?). It's on that short list of books I intend to reread, probably more than once."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I'm so amazed that a grown man can capture a teenage girl's thoughts so perfectly. Andrea Marr's high school experience is so familiar to my own I feel like I've lived this book. Blake Nelson portrays Andrea as any teenage girl, confused and unsure about where she is going. A friendly word of warning: the movie (starring domonique swain) does a horrible job of capturing the true message of the book and turns the confused heroine into an annoyingly whiney little girl. I hope he writes a sequel so we can all know about Andrea's adventures in college and beyond."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"When I first read the short story versions of this book in Sassy magazine, I couldn't wait until the whole book came out. When it finally did I was happy to see it lived up to my expectations. Andrea Marr is the typical teen sick of living under suburban law and trying to find out who she is amidst the normal chaos of high school life. The words she uses, while maybe not perfect grammatically, are perfect realistically. I lived this book when I was in high school, and all my friends lived some version of it. Girl might not be for everyone, after all, it is a statement of sorts against suburbia and all things &quot;normal,&quot; but for anyone who felt like they were the only one completely misunderstood in high school, this book will make you laugh recognizing the stupid things you did when you were 16, and definitely cause you to take a trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"... WARNING: causes self-retrospection; nostaglia; and &quot;he is talking about ME&quot; thoughts. If you like a good read, one that causes you to look back at your own life and relate to the character (were you a teenager of the nineties?), you cannot go wrong here... Blake Nelson writes the teenage girl perspective accurately and sincerely, with honesty and integrity... presenting the often less than pretty and true to form comings and goings of any teenage girl... no &quot;sweet sixteen&quot; here!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"GIRL is a powerful, unapologetic account of a semi-rebellious teen that lures you right into the world of high school angst/indecision &amp; keeps you there. I was prepared to dislike Andrea Marr at first, with her typical teenage jargon, her obsession with coolness, her unsure take on her own taste in music/friends/clothes, but I related to her to a degree that almost made me cringe. Despite the generation/geography gap (I'm about 20 years older &amp; a lifelong New Yorker),I felt her unsureness, her willingness to explore her dark side without totally abandoning herself to it. It was interesting to get immersed in the alternate-rock scene of the mid-90s Pacific Northwest, something unknown to me prior to this, but her situation is universal...a fairly standard teen discovering her loyalties/sexuality/&quot;image&quot; and finding her place in the world.For all her self-absorption &amp; obsession with crowd-pleasing she's basically good-hearted, apparently book smart, and comes from a solid-sounding family (they're there, on the fringes of her story but typically take a VERY back seat). She also has the sense to be drawn to some colorful, compelling friends; I'd like to get the real story on all of them, particularly the mysterious and wounded Cybil.All in all, a realistic, involving take on a flawed, evolving but hopeful EveryGirl. Lots of great bleak sex throughout, vividly capturing the confusion of early obligatory teen experimentation mixed with real desire. Hope it gets better for Andrea. Blake Nelson, a guy in his thirties, really nails the inner voice of a teenage girl...wonder how he did that?? It was a pleasure to crawl inside her brain."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"i thought i was the only person who read this book. i read it when i was 15 or something, and i have re-read it about 10 times since then..."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I loved this book so much. I just read the Catcher in the Rye and I know every book is supposedly the Catcher in the Rye of something . . . . but this book really was! A great story and the voice of Andrea, telling you about her life in the most natural and easy way. And the way at the end you cry even though nothing particularly sad happens. You cry becuase you love Andrea and you love her friends and you know that you are only this young once, you only get to see things for the first time once. One of the five best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"i first read Girl 9 months ago and since then i've read it probably more than 10 times. this is the first book that i can honestly say i didn't sleep until i finished it. although it may be an easy read and may seem shallow to some, those who are\\\\were\\\\or knew somebody in the underground music scene will realize that Blake Nelson has brilliantly captured a piece of it.it is as if he is still a teen. my friend suggested i read it and although i was reluctant because of the title, i found it to be my favorite book of all time and would suggest it to anyone of any age, male or female."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I bought it 3 years ago and I've read it over 20 times. I've been looking for the book since I read a part of it in Sassy a long long time ago. I recently bought the movie, which was good but they totally destroyed the book. I wish Blake would write some more about Andrea in College."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Blake Nelson may have sneaked a peak at my diary before he wrote Girl. Andrea's experiences are my own. Her thoughts are mine. Her words are mine. Any man who can get inside the mind of a teenage girl and so accurately portray that experience has this girl wrapped around his little finger."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"When I first even heard about this book, it was when the movie came out, and I actually saw the movie first. That in it's self just blow me away. The I found out about the book, and ran all over the place to find the thing, and I did not regret it. I felt as if I was reading my own diary with a different take on it. I too was in the club grunge/punk clique, and while i did not chase after a band member, I did have my little punk band, all the same. Anyway, getting off track here, if you are a teen that is lost, or just needs that little boost up to really find yourself, then this book is for you. Also recommended: The Perks of Being a Wallflower, published by MTV books"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! For those of you who may think it's just for teenagers, this book can definately be enjoyed by anyone in their teens, twenties, OR people just young at heart. Blake Nelson accurately tells the story of what it's like to be a young, impressionable girl desperately searching for a place to fit in. Andrea's versatile personality gets her into many interesting situations. Each chapter holds some new revelation or adventure. If you were a fan of the television show &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, you MUST read this book. Perhaps Angela Chase and Jordan Catalano are based upon Andrea Marr and Todd Sparrow of &quot;Girl&quot;...the parallels are striking! Read for yourself! You'll want to go back to high school once you read this...you'll wish you were sitting in the cafeteria, slammin'in the mosh pit, or hanging out at the mall with Andrea and her friends!!!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Though it is easy to say that this book is just for teenages or parent's would be &quot;shocked&quot; to see what was in this book.....that is the exact attitude that is being portrayed by Andrea Marr....I have read this book countless numbers of times and each time I find a new piece to it. Look beyond the words....think about what is really going on....to say that this book is about...(insert your own description) is exactly what Blake Nelson wanted you to do....compare yourself to Andrea....think about what is really going on in this book....may just change the way you think......."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Although,some of the things that Andrea experiences make you want to grit your teeth, it's honest and that's simply the best way to put it. Relationships are forged and forgotten and that's the most painful part of high school. The double-life of an average teenage girl and her friends and lovers are real enough to see as you turn the page, dying to know how it's all going to end. You experience what Andrea experiences in the most real way. You see the things she sees and at times you want to be Andrea and other times, you can't believe who she thinks she is, but you stay and read, because she is real enough to believe."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. My sister gave it to me to read because I wanted an interesting book to read. I've read it like 5 times. Blake Nelson did a great job capturing Andrea for the girl that she was and relating in one aspect or another to the reader. The other characters Cybil (especially), Mathew, Rebecca...are also likeable and resemble people in our everyday lives. GREAT book. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This was one of the best books that I've read in a long time. I literally could not put it down. I loved Nelson's writing style and look forward to seeing something else from him soon. This book brought back many poignant memories of my own high-school years"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I sped through this book with ease. it's so rare these days to find a great book such as this - the journal-type writing is refreshing only because it isn't a journal and the way Blake Nelson depicts girls is fabulous, because I know what it was like to grow up through those ages that Andrea was in the novel, and even though I am only 18 now, I know I will still love this book when I grow old, because reading this makes me yearn to be that age again.Opium Poppy Fields"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I was quite impressed. I've never been a teenage girl, and I would feel really stupid making a statement on whether it was &quot;realistic&quot; or not. Still, from the point of view of this 27-year-old ex-teenage boy, I'd say Blake Nelson does an impressive job of getting inside the female narrator's head, and her explorations of coming to age in the Portland, Oregon punk/indie scene. Andrea Marr is the bold, sexy, shy, often confused but always resilient heroine of this story. She takes on life with an eagerness that shines past rebellion"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I first read this book when I was 17 and it left a lasting impression on me. Andrea, the main character, is a young independent woman who I never quite got out of my mind. I recently re-read the book and I still think its a wonderful coming of age story and not in a goody two-shoes way. The story tells the struggle of Andrea and she grows up and is torn identifying between the straight crowd and the independent albeit freakier crowd. At the same time, she is trying to make her own mark and find herself. This book falls along the lines of \\"My So-Called Life\\", \\"Sassy\\" Magazine, etc a great read for young adults and not-so-young adults even today."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"this is one of my favorite books of all time. it rocks! recommended for all girls and people who love music."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Andrea Marr is a 16-year-old wanna-be Holden Caulfield. She's your typical teenage girl trapped into the world of grunge and punk bands when her life is changed and she becomes rebellion. Born, suburban and splenderous, Andrea fears away hoping she can still be cool with her new friends. I think this book has a lot of good, very good points yet, Andrea sounds really vapid and does a lot of stupid sexual things like just let guys do it to her. I don't get it. I mean, I'm no girl or anything, like the author, but I still wouldn't make someone who's supposed to be so-called rebellous just a total tease and [easy] for gitty musicians and gullible boys. Not all girls are [easy]. Either way, this book is a good book and deserves a look from it's stupid cover (no offense to company who took the picture)."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"The central premise of \\"Girl\\" is as old as storytelling itself: young person comes of age. That Nelson could have done so much to make it fresh and original is a genuine tribute to his skills as a writer, particularly when one realizes that this is his first book. Our main character and diary-style narrator, Andrea, leads us by the hand through a tangle of botched romances, unrequited love, sexual identity crises, and the Portland, Oregon underground music scene. The narration is in turns hillarious, terrifying, heart-rending, torrid, achingly beautiful, and frantic. By the end, one can't help feel like Andrea's older brother, wanting to put an arm around her and tell her that she's good people with a bright future and a fulfilling social life -- but, by the time we are truly tempted to do it, we also know her well enough to know that she'd step away from our arm and say something gen-X'er like \\"Oh, puh-LEASE,\\" anyway. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I loved Girl, and have reread it a bazillion times-I bought five copies to give to friends for x-mas.

Maybe he'll be back, we need him here. I want a sequal-does anybody know if he's writing one? I'd love to read about Andrea in college, and what happened to her. Please, Mr. Nelson, write more about Andrea,(I wish she was my sister!) and Todd-what happened to Todd? and Cybil? You have no idea how many people want to know about them-all my girlfriends-(and some boys, too)- and I talk about them as if they were real people, as if they were friends of ours, and we've lost touch.

Everything Andrea does/see/feels is EXACTLY what I felt! From finding the perfect vintage dress, trying to smoke and losing her virginity to some boy in the mountains, Ive done it all! Ive made every single one of my friends read Girl from start to finish (some needed bribing) And almost every one either said it applied to them or to me. If Catcher In The Rye can be viewed as a coming-of-age story for a male in the 1940's, then Girl can be seen as a coming-of-age story for a female in the 90's!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Well, my friend shannon tells me to read this book GIRL and I decide to do it cause she gives me the book, and since she lent it I gotta read it. A wierd thing happened, I realy dug it. Know, I am predisposed to liking coming of age stories, but this one really got me. I'm a 21 year old guy but this book did really have meaning for me. It's a bout the struggle of conformity, and whether or not we give in. This battle to be independent may be most famously fought in high school but you find that the war still goes on as you age, the powers that be still want you to conform. So this biik was a good portrait of high school but is also aplicable to the greater battle of trying to stay true to one's self. Never sell out, andrea, keep fighting the powers that be. Remember, We are all prostutes."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This book was true to some girls, but a little on the wired side. Blake Nelson did a nice job, but there was things that not many girls could relate too.

I let my friend read it and she gave it back to me the next day 'cause she thought it was too weird. I alest read the hole thing. Putting aside the differences, it was well writen and cool. If you like the out-of-the-ordinary this is for you."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Even though I am a boy, this book made an incredible impact on me. Andrea goes through an archetypal high school experience that mirrored my own so much that it was scary. My sister, who loves it as much as I do, attested that while Blake Nelson came close to capturing a girl's voice, he didn't totally succeed, but came pretty damn close. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to get a memorable gift....but i wouldn't limit it just to teenagers."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"When I read this book I kept thinking, It is as if Blake Nelson has read my diaries and walked around for a couple of years in my thrift store dresses. I think that Andrea Marr (the narrator) is our Heroine EveryGirl. She's smart,adventurous, thoughtful, and humble; she experiments with cigarettes, weed, sex with jocks, and sex with alterna-boys. My copy of this book is dogeared and battered from reading it so many times and loaning it to people. This book is the most accurate, realistic representation of how it is to be a suburban white girl. The only thing that didn't ring true was how Andrea felt like a slut for wearing eyeshadow."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This book reached out to me and said yes, you can. I worshipped it. The reason I didn't give it a 10 is I think Nelson didn't make it girly enough. Not a word about girl gripes like monthly blood, how you can get bored with too much sex, how you yearn for guys and can't get them. He was writing about a girl who is unusually boyish, who keeps the same clique of friends for all 4 years of high school. Sorry, Blake, that's not the way things work. But still, this should serve as a handbook for getting through adolescence. Rock on"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I gotta secret for you.

Bands make it big, sex, drugs, fights, accidents, death and so much more. All revolving around music."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"After pouring through many of Pete Fromm's works (As Cool as I Am & How This All Started specifically) and now finishing up Blake Nelson's Girl, I am at loss as to how these two men can write so efficiently in the tone of a young female or reflect on the life of one so honestly and realistically.There are so many stereotypes that Blake could have easily fallen victim to, but he keeps his story away from most of them. Being a young female myself (not as young as the heroine of the story, but close enough to that age to have it still fresh in my mind) I was stuck in the book. I was captured and finished it up in a day, reading whenever I found the time. The tone of Blake's writing demands that, at least for this story. I couldn't count the number of 'and's in this book, because many of the passages are intertwined and ramble on as if you are really sitting down in the head of a 17 year old girl. It isn't structured along a clear cut 'paragraph, paragraph, paragraph' - the book is written well in a journalistic tone of someone experiencing her four years of high school. The story follows her ups, downs, growths, experiences, discoveries, heartaches, and surprises without ever leaving the \\"...And I went down to visit her because she was upset. Afterwards we decided to go get frozen yogurt downtown and look for Todd...\\" tone.The central character is frustrating, in the way a mother might get nervous picking up the journal of her daughter and finding out what she's been up to, yet she constantly draws you back with the choices she makes and her reasonings behind them.This book aptly portrays the shallow, sweet world of being a teenage girl - and her inner thoughts will always disarm you into reading the next page..."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"This book I found interesting and exciting to read. It seems like she is very energetic for some reason, like she never stops! I think this book is really for teenage girls or even adults. I think Andrea is the typical teenager (apart from some things in the book that some people might not be doing at that age... if you know what I mean!) But all in all I think this is a very enjoyable story and will get all your emotions up and running. There are some quite humourous bits, like when Cybil shaves her hair off, to impress a boy that Andrea ends up with anyway... OK, I will not tell you ANYMORE and you will just have to buy the book to see what other amazing, exciting adventures happen to Andrea throughout her hectic high school life!"},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"I received \\"Girl\\" as a chance encounter and could not put it down from the moment I first picked it up. I found the characters to be as real and interesting as any I have read about. Andrea is a very believeable character and the whole book has a very somber feel to it. I truly hope that the author will give us a part two to the novel so we can continue to enjoy the adventrues of Andrea as she enters college. By the way using a Krokus song in the novel really took me back as they were one of my favorite bands in high school."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"ok, 1st off, I LOVED this book!

Thank you blake."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"When questioning whether a grown man could accurately write about a teenage girls adventures through high school, one would think it impossible. Blake Nelson's most popular novel Girl takes the reader on a girl's journey to self discovery. Set in modern time, the characters of Girl are faced with issues dealing with drugs, sexuality, and personal loss.Andrea Marr is a sixteen-year-old girl growing up in a typical suburb in Portland, Oregon. Andrea is part of the in-crowd, dates a jock, and is invited to the coolest parties. Andrea is not like the rest on the popular crown in that she befriends anyone. One of her acquaintances includes Cybil, a head-shaven punk rocker. Cybil opens Andrea's eyes to life outside of suburbia. Andrea followed Cybil's band Bed Head, later to be renamed Thriftstore Apocalypse to downtown bars. This is when Andrea changes her image and ideas. The novel is written with such intimate insight to life as a teen girl.Through the downtown scene, Andrea is introduced to indie music. No longer shopping at Sunset Mall, she buys her clothing at HOP! and other second hand stores. Andrea learns through experience about drugs and sex, and about love and heartbreak. For anyone trying to make it through the tortures of high school or who can now laughingly reminisce about it, I recommend Girl."},{"Title":"Girl: A Novel","review":"Being a 17 year old girl, who lives in a smaller town and listens to punk rock. I have never read a book i could relate to more than &quot;Girl.&quot; I started reading it one afternoon and i could not put it down, i stayed up late into the night, because i had to finish this book. i could understand everything the main character was thinking and going through. I was so excited to get to the end of the book to see what happens, only to find out there was another book. The next day i drove, and called every bookstore in town but no one had it.

It is an older book, so it is written in a style you don't find much anymore, but that's a big part of its charm... it is just SO full of information. Many time-period projects, crafts, lore, even a great section on many tribes' languages and specific words. A must for anyone interested in studying to learn more about Native Americans, even though it is a bit dated."},{"Title":"Lonesome Cities","review":"My favorite book of love poems by the eclectic talent of Rod McKuen. He's written several poetry books, but this one's the best all because of the poem, 'The Outstretched Hand.' McKuen has done just about everything in life besides being a talented songwriter and entertainer. He's been a Radio D.J., composer, newspaper columnist and now best-selling author. He did the motion picture scores for, 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' &amp; 'Joanna.' He's recorded 35 record albums of his own songs. He has published 'Stanyan Street and other Sorrows' in 1966 and 'Listen to the Warm.' If you want to know about Rod McKuen style this is a good place to start.Here's an excerpt from the book of 'The Outstretched Hand' (for Jay Allen):Each of us was made by Godand some of us grew tall.Others stood out in the windtheir branches bent and fell.Those of us who walk in lightmust help the ones in darkness up.For that's what life is all aboutand love is all there to life.Each of us made by Godbeautiful in His mind's eye.Those of us that turned out sowedshould look across our shoulders onceand help the weak ones to their feet.It only takes an outstretched hand."},{"Title":"Lonesome Cities","review":"Lonesome Cities runs the whole gambit of love poems, from elated to lost and then some.

It helps make connections between different events in different parts of the world. This has been especially helpful for me when planning units of study for children of all ages. It helps expand the study to a variety of interest areas.The book is also helpful when reading as I often look up the particular time span and find out what else was going on at that time. For example, the year I was born, 1945 was the year that Vitamin A was synthesized, that Carousel played in New York, that Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim Museum and that George Orwell wrote the Animal Farm. These connections make the reading so much more interesting and expansive. These connections have been especially helpful for the children. A really handy reference book. I have another copy."},{"Title":"The Timetables of History A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events","review":"This book illustrates very clearly how different events affected or started parts of history. It divides it up into sections such as political, religion, music, arts, and daily life. It proceeds to list all of the events that occured at that time period, or as mostly used per year. This book is a very helpful tool for a research project, or if you just want to brush up on your history."},{"Title":"Furniture Factory Outlet Guide","review":"This one looks like one...every page has a different outlet, with information like location and telephone, hours, email, a brief description with very personalized comments from the author, directions on how to get there, and lists of manufacturers each outlet carries or does business with. It also has some photos of items you could find there and the great discounts offered. Too bad I don't live in the North Carolina area or I would be off every weekend going to every outlet. It's great for those who really want to save big money on furniture and accessories for the home. The book did mention 3 big warehouses in NC, which I already know about, but offered more info about them than what I already knew. If you plan on getting furniture, get the book, but first check if there is a copy in your local library instead of spending the money on the book. This is a guide you will probably use once every other year, or until you finish furnishing your home."},{"Title":"Furniture Factory Outlet Guide","review":"I purchased a house recently and decided to replace almost all my furniture. I bought The Furniture Factory Outlet Guide for assistance. I saved literally over $10,000 using this book. My one recommendation to use this guide is to shop your local furniture stores, get the furniture manufacturer's name, the group name and/or number of the pieces you like. Then use the guide to call the stores listed in the guide that carry the furniture manufacturer you're looking for, and price shop, one against the other for the best deals. You really don't even have to go to NC, unless you want to spend a couple days looking and figuring out what furniture you like. Then go home and call the stores in this guide. Good luck and happy shopping."},{"Title":"Furniture Factory Outlet Guide","review":"I stumbled across Causey's book on a North Carolina furniture discounter's web site. My husband and I made the trip from Portland, OR, for less than $400 with all of our frequent flier miles and Marriott Reward points. We loved the people and had a blast! Causey's book was instrumental in helping to plan the trip. It reduced the number of stores we visited significantly, and we were able to trust in the discounters that we visited. Here's my advice:1. If you don't know exactly what you want (ex: style of bedroom set), get the book and make the trip. We went to the After Market Sale in early May and just about everyone had a big sale. I can't understate the value of seeing so many pieces within a short time. We were able to quickly develop preferences for which styles, manufactures, and colors would work in our home. Our favorite place was the Hickory Furniture Mart - a great experience for those buying mid- to high-end furniture.2. If you already know exactly what manufacturer and collection you want (maybe you've seen something in your home town), get the book and call all of the listed discounters for quotes. The book has an index by manufacturer, so it's really simple and will pay for itself in the time you save. There are tons of discounters, so the book is needed to weed through the masses.(...)At the end of the day, the trip was well worth it. We found a perfect dining room set and bedroom set to meet our needs. We ended up buying Thomasville furniture due to their very unique, warm, and rich Cognac stain (fantastic sales team at the Hickory Furniture Mart: ask for Shana Bretzius and Randy Huffman). Seeing all of these pieces in person, we thought Thomasville was a clear standout.We are ecstatic and couldn't have found such perfect furniture for us without making the trip. We also validated that in all cases, the DirectBuy prices are lower than the NC discounters, even when including the After Market Sales. Unfortunately for us, DirectBuy doesn't carry Thomasville (due to Thomasville's minimum retail pricing policy), and we decided the Thomasville furniture was the perfect fit for us. We did, however, get the minimum pricing + free shipping + free white glove delivery (they carry it in and set it up) to Portland, OR. And, a much better deal than our local stores!"},{"Title":"Furniture Factory Outlet Guide","review":"Have not actually travelled to NC yet, but plan to in October.

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)","review":"I have lived in The Netherlands for only four months. I have looked at several sources of information about the country: its culture, customs, language, history, climate, geography, tourist attractions etc.. I found Mr. Janin's brief (167pp) volume to have been very well-done. I believe his 25 years as a U.S. diplomat (but not in The Netherlands) have taught him what an outsider needs, to begin to understand a culture. He combines the personal experience of others--in this case, his Dutch wife, her family and many of their friends and acquaintances--with pofessional writings. He even includes an 18-item english-language reading list. The range of topics covered is broad--geography, climate, history, language, customs, principal attractions, even a &quot;culture-quiz&quot; to help the reader understand what s/he has learned about the culture at the end of the book. The coverage is also balanced: he includes both pluses (egs.respect for others, language ability) and minuses (egs.drug use, immigrants and asylum seekers). He readily recognizes that, however helpful it might be to understanding the society, the Dutch view of themselves--which he capsulizes--is not likely to be objective. I wish he had included information on regional differences in the Dutch language, customs and attitudes. But, that minor quibble aside, I think Mr. Janin's goal in writing this small book (&quot;to help [the reader] become [a] well-briefed foreigner.&quot; (p.10)) has been achieved in an admirable fashion. I think it is an informative, easy-to-read--even entertaining--book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Netherlands (Culture Shock!

Despite best efforts to keep characters straight, track possible motives and alibis and follow a labyrinthine plot, it was still difficult to figure out what the hell was going on.

Lovejoy is recruited to act as a consultant for a film about a robbery from the British Museum. Lovejoy knows all along that he's a pawn in some crook's game, but he can't figure out why they need him. Lovejoy, you're too modest - not only are you a divy, but your reputation preceeds you! Anyway, Lovejoy ends up mixing up with some very bad people, and he even finds himself in between two mob bosses that are after each other's blood.

It enscapsulates an interesting and significant period of Britains history and this well written biography neatly captures the feel of these times. Callaghan's premiership has often been perhaps judged rather too harsely with the memories of the final period, rather than earlier acheivements being to the forefront of most peoples minds. this attempts to be a revisionist biography and in truth the author is a little too reverential towards and uncritical of his subject."},{"Title":"Callaghan: A Life","review":"Callaghan was in some ways a pivotal political figure. He not only lead the Labour party to a critical defeat which not only saw the conservatives dominate Britain for a record period but his loss of office led to the destruction of everything he stood for. That is the union movement, Britain's place as a manufacturing nation and the notion of the labour party being a working class movement.The writer of the book has been absorbed by Callaghan's career and has come to like him (as did most of the British Electorate). His biography thus lacks a sense of the tragedy of Callaghan's life and the failure of his Prime Minister Ship and the desolation which resulted.Instead we get a picture of a man on the right of the labour movement who was a decent man and tried in his political career to stand for what he thought was right.A readable biography which looks to much at the man and perhaps not enough at the political context."},{"Title":"The Abbott and Costello book (The Popular Library film series)","review":"For years,the work of Abbott &amp; Costello have been ignored or even unfairly criticized by many film and tv historians.Except for Leonard Maltin's &quot;Movie Comedy Teams&quot;and &quot;Great Movie Comedians&quot;.The boys'efforts have recevied little or no reconition at all.Until now.Film and TV Comedy writer Jim Mullholland has finally written a book that gives us all some insight into the team's careers.Using reserch,interviews with the boys colleages,family members,performers and craftspersons from the films and tv work and from Maltin.Mr.Mullholland looks at the duo's humble beginnings in Burlesque,With The Steel Pier Mintrels,performing on &quot;The Kate Smith Radio Hour&quot;and in nightclubs.To their debut in The Broadcway Musical revue:&quot;The Streets Of Paris!&quot;with Carmen Miranda and Bobby Clark to hosting their own weekly radio series'on NBC and later on ABC Radio.The book goes on to look at their film careers and at their work on tv:First as semi-regular guest hosts/performers on NBC TV's:&quot;Colgate Comedy Hour!&quot;and then as the stars of &quot;The Abbott &amp; Costello Show&quot;.The book also has a filmography of their movies and a listing of their second tv series.Plus photos of the time(Many of these pictures are from private collections).While the book does not go into the problems that exsisted behind the scenes(Including the sorid details of the team's second and final breakup in December,1956)and there is only a small ammount of info about the creation of the films.It still gives us a look into the creation and successes of one of show business'most popular teams.This is one book that Abbott &amp; Costello fans should have.Along with fans of comedy history.Bravo Jimmy!

Wow! What a treat! I've read on the author's and publisher's websites that the next book in the series will be released this summer, and I'm just intrigued to get my hands on a copy (pun intended). When Brandon has to contend with the mentality of modern-day Japanese life, he is understandably flummoxed by the people around him and their special reverence for authority figures. He is also surprised by the unique political power machinery in Japan. I've lived there, and I know that Rucker speaks the truth about these matters. I learned a lot of new things I didn't know about Japan before, too, and I always love that about the mystery novels I read. Two thumbs up! Carry on, Lance Rucker!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"Hawthorne's gentle, charming collection of classic myths retold for the children of his day is a neglected classic. Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion, his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample:&quot;Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun. There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry. The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year's withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.&quot;But Hawthorne is also equal to the task of less genteel, more vigorous images:&quot;At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.&quot;Adding to the pleasure of these retold tales is the gorgeous art of Arthur Rackham, both in black-and-white drawings and full-color plates, which captures the unearthly beauty and the unexpectedly surprising humor of Hawthorne's work. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"Once upon a time (I was about 8), a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here, there, and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology, especially \\"The Chimaera\\" and \\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\", since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas, I forgot the name of the author of \\"The Chimaera\\", and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series, no doubt, I would have said, if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago, I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. \\"Scarlet Letter\\" Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_), but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story, or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright, but then I want more space for more myths. :) Each myth in _A Wonder Book_ has an Introductory and After the Story section where the storyteller leads up to the tale, then fends off any awkward questions from his young audience.\\"The Gorgon's Head\\" - The story of Perseus, from his infancy through the quest for Medusa's head. Hawthorne skates delicately past the question of who put Perseus and his mother, Danae, in a chest and abandoned them on the sea, let alone why (toned down for kids, and all that), and of course doesn't go into detail about what mischief Polydectes might intend if Perseus can be got out of the way.Hawthorne is otherwise thorough about details: he even includes the Three Gray Women, who share the use of a single eye, who had to be persuaded to reveal the location of the monsters whose gaze turns living creatures to stone.\\"The Golden Touch\\" - The Midas legend, of how a king, blinded by a love of gold, foolishly asked Apollo that he be given the gift of turning things into gold with a touch. Be careful what you ask for...\\"The Paradise of Children\\" - The story of Pandora's box. Hawthorne's version, much as I like his other mythological tales, has been prettified a little too much: everyone in the world was a child who never grew up, before the box arrived.\\"The Three Golden Apples\\" - The 11th labour of Hercules, wherein the king sent him to fetch the apples of the Hesperides. The tale begins with Hercules meeting a band of nymphs, who hear his account (only briefly summarized, alas) of his preceding labours before directing him to the one person who can direct him to the garden: the Old Man of the Sea...\\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\" - Philemon and his wife Bauchis have grown old together - the only kindly folk living for a good way around a prosperous village, whose inhabitants delight in tormenting vagabonds (although they'll fawn on wealthy-looking strangers). Then one day a ragged youth called Quicksilver and a taciturn man with an appearance of great wisdom are driven out of the village...\\"The Chimaera\\" - Bellerophon's pursuit of Pegasus, whom he seeks because only in the air does he have a chance of killing the monstrous chimaera. Bellerophon's long wait beside the fountain of Pirene, where Pegasus descends to drink, is enlivened by several characters living round about: an old man who can't even remember his glory days, an overly timid maiden who'd run from anything unusual, a yokel who only appreciates plowhorses, and a little boy (the only one who really believes in Pegasus)."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"In the spring of 1851 Hawthorne wrote to his publisher, James Fields (of the renowned Ticknor and Fields), proposing a children's book retelling six well-known stories from Greek mythology. He planned to adopt \\"a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic.\\" In addition, he wanted to make the fables suitable for young Christian children: \\"of course, I shall purge all the old heathen wickedness, and put in a moral wherever practicable.\\"I am usually not a fan of sanitized tales--even when written by someone the status of Nathaniel Hawthorne. But, in spite of their overt preachiness and their occasional preciousness, there's something charming and original about these adaptations. Even adults might enjoy these six tales: Perseus's slaughter of Medusa, Midas and his golden touch, Pandora's box (stripped of Prometheus's role), the apples of the Hesperides (or Hercules's Eleventh Labor), Baucis and Philemon and the magic pitcher (which, in my opinion, is the best of the lot), and Bellerophon and Pegasus's battle with the monster Chimaera.Threading these stories together is Eustace Bright, Hawthorne's college-age narrator, who relates his versions to a gaggle of local children (a couple of whom taunt him for his bumptiousness). Hawthorne uses this framing device to insert himself as his own critic. Overhearing one of the stories, the father of one of the children is not amused, finding Eustace's taste \\"altogether Gothic\\" and advising him \\"never more to meddle with a classical myth.\\" To this critique, Eustace petulantly responds that \\"an old Greek had no more right to them, than a modern Yankee has,\\" and he accuses classical writers of forming these tales \\"into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless.\\" If anything, Hawthorne has certainly brought warmth to these old stories.Still, the reading level might be a tall order for many children under 8 (although an adult can adapt them for reading out loud). Hawthorne sprinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context. And he gets carried away with his descriptions of the countryside. Hawthorne's evocative passages will surely strike modern readers as hopelessly old-fashioned, although the author realized that he was trying the patience of children even from his own day. After three florid and nearly insufferable paragraphs describing a meadow, for example, Hawthorne apologetically interrupts himself that \\"we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and the wild flowers. There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.\\"What's more interesting, of course, are the stories of Greek gods and monsters and flying horses. Fortunately for readers young and old, Hawthorne mostly stays away from the scenery and sticks to the legends."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"One day last week, I could not, even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce), decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again, and as Eustace Bright, the ambitious college student who narrates these tales, held his little auditors in awe, my eyes, too, were wide with wonder. It truly is a &quot;wonder book,&quot; full of high fantasy, thrilling action, and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards &quot;boys and girls,&quot; Hawthorne explains in his introduction that &quot;children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.&quot; Indeed; the book hardly condescends, and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales, for I was equally, if not more, entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story, which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart, whoever you may be!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book.

Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"If you've read Hawthorne's longer works, you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages, 8 to 80, who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery, wintery day, sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden, summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator, Eustace Bright, who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch, of Hercules' exploits, of Medusa, you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly, yet fully adventurous form, through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm, makes them palatable for younger kids, and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings, but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder, I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format, enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in \\"A Scarlet Letter,\\" \\"House of the Seven Gables,\\" and even \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" he excels in his shorter tales, where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing, with only hints of his humor and playfulness, but in \\"A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls,\\" we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it.

The next remarks are in response to the first two reviews appearing on this page.Dear Readers,I am Zachary Gartenberg, the author of Mori's Story. It has been ten years since I sat down to write the first draft of my book; I am now nineteen, Mori is eighteen, and I am happy to say that he is healthy and flourishing. Just recently, I came across the two reviews that appear first on this page, one entitled \\"Biased\\" and the other with a header that warns, \\"Only but this book if you sent your Autistic child away.\\" I would like to address several things said in these reviews.First, with respect to the first review, I acknowledge and regret my use of the term 'disease' in reference to Autism. I certainly do not conceive of Autism as a disease and understand it to be, as the author of this review points out, a neurobiological condition. At the age of nine, however, I did not perceive such a distinction; I am surprised my editor did not either.With regard to both reviewers' claims that my parents \\"sent away\\" my brother, I must respond that I have never once questioned my parents' love and devotion to Mori. Thay have always done the best for him and always will. It is incorrect and unfair to say that we neglected Mori, becasue we sought the best behavioral treatment that was available for him, we did it without hesitation, and we did it with great sacrifice. We interact with Mori on a more-than-regular basis; he is a central part of our lives, a wonderful and enriching part. Finding an alternative living situation for Mori was a necessity that made every member of our family profoundly sad; we believe we did the right thing, nonetheless, in ensuring that Mori live with caring, responsible, and understanding people.It has been quite some time since I sat down to re-read Mori's Story. Many things have changed since I wrote the book. One thing that hasn't changed is my family's unconditional love and respect for my brother. I hope that anyone who has read or will read my book will keep these comments in mind. I hope to write more on my brother in the future, and as I know more and am older, perhaps I am better equipped to do so now than I was ten years ago. But I will write about Mori in the future for the same reason I wrote about him in the past: I want to share what it means to accept, understand, and love a person who is different and special, and Mori has taught me that."},{"Title":"Mori's Story: A Book about a Boy with Autism (Meeting the Challenge)","review":"Doesn't every family who encounters autism come at it differently?I went to high school with Zachary & Mori's uncle. I knew about the book, but had never seen it for sale. I was so thrilled when their grandmother pointed out where I could get \\"their\\" book. It's a loving book about a loving family. My own daughter is autistic. In part, I bought the book for a classroom school library -- I am also a special educator-- to share with other parents of disabled kids.I will eagerly read anything else Zachary writes about his brother and family."},{"Title":"Mori's Story: A Book about a Boy with Autism (Meeting the Challenge)","review":"This is a good book written by a brother of an autistic child. No one should judge this family and the choices they made. It is not as though they hide Mori. They want what is best for him and in this situation, what was best seemed to be sending him to live with a family where he could get the help and focus he needed.It seemed obvious to me the family is proud of him and wants him to be the best he can be and that meant leaving him with another local family. It had to be hard to make that decision.This book is a story about how different people hand different situations due to different dynamics in a family.I highly recommend it and recommend reading it without judging eyes."},{"Title":"Mori's Story: A Book about a Boy with Autism (Meeting the Challenge)","review":"I guess this is something that I feel strongly about. Because we have an autistic child who we love, care for, teach and could not imagine living without. It can be extremely exhausting at times but I could never imagine placing our child in another home. I don't want to judge the situation here but I bought this book thinking it was something our other son may relate to. Not so, since Mori does not live with his siblings except for visitation. Our other boy was extremely sad when he heard about Mori not living with his family. I could not recommend this book to anyone who is facing the trials as well as the rewards of living and loving a child with autism each and every day."},{"Title":"Against the Season","review":"A novel about the tangled lives of small town folks both young and old and the relationships that evolve among them. A story that brings together people from various places and stages in their lives - Amelia, an older woman who recently lost her sister; Agate her young, pregnant housekeeper; Cole Amelia's grandnephew; Dina, the used furniture dealer; and Rosemary, the town social worker to name a few. Throw in some humourous misunderstandings, and this makes for some interesting reading."},{"Title":"Against the Season","review":"About a collection of characters, men and women of all types, in a smallish New England town. All of them connected through their relationship with the elderly Amelia Larson, one of the town's surviving matriarchs.About love, hate, foolishness and consequence, compassion, romance, regret, life, death, complications, men's mental crap, women's mental crap, sticky situations, sex, pain, loss, dancing Greek sailors, change...At turns funny, angering, erotic without being pornographic, sweet, and terribly realistic throughout. Most of the characters will become beloved friends, and those who don't will at least win your empathy.The author doesn't insult the reader's intelligence with two dimensional characters, overused cliches, and unnecessary sentiment.This story was set in a time when people still had to take responsibility for their own actions. And even though two of the main characters are lesbos (I can say that...*I'm* a lesbo), this book is definitely NOT PC. So if you're a liberal, you might want to stick to Alice Walker.This book will make you *feel*. Some things have been lost in our modern society. Things like honor, integrity, a sense of duty, loyalty, morality. Those things we lost are in this book. Get out the tissue.Because of the tone of the book, I would recommend it to anyone except leftist Democrats/Socialists. (Like I said, it is set during a time in the U.S. when folks had to take responsibility for their own actions.)Generally speaking, this story has been told many times before, by other authors about different characters living in different times, and perhaps different countries. But this version is the most satisfying, realistic, engaging, erotic, heartbreaking yet uplifting one I've read so far.[...]...."},{"Title":"Merry Christmas Curious George","review":"Length:: 6:17 MinsMy son (almost 3) loves this book and we have to read it almost every night before bed, since I got it around Thanksgiving. :)"},{"Title":"Merry Christmas Curious George","review":"Excellent book.

He loves the books and the television programs. As my nephew is a curious little fellow who sometimes gets into trouble for his own investigations, he finds a kindred spirit in the cheeky little monkey who always tumbles into his adventures.My nephew loves to hear this story (over and over and over), and he loves to discuss all the items in the book's richly, clever illustrations--especially when George first decorates the tree with items he finds in the children's hospital---X-rays, crutches, cups, cards, medical supplies! One of his favorite story moments is when the nurse is picking up the naughty monkey to remove him from the hospital. Ah, but the children and my nephew beg for him to stay!Reading to children is important. Reading builds personal connection, observation, critical thinking, and language in ways that today's loud, obnoxious video games and automated toys do not. The Curious George books continue teach and reach generations of children. They are a family favorite here, and they are always welcomed.A bonus of this book is that my nephew is learning some health / hospital vocabulary in a fun, non-threatening way. This book opens the door to talk to children about children who might be sick or hurt or who might have to have extended stays in the hospital. It allows for a discussion about why some people may need X-Rays, crutches, canes, wheelchairs, etc. With adult guidance, a child can learn empathy and compassion for others through this book. Of course, bringing comfort and cheer to those who need it the most also speaks to the spirit of Christmas.The book is a lovely edition to my nephew's library of favorite tales. We believe that fans of Curious George Goes to the Hospital would enjoy this Christmas book."},{"Title":"Merry Christmas Curious George","review":"I got a copy of this book after Christmas at Target.

The 10 1/4 inch by 10 1/4 inch 24 page book is delightfully illustrated on every page. Children will love the illustrations by Mary O'Keefe Young. From the picture of Curious George with his friend wearing a ten gallon hat getting into a sports car to go looking for a Christmas tree, to the one where Curious George is climbing to the top of the large Christmas tree in the Children's Hospital to help decorate it for the children, children will love these meaningful illustrations. The book has a full color pictorial cover showing Curious George placing a large star on top of a Christmas tree. Both the front and back endpapers are beautifully decorated with full color designs of many Christmas tree balls with a reflection of Curious George in each. The author knows exactly how much text to place on each page for younger children. The text is limited on each page to a few sentencesThe story opens with Curious George and his friend, with the ten gallon Texan hat, shopping for a Christmas tree. At the Christmas tree farm, Curious George climbs up into a large Christmas tree. While in the tree, men cut the large tree down and transport it to a children's hospital with Curious George still hidden in the branches. The tree is taken into the children's hospital where it is erected in a large room. It is here where the fun really begins. Children will want to read this book to enjoy the wonderful and funny adventures of Curious George in the children's hospital at Christmas time. Children will also learn an important and valuable moral lesson and that is the imprtance of making other people happy.This is a light tale and enjoyable to read. However, it lacks much of the real meaning of Christmas."},{"Title":"Merry Christmas Curious George","review":"This book was a nice addition to our Christmas Book Advent Calendar. This is the first year I did the Book Calendar so I had to buy at least half of the books to round out the stack we already owned from previous years gifts. In typical George fashion he gets into some kind of mischief that ends up working out in a happy way. In this book George gets stuck in a Christmas tree that makes its way to a children's hospital where George tries to help decorate it and make the gifts look better by changing around the bows and name tags. Of course this makes one of the nurses mad and when she is escorting George out, all of the children at the hospital are cheered up by his silly antics and beg her to let him stay. It's a nice enough book with even a visit from Santa thrown in and my daughter seemed to enjoy it, which is the most important part."},{"Title":"Merry Christmas Curious George","review":"This is an adorable Christmas book for fans of Curious George.

That said, I found the trading of power (or at least the characters' perception of it) in this book most compelling. From one second to the next, as the characters in a scene come and go, or the shock of first appearances fade or linger, a feeling of control quickly becomes one of fear and distrust. It's a true Malouf masterpiece because he makes us think about the people in our own world today by letting us into a story in an otherwise distant time and place. It's a beautiful book, and reads to me- like most of Malouf's writing- like a pure stream in a dirty world."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"I found the issues addressed in this novel compelling. Firstly, the title, 'Remembering Babylon' refers to Psalm 137 where Hebrew slaves in Babylon lament the loss of Zion, their homeland. The novel addresses exile in various forms: immagrants in exile, members of a small community in exile. How can these immigrants from Europe belong in a place which is not their own? The answer is provided in Gemmy Fairly. He is ostracised by the European settlers, but at the same time is not an aboriginal - he represents a meeting place between the two cultures as he hovers upon the fence in the opening confrontation with the three McIvor children. The answer he provides, is one of spirituality. Throughout the novel there are certain parallels: White understandings of power (eg authority through guns, and land ownership) versus aboriginal understandings (kinship and oneness with the land), White spirituality in Rev. Frazer versus the tribal land spirituality. This is not merely indigenous stereotyping as Germaine Greer suggests, but a suggestion as to how newcomers can learn to make the new land home. This is done not by 'recreating Zion in Babylon' and trying to recreate a little piece of Europe in this harsh environment, not through topsoil forever ruined by the trampling of hooved beasts, but by connecting spiritually with the land, and becoming one with it. This point is most strongly reinforced by Janet, the McIvor's eldest daughter, in two occasions. Firstly, when the initial connection is made, bees (native - European hybrid bees, through no accident) swarm majestically around her, attracted to her menstrual blood like honey, but leave her unharmed, leading to her involvement with the convent to study bees. Secondly, in the last pages of the novel, as she watches the night fall and the tide rise, the concluding spiritual connection with the land is made. This is the point where exile becomes home. note: This short ditty was written in preperation for an exam, and thus have failed to include relavant references from Suvendrini Perera, Susan Wyndham, Germaine Greer and Joan Maxwell. sorry."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Mr. David Malouf has the ability to take familiar topics, amend them, and create a new viewpoint, a valid book, and worthwhile reading experience. Fear generated by the unknown as perceived by ignorant or well-educated simpletons is not new. That these feelings are often expressed in terms of racial tension; hatred and violence are routine, not an exception, and anything but a novelty. In, \\"Remembering Babylon\\" the Author tells the tale in a manner new for me, and even though the behaviors of many involved were predictable, the new perspective and quality the Author brings to it made for very good reading.As he has in previous works he sets the tale in Australia, and once again brings settlers from Europe, in this case Scotland. Mr. Malouf then takes a familiar human interaction, which is by definition tragic, and it is here he makes it his own. In terms of Race, Gemmy is as white as any of the settlers. He spent thirteen years in London, and then was washed upon the coast of Australia where he then lives amongst the Native Aborigines for sixteen years. As Gemmy has lived the better part of his life is the harsh sun he is no longer as light in complexion as the self-described white newcomers. Gemmy one day happens across the path of some children, and in fear of his safety announces he \\"is a British Object\\". The irony of this statement could be dwelt on for pages by itself.There are many relationships a reader can explore in this story. I felt a key one was that between Gemmy and the Family headed by Jock that takes him in. Jock does so to please his wife, as Gemmy is not a person he would bring into his home with his Wife and Children. The reaction of the balance of the settlement ranges from degrees of fear, to desire to destroy the race that Gemmy has morphed into from the viewpoint of the duller of the participants. Gemmy at once becomes a trusted member of Jock's Family, and the focus for every evil fantasized, imagined, or counterfeited by others.The storyline must be left for the book, however one experience shared by Jock and Gemmy is of note. Gemmy treated like the savage he is not, routinely stays several steps ahead of those who attempt to exploit him to gain knowledge of his tribe, and then extinguish them. Far from being intellectually inept, he combines the street smarts of the former London Urchin, with the practical knowledge of sixteen years of learning to live in harmony with the same land the settlers come to conquer. He becomes a harmless, productive and trustworthy part of Jock's Family if not the community.Gemmy knows his own heart, and that of those he has come to live amongst. He is under no illusions as to how he is viewed, or how he sees the world. Jock goes through a major reassessment of what he thought he was, as events build around Gemmy. The Author explores in a thoughtful manner what our thoughts are made of, how they change, and whether it is we that change, or our views of others that change us.The book is filled with smaller observations that are material for contemplation. The loneliness of settling a new land is a reality, but when the Author takes one player and has her ponder the thought of being the first dead to be buried here as well, and the loneliness of knowing no Family that has gone before, no one to join in the new resting place, is beyond poignant.Another great piece of work from this Author."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Remembering Babylon is the story of Gemmy - washed up on the Australian coast as a boy after a life of harshness that is hard to imagine, he is taken in by group of Aborigines. Sixteen years later, he makes himself known to the white community of northern Queensland, where he causes the community to examine not only it's attitude towards what is \`civilised', but also causes them to look inwards upon themselves.This is a story about frontiers - the physical frontier of the small community that Gemmy joins; the frontier of the new state of Queensland; and the frontier between civilised and primitive. There is some beautiful work in this book, especially in its examination of small community dynamics, and coming of age. But I feel that Malouf starts threads that he doesn't bother to finish - the ambiguous characters of Mrs. Hutchence and Leona are introduced with promises of an exotic past, yet we never get to know them. George the school teacher is developed, only to be left out of the second half of the story. While Malouf manages to pack a lot of punch into a short tale, I feel that perhaps just a little be of expansion would have made this an even better book. But I will admit that I got a kick out of reading a story set in my home state of Queensland - it is nice to see that there is some Australian historical fiction set somewhere other than the Southern States!"},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Our book club recently read this novel for its monthly selection and found it to be a good choice. Although a couple of members were confused by the book's seemingly aimless direction and lack of a central character, the discussion we had was very lively and interesting. The author's nuanced insight into the point of view of each character let us see the profound effects Gemmy had on all the lives of the villagers. The work takes some digging to fully appreciate; then its poetic artistry and structure and purpose become more evident. The key is not to expect the book to read like a conventional novel of cultural conflict. This is more like a prose poem where the details are distilled to essentials, where an entire community is compressed into five or six main individuals, where symbolism expands the meaning and emotional content, where lyrical language stimulates thought, where ambiguity and mystery draw in the reader without giving way to romance. Gemmy, the catalyst for change, is complex and hard to figure: on the one hand he is pathetic, childlike, and vulnerable but on the other he is observant, considerate and spiritual. He brings out the best of those in the village who are open to new experiences and the worst in those who are close-minded and fearful. Also he touches the reader. This fable will be appreciated by the poetically-inclined and scorned by the literal-minded."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"\\"One day in the middle of the nineteenth century, when settlement in Queensland had advanced little more than halfway up the coast, three children were playing at the edge of a paddock when they say something extraordinary.\\" So begins David Malouf's poetic novel \\"Remembering Babylon,\\" a tale based on the true historical character named Gemmy Morril. The fictionalized Gemmy Fairley is the \\"something extraordinary\\" the three children, sisters Janet and Meg McIvor, and their cousin Lachlan Beattie find and later provide shelter for at the McIvor farm home. Gemmy is twenty-nine years old; sixteen years earlier he was thrown overboard from a British ship and has since been living with the aborigines.Upon being threatened by a stick made to appear as a gun by Lachlan, Gemmy spits out, \\"Do not shoot, I am a B-b-british object.\\" How apropos those words turn out to be as the town treats Gemmy more like a carefully watched dangerous animal than the prodigal son. Malouf is a native of Australia, but his mixed ancestry (mother is of Portuguese Jewish descent, father is Lebanese Christian) has surely prompted him to explore identity. One running theme and fear is losing one's whiteness. \\"Poor bugger, he had got lost, and as just a bairn too. It was a duty they owed to what they were, or claimed to be, to bring him back, if it was feasible, to being a white man. But was it feasible? He had been with them, quite happily it appeared, for more than half his life: living off the land, learning their lingo and all their secrets, all the abominations they went in for. Were they actually looking at a man, a white man?\\"At times Malouf's writing jumps too quickly from different vantage points such as the schoolteacher George Abbot; Jock and Janet McIvor, who protect and treat Gemmy fairly; Mr. Frazer, the minister; and other smaller side characters. But after regaining one's bearings, the reader will step into a rhythm and word choice that befits a well-crafted poem. Malouf earned his writing chops via poetry (\\"Bicycle and Other Poems,\\" 1970); \\"Remembering Babylon\\" sparkles with visual imagery thanks to the author's writing foundation of poetry. Happily the ending does not fall into maudlin sentimentality or clich&eacute;. However, one perhaps would have like to read and delve into knowing Gemmy more. Nonetheless, Malouf's \\"Remembering Babylon\\" is a powerful look at what happens when one encounters the \\"other.\\"Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"The novel &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; by David Malouf deals with the cultural clash between 19th century white settlers in Australia and the native Australian world view. Praised by many critics, the book won the 1996 International Impac Dublin Literary Award and was short-listed for the 1993 Booker Prize.In this novel, David Malouf, an Australian himself, describes the story of Gemmy Fairley, who was cast ashore in northern Australia as a boy and then raised by Aborigines. Sixteen years later, he steps out of the &quot;absolute darkness&quot; of the outback and makes himself known to a small community of white settlers. Trying to find his former self, Gemmy has to deal with not only the cruelty and racism of the villagers but also with the demons of his own past. In the course of his stay, he changes the settlers' view on the natives as well as their view on themselves.I read this book for English class, and I must say that it is not easy to read for a non-native speaker if you really want to understand the book. It took some time to get absorbed into the story, but once I had gotten the hang of it, it was an interesting and enjoyable read. Malouf uses a very poetic language and many metaphors that help get an impression of the native culture. He is also great at describing nature and impressions of it to the reader, making it easy to imagine everything. One thing I did not particularly like about this book is the fact that the narrator reveals information about Gemmy's past only in small bits, so the readers keeps on guessing and wondering what is going on sometimes. On the other hand, this way of giving facts about Gemmy is certainly what makes the reader keep on reading.All in all, I can only recommend this book to anybody who is interested in getting to know other cultures and in learning more about &quot;cultural clashes&quot;. Even though the story takes place in 19th century Australia, the message of &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; is universal and still important today, maybe more than ever."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"When abandoned 'British object' Gemmy Fairley sprints away from his Aboriginal protectors and into a white settlement of mid-nineteenth-century Queensland, it's the occasion for both wonder and hostility. For Malouf, it's an opportunity to explore many aspects of language, landscape and Australian identity. In the various reactions of the townsfolk, and Gemmy himself, he elucidates his themes. It's a novel full of complex images, acute observations, and heartbreaking lyricism. Once again, Malouf effortlessly fuses personal moments with grand themes. This is a more complex and elliptical work than his earlier novels, but no more or less satisfying - it's hard to improve on perfection. Shortlisted for the 1993 Booker Prize, 'Remembering Babylon' - from the breadth (and depth) of its scope to the finest details of its execution - leaves the actual winner for dead."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Setting this book in the mid-1800's on the nearly uninhabited north coast of Australia provides David Malouf with plenty of leeway to explore some of his favorite themes. The book begins with the return to &quot;civilization&quot; of an English cabinboy who had gone overboard twelve years prior and had been nursed by aborigines. With the north coast now being settled by people fearful of the shy aborigines who they think may be a threat to them, all the characters feel isolated: the settlers from life in England, from the more populated centers of Australia, from the aborigines, sometimes from each other, and certainly from the strange young man who has made contact with them; the former cabinboy from his &quot;countrymen,&quot; from the society of the sailors he served, from the aborigines who nursed him, and from the new society now being established on the north coast. All have differing views of reality, different values, and different understandings of what is important. The reader is forced to question what constitutes &quot;civilization&quot; and to ponder the extent to which we can have a &quot;real&quot; world without recognizing the importance of the supernatural and those who allow it to inform and transform their lives.As in &quot;The Conversations at Curlow Creek&quot; and in &quot;Harland's Half Acre,&quot; Malouf's main character must decide whether he will live in civilization as he has found it."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"As expected from David Malouf, &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; is replete with beautiful, lyrical passages. The dreamlike imagery and ethereal descriptions play upon the mind while one reads, touching the soul. Malouf is a fantastic, poetic writer, and is all-too-often ignored outside his native Australia.However, I was a bit disappointed with &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; because I expected so much more from a novel that was short-listed for the prestigious Booker Prize. The book starts out strong, but as it progresses, Malouf seems unsure about where things are headed, and begins to jump from scene to scene with little rhyme or reason. New characters are introduced in almost every chapter up until the last, only to never be mentioned again. Even the resolution regarding the main character seems contrived, as if Malouf simply had no idea what else to write about Gemmy, or how to end his particular story.As a poetic series of images depicting colonial Australia and its white inhabitants, &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; is a wonder. As a novel, the book is less than satisfying. After reading the last page, I remained unsure about the point or purpose of what I had just read. &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; might have worked better as a series of inter-related poems...Recommendations: &quot;The Conversations at Curlow Creek&quot; by David Malouf; &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; by Chinua Achebe"},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Remembering Babylon, which is written by David Malouf and is the winner of the 1996 International Impac Dublin Literacy Award, is the story of a white british boy, called Gemmy Fairley, who lands someday on the Australian coast and then is raised by a group of Aborigines. The story takes place in the mid 1840's and contains many lyrical passages ,which make it difficult for the reader to understand the plot, especially a German school class. All in all it's a very poetic novel,which visualizes on the one hand the civilised world and on the other hand the primitive world impressively."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"I am a fan of Malouf's work and I have always found him very insightful.

Got it in great condition as well."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"The writing of David Malouf is always poetic, full of sensation and unique perspective. This makes him a joy to read, for he brings the reader to their senses with his vibrant evocation of smells, tastes, touch, and sound. Whereas we grow so accustomed to reading novels where plot and character development are the two primary concerns of the author, Malouf takes a different strategy. He enhances both plot and character development with dreamlike forces of nature and society and environment that act upon both the plot and character to such an extent that these forces become dominant themes. This is certainly the case in Remembering Babylon where fear of the unknown becomes a major force that captures every character and entraps them in their thoughts and social interactions and consequences of their thoughts, words, and deeds. It is also a book about identity, claiming identity, inheriting identity, developing identity, and losing identity.Jemmy, a London street child, cleaning under sawmills at age 5, is a cabin boy at thirteen, set adrift in the Pacific by sailors who fear his fever. He lands on the northern shore of Australia and for sixteen years survives as a fringe outsider to a tribe of Aborigine nomads. When he hears about white people his interest is peaked and he soon tries to locate them and live with them. But he is the \`other', an outsider that never fits the community mould of these suspicious struggling Scottish pioneers who fear the unknown Aborigines and fears that Jemmy will somehow increase their vulnerability.Janet, the child of pioneers who take Jemmy into their home, is perceptive and intelligent and finds her life work among the first bee keepers in Australia. She experiences the pain that fear can cause in a community and even in her senior years, as a scientist nun with a study of bee sign language, she is again introduced to the effects of fear on the fabric of a community.Such a novel may frustrate some readers for characters talk past other characters, never really understanding or making connections. Malouf portrays this chronic world of misunderstanding with accuracy and pathos. In his books we see that we humans never really know each other, we have difficulty getting past our own projections and the projected defenses and masks of our contacts. We are vulnerable to the forces of fear which act like a contagion and spread quickly in human society. We have very few resources and defenses other than common sense which often fails in the face of fear, and compassion, which is a private solution in the face of public fear.Jemmy evokes fear in many of the farmers and compassion in a few. It is this mystery of human life that Malouf explores with such exquisite penetration and which makes him a joy to read."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Can one truely define what it means to be civilized and what it means to be savage? David Malouf focuses on questions like these in his novel \\"Remembering Babylon\\". The main character, Gemmy Fairley, is a British boy, who was washed ashore in the lands of the native inhabitants of Australia and taken in by them. Years later, Gemmy encounters a settlement of British colonizers, where he is taken in by the McIvor family.In the course of the novel, the reader is confronted with the feelings of different settlers concerning Gemmy and the native people of Australia. As he acts the way the natives of Australia do, the settlers cannot decide, whether Gemmy is truely British. In order to contrast their rascist behavior, Malouf gives the reader a background of the settlers. He relates their life stories in a moving manner, showing how the dreams and hopes that the settlers had before coming to Australia, have been shattered."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"I read this for a class on British Lit Post-WWII. It's one of those books that I know I wouldn't have picked up off a shelf on my own, but I enjoyed it. Malouf uses a lot of imagery to convey the emotions in both characters and the community as they cope in their own ways with Gemmy. A very interesting story about a white man who is lost overboard a ship as a child, and raised by the aborigines until he comes upon a settlement of whites. Definitely an intriguing look at race (he is known among the settlers as the \\"black-white man\\"), community, and identity."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"A coming-of-age/awakening/search-for-identity novel that moves beyond the angst felt in the search for truth/self to interesting modes of revelation and insights into human nature. The story is more complex than many novels because the revelations are multiple-each character develops new insights and ways of knowing. Other themes developed by Malouf in this novel deal with man-nature relationships; fear of of the unknown, the alien, or the misunderstood; and cultural bias, esp. toward other ways of thinking/knowing. A fine story that is rich in ideas."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"The book &quot;Remembering Babylon&quot; written by David Malouf takes place in Australia and describes the life from Gemmy who is a man born as a white but grow up in the bush as an Aborigine and then finally lives in a settlement of whites.I think this book is realy interesting because you get a view into a settlement and its problems. And especially the character of Gemmy and his relationship with the settlers are full of suspense because Gemmy and his relationship to the settlers creates a lot of problems.In my opinion the book is partly difficult to understand because there are al lot of switches in the narrative perspective and this is sometimes confusing."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Gemmy Fairley doesn't belong anywhere. Tossed from the sea upon a wild Australian beach, the boy is a curiosity to the indigenous natives who discover and allow him to tag along, learning their language and customs. A strange yearning assails his dreams, images, memories of a beginning, brutal people and things barely glimpsed.From a truly ignominious beginning, Gemmy schools himself to adapt to circumstances, intuiting acceptable behavior as necessary for survival. Throughout his wanderings with the Aborigines, he assumes the coloring of his surroundings, much as they do. But another voice, a distant curiosity calls Gemmy ever closer to the poverty-riddled settlers who view him as a threat. There is a life-defining moment for two young people, Lachlan and Janet, when they first see Gemmy, perched precariously atop a fence, held for a moment in time that marks their consciousness indelibly. Drawing Gemmy into their world, Lachlan is his mentor, Janet his friend, both protective of his innocence, forever fascinated with that first seminal glimpse.In such an intimate and hardscrabble community, where human connections insure survival, Gemmy is a freak, too strange to be perceived as non-threatening, white, but with the outward visage of a black. Fearful and superstitious, they draw away, repulsed. Eventually, Gemmy finds himself moving back into the bush, unable to manage the demands of such a borderline civilization. Years later, as adults, Lachlan and Janet deeply reconnect over their youthful remembrance, that slender thread that attached them to Gemmy for that short time in their young lives.The writing is powerful and beautifully rendered, with a sense of awareness that pulses with life. Immersed in nature's stark reality, words become feelings, thoughts merge with the heartbeat of humanity at its most vulnerable."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Lachlan Beattie, a boy of Queensland, encounters Gemmy Fairley, a ragged castaway. Gemmy had learned the speech of the Aborigines and he had lived among them. He was not quite a Kaspar Hauser, but nearly one. He was taken in by Jock and Ellen McIvor, Lachlan's aunt and uncle. Gemmy had jerking stammering fits. People wondered if he was a spy. He was white but had acquired a native look.George Abbot, the schoolmaster of the settlement, is very young, but likes to pretend that he is older. Abbot hates the petty tyrannies of his job, hitting the students with a ruler. He had been a charming child, but as an adult he was plain. Alisdair Robertson, a relative, had helped George as a child. He was the person who had urged George to go teach at the settlement. George felt that he had come to a not very promising end. Gemmy tagged after the children when they went to school. George Abbot was the sort of person who tried to maintain his proficiency in French by practicing.When Gemmy is seen speaking to two natives, he is considered to be disloyal and Jock McIvor's associates want him to leave the settlement. Jock seeks to resist mob action but as unexplained events begin to take place something has to happen to change Gemmy's circumstances. He is moved to the household of a bee keeper. Lachlan is surprised to learn that the school teacher is a visitor there, a place where two rather cultured women live.The minister, Frazier, sees that Gemmy is caught between two worlds and that he is a figure of the future. Gemmy had been a ratcatcher's helper. He had loved the ratcatcher. Smelling a piece of wood in furniture at his new abode with the bee keeper, memory of his past is triggered. After being a ratcatcher's boy, he was at sea for two or three years until he became a castaway. Lachlan, in manhood a politician, feels that Gemmy's presence has remained with him for his whole life.This novel is a part of the wonderful and growing literature of the British diaspora."},{"Title":"Remembering Babylon","review":"Remembering Babylon, I found wasn't aas good as I thought it was going to be.

I'm not a vegetarian but I do try to incorporate at least one vegetarian meal into my diet at least once a week. For the most part, I have been pleased with this recipe collection. The recipes run the gamut from very good (mushroom risotto/quesadillas)to just okay (quick meatless stroganoff) to downright awful (cottage crunch casserole/meatless loaf/macaroni special), but the recipe that puts this book over the top (for me at least) is the meatless shepherds pie. I've made it so many times, I know the recipe by heart. The only difference I make is that I use a different set of spices than those that she suggests. It is flavorful and very satisfying (however, I don't think it'll convert any carnivores). Most of the recipes are pretty easy to make and McCartney designates the vegan recipes with a V after the title. There is a set of various vegetarian seasonal menus at the begining of the book and McCartney provides some very interesting information on the vegetarian diet at the end of the book. A great book for the hardcore vegetarian and the vegetarian curious alike."},{"Title":"Linda's Kitchen: Simple and Inspiring Recipes for Meat-Less Meals","review":"This is one of the best practical cookbooks for vegetariancooking that I've read. Unlike most of its genre, this bookfocuses on foods that people really eat. Unlike books suchas the Moosewood series that seem to insist you becomeaccustomed to unfamiliar foods and cooking methods that willkeep you in the kitchen for hours, Linda McCartney's bookuses familiar tastes and preparation methods. Some of theingredients will be difficult for some to find, however.Since the recipes center around meat-like meals, many useingredients like TVP and prepackaged vegetarian products.The results are tasty, but be prepared to do some searchingin the grocery store. The recipes are very British -- theyuse lots of butter, cheeses, and are not low in fat. On theother hand, these recipes will be more attractive to thosewho want to make a gradual transition into vegetarianism, orsimply add a few meatless dishes to their weekly diet thattheir families will actually eat.

They included a comment she made to one of the editors to the effect that they should include more recipes like vegetarian lasagna. Her point, I believe, was to make vegetarian food seem like something comfortable that wouldn't require a lifestyle change.This book embodies that philosophy. Although there are some delicious things you may not have tried before (eggplant and red pepper melt- oh!), the book is filled with familiar favorites, including yorkshire pudding, stuffed peppers, stroganoff, moussaka, paella and, of course, lasagna (she spells it with an \\"e\\" at the end). It also includes a lot of Indian food and Mexican food, which gets its very own section (and why shouldn't it?).The recipes are mouth-watering, but I always judge a book on its soups and desserts. Those are wonderful as well. I literally had to get up yesterday to make myself some vegetable soups after looking at her recipes and pictures. You might want to as well. I feel the same way about her carrot cake recipe, which uses pureed carrots instead of grated carrots. I've been using that technique since I bought this book years ago, and I agree- it makes for a better, moister cake.Not all of the recipes are perfect. She calls for the use of a lot of raw eggs, and as I write the US is in the middle of an egg recall due to salmonella poisoning in over 1300 people. She also grates on my nerves when she uses the word \\"Oriental\\" in a few of her recipes.But none of those criticisms should keep you from this book, especially if you're a vegetarian who doesn't want to lose your traditional comfort foods."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"This book is a must have for every woman.

Read Darien's books and you'll have an entire happy family!"},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"First of all, unlike many, I do NOT believe that the wife is supposed to submit more than the husband is. If you read the Bible closely enough, you'll see that submission and sacrifice are required from BOTH spouses, not just the wife. If the wife alone were required to serve her husband and get nothing in return, every self-respecting woman in the world would be single. Second of all, even if you do believe that submission is the wife's duty, this is NOT the book to get! Please pay attention to the other negative reviews before reading this travesty of a book; even \\"submissive\\" wives hated it. I firmly believe that a wife is required to love, respect, and support her husband, but this book goes WAY beyond that. If your husband's not a Christian, don't read your Bible too much in front of him (or at all, if he really hates it) and don't share spiritual truth with him if he doesn't encourage it. Defer to his demands, even if this means going to a tavern. No fears, God will intervene by giving him a headache or something similar.I truly feel sorry for Cooper and the other women who believe they should be doormats, particularly the poor soul who gushed about the book and said that women are placed under men for a reason. Actually, that's not what God had in mind; note that He placed Eve BESIDE Adam, not beneath him. If you don't learn to think for yourself, honey, you're not going to get anywhere in life. Ladies, please do NOT be fooled by this book. Remember that it was written by a woman who still thinks she's in the 50's (check out her ridiculous hairdo on the back of the book if you don't believe me) and don't confuse it with the Christian doctrine, which isn't anything like it. I wish you a husband far worthier than the type described in this book.To the man who said this book is correct on the male perspective: If that's true, that's pretty darn sad, buddy. I don't know if you noticed, but Cooper described men as emotional infants and most men don't want that description. Also, just because lots of us women don't buy this garbage doesn't mean we don't want happy husbands. A real man doesn't want a robot; I suggest you keep that in mind."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"I used this book to try to save my marriage years ago.I just read an article about gaslighting...My ex was the MASTER of the gaslight..he made me think i was crazy.Before you take this book to heart please get outside advice from a therapist.This book caused me to allow many extra years of damage to my life and well being.

Recommend to married couples and singles getting ready to get married."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"I came on Amazon to buy this book for a friend and felt I should leave a positive review after being saddened by some of the negative reviews. I first read this book about 4 years ago and I regret not putting it into practice. Because of my stubbornness, our marriage has really been through it. There was a time I would have told you our marriage was great, but my husband later told me the truth on his end. Now, I can't help but see how I have played my part.I cannot argue with the principles laid out in this book and it saddens me how others do not see that as wives, we women have the opportunity to be just like Jesus...in truly being a servant, in holding our tongue rather than defending ourselves, in not doing our own will, etc.My only disappointment with the book: I am not against various Bible translations, but I did find some of the verses the author quoted way off even from the 4 versions of the Bible I have in my parallel Bible. I don't really understand why she did that.Sidenote: For those who disagree with Ms. Cooper's advice for a woman to not go to church if it displeases her husband - Going to church on Sundays has become a man-made tradition and it was not one of Jesus' commands. Followers of Jesus can fellowship anywhere on any day at any time, as she points out in the book. It is not a sin to not go to a man-made building on Sunday and there was never a case in the book where a woman sinned by obeying her husband. Going to a nightclub is hardly a sin although most people who go to those places do sin. It is definitely not a sin when a woman does not even want to be there but is instead going on behalf of her husband. So for those who might be turned off by those reviews, I suggest reading the book for yourself to see the context of situations and the cases where God intervened so a wife did not have to do something she really did not feel comfortable with."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"My marriage was in big trouble and I went to the libaray in our church and asked God to help me find guidance. He led me to this book and several others, but his book is where I found my answers. Like other readers, I was horrified at first. I spent my career breaking glass ceilings and fighting for the rights of women. Until recently was the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. Although I am feminine, I also enjoy working on my own car, building things in the garage and all manner of other things this book might not approve of.However, I DID find in this book the answer to my problem... humility and submission. My pride is choking our marriage.I am married to a Christian man who would never ask of me the things cited in the book and objected to in the reviews below, so I won't address those issues. However, that doesn't mean I haven't been robbing my husband of the things he needs to feel valued, loved and honored. The way I read this book, I don't have to STOP doing any of the things I love to do. It isn't fixing the car that robs my husband of his esteem, it's fixing the car on the last evening we have together before his next business trip, or refusing his help when he offers, or having a wrong attitude about his needs of any kind.Yes, it's 2005 and a few of her 1977 attitudes (including her hairdo on the back of the book) stuck in my craw, but I know that when I asked for help, God asked me to read and consider the message IN THIS BOOK. After reading it, I feel VERY convicted to honor my husband in much healthier ways. I am intelligent enough to know what applies to me, and God has shown me that humility and submission are part of my role as a wife - and that they are appropriate. God has given me a wise husband. I can submit to him with confidence.I came online to Amazon to buy my own copy and am excited to see a new edition beging published next month. I suspect we'll see some more \\"contemporary\\" approaches in the new edition."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"This book is definitely MUST reading for every Christian woman--married or single.

This book is very sound Biblically and can be the turning point for even the most difficult situation. I keep re-reading it so I will not forget anything and it amazes me how the content never seems to get stale. Order several copies for friends and family."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"I have never felt so strongly about a book that I felt necessary to give a review one way or the other, but I feel I must. Please read the last part about finding a better book if you're in a hurry.I am a spiritually mature Christian who struggled with the idea of submission like many of you. This book is NOT the answer.I had to read this book 3 times to make sure this wasn't a joke. Even my husband thought it was nuts.To be fair, she has some correct ideas about how not to beat down your man with criticism and to appreciate what he does, and advocates a more loving, sweet attitude.I also don't know where she got some of her Bible quotes. I checked 15 translations and they don't say what some of her quotes say.The danger comes in other junk: staying home from church and not reading your bible in front of him if he disapproves. What about our need to seek a closer relationship with Jesus?She also recommends being sweet and loving to him when he visits you if he moves out after cheating on you. No mention of the disease issues at all!You are not to say no to him for any reason (sex or otherwise). This could emasculate him and lead him to adultery or some other ruin. Hello! We are not responsible for their choices and they is not responsible for ours.She points out that you lose your femininity if you learn how to defend yourself. Getting a job is a no-no, even if he orders you to, which of course you must do. You must be financially and completely dependent on your husband.The part that really did me in was about going to a place of \\"lewd entertainment\\". You must be obedient, regardless of the humiliation. And what if he asks for a threesome? None of these extreme examples are practical and would be great ammunition for an abusive man. Abuse is never covered in this book - very irresponsible.This book doesn't give men enough credit and does not mention personal responsibility. Her instructions to curtail time with your family, friends and outside interests if he orders it are classic symptons of wife-battering.She also recommends lying to him, complimenting him on his beard even if you wish he'd shave it off - stupid stuff. If you hate the perfume he gives you, use lots and lots of it to make him sick of it.She contradicts herself too. Don't discipline the children; she says that's his job. Later says not to bother him with routine problems with the children.Silly stuff: \\"Sense\\" when your husband wants to make love so you can prepare your mind. Make your schedule flexible so you can be available to him morning, noon, and night. Do whatever he asks in bed. When he tells you to empty the garbage, drop whatever you're doing and do it and do it lovingly and gratefully.

First of all, this book is touted as \\"Biblical\\", but there are literally entire paragraphs passed off as Bible quotes that are NOWHERE in the Bible, merely somebody's (the author's?) spurious interpretations and extrapolations. ...Second, I don't know who this supposedly Christian lady hangs around with, but it sure seems like alot of her friends' husbands (and her own?) go to lewd nightclubs, watch dirty movies, indulge their midlife crises with motorcycles, stay out all night with no explanation, skip church and expect their wives to do the same, and other sinful behavior that wives are supposed to silently indulge without care or comment. The book is riddled with advice in dealing with such self-centered louts, and none of the advice has to do with refusing to accompany your husband into sinfulness, or refusing to even point out that his actions are sinful. Heck, you're not even supposed to ask questions if your husband stays out all night. Maybe the reason this book advocates such silence and self-abnegation on the part of wives is because these wives are married to hopelessly childish, self-centered jerks who haven't a prayer of becoming the godly, Christ-like men that Ephesians 5 calls THEM to be. The author gives the example of a woman who announced her decision to become submissive to her husband, who then tested her by demanding that they go to a lewd nightclub together. She swallowed her hurt and revulsion and agreed, but he came down with a violent headache and so they couldn't go. The author describes this as a victory, but totally avoids the sad point that he still WANTED to go, though he was prevented from doing so. Who wants a husband who would even suggest such things?The book claims that its purpose is to restore the husband as the head of the household, and yet describes men in infantalizing terms. For example, detailed instructions on complementing your husband's manliness are given, as are instructions to indulge him sexually even when you feel tired or ill, \\"trusting in God\\" to help you overcome your lack of interest so that he won't turn elsewhere for gratification. Making sure that you look appealing when he comes home in order to combat the temptations of attractive and stimulating women he meets at work is suggested. There is a subtle undercurrent of fear and anxiety in the book, namely that if you don't completely subjugate your every feeling and indulge your man's every whim, he will turn away or turn elsewhere. Also, while touting men as the leaders of the family, the examples she gives are husbands who seem utterly incapable of acting in a sacrificial Christlike way, protecting a woman, or shepherding a family.Wives are to be sub,issive to husbands, but husbands are also commanded to love their wives as Christ loves the Church. Remember Christ loved us FIRST-- the Bible says so! Also, Christ would never lead his bride the Church into sin. This book turns these Biblical concepts upside-down by basically stating that the state of the marriage is up to the woman, and that if we're lucky maybe our husbands will notice we exist as a result and stay home from the nightclub once in awhile. No Christlike husband capable of leadership would withhold love until his wife submits; it is the love which ENABLES the wife to confidently submit. No Christlike man would ask his wife to indulge him in sinful behavior; it is up to him to PROTECT HER from such behavior. This poor woman and every single woman friend she describes have very, very sad excuses for very UN-Christian marriages. I pity them."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"A female friend of mine gave this to my wife in hopes that it would help our failing marriage. My wife refused to read it, so I read it myself out of curiosity. At first, I was skeptical.

It soon became evident to me that not only did Mrs Cooper understand the male psyche, but she understood it even better than most men do! The book was 100% on target with everything it said.

One exercise was to make a list of the positive traits that attracted you to your spouse in the first place. When I hit page two, I realized that I was expecting the poor guy to meet my every need, and not appreciating him for the great guy he really was.I can't speak to the issue of abuse, as that definitely wasn't the problem in my marriage. What resulted from what I took from this book, was a marriage that is the envy of everyone we know. I can honestly say my husband is the best example of loving me as Christ loved the church. He is the most encouraging person and my greatest champion as I am his. We've been married 25 years now and people often ask us if we're newlyweds.There were certainly things in this book I didn't agree with, but for me, it helped me to set aside my selfish and immature expectations and understand that God never intended my husband to meet my every need, as only God can, and as a result of that new mindset, I was able to be a true partner to my husband."},{"Title":"You Can be the Wife of a Happy Husband","review":"I was on the verge of getting a divorce several years ago when the ladies of our church used an earlier verson of this book as a Bible study tool.

It doesn't have much replay value because the items included are of such low quality. The fingerprint ink & cards are terribly messy. The process of lifting prints off of objects within the house never worked at all - the dusting powder just wouldn't do the job it is intended to do. All it made was a huge mess.

Prior to Robbins, economics was thought of as the science that studies wealth. Robbins recast economics as the science that studies the allocation of scarce means among competing ends. This became the standard textbook definition of economics. Robbins also drew a sharp distinction between the efficiency issues of positive economics and the ethical issues of normative economics. Once again, this distinction is common in modern textbooks, and has been for decades. This distinction is a break from the three-way division of political economy into the value free positive science, the value laden normative part, and the third part: the art of political economy. Robbins paved the way for the \\"academic imperialism\\" of modern economics. Since economics is about ends and means, not just wealth, any instance where people choose is fair game for economists. Consequently, we now have the economic analysis of religion, the family and marriage, crime, sports... Gary Becker should have cited Robbins heavily.The Nature and Significance of Economic Science was also central in the discussion and propagation of the opportunity cost concept. Ricardo hinted at this concept. Menger more or less stated it. Weiser developed it thoroughly. Mises understood its full significance. But Robbins made opportunity cost the mainstream concept of economic costs (well, Davenport and Knight helped too...). Once again, the contents of Robbins' essay found their way into modern textbooks.Robbins also stressed that value free economics must be free of interpersonal comparisons of welfare. That is, we cannot measure consumer satisfaction across individuals. We cannot scientifically compare the economic welfare of one person to any other. Scientific comparisons of interpersonal economic welfare require caridinal measurement of consumer utility. Robbins makes a convincing case that consumer welfare can only be ranked ordinally, from most to least preferred. Interpersonal comparisons of welfare entail judgments of value on the part of anyone who makes such comparisons. As such, people who discuss the merits of transfer programs are definitely not speaking in terms of economic science, but are instead making moral claims or political statements. This is an important point because some economists try to pass off their opinions regarding income distribution as their professional opinions, rather than their personal opinions. Robbins knew better than to do such things.Robbins drew upon the work of Mises, Weiser, and Wicksteed in writing this book. The influence of Mises shows up most clearly in this first edition. The 1935 edition drifted away from these early influences. Robbins ultimately influenced professional economists to focus on allocation rather than human action. As such, we Austrians are critical of the book that popularized our ideas most effectively! Israel Kirzner sorted out the primary Austrian complaints in his book, The Economic Point of View. While economists can and will disagree regarding the finer points of this book, none can doubt its influence. The Nature and Significance of Economic Science is one of the twentieth centuries ten most important books on economics."},{"Title":"An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science","review":"The type of theory developed in this book is of basic importance for all students of social processes. The postulates of rational economics essentially stake out a claim to adequacy for a complete analysis of human behavior in terms of choice between uses of means in realizing ends, the laws of which are to be worked out in the form of a kind of theoretical mechanics with the notion of equilibrium as the fundamental concept. Robbins's work, a transplanting onto English soil of the Austrian or \\"neo-Austrian\\" economics, is an improvement, in many respects, on the traditional British-Classical doctrine, even taking the latter as already profoundly modified by subjective-value influences. But, only with qualifications can the book under notice be indorsed as a satisfactory treatment of its topic, for in spite of much insistence, of a rather too-much-protesting sort, on \\"precision,\\" and on being \\"scientific,\\" many of the positions taken fall considerably short of being thought out to definiteness and accuracy.In defining economics (of his particular brand-see below), Robbins makes an excellent start, taking his cue from a phrase of Cannan, \\"the fundamental conditions of wealth for isolated man and for society.\\" (\\"Wealth,\\" to Cannan, meant \\"economic well-being,\\" not marketable goods.) This starting-point leads to a characterization, first, of economic behavior from the standpoint of the individual. It is defined as behavior involving the employment of limited means having competing alternatives of use (p. 13). Secondly, what the economist actually talks about is \\"chiefly...the complications of exchange economy.\\" This second step is stated as an \\"admission,\\" presumably to emphasize the author's primary interest in the deeper and more universal principles; the discussion of economic principles in relation to other economic organization forms is brief and superficial. But the discussion of economic generalizations and of the significance of economic science in the second half of the work (chaps. iv - vi) does refer to society, and we miss any exposition of the way in which economic society is built out of economic individuals or of the background and character of the social problems. It might have been noted that a society made up of such individuals is essentially an aggregation of Crusoes, each on a separate economic island, interacting through a kind of \\"stumme Handel\\" and especially that at best such a group must have a fairly elaborate set of rules enforced either by religious sanctions or by some compulsive political machinery. And at best, such a society is both an intellectual and a moral monstrosity; the social problems we call economic do not have to do primarily with such an economic organization. I am rather surprised to read (pp. I39, I40) that the difficulties of society arise more from intellectual confusions in the minds of individuals than from conflicts of interests.With regard to basic concepts defined from an individual standpoint, there are also queries. The discussion centers in means and ends, with no recognition of the paradox of such concepts appearing in a pure science, no explanation of how a subject-matter \\"addicted\\" to ends and means can be treated in \\"scientific\\" terms. I should say that it simply cannot, if the terms are taken in their narrow and proper meaning. Robbins disavows ethics often enough and emphatically enough -- indeed, in our view, much too easily -- but he does not seem to see that the notion of a given \\"end\\" involves a value judgment also and its relation to conduct is a totally different thing, both from the cause and effect or \\"uniformity of sequence\\" of empirical science and from the logical sequences of mathematics. \\"Significances for action\\" are not identical with \\"stimuli to behavior\\" (p. 86) and \\"scales of valuation,\\" even purely individual, do not mechanically \\"determine particular transactions\\" (p. 87). (And the notion of end as \\"tendency\\" to action [p. 37] is a mere evasion.) Ends are properly emphasized as \\"given\\" but sometimes means are clearly in the same position, as they should be (p. 45), while at other times they seem to be contrasted (pp. 23, 37, etc.). Moreover, there is serious confusion regarding the nature of an \\"economic\\" end. We find quoted Fisher's admirable statement about the ultimately immaterial or \\"service\\" character of all income (pp. 8-9). But the discussion of the relation between technical and economic problems makes the distinction turn (following Hans Mayer, cf. p. 35) on the difference between unity and plurality of ends. Here all ends are thought of as physical. This is confused. Technical problems are physical, and either means or ends, independently of each other, may be either singular or plural. (Consider chemical analysis, synthesis, and double decomposition.) In an economic problem the essence of the matter is that both ends and means are unitary and measurable; the ultimate end in economic life is subjective -- we call it \\"utility\\"; but the notion of economy applies to either physical or subjective ends, provided all \\"ends\\" involved in a given problem are quantitatively comparable; that is, qualitatively, there is but one end. For economic theory, technical processes are also data, on the same plane as both means and ends; such discussion is concerned only with the allocation or apportioning aspect of choice between modes of using resources in realizing a single homogeneous end. Furthermore, as a \\"science\\" it treats the end as a mere concomitant automatically maximized by an actual course of behavior, eliminating all problematic character for the actor from the course of action. In this connection, too, exception must be taken to the statement (p. 30) that money is a \\"mere means\\": money is largely an end, subjectively and functionally; and, in the real, social sense of end, the goods and services bought with money are perhaps more largely means. (More accurately, they are \\"symbols\\" -- a far-reaching distinction, but impossible to discuss here.)Robbins's conception of economics is essentially the \\"utility mechanics\\" of Jevons, but there is no critical raising of the question of the applicability of mechanical categories to economics or of the dimensions of invariants of its phenomena corresponding to those of mechanical statics, dynamics and energetics, to say nothing of history defined as a non-mechanical residue of phenomena. It is narrow and arbitrary to limit \\"economic science\\" to the quasi-mathematical theory of price and utility. Several other \\"approaches\\" are fully as legitimate, and in fact are complementary to pure theory itself. The most important statement to be made regarding methodology is that the various conceptions or approaches can never be sharply separated. \\"Concepts without percepts are empty, percepts without concepts are blind,\\" and this dualism is by no means the whole story. Even in the treatment of a subject matter drawn from nature, the connection between truth (in more than one sense) and significance for action (also of several kinds) can never be left out of account. In the treatment of a social-human subject matter, this is far more the case, and, in fact, the lines between the different systems of concepts tend to dis- appear. Human \\"facts\\" are essentially and primarily both purposive and evaluative. In addition, they are essentially historical-\\"dynamic\\" in a sense, in comparison with which any mechanical or mathematical dynamics belongs definitely in the field of statics. It is simply impossible to describe empirically or analyze theoretically in the human field and be \\"objectively correct\\" without being clear as to the bearings upon one's statements of fundamental conceptions of individual and social policy in a broad sense. The categorical distinction between judgments of \\"is\\" and \\"ought\\" which Robbins stresses so often (p. 133) simply cannot be maintained. The attempt to do so results in such naive identities or petitiones principii as Robbins's statement (p. I27), \\"given the desirability of individual liberty, absence of regimentation, power of continuous initiative, there is strong reason for supposing that conformity to the criteria of free economic equilibrium constitutes a fulfillment of these norms,\\" on which there should be no point in commenting further. The predominantly critical character of these paragraphs is not to be interpreted as a negative judgment of the book. The substance as a whole of Robbins's treatment represents an important advance, and the space of this review could as easily have been filled with notation of particular features worthy of especial commendation."},{"Title":"Blood on the Forge","review":"William Attaway's BLOOD ON THE FORGE powerfully depicts both the Black migration to the industrial north after WWI and the startling hell-like environment of the vast iron &amp; steel works of the era. No other writer--novelist, sociologist, historian--has ever captured so well the compelling, visceral experience of the humans working these sacrificial jobs. As Attaway walks us through the vast furnace &amp; forge areas of the works, our own skin scorches along with that of his worker-protagonists. We become party to the daily struggle to survive the most appalling working conditions.This novel deserves a place on the highest level of our American esteem. It's tragic Attaway was unable to produce more work, since both his vision of the American experience and his fictive language were intense, revelatory and precious to anyone wishing to know and acknowledge this nation's true industrial and racial history."},{"Title":"Blood on the Forge","review":"Blood on the Forge tells the story of three brothers: Melody, who finds the music in every place and situation; Chinatown, who finds the humor; and Big Mat, a relentless worker who studies the Bible and tries to find an elusive inner peace. They work as sharecroppers in Kentucky, accustomed to poverty and racism, until circumstances brought on by Big Mat's quick temper compel their move to Pennsylvania, where they take jobs in a steel mill. Poverty is replaced by dangerous grueling labor that leaves them too exhausted to spend their wages on anything except alcohol, gambling, and whores. Racism is replaced by class division as black steelworkers join new immigrants from Ireland and Italy and Middle Europe, all viewed with disdain by those who inhabit the big houses overlooking the mill. By the novel's end, that conflict is defined by the workers' attempt to organize a union and by the owners' resort to violence to suppress that effort -- leaving the brothers caught in the middle of the conflict, and to some extent divided by it.Although racism and class struggle are important themes in the novel, the story is about much more than that. If is fundamentally the story of three very different brothers, bonded by family ties and shared lives, but torn apart by their unique experiences. Chinatown must cope with injuries inflicted by hot steel, leaving him feeling less than whole. Big Mat must cope with his own feelings of inadequacy, his inability to give the Mexican woman who moves in with him the moneyed lifestyle that she craves, a feeling he can only overcome with the sense of power he derives from violent behavior. As he struggles to find his music, Melody must cope with the desire he feels for the woman who is living with Big Mat, and with the secret he learns about her.Attaway tells the story from the perspectives of the brothers, using language that is eloquent in its simplicity. The story is powerful, sad and moving, unforgettable. At the end of the fast moving novel I literally said \\"Wow.\\""},{"Title":"Blood on the Forge","review":"After killing a dumb redneck who seemed not to have noticed that slavery had been outlawed half a century earlier Big Mat, together with his two brothers Melody and Chinatown, leave family and sharecropping and make their way to the steel mills of Pennsylvania. Here they metamorphose from \`n-----s' into \`coloreds' and graft alongside other migrant workers from the Ukraine, Italy and Ireland. It is not a pretty world: dog fights and gang rapes, murders and industrial fatalities; but at least they get money. Unbeknown by his brothers, Melody falls in love with an underage prostitute who instead takes up with the stronger Big Mat, indifferent to his wife back in Kentucky. The brothers, caught up in their own little, world fail to notice significant changes happening around them as their already hard lives tip into the abyss when union-boss conflict divides along racial lines. This book is a superb parable on the northward African-American migration, a social cataclysm that was to change the economic and cultural landscape of the United States and massively contribute to its future world dominance. Attaway was a contemporary of both Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison and was highly regarded by both. Naturalistic, fatalistic, powerful and poignant, Blood on the Forge is the equal in quality to Steinbeck at his best in its description of tough and pitiless migrant lives and is a true twentieth century classic."},{"Title":"Blood on the Forge","review":"Novels written in vernacular are difficult feats, and when written decades ago are often not a comfortable read. \\"It was a hungry craving yanking at his vitals\\" is an early example from this novel. But soon the oddity of the language fades away and the reader is presented with a character study of the three Moses brothers: Chinaman, Big Matt and Melody. The story starts on a hardscrabble farm in Kentucky \\"leased\\" to the Moses family from the landowner who keeps the accounts and somehow every year when the crops are harvested the sharecroppers owe yet more than the year before. The book opens soon after the brothers' mother died plowing the field, and the mule, leased from the landowner, continues plowing to the end of the field, dragging the corpse behind him. In a blind rage, a rage that fuels much of the momentum of the book, Big Matt kills the mule.This event inextricably leads to others, each precipitated by Big Matt's anger, and soon the brothers are sealed in a boxcar with innumerable other African-American men traveling (sneaking, actually) out of Kentucky into West Virginia. Because these men are a valuable commodity both for the foundry owners in West Virginia and the landowners in Kentucky, and neither will willing allow its chattel to be removed. \\"Always within him was the instinctive knowledge that he was being turned to white men's uses.\\"Each of the three brothers is carefully drawn, and we see how each reacts to the brutal forces of the mines and the lethargic life of half-starvation on the farm. Big Matt is the driving force throughout the book. Black as coal, huge and with endless energy that turns to blazing anger at the slightest provocation. \\"Coming from hate to a new kind of hate.\\" It is only his energy that keeps the brothers from starving in Kentucky, but the anger propelling them to the mines where each in his own way is devoured.While the dialog is vernacular, the narrator speaks in a straightforward voice briskly describing the world in which the brothers live. The mines are described as a Dantesque hell of fire and death. The various jobs are described vividly. Twelve hours of death defying work in a fiery cauldron each twenty-four hour period. And when the workers leave the plant they are confronted with a landscape of scarred earth unsuited for any use. Consumed in the fiery furnaces, the only earth remaining, the only people remaining, are the waste piles of slag and injured workers. The inhumanity of this process is vividly shown to be no better than the 'debt slave' economy of the South."},{"Title":"Blood on the Forge","review":"I was very happy to receive this book in good condition because it is a classic and I wanted a good copy for my collection of novels I wish to keep.

This allows you to memorize important vocabulary. Other than that it is just like Cupid and Psyche. But if you're an intermediate student like I am, it makes all the difference.Read this THEN Cupid and Psyche (my teacher made us read the latter first).

If you need to be convinced, try The Revolt of the Angels.An angel, Arcade, leaves heaven, comes to earth, uses his invisibility to steal books from a library, after which he joins a host of fallen brethren with plans to overthrow god. Fantastic? Think again. In the hands of France, the plot is a mere jot; he is more interested in expressing his contrarian view of the universe.His knowledge of history and religious texts is amply demonstrated; however the main draw is his cynical philosophy and his virtuosity in descriptions. When one of the angels delivers a tirade, the lifespan of the universe is captured in paragraphs: Original sin is a fable concocted by god, the Reformation was started Luther \\"all swollen with beer and theology,\\" and god's thunderbolt was stolen by Franklin. According to France, god foresees everything, yet is surprised by the most probable event. France is not interested in orthodoxy, this is not religious satire to make you laugh; this is one that causes you to painfully shake your head and smile.The conclusion is obvious, but it brings us back to reality - nothing will change. By the end of this impressive work of literature we discover only one angel is in revolt and it is not Arcade. It is Anatole France."},{"Title":"The revolt of the angels, (The works of Anatole France in English, ed. by the late Frederick Chapman, James Lewis May and Bernard Miall)","review":"There's a lot to work with in this idea. Angels exist on earth, lots of them, including many assigned duties as guardian angels. God's in his heaven, and all's right with the world.But, at the hands of master satirist France, all is not right with the world. The god in this story is a petty, tinhorn tyrant. He has arrogated himself power of life and death over this world's little beings, but with no true understanding of the clockwork perfection of even his assigned corner of this universe. Many of those angels on earth have defected, and are plotting an insurrection against that god's dictatorial rule. They secure funding, they stockpile bombs of horrific power, and they brace themselves for the struggle ahead.I'm no scholar of the French revolution, but one point of similarity leaps out: the rebels' near-total lack of plan for what happens after the current in-crowd is outed. And, once the angels take on some features of earthly flesh, they fall victim to many of the ills that human flesh is heir to. Those include love of money, love of women, and love of the anarchic plotting in itself.There's a lot to like in this novel by Nobel winner France, but also a few things that didn't work for me. France move his plot forward using an alternation of many viewpoints - a technique that works poorly for maintaining cohesion in a story. This translation, from 1914, is generally readable and enjoyable, but a few of its phrases seemed stilted by today's standards. And, although I enjoyed the narrative, I was not always sure how the family story of the d'Esparvieus matched the larger story around it. France makes up for any failings, of course, in his repartee, including some well-place barbs at America and Americans.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The revolt of the angels, (The works of Anatole France in English, ed. by the late Frederick Chapman, James Lewis May and Bernard Miall)","review":"Excellent, starts a bit slow but proves itself to be a tour de force of comic invention, emotional intensity and general creativity. The story appears for the first forty pages to be a setup for a rather dull society world with one Maurice the owner of a vast collection of books and discovering one of them to have gone missing. After a bit of by the numbers effort to see who might have taken it, Maurice is met by the being responsible. It's his guardian angel, and as the result of reading the rationalist literary text the angel has decided that religion and the bonds of heaven are tyranny, and sets about to spread emancipatory consciousness among the order of angels. The title of the book wasn't symbolic, it features the direct plot of the book, with lots of unexpected turns, good insights and general hilarity. The strength of the discordant relationship between Maurice and his ex-guardian angel could carry the book in themselves--there's lots of hilarious and surreal scenes like where Maurice tries (unsuccessfully) to preach the virtues of religion, or when he challenges the angel into a duel over an issue of personal honor. Ultimately the book's scale is a lot wider than just that aspect, and it benefits from it.Much of the book is a direct satire. It's from the early twentieth century and bits of this humor haven't aged well, but a lot of it has. For instance there's the effort by one angel to talk another into rebellion against the celestrial arrangement and the current social arrangement in France. The second angel protests, on the grounds that France needs no change and was already completely perfect. It then goes on a speech on how the main credit bank of Frane was particularly refined \\"as pure and chaste and the Holy Virgin.\\"The novel also has, late on, one of the most affecting inversions of Christian myth that I've seen. The text had previously established a gnostic worldview where the entity ruling by the name of God was a lying oppressor of less than ultimate power. It had also shown Satan and his followers to be free thinkers, who tried to defeat God from humanitarian altruist notions. Across the novel the new outbreak lead by Maurice's ex-guardian angel linked up with the old resistance and formede plans for a new front, gathering strength to a march against the status quo. In the last chapter Satan has a dream, whereby his invasion is successful, the God-being is cast down and he takes on the celestial throne. The scenario plays out longer, with Satan becoming more cold, distant and egotistical, remote from and callous towards the human suffering that motivated his earlier fighting. He starts to shroud himself in mystery and hierarchy and govern as a tyrant. Simultaneously, cast down from the seat of power and command, God begins to observe the suffering of the small people and has a turn towards compassion and activity. Satan awakes from the dream, sees that a successful invasion of Heaen would just switch roles, and calls off the attack, resolving to maintain his spirit of compassion and work to help in smaller ways. There's a basic attitude of decency built into this story that's rather affecting, combined with the very strong and narratively surprising ending tone of anti-militarism. Such moments, of which the above is only the culmination, establish a writer of great sensitivity and complexity as well as humor.The novel is enormously rewarding and entertaining. Proof that at least sometimes the Nobel Award for Literature wen into deserving hands. I'm definitely going to look up more of Anatole France's writings.Similar to and better than: Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry PratchettSimilar to and also better than: The Hunchback of Notre Dama by Victor Hugo"},{"Title":"The revolt of the angels, (The works of Anatole France in English, ed. by the late Frederick Chapman, James Lewis May and Bernard Miall)","review":"\\"The Revolt of the Angels\\" is a wonderful tale spun around the dichotomy of existence.

That goal is to craft a reassessment, which conveys to the reader that the desegregation of New Orleans public schools in the early 1960s was just as politically charged and fraught with controversy as any of the busing crises that came to the fore in the 1970s. Prior to Baker's reappraisal, the prevailing notion was that New Orleans public schools had been integrated in a reasonably peaceful fashion. In reality, the situation was far tenser, more complicated and explosive that many might have believed. Through evocative and engaging sketches of the major figures of New Orleans school desegregation, such as Creole lawyer A.P. Tureaud and courageous 5th Circuit Federal Judge J. Skelley Wright, Baker shows that, but for the actions of a few dedicated figures, New Orleans would have remained under the spell of Jim Crow. While Baker's portraits of Tureaud and Wright are wonderfully readable, her portrait of Judge Leander Perez, the race-baiting delta boss of Plaquemines Parish, is equally engrossing. The bold and conscientious actions of Tureaud and Wright are counterposed with the racist antics of Perez, who invested tremendous amounts of money in a public relations to enflame passions about desegregation. In sum, Baker has offered an accurate and insightful book that is a must for anyone interested in the regional history of America's civil rights movement."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"In THE COLOUR Rose Tremain creates a wonderful insightful portrait of individuals drawn into the lure of the New Zealand gold rush in the mid-19th century. Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone immigrate to the south island of New Zealand with Joseph's mother Lillian in order to begin a new life on a farm in the untamed countryside. As the Blackstone family settles down to their new life it soon becomes apparent that Joseph and Harriet's marriage is not based on any deep sense of love or devotion. In fact, they are becoming increasingly emotionally distant from each other each day. In addition each is fleeing from a disturbed past in Norfolk, England. After their first year in their new homestead their lives are forever changed when one day Joseph spots a glimpse of the colour, a New Zealand euphemism for the glimmer of gold, in their creek. Keeping is discovery a secret from his wife and mother Joseph soon abandons his dreams of farming and joins the thrust of the gold rush occurring throughout the country in his dreams of striking rich and securing a better life. After he leaves his farm and heads to the west coast Harriet is not far behind with her own agenda.This book is filled with wonderful images of the hard painstaking life of establishing a farm in the midst of the untamed New Zealand countryside. I felt sympathy for their ever-increasing struggles to remain on their farm. The descriptions of the harsh winters made me appreciate my warm apartment. One of the most interesting parts of this book dealt specifically with the gold rush. I was entranced by the descriptions of men buying mining licenses and claiming a spot of land in order to pan for gold while living in squalor - all the while clinging to the dream of striking rich and cashing in their fortunes. Also intriguing was the varied individuals who developed a business to accommodate the miners such as selling food, lodging, and sometimes their bodies. But despite my enjoyment of this section of this book, I was dismayed by the inclusion of the Maori woman and her connection with the little boy Edwin. Tremain appeared to feel a need to include a Maori storyline but it felt too forced for my own tastes. Furthermore, I felt the story of Pare didn't coincide well with the other storylines and her relationship with Edwin was eerie and unsettling. Regardless, THE COLOUR is a book that quickly grabs your attention and had me guessing the ending until the last couple of pages.

As the season changes, he lies awake, worrying. \\"He rebuilt it in his mind in the lee of a gentle hill. But he said nothing and did nothing. Days passed and weeks and the winter came, and the Cob House remained where it was, in the pathway of the annihilating winds.\\"It was their first winter. The earth under their boots was grey. The yellow tussock grass was salty with hail. In the violet clouds of afternoon lay the promise of a great winding sheet of snow.\\"With Joseph is his new wife, Harriet, 34, grateful to be saved from a stultifying spinsterhood as a governess, and his widowed mother, Lilian, who spends the cold days mending china, broken on its long journey from home. Uprooted, alienated by this inhospitable place, Lilian is miserable, but Joseph and Harriet both have ardent hopes.Joseph has fled England with a terrible secret to put behind him. He believes that strong, capable Harriet will renew him \\"and living sensibly with her, without loathing and without damage, then, he believed, his past would slowly vanish. He would be able to grow old without it, just as, if a man is careful, he can grow old without yearning.\\"But, a product of his times as well as his nature, he begins by stifling Harriet's dreams, first refusing her desire to help in building the Cob House (a structure meant to be temporary, built of mud and grass), then denying her longing for a child. Though growing disappointed with her marriage, Harriet retains her optimism. She surveys her hard-won garden with satisfaction or looks out at the distant mountains with wonder and desire.Then, during a thaw after a devastating snow storm, with Harriet gone to get help from their richer, more established neighbors, Joseph finds gold in their creek. It's not much, but it sends him into a frenzy of feverish work and secrecy. Instinctively he hides the dust he's found and takes pains to keep his work from Lilian and Harriet. Though he finds no more, his obsession builds and when gold is found on the other side of the mountains he seizes the chance to escape his failed life and eroding marriage.The narrative continues to move between characters, primarily Harriet and Joseph, but also Lilian, and their neighbors, the Orchards. Tremain brings alive the privations, filth, obsession and excitement of the Gold Rush; the struggles of the two women to maintain their Cob House holding in the face of an onslaught of New Zealand elements; the even, tranquil tenor of life at the Orchards' ranch.Eventually Harriet gets to fulfill her longing to go into the mountains, only to find them impassable. Joseph's failure to find gold inflames his self-absorption with hatred for the world, and young Edwin Orchard becomes afflicted with a strange, Maori-inspired illness. Harriet perseveres, obligated to meet up with Joseph one last time and the novel rises to new heights of cataclysm and a romantic obsession so intense it moves at times into the surreal.With its majestic, forbidding landscapes, passionate characters and precise imagery, \\"The Colour\\" is a beautifully written novel and a riveting read. Though the setting couldn't be further from the ultra-civilized 17th century royal court of her last novel, \\"Music &amp; Silence\\" (winner of the Whitbread Award), Tremain's deft depictions of self-defeating narcissism, and (on the other hand) the human longing for experience beyond the ordinary, remain elemental themes.Not that the book is without flaws. The mystical connection between Edwin Orchard and his Maori nurse is more alienating and puzzling than intriguing and Joseph seems, at times, overwrought. Quibbles aside, this is a masterful novel with a story, setting and characters that will stick with you long after the last page is turned."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is a beautiful book. The characters inhabit a world that is vibrant, emotionally alive, daring with a host of smells and textures that pour from the page into your heart.

With an unfurling of lives that is natural and compelling, Rose Tremain transports the reader into a world that is so real that the cold of the mountain torrents, and the unbearably heavy lightness of the snow, and the strange wonder of the birds and air and clouds sink into your bones and deep into your mind.Finishing this book was sweet sorrow. It all came full circle, but i didn't want to say goodbye. The world of The Colour, though, is as real as things seen only in the mind.

Accompanied by John's widowed mother, Lillian, a saturnine woman who longs to return to her beloved England, the three live together, separated by flimsy walls of calico. Sturdy and resourceful, Harriet falls in love with this open land, her flourishing vegetable garden one small retreat from an ill-suited marriage to a man either unwilling or unable to be a good husband.When John discovers a tiny amount of gold dust in their creek, he is infected with the fever for more, the same gold fever currently raging on the west coast of New Zealand. He hides this meager treasure from his wife, beginning a long process of denying the partnership with Harriet. His desire is single-minded and selfish, as dreams of wealth consume him. Disappointed with his negligible booty, John decides to board a ship and sail to the gold mines to seek his fortune and he intends to do so alone.John becomes one of the miners, obsessed and driven, common sense a thing of the past. With observations unflinching as a camera, Tremain captures the force of this lust, wherein the quest becomes the goal. Here is this drive, this need in exquisite detail, the lives of the miners and the claims that patchwork the landscape exposed like helpless suitors in pursuit of an inconstant lover. Meanwhile, purveyors of goods collect handsome amounts of currency, providing necessities to the miners, a cottage industry springing up wherever Gold Fever strikes.When Lillian dies and the newlywed's Cob House collapses from the onslaught of winter, Harriet goes after John to inform him of Lillian's death. Their first meeting is as awkward and formal as it was in the beginning of their relationship. Leaving John's camp, Harriet climbs higher, starting a claim near the produce garden of Chen Pao Yi, who sells his fresh vegetables to the miners.Given time, the miners would scramble over the land and wantonly purge it, without a thought to the devastation left in their wake. But, like a sleeping giant, New Zealand has only to shift while dreaming and the men are scattered and destroyed, the continent returned to its former pristine beauty. With one brutal stroke, nature intervenes, changing all their lives. Separated, John and Harriet struggle to survive and it is clear that John is the glass half empty, while Harriet is certainly the glass half full. Harriet enters a period of awakening, cherishing each moment as it comes, while John is tormented by loss and self-pity. And the gardener, Pao Yi, is fortunate as well, for he is essentially the water, without need of a glass at all, inhabiting his world with quiet acquiescence.Tremain is one of those accomplished writers who fleshes out her characters, all the trivial moments and secret longings that give them depth and believability, allowing the reader to understand these people in their flawed humanity. The colour, the gold, changes John, Harriet and Pao Yi intimately, each indelibly marked by this vast and awesome landscape.

I am in the process of buying all of her works! If pressed, I couldn't tell you which I liked best. Each one wove its own intricate tapestry and connected with a part of my heart and mind. It would be like asking who your favorite child was... until I was a mother, I would say 'there HAS to be a favorite', but now that I have my own tykes, I understand. Each is special and lovely in individual ways.The characters are complicated. You loathe one moment, but understanding prevails, and you can see the inner struggles and hurt, even as you steam. Though much less complicated than the others, in this story, my favorite character was/is Edwin. I wanted to snuggle him and protect him.Tremain has a wonderful, exquisite gift for writing. I was telling my husband that reading her books is akin to eating... it just leaves you 'full'. Each sentence is meant to be savored and enjoyed. While reading in bed one night, my husband asked me to read a sentence as an example of what I was referring to (this whole eating analody didn't sink in with him)... I didn't even have to search; I simply read the next sentence.Her books elicit in me such a profound sense of introspection and objectivity about others around me. For through the words of Rose Tremain, I am allowed to see into the hearts and lives of others, as if they actually were present and real. That I think of these characters even now, through many other novels, is deeply profound.The only downside is that now, I crave her work. I am anxiously awaiting my next novel and plan to devour it with relish..."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"An historical novel set in New Zealand, there is much here that lays to rest the romance of the pioneer life.

The cob house is especially drafty and cold because John would not listen to anyone's advice and has placed the house in the most disadvantageous place possible. You know from the start that this trio is in for trouble.After the death of his debt-ridden father, John sells everything remaining when the debt collectors are done with it and takes his mother and new bride to the opposite side of the world for a fresh start. It is the mid-19th century and New Zealand seems as good a place as any to start a farm. But John's decisions are weirdly off-kilter, making everything even harder than it need be. Lilian plots her escape, and Harriet wonders what happened to the fleeting bliss she and her new husband knew while preparing to emigrate. Something is wrong here, something that is exacerbated by the discovery of gold-\\"the colour\\" of the title.This is a rich and mysterious novel, a place where grueling days of sodbusting meet the cloudy mountains of a dreamtime. Rose Tremain has the ability to imbue her story with the kind of deep emotion that cannot be described and do it in a most readable fashion. The setting and the characters of \\"The Colour \\" all ring true, including the mystical ties between an English child and a Maori woman. This is an worthy addition to Rose Tremain's earlier novels, which are worth checking out if you haven't done so already. Her books are notable for their strong historical detail and unusual emotional frisson. ---Reviewed by Candace Siegle"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is set in 1860s New Zealand, a time of mad rush for gold as well as nation-building fueled by heavy immigration. Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone arrive from England with Joseph's widowed mother Lillian in tow. Joseph acquires some land, builds a temporary house, and they begin the work of establishing a farm. But Joseph is distracted by gold fever after finding some of \\"the colour,\\" and he is haunted by memories of the heinous act that led to his flight from England.Meanwhile, Harriet comes to regret hastily marrying a man she barely knew. He was her ticket to something new and exciting, but she finds she cannot love or even like her parsimonious, affectionless husband. She is smarter and more resourceful than Joseph, and he resents her for it.Eventually, the Gold Rush leads both Joseph and Harriet into experiences that test their mettle in ways they never could have guessed at when they dreamed of a new life in a new land. Joseph is found sorely lacking in character and fortitude, while Harriet discovers her hidden reserves of strength, determination, and self-sufficiency.This is a rather meditative and often melancholic work. Rose Tremain gets deep inside the hearts and minds of the characters, sifting through their hopes and despairs and secret motivations. This is where her writing really shines.I identified most strongly with Harriet. I could appreciate her growing desire for solitude, her love of animals and unbounded Nature, and her ability to go with the flow in a practical way. I was glad that her practical acceptance was eventually rewarded, and I can see her living out her future in a contentment very different from the one she'd envisioned.As for Joseph Blackstone, I think he's a weak and pathetic excuse for a man. He doesn't recognize the treasure he has in Harriet and doesn't deserve her. He has a stinginess of spirit that pervades every relationship and endeavour of his life. He sees other people only as stepping stones or obstacles to his own selfish ends, and he's utterly lacking in self-knowledge.The \\"supporting cast\\" of characters is also very memorable. There's Pao Yi, the gentle Chinese vegetable seller with his makeshift opium den. And the robust, enthusiastic, generous Toby and Dorothy Orchard on their very successful sheep run. And also Pare, the Maori woman caught alone between the two worlds, desperately wanting to do right by everyone, white or native.I enjoyed moving through this story at a slower than usual pace, and I strongly recommend it for the character studies as well as a rich introduction to historical New Zealand."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Strong women may not usually capture the centre of attention in a wild west survival story - it's a men's world after all. Yet, Harriet deserves her spotlight! Set against the background of New Zealand's gold rush in the 1860s, Rose Tremain has crafted a memorable, vividly coloured historical drama, that revolves around immigrants Joseph Blackstone and his new wife, Harriet. New Zealand's spectacular landscapes and the country's havoc creating extreme weather vagaries, powerfully evoked throughout the novel, are merged as an integral part into the story and adding to its sense of drama.The young couple, together with Joseph's mother, Lillian, embark on a farm life that none are prepared for. Tensions abound as the precariousness of their survival becomes evident, in particular during their first winter in the wilds around Christchurch. Three isolated and solitary people, each is preoccupied with attempting to overcome unresolved issues of their past life back in Norfolk, England. Joseph hides some shameful crime from his former life that comes back to haunt him with increasing intensity and is revealed to the reader in small portions. His secret is isolating him even more from his wife in particular. He becomes wary of his wife's positive attitude and growing self-confidence - \\"a woman as tall as he\\". When, by their creek, he discovers a few specks of gold, the 'colour', he is ecstatic and frantically searches for more. While no more gold is found and he manages to hide his find from his wife, his obsession can no longer be contained. He abandons the faltering farm and declares that joining the new wave of gold diggers on the other side of the country will be their financial rescue and salvation.Harriet, while still expecting ongoing domestic contentment, has also been changing. Discovering Joseph's gold secret adds to her increasing disenchantment with her current life. Tremain sensitively captures Harriet's character and evolving personality. She conveys the new sense of confidence that sees Harriet blossom and explore new and sustaining friendships in the neighbourhood. Eventually, the young woman decides that seeking clarification in her relationship to Joseph will be essential for her own future. She embarks on a journey across the mountain to the South Island to find her husband among the gold diggers. The author's description of Harriet, the solitary woman on a horse, in the midst of a wild bunch of rough and reckless diggers is vivid and shows Tremain's deep empathy for the fate of the young woman.Harriet had agreed to undertake another task during her solitary quest across the country: her young friend Edwin, gifted with unusual spiritual powers and in something resembling a mental dialogue with his former Maori nanny, Pare, needs Harriet to find her in the mountains. It is a life and death situation. While the sub-plot of Edwin and Pare moves the story possibly a bit too much into magical realism, the rest of the narrative is very strongly grounded in the realities of the time. Tremain's detailed description of the desolate living conditions that the diggers endure, their fixation to find \\"a homeward bounder\\" of gold that would relieve them, in one stroke, from all their worries and suffering, makes gloomy reading. Some characters, though, stand out, exquisitely captured by the author: young Will Sefton, a street urchin transported into the diggers' camps and especially Chen Pao Yi. Pao Yi came from China to seek his fortune, less as a gold digger than as a gardener and supplier of essentials to the different camps along the river. His life stands in stark contrast to that of the diggers. And then, one day, a sudden natural disaster threatens the survival of all those digging and living along the river and its vicinity... There is a moral undertone to the novel: in the end, those individuals who are least obsessed with the 'colour' have the author's attention and they have the best chance to gain the most in terms of humanity, dignity and happiness.

There were some details that just did not make much sense and seemed just to serve to push the story along. I still do not know what was the purpose of including the detail about the spiritual connection between the little boy Edwin and his Maori nurse. Was it only to give the sense of it being a 'Kiwi' book and not some other gold rush country? Also I am still unsure why Joseph, who appeared at the beginning of the book a dependable kind of chap set on making a go of a farm on the other side of the world, would suddenly just abandon it, his wife and mother to hit the goldfields in a case of gold fever. But then again maybe that is the point of the book."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"From the get-go, this book has two rare literary features going for it: one, it's set in New Zealand (and how many other books are set in New Zealand?), and two, it takes place during the New Zealand gold rush of the 1800's (yes, there was a New Zealand gold rush in the 1800's!). From page one, these two aspects alone, coupled with Tremain's simplistic yet powerful writing style, grab the reader's attention and demand that pages be turned.The story centers around a newlywed couple from England who decide to start their life anew- along with the husband's widowed mother- in the wilds of New Zealand, a country that is in many ways the opposite from that which they come. Unprepared for the extreme seasons and the difficulties of daily living, the husband decides to head to the treacherous west coast of New Zealand to join the gold rush once he discovers traces of gold (the colour of the title) on his own property. As the action follows the husband, and soon thereafter the wife, west towards the dangerous gold fields, several different characters find their way into the drama- fellow Englishmen, gold seekers, New Zealand natives, Chinese merchants- providing a more complete portrait of this hectic time in the history of a country not well documented in popular literature.What starts out as a straightforward yet powerful story of one couple's battle against nature (reminiscent of Knut Hamsen's early 20th century must read novel, \\"Growth of the Soil\\"), starts to get bogged down by the weight of history as Tremain attempts to stay true to the reality of the harsh gold rush. While many of the characters are memorable, at times it seems like there are too many fighting for attention, and what should be the heart of the story- two strangers trying to survive in a strange land- begins to lose out to side plots and minor detours.Rose Tremain is an excellent writer, and the topic and setting alone- New Zealand and its gold rush- are enough to make this novel worth reading. If, however, she had invested more time with her central characters and kept them at the heart of the action, \\"The Colour\\" would have been a great book, instead of merely a really good one."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is, on the surface, the story of a man and woman who flee England for different reasons to New Zealand in order to make their fortune. What could have been an ordinary, but hard life and... perhaps one of satisfaction and eventual comfort is taken away by a smattering of gold dust that appears in a trench that the man begins to build.And so the fever for gold takes root. Joseph and Harriet are married and living with Joseph's mother in \\"The Cob House\\", a rickety, temporary home built by Joseph in a place it should not have been. Joseph is fleeing from his past, and Harriet is fleeing toward a future promise of independence. Joseph hides crippling secrets and Harriet, in her pursuit of her dream, begins to uncover them.There were a few surprises for me in this book; the betrayal of loved ones, superstitions of the native New Zealand people, the love of a mother for her child and the ultimate disappointment it can bring. This wasn't a feel good book, but instead it was a real, gritty but still sensual picture of the Gold Rush taking place in New Zealand during the 1860's.It's very easy to see why this book made it to the 1001 Books to Read Before you Die list as it was an experience that, if I had not been exposed to the list, I probably would have never had. It's fascinating to me the questions and curiosity that can spark from reading a book about an event that you had no previous knowledge of."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Rose Tremain is a weaver of stories.

Selfishness, greed, and other deadly sins move the character Joseph to despicable deeds--so unlike his wife, &quot;Hal-yet&quot; who yearns for the love of being free of the world of 19th century England. The New Zealand landscape comes alive with its aggressiveness in the winter: imagine a snow so deep, cold and ravaging that it can.....Greed has to be a character in the novel as it pushes the plot to an unbelievable ending....why wasn't he killed instead of....What a movie this book would make!!!!"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"I have to say that I was surpised how much I liked this book. It kept me hooked and I couldn't wait to find out how it all turned out. I think it's a relevant narrative on the role \\"stuff\\" (i.e. material possesions) has in our lives. It's got great characters and is a really interesting story.(Sorry, I'm not going to deliver a page-long essay - you'll have to read it yourself!)"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The title of Rose Tremain's new novel refers to the glint of gold. Set during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand, every character in the book is somehow touched by the crazed hunt for gold that eclipses all other possible occupations as the land is overrun by desperate miners and those who cater to them. It's a harsh world, driven by greed and deprivation, and utterly alien to the British newcomers, whose slender dreams are not strong enough to support their lack of knowledge and preparation.Joseph Blackstone tries to outrun a horrible, tragic secret by marrying and moving his new wife, Harriet, and his mother, Lilian, to New Zealand and starting a farm. These three traveling companions are not particularly well-matched: Lilian finds the adjustment from refined Englishwoman to farm work in a foreign country to be very difficult; Harriet is forced to realize that she does not love her new husband enough to make a success of their hard new life; and Joseph just isn't resourceful enough to adapt to the strange demands of his new situation. Mining for gold and making a quick fortune seem like an easy solution to their insurmountable problems. Other settlers have done so, and facing up to failure in the midst of others' successes adds a particularly bitter tone to Joseph's experiences.Joseph abandons his struggling farm and makes his way to the mining fields. This decision informs the fate of all three, and leads to surprising new developments. Joseph plummets to new levels of misery and disappointment in the mines, as success continues to elude him and his dark side reasserts itself. Harriet discovers unsuspected strengths; her bravery and compassion lead to bold choices and adventures. Lilian finds an unlikely, brief peace, but her death requires Harriet to search for Joseph in the mines, just in time for a catastrophic flood that annihilates the entire operation and changes the Blackstones' fortunes again.The symbolism isn't difficult to understand. Gold represents success and the newcomers' ambition to improve their grim, practically hopeless lots. But ambition can be a complex compulsion and Rose Tremain deftly explores what makes these people happy, what they really want, and what they will do to fulfill their dreams. It's interesting that it's never the gold per se that fuels them, but what even a little money will allow them to do. Prosperity, security, a new start, or amends for an old crime --- these things are more precious and require sacrifices.--- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"All of the characters in this book are believeable although not necessarily likeable. Harriet has a strength about her that was necessary if a woman was to survive during these hard times. Even her mother-in-law Lillian, who at first meeting appears to be weak and self-centered learns to adapt to the hard circumstances of their life. Joseph is a complex, distant, and distrusting man filled with a guilt that he himself does not seem to understand. The setting of New Zealand with its rugged terrain seems to almost become a character. All of the realistic and harsh aspects of this novel pulled me into the story. However, the mysterious &quot;spiritual&quot; world of the Maori nurse and her relationship to young Edwin seems out of place in the story. I was disappointed in this aspect of the book. The contrast between how the Maori reacted to the environment around them and how the English settlers reacted could have better developed. Overall, a really good historical fiction read"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is a well-written, engaging work of historical fiction, set in 1860's New Zealand. It reminded me of Allende's Daughter of Fortune and Smiley's The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton, which are set around the same time period (although in different parts of the world) and have some similar characters and situations, but without being so similar as to feel derivative. Like those books, it also has some plotting issues, but is good enough to be worth a read anyway.Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone arrive in New Zealand intending to start over; each married the other hoping for a new life, although they're barely acquainted. With Joseph's mother Lilian, they buy some land, build a house out of cob, and intend to start farming, but events don't go as planned. Then a gold rush comes along and changes everything.The Colour is on the more literary end of historical fiction: while it tells an engaging story, the pacing is not especially quick and much time is spent on character development, which is well-done. Joseph is fairly useless, but Tremain does a good job of writing him in such a way that readers can sympathize somewhat (where, if we didn't have his viewpoint, he would likely come across as an antagonist). Harriet is more traditionally likeable, but complex. Lilian might at first seem like a stock obnoxious mother-in-law character, but soon becomes much more well-rounded.The historical detail is worked into the story well, and there's a good sense of place with some evocative descriptions (although one key setting--the Hurunui gorge--is left almost entirely to the reader's imagination, as if it were intended to be more metaphorical than real). And the writing is good. There's something opaque about it, though: scenes that seem intended to have some great symbolic or metaphorical meaning that was not evident to me. Maybe the point was that life doesn't always make sense or turn out well--it's a melancholy book--but there's something rather distancing about Tremain's vision or her writing style that I didn't feel I entirely understood.My other issue with the book is plot-related. Toward the end, a romance comes out of nowhere, as if the author suddenly realized the book had no love story and threw one in, but without bothering to integrate it into the rest of the story. And there are a couple of secondary characters who have their own minor plotlines, but don't contribute much, seemingly there more to add ethnic color than anything else.Overall though, I did enjoy this book and would recommend it as a good work of historical fiction--if more melancholy and less willing to give up its secrets than the typical fare."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Rush, don't walk or even run, to buy this book! In this magnificent novel of the New Zealand gold rush of the 1860s, epic in scope but intimate in texture, Rose Tremain shows a power that her most recent book,THE ROAD HOME, only hints at, although her central concern of humanity triumphing through struggle remains the same.\\"The colour\\" is the miners' term for that gleam of gold that may -- or may not -- indicate the presence of a seam. It is a madness, a seduction that seldom brings satisfaction. Joseph Blackstone, newly arrived from England, glimpses the colour by a stream on the hardscrabble property he has bought near Christchurch on the east coast of the South Island. It seduces him into scanting on the proper establishment of his farm, failing to replace the temporary sod house by a permanent structure fit for his mother and his new wife, who have accompanied him from Norfolk. It leads him to join the gold rush on the inhospitable west coast of the island, leaving the women to fend for themselves.Joseph -- compulsive, driven, and pursued by an old guilt -- is not presented as a very sympathetic character. That role is given to Harriet, his wife. A former governess with a taste for adventure, she yearns for some means of proving herself, and ensuing events give her opportunities aplenty. She emerges as one of those strong pioneer women without whom none of the great nineteenth-century expansions would have been possible. But she is also a person of great sensitivity, with a true gift for friendship. It is she who, at her lowest ebb, forms a connection with the Orchards, owners of a successful sheep ranch nearby, finding a place in the life of their family that she is denied in her own. She is also a woman with strong emotional and physical needs; the chapter in which these are finally requited, in the most unexpected fashion, brought me to tears.And what of \\"the colour\\"? Gold is found and gold is lost, but the truly sympathetic characters in the book are those who do not make gold their god. The novel is framed by the mystery and awe of an untamed country (and its original people) on the one hand, and by the simple truths of everyday living on the other. At its heart, it is about love -- love denied in the usual ways, but triumphing in unexpected ones. Not since the novels of Jane Urquhart (THE STONE CARVERSand especiallyA MAP OF GLASS), writing about pioneers in Canada at the opposite end of the globe, have I read anything of this kind that has moved me so deeply."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour, a novel by Rose Tremain, tells an epic story against the backdrop of great events and a stunning landscape. James and Harriet Blackstone have left Norfolk, England, to make a new life in the South island of New Zealand. They have built a somewhat makeshift house called the Cob and are prepared to eke out a subsistence from the mixed though meagre blessings that the land and climate can offer. Their marriage might not be loveless, but often both have to search very deep indeed to find something that might approach their individually desired contentment. There is a history we learn, especially on Joseph's side, a history in Norfolk which may have prompted the decision to leave.While her husband is hard-working, he is rather secretive by nature. Harriet, on the other hand, is patient, diligent and long-suffering. She is also innovative, strong and honest. She relates to her mother-in-law, Lillian, who has accompanied them to their new lives, and to her neighbours, whose little son becomes especially important in her own childless life. Joseph's mother, meanwhile, will clearly never settle in these unfamiliar surroundings and there are tensions to overcome.When news of gold in the region stimulate a rush, Joseph stakes a claim, hides his interests in the same way that he hides his emotions, and tries to make his fortune. Eventually his independence, his insistence on self-reliance, becomes his downfall. His life amongst the other prospectors and the suppliers of services that are attracted to their needs is beautifully described.Harriet, however, is eventually more resourceful. She takes it upon herself to trace a Maori girl whose input to a little boy's life could prove crucial. Her search takes her across cultures as well as across the landscape and, eventually, she discovers things of her own, things that endure.The Colour is a beautiful book that does not, however, achieve the total success it promises. Somehow, its whole is rather less than the sum of its parts. The tale and its characters are all beautifully drawn, but the historical perspective, the feel for landscape and the crossing of culture all fall a little short. These are minor criticisms, however, of a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The story is set in the late 1800's. Joseph Blackstone flees England with his new wife Harriet and his aging Mother in tow. He was looking to start a new life in New Zealand and flee from a darkness that clouds his conscience and existence. On the other hand, Harriet was restless and was sick of her humdrum life as a governess -\\"weary of owning nothing and going nowhere and spending her days by other people's meager fires. He wooed her with dreams of escape. She sat on the heart rug with her head on his knee and he described to her the paradise he would create on the other side of the world. It was his words which made her cling to him when he touched her.\\"Joseph buys uncultivated land in rugged New Zealand and constructs a humble home out of cob (lumps of clay and dirt) with his remaining capital. They intend to raise livestock and crops however Joseph happens to find gold in a creek running through his property - and begins to pan on the sly - not sharing his secret with his wife and Mother. Joseph and Harriet drift apart - what little drifting there was to be from a marriage that was hastily arranged - with love not being at the core of the union.Joseph eventually finds little Colour on his property and decides to abandon his mother and wife to join the gold rush. The story moves on to depict the struggles of Joseph finding gold - circumstances leading to Harriet to travel to join Joseph and the gold rush and engaging story developments that pull you along to the finish.Author's imagery throughout the novel is spectacular:\\"But Joseph understood that the men of a gold rush were like moths, going towards a golden light, and in time - inevitably - that light began to die, and so they hurried blindly on to the next and the next, always hopeful, but always aware of the enormity of the pursuing dark.\\"The main characters' introspection is woven through a terrific story:\\"Harriet preferred not to think about Joseph. She discovered that almost every memory she had of him produced in her a feeling of disquiet. Though she had to work harder, she found life much easier without him.\\"The book is alive - you smell the smells, you feel the emotions, your skin tingles with the heat and cold, your body aches with the hardships. Tremain is a master storyteller who puts you on-site as the story unfolds and she takes you along the journey with the principal characters. Great story..."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Three generations of men in my family have been/are involved in the gold mining industry. When I found a novel by Rose Tremain, a favourite author, about the 19th century gold rush of New Zealand, I had to buy it. And I'm glad I did!Whether she's describing the harsh wilderness that awaits the newly-wed English couple, Harriet and Joseph Blackstone, and Joseph's mother Lilian, on their arrival; the dangerous man-made wilderness of a mining camp, or the toll both take on the human psyche, stripping away all inessentials and reducing individuals to their most basic nature, Tremain's writing doesn't disappoint.With subtle twists and turns, the characters that inhabit this story must face deep truths about themselves. Those, like Joseph, who at first appear strong and reliable, disintegrate under the raw influence of the colour (gold) and their own secrets (Joseph's relationships with both Rebecca and Will are excruciatingly revealing.) Others, like Harriet, discover unexpected inner fortitude, while Chen Pao Yi, the Chinese vegetable peddler, reveals a quiet strength and sensitivity that is Harriet's salvation.Tremain's skill comes to the fore in her characterisations: although the cast of secondary characters is at times overwhelming, each character is drawn with such exquisite talent that their world is captivating.Without any overt moralising, THE COLOUR ends with a clear message: those who face life with a sense of entitlement (whether based on their gender, race, social status or sense of victimhood) will find life futile and meaningless, while those who face life's challenges with hope, courage and kindness will prosper both spiritually and materially.Tremain has written a novel that is both profound and entertaining. A remarkable achievement.(my paperback edition has a different cover)"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Having lived in Hokitika on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand, this book was of interest.

Jenny Patrick does the West Coast stuff much better."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I've read reviews of this series that have criticized Ms. Butler for having such a bleak view of the future and I agree that her vision for the next 50 years isn't easy to swallow. She tends to focus her work more on societal deterioration and not so much on technological advances like so many other sci-fi writers. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy novels like Neal Stephenson's &quot;Diamond Age&quot; but it didn't encourage me to run out and get a Computer Science M.A., reading this book by Ocativia Butler made me think about my community and scrutinize the things I wasn't doing to improve it. Yes, at times &quot;Parable&quot; is hard to read, but it has a big enough dose of reality to serve as a much needed wake-up call to humanity. There is definitely more to life than IPOs and open source software! As a Black woman I also enjoyed that Butler is the ONLY sci-fi writer I've read that knows the meaning of the word DIVERSITY. The main characters in her books are always Black women but they don't live in an all-Black world. Butler is always careful to include characters of all hues and nationalities. I can't recommend this book enough. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I read Parable of the Sower and I felt overwhelmed with thought and visions of the future and I didn't want it to end.

I strongly recommend this book to everyone but especially if you are looking for a read that will feed your mind and stimulate you intellectually.....One complaint since the main character Lauren was creating a new way of thinking via Earthseed at times I felt as if I were reading one of those &quot;power for living type books&quot; and it got to be a bit much at times....

Strangely, however, it took me 4 weeks to read, partially because it is a painful rendering of a very plausible future and partly because my life does not allow for much leisure reading. She takes you down and down and down with always glimmers of hope through Earthseed which is a perfect description of human beings struggle to understand life and spirit and hope and what the future holds. A necessary multiple read as there are so many parables and parallels with other literature and real life events. I appreciate the integrity she apparently puts into the writing . A must read!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The Parable of the Talents is the story of a woman attempting to maintain stability in a world of anarchy. I found it to be at first intriguing and promising, then it became absolutely unbearable, and then refreshing, surprising, and enlightening. Although Butler is a powerful storyteller, she lacks in several areas and this novel is significantly flawed.My problem with Parable of the Talents wholeheartedly began and remained with the people of Acorn, and with Acorn itself. There were way too many characters and families that Butler threw in the story purely for exemplification-they offered absolutely nothing else. Instead of trying to unsuccessfully weave all of these characters into the story, it would have been better to read into a few more well developed characters, leaving the majority of the group nameless. I've noticed that Butler does this in her other work as well and can't understand why. The characters are neither allegorical nor satirical, just a jumble of names and brief physical descriptions that add absolutely nothing to the story.The very long-winded narrative of the Acorn's daily activities served no other purpose than to show Acorn's philosophy and way of life, which could have been done in a few chapters. The endless chapters narrating the Acorn lifestyle certainly didn't broaden or flesh out any of the other characters, including Olamina. In addition, the never-ending focus on the doctrines of Earthseed for the first 200 hundred or so pages became very preachy and didatic. The excessive lyrics from 'Earthseed' were completely uneccessary. Butler even admits in her afterword that she had to keep \\"rewriting the first 150 pages or so of Talents and heading up one blind alley or another...I couldn't seem to tell Olamina's story no matter how hard I tried.\\"Olamina's need to always improve and change was an interesting one and was well manifested in her creation of Earthseed, but it her motives in general were never explained. It was obvious that she wanted to create a progressive group of people who were realistic about 'religion' and had a logical explanation for the ins and outs of life, which is and was appealing, but I kept searching for another reason for Olamina's obsession with her own controlling strength and independence, and never found one. After reading Octavia Butler's afterword, it became obvious to me that Olamina, Acorn, and Earthseed represented Octavia Butler's own values and motivations, which offered me a bit more insight into the character of Olamina. It would be interesting to research exactly how much of Butler's own personality is reflected in her female protagonists and other leading characters.Despite my griping, I am still impressed with Octavia Butler's mastery of illustrating the follies of human nature and what it breeds. I somewhat enjoyed Bloodchild and the Lilith's Brood series, but I feel Butler has definitely faltered this one. Although this series doesn't have to be read in sequence, I would recommend that those new to Octavia Butler start with Bloodchild, which is a collection of short stories, Lilith's Brood, and then Parable of the Sower and Talents."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Consistent with her other novels, Octavia Butler creates characters that you trust, understand, and love; characters who are up against substantial odds. Her vision of a dark future void of the securities that we all take for granted is a stark example of &quot;divided we fall.&quot;Perhaps not all readers will be as enamored, as I am, with the truths and promises of the Earthseed Destiny but I think all can appreciate Butler's prediction of human misery when tolerance and democratic rights are trampled.Religion is a balm, an inspiration, a scourge, and a trap but it is a fundamentally human creation, sprung from our abstract vision. Butler explores our need to formalize these abstractions. When she redefines \\"God\\" in Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents she tries to avoid the pitfalls that are inevitable where religion is concerned.Butler provides many dissenting views of her protagonist, Olamina. Allowing your faith in the character to be tested. Olamina is not perfect but her recognition of the power of a belief system and her refusal to transform the core truths into something comforting or theistic makes her a trustworthy prophet.Read this novel and you will draw many conclusions about the state of the world today."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"One of those rare sequels that is better than the original (which itself was amazingly good), Butler continues the story of Lauren Olamina and her attempts to establish Acorn, a self-sufficient community in a nightmarishly dystopian world. Many of the elements of the previous novel are here--Lauren's genetic ability to feel the actual pain of others' experiences, the collapse of the U. S. government and its economy--but there is much new. Alaska has seceded from the nation, the U.S. is a war with Canada, and religious fundamentalists threaten what remains of the American way of life.The sequel is told from three points of view. While much of the conflict is between Lauren and the brother she frees from slavery, Lauren's daughter provides a retrospective and balanced look at the eventual and inevitable hostility between the two siblings. The first half of the book portrays Acorn and its attempts to bloom in a hostile world. When the community comes under attack from the newly elected fundamentalist government that promises to restore law and order, the novel recalls--in a good way--Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" especially in the portrayal of the hypocrisy of those in power and their attitude toward women. Part social commentary, part adventure story, the second half of the novel concerns Lauren's often desperate search for her daughter and her persistent desire to reestablish Earthseed, the religious system she has created which believes that humankind's ultimate destiny is to establish itself on other planets.As usual, Butler is best when depicting intra- and interpersonal conflicts and when detailing the unusual specifics of her imagined world. But, because the novel is such a smorgasbord of themes and because she describes the rise, demise, and resurrection of a community of several dozen people, only the lead characters are meticulously sketched. Unlike her other books, the novel falters occasionally in its attempt to render the many characters, who are often difficult to distinguish.Ultimately, Butler is kind to her readers: she doesn't leave the novel with an wide-open ending designed to generate sequels. But there's good news for those of us who enjoyed the first two books: in an interview at the end of the book she admits that she \\"intends to write about communities of Earthseed who, in fulfillment of the Destiny, go out to extrasolar worlds.\\""},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The book is set in the post-SHTF world, action taking place in the Pacific Northwest/Northern California. It describes United States in a such a way that Germany leading up to the Second World War comes to mind. Violence, poverty, unemployment, inflation and a general sense of despair pervades the world of this book. Simple existence and the sense of humanity is not taken for granted, as characters in this book are forced to fight for their place under the sun.Protagonist of this novel is a remarkable woman striving to establish her own identity, and community in a world that seems very scary to us, yet hauntingly plausible. She is a visionary, able to influence those around her through her writings and through preaching of her own religious/moral views.During times of despair, tough, fanatical leaders often emerge and people tend to follow them blindly, while creating even more havoc in the process. (Hitler and Stalin come to mind) This book is no exception. A militant Christian preacher is elected to be the President of the United States, with disastrous results to follow: more war, persecution and poverty.Many times I have read posts and emails with their main line of reasoning going something to the extent of: \\"When SHTF, I will head for the hills and tough it out with my buddies and weapons...\\"After reading this book, I realized that it is not going to be an easy task by any means. Even if you manage to establish a community of like-minded individuals. Even if you are well armed and self-sufficient, you are still not going to be safe from heavily armed fanatics bent on enforcing the \\"Will of God\\".This is a painful book to read. Main character and those around her go through some hellish events in the course of this book. These are truly horrific and Butler manages to describe them with just enough of a gritty details for the suspension of disbelief to be complete. IMHO, she goes a bit overboard with this and the book becomes unbearable and depressing at times. Perhaps that was her intentionI would recommend reading this book if you are interested in feeling or imagining \\"what it would be like\\" to live in a post-SHTF world. This is a work of fiction, science fiction to be exact, but it is more of a \\"soft\\" type of science fiction: there are some futuristic technologies described, but they are plausible and not too far removed from reality.Overall I would give this book a \\"B\\"Plot: \\"A\\"This is an interesting and engaging story very relevant to modern times and humanity in general.Storytelling: \\"B-\\"Some lengthy descriptions of various minor characters add little to the story, except they only increase the sense of despair.

I name them both in this review because they are essentially the same book broke up into two parts. The nebula award wouldn't have been awarded to Talents as a stand-alone book so be certain read the Parable of the Sower first.In a nation recovering from vast economic, environmental, and social upheavals the main-character's life is presented via her daughter who has obtained copies of her mother's personal journals. It chronicles the creation of \\"Earthseed\\" a religious movement (cult) whose beginnings originate from the mother's childhood musings from within the walled community of her home presented in the Parable of the Sower. The musings can most easily be summarized by the oft repeated phrase \\"God is Change\\". From the mother's perspective Butler makes a variety of cultural and political statements denouncing the dangers of religious fundamentalism, laissez faire economic policies, and the sort of intentional ignorance humanity uses to protect itself from unsettling truths (poverty, slavery, war, etc.). She also promotes amongst other things universal education (no school vouchers for her) and a world-view completely devoid of faith in the supernatural and centered around the need for humanity to colonize space, this being the only real \\"heaven\\". My favorite quote from the second book comes from Lauren (the mother) in chapter twenty: \\"The truth is, preparing for interstellar travel and then sending out ships filled with colonists is bound to be a job so long, thankless, expensive and difficult that I suspect that only a religion could do it.\\"The views presented by Butler from Lauren's perspective are quite extreme and would probably have turned even myself away from this book had not both her daughter (the narrator) and Marc (Lauren's brother and only other surviving relative) been written in such sharp contrast to the Lauren. These two contrasting points of view save the book from degenerating into a long attack on Christian Fundamentalist values and Republican environmental and economic policy. Instead I was able to better appreciate the depth of Octavia Butler's characters and the passion with which they acted out their parts in her story. This story is in my opinion a much more valuable novel than The Handmaid's Tale which it has been compared to, but failed to draw me into it to the extent that George Orwell's masterpiece 1984 did.

Lauren Olamina, the main character, preaches Earthseed, always saying GOD IS CHANGE. I'm not very religious, but i can relate to all of the verses. Most of them are very true verses, ones that i can relate to. This book is about the world after the Apocalypse. Slave collars are used to control people, sending them lashes mechanically. A provocative but fascinating book-- and long enough to enjoy all of its layers.\\"Parable of the Talents\\" is a Science Fiction book-- but not the stereotypical robots and Martians kind of a book. It mostly feels like your reading about history-- even though there are some inventions our society doesn't have. Recommended highly from a person who hasn't liked reading much-- especially science fiction- until this book!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"At the end of Parable of the Sower Lauren Olamina had founded her first Earthseed community: Acorn. She founded the community with those she found on the highways of California as she tried to find safety somewhere among the violence of the United States. A man who came to travel with Olamina, Bankole, allowed her to use land that he owned. Bankole and Olamina eventually married and she had been teaching the community Earthseed and raising the children in it, her alternate religion that she believes is truth. Now that she has founded Acorn Olamina needs for her community to grow. She needs to spread Earthseed to others, to teach, to preach, to help others to know the truth as she knows it. She also needs Acorn to remain safe and protected as any could be killed, captured into slavery, robbed, or raped. Or all of this could occur.As in the first volume, Parable of the Talents is a novel told primarily in the voice of Lauren Oya Olamina through her journals. So, we are looking at what she wrote of herself and her surroundings from some point in the future. She may have neglected to write about certain events and everything is always from her perspective. This is the part of the format that is the same as Parable of the Sower. What is different is that the chapters include discussion and writing by her daughter, and her daughter has a completely different point of view than Olamina. Shortly after the novel begins we learn that Olamina is pregnant. For her daughter to be writing and writing this well, this has to be coming from at least twenty years in the novel's future if not longer. The daughter offers commentary on Olamina's writing and perspective and gives her own. She also includes brief passages by her father and the occasional passage by Olamina's brother. Together we get a much different view of Olamina as we did in Parable of the Sower. She is still the leader, but her family is resentful and angry. Her daughter comes off as very angry, so we are left to wonder why and we begin to discovery why.The format change was a bit surprising but it was very well done. It is enough to say that Octavia Butler was one of the masters of speculative fiction and she is in complete control here. This harsh vision of our future and even harsher vision of what Olamina and Acorn undergoes is exceptionally moving and powerful and it is part of a brutal world that I didn't want to leave. Wherever I thought Octavia Butler might go with this novel, she went in a completely different direction but one that felt entirely authentic.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Parable of the Talents is the sequel to Parable of the Sower. Given the subject matter of the first book, I was a little nervous and intimidated about reading this new one. My nervous anticipation was not unfounded. Just as with the first, all hell breaks loose at some point in this book and it is not easy to read.The protagonist, Lauren Oya Olamina, has settled the town of Acorn for the past three years, but her husband Bankole keeps insisting that they leave to go to one of the more settled towns. However, Lauren still envisions the prospects of Earthseed and hopes to see it blossom and grow from the small town. Both she and Bankole are ecstatic when she finally learns that she is pregnant with her child.When her daughter Larkin is only three months old, the town of Acorn is torn apart and destroyed and none of their lives will ever be the same when the world around them decides Acorn is not in step with the rest of it. Parable of the Talents becomes a story about survival through the worst possible human conditions. Fortunately, Octavia Butler spares us some of the details even though she writes with brutal honesty throughout this story.I have yet to be disappointed with any work from Butler. I find her work prophetic and quite frightening at times because of this. Still, she always has characters who are well-rounded and developed. I would recommend this book to anyone, but I would also say to read Parable of the Sower first."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book packs in a lot of story. It continues the story of Lauren trying to build her \\"religion\\" (even though it was established that Lauren is trying to \\"reimagine\\" or reject traditional religion) of Earthseed, and the world building of the dystopic (and still racially charged) America. Butler doesn't shy away from villains who, backed by their warped sense of religion, prey on anyone (i.e. men, women, children) not seeing their way. It was very emotional, and a very long book, but satisfying."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Bought it for my daughter. She loves this author - I had to buy quite a few - both through Amazon and elsewhere. I guess they must be good??!!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I would buy this book multiple times over if I could relive the magic of its storytelling and genius thought. However I'm quite content with the purchase of this sequel to read it multiple times over. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this book, because its not enough to borrow--you have to be able to own it and cherish it because the story is just that great. I also highly recommend any other of my favorite authors (Olivia E. Butler's) work."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I loved it. I was so impressed that I started to research the writer and realized that today is her birthday. (06/22/2011) Spooky, and so is her writing. I became an immediate fan. I will read the other books now that I have been 'bitten' by her charm. The book will make you stop, think and then read the passages again and again. My first encounter with Ms. Butler was through her book titled 'Kindred' which was an earlier effort. This book has shown the growth in her art and power to create an experience. It's your turn to look into the future that we are creating. She has done a better job at detailing the effect of global warming than most of my scientific peers have done and I am finally convinced that we may have a real problem on our hands."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler is a brilliant writer, and does not falter here in the least. Her writing is frighteningly realistic and the characters believable. I have been waiting to read the second book for almost a year now and am glad to finally have it in my hands. I have a couple of chapters left and am still enjoying the read tremendously."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler's book is Part II of Parable Of The Sower. While the first hundred or so pages seem a bit difficult to get through lacking story and motivation, it is a necessary primer and like writers of old, Octavia believes in setting the table first before serving the meal. The meal itself is an utter and shocking page turner. Octavia is a master at creating misery without sounding miserable and pathetic. There is a definite reflection of the US of today. She changes names and augments situations but in many ways, this is an exaggerated U.S. of 2007.The situation between Lauren and her daughter will lead to an utterly devastating and bone crushing conclusion. I can safely say in reading it, I had to stop, cry, and sit by myself trying to absorb what I have just seen. This is utter tragedy and tore my insides in two. It was that hard to read and imagine but it was an integral commentary about Christianity and belief systems in general. Octavia's message was driving it down to a personal level and it worked.I would call this one of the greatest books I ever read and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book is the continuation of Lauren Olamina's life story, picking up where Parable of the Sowers left off. It has much to say about how one transcends trauma, about what compels human beings to make the choices they do when the range of choices gets narrower and narrower. The reader becomes engrossed in Lauren's survival and what that means to other important characters. Most importantly, the reader is challenged to explore the various ways people choose to cope with destructive forces beyond their control."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book may be prophetic. It is the scarriest version of world social decay because I can see her trail to it. It should be required reading in all High Schools, so we never let it happen."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This is a book in a by now well-known format, with Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy and Suzette Haden Elgin's Eartsong trilogy the parallels that come to mind immediately. The new Earthseed omits the aliens from Xenogenesis and the imaginative speculations into human nature of Earthsong. Earthseed is more down to earth than either and must have been more difficult to write, but comes off well."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"After reading Butler's &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot; in 1995, I waited breathlessly for the release of this, the sequel to her stunning first success. Butler never disappoints. Unpredictable, edgy, and frighteningly relevant, &quot;Parable of the Talents&quot; continues the story into realms never thought possible."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I feel the same way about Butler that others do. She is my favorite sf writer and one of my favorite fiction writers (why isn't her picture on her books, anybody know?). This book was worth the wait except I do think there was too big a jump in time at the end. I wonder if there will be another book in this series. What did Butler do with all of her genius money?"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I received this book for Christmas, and finished it on 12/27. The first two-thirds were intense, gritty, detailed writing. However, I didn't feel feel that there was enough explanation about how the end was finally reached. (I'm being a little vague here, but I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't read it yet.) Lauren Olamina Oye Bankole's goals were intriguing, and I enjoyed reading about the small steps taken to reach them...so I felt disappointed when the book's steps turned into leaps. Still, it is a fantastic book -- and I hope we'll have a shorter wait for Butler's next!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Butler, in her afterword to this book, indicates that Parable of the Sower and this book were conceived and partially written as one book. It's therefore somewhat surprising that not only do you not absolutely have to read Parable of the Sower first (though I highly recommend you do so), but that Talents is, perhaps, the \`better' half. Butler includes enough background information on the happenings of Sower that the current situation is fully understandable.And the current situation is the stuff of nightmares. Not only is America wracked by the effects of massive climate change, a badly frazzled economy, and a society turning inward upon itself, but anarchy, slavery, utter lawlessness have become rampant. In this world we have Acorn, the small community established by Olimina, who has a vision, a new religion, Earthseed, based on two items: God is Change, and the Destiny of Man is the stars. The depiction of this community's daily life, its struggles to establish stability and some form of security for its residents, is starkly realistic. Not all of its inhabitants totally buy Olimina's vision; there are doubters, slackers, whiners, those with different visions of how to proceed in the world. But all the plans go by the wayside when the community is not just attacked by members of the \`fundamentalist' Christian America group, whose nominal leader has been elected as President of the US, but all its residents are forced into slavery, and their young children taken away for fostering in \`Christian' homes.This section of the book is highly depressing as the picture of humanity portrayed here is not only extremely ugly, it is all too believable. Fanatical beliefs in anything always seems to lead to behavior like this - after all, if you know that only your way is right, you can justify and rationalize almost any action against those who don't believe as you do. Butler's descriptions of the degrading conditions, the brutality Acorn's members experience, is horrifying (I just wish she'd had descriptions this powerful in her Kindred, as that was about the only flaw I could find in that excellent book). But this book is not just a screed against fundamentalist \`Christianity', but against any belief system that calls for blind acceptance of its dogma. Butler presents not only Olimina's viewpoint, but also that of her husband, brother, and daughter (who was raised not even knowing that Olimina was her mother), and these viewpoints show that even Olimina's own vision, her religion of \`Earthseed', is not without flaws of its own, and Olimina's obsession with spreading her word sometimes leads to decisions that are not in the best interests of all involved.Each of these characters comes to life in this book. These are some very different people from one another, and their different viewpoints adds tremendously to the believability in the events portrayed.The poems Butler presents as part of the \`Word' of Earthseed are finely crafted and have enough power to make you, the reader, believe in their being a part of a new religion. Their message of strength to manage a world of constant change is, perhaps, the best part of Butler's themes, showing that there is hope for a better future, if only man will actually use all of his abilities to manage both himself and the world around him.A finely crafted work, rife with emotional power, horrifying in its believability, with a message that cannot be ignored.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Parable of the Talents is classified as science fiction, but has less of both than usual for this genre. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The description of America led by extreme religious fundamentalism is frighteningly realistic. Meanwhile, despite a few references to futuristic technologies, much of the book deals with fairly primitive living conditions (18th century by the protagonist's reckoning).In addition to addressing the perils of fundamentalism, the book does a nice job of portraying the benefits of communal living. A striking feature of the book is it's ambivalence towards Olamina and Earthseed. This is neither a screed against goofy cults, nor an apologetic.A word of caution: for those, like Olamina, who are \\"sharers\\" (easily feel the pain of others), the descriptions of child slavery and sexual molestation can be a little disconcerting. Good writers can make the reader feel pain just as well as pleasure, and Ms. Butler is up there with the best."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents are the best written of Butler's books. Stylistically, she just keeps improving as a writer. I understand sci-fi fans might want more science, but thse books are really morality tales about the path she sees our country taking--- and it's not for the faint of heart. Be forewarned, a point in the middle is so depressing I could barely keep reading, and I find the end heartbreaking despite the utopian possibilities offered by the end of Lauren's story. This book is most extraordinary because she frames Lauren's writing with her daughter's observations of her life, and readers are forced to interrogate Lauren's kind of new age spiritual politics with her daughter's embittered, ambivalence to religion and politics. Butler is always interested in how and how much people resist power, and in examining how people survive by doing things that no one would have imagined as a productive possibilities before. This book is worth teaching, as you can explore contemporary political conflict but also think about the allegory of resistance Butler presents here--- something revolutionary as opposed to something that accomodates old systems. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This is one of the very best novels ever written; it ranks right alongside Edgar Pangborn's \\"Davy.\\" The sequel to \\"Parable of the Sower,\\" it is that rarity: a sequel even better than the book it is a sequel of. The America portrayed in the Earthseed novels is indeed horrible, but it is eminently believable as a possible result of the corruption and incompetence of the faux President and his evil cronies. Could Octavia Butler be a prophet as well as a brilliant writer?Some have complained about the dark future envisioned in \\"Earthseed.\\" But while it is entirely appropriate to be horrified and angered by the cruelty, oppression, and injustice of the future Butler presents, we should be inspired by Lauren's continuing hope and perseverence and determination and the eventual triumph of Earthseed. We should be doing everything we can to insure that the bleak future described in the \\"Earthseed\\" novels will NOT actually happen, because that future, frightening as it is to contemplate, is all too possible.I read \\"Parable of the Talents\\" before I was able to get my hands on \\"Parable of the Sower.\\" Both novels are so outstandingly excellent that little was lost by reading them in the wrong order, but it would be better to read \\"Parable of the Sower\\" first.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler drags you to the edge, shoves you over,then delivers you to the bottom without a scratch. Her work can scare you, but she never leaves you without hope. Ms. Butler's skill and talent grows with every project. I can't wait to see what's next."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Within Octavia Butler's impressive body of work, this is arguably her most fully realized and solidly constructed novel. It's also a rare example of a sequel that's better than its predecessor. Whereas Parable of the Sower was more about humans struggling amidst a collapsing society, not to mention a tried-and-true road trip saga, Parable of the Talents dwells more on the philosophical and religious ideas that Butler merely introduced in the first story. Via journal articles collected by her long-lost daughter, we learn of the heroine Lauren's attempts to build her nascent religion (Earthseed) and establish a progressive community. Her disciples are then enslaved by Christian zealots and scattered, but the new religion somehow perseveres. Many of Butler's novels describe oppressive near-future dystopias, with varying degrees of plausibility, but the America she creates here is disturbingly possible and is based on current trends in demagoguery, inequality, and poverty. Butler's social commentary is often brilliant, because it builds the story with subtlety and subversion. Butler also dispenses with pie-in-the-sky idealism, as Lauren's struggles to build her new faith and to reunite her scattered family are depressingly but reassuringly believable. Especially poignant are the impossible obstacles and misunderstandings faced by families that have been forced apart by social and political collapse, including the story of Lauren and her estranged and disbelieving daughter. All of Butler's books are recommended for those seeking insights into the human side of speculative fiction, and Parable of the Talents is surely one of her milestones. R.I.P. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia is a great writer. This book, along with Parable of the Sower will grab you. Awesome character development, and an unfortunately, believable plot."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I cannot recommend this book to anyone; it's mostly just torture porn. The formulaic plot and obvious resolution served only the constant barrage of terrible experiences written in an emotionally manipulative fashion to force the reader to \\"share\\" (in a parallel with the protagonist's condition (important in the first book and nearly forgotten here)) in the harshest situations the sadist-author could dream up (or copy/paste directly from history) to make her readers suffer. The book isn't poorly-written (most -though not all- of the punctuation and wrong word uses from the first book have been polished away by a new publisher), it's the worse thing that the subject matter and intent of the book were poorly chosen.Read these books only if you are a masochist, looking for pain and suffering.With regard to Earthseed, the protagonist's invented religion, it is no more developed and no better explained in this book than in the first. In fact, I found this book to be much more obviously a book about the author's perceptions of the evils (and potential evils) of Chistianity, with Earthseed's presence only as a foil for her evil-Christians to use as an excuse. I was upset not just at the twisted, exaggerated portrayal of Christianity, but also at the total lack of a meaningful alternative belief system in Earthseed; I enjoy studying religions, but Earthseed is insubstantial to the point of non-existence. What a wasted opportunity.

As a child, I too suffered abuse, intolerance, and just plain meanness from people who were supposedly \\"Christians.\\"In this bleak future, free education is a thing of the past, poverty & violence & homelessness are rampant, the separation of church and state has been forcefully rousted, and the Church is leading the country - and doing a bad job of it, completely ignoring the rights of the populace.The writing is powerful, and as other reviewers have stated, this books speaks to humanity - not just blacks, or whites, but all races.There are almost too many points of view in the book - the poems (which are lovely, and make me wish that Butler had actually published a book of poetry called \\"Books of the Living\\"); Asha/Larkin's writings; Lauren Oya Olamina's journals; and Marcos Duran's book excerpts (which were pretty useless for advancing the story).The other negative is that the ending is almost too pat, too quick. There was a lot of struggle, and then boom - Earthseed succeeded (of course, after many years).... there was a lot of story that Butler didn't tell us, and I wish she had."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I read this book in the week following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Switching between reading Butler's descriptions of &quot;post-Pox (Apocalypse)&quot; America and watching the country's fearful reaction to its exposed vulnerablity to faceless terrorism, I found her incredibly insightful. Her fascist Christian American Jarrett was reflected in the rabid anti-gay, anti-feminist and anti-choice &quot;God turning back on America&quot; finger pointing of Falwell and Robertson, and I found the unexpected concordance utterly chilling.The teachings of Earthseed are believable and applicable to real life. &quot;God is Change.&quot; It could be a guidebook to ethical living, to learn, teach, work, take care of one another, take an active stance in shaping your destiny, use kindness to ease change. A goal or vision beyond the gruntwork of every day to reach for, in this case, reaching for the stars, literally, a grander, greater goal akin to Kennedy's vision to put a man on the moon within a decade back there in the 60s. I think the tech IPO bust early in the new millenium has made us realize our concentration on material prosperity has fallen a little flat, and a little spiritual or visionary striving will do us some, or even a lot of good. Earthseed is much more palatable than the hateful exclusionary hallucinations of Falwell and his ilk."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler has written a stimulating,thought provoking tale of 21st century America dominated by lawlessness, slavery and religious fanatacism. Education, family and even more importantly -community, become essential for survival. Although this futuristic picture is often dark and depressing,Lauren Olamina's Earthseed community's diversity and it's vision for the future provide a positive note. In this &quot;parable&quot;,Lauren makes the ultimate sacrifice of her own family to use her talents for the greater good of the community. How inspiring to read of a Black woman portrayed with such strength and fortitude!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book is very much Octavia Butler's response to conservative fanaticism and where she thought it would/could lead the United States. She follows through the social changes proposed by Christian conservatives through to its conclusion and creates the dystopian world that their ideology would naturally lead to. Many people have commented on the horrific violence in this story - and it is at times oppressive and overwhelming. Violence is a real fact of life for many people throughout the world, and were Butler's dystopian future to come to pass, the violence in her tale wouldn't begin to tell the tale. It is not senseless violence added for a vicarious thrill or as one reviewer here termed it \\"torture porn,\\" rather it is always employed in service of the story. Given the nature of the violence and the story, the description could easily be more graphic and personal - Violence is always reported through Olamina's journals, and it takes on a news report kind of tone - Butler does not burden the reader with intimate personal accounts that would haunt the corners of your brain. There is little in the way of uplift in this tale - nor should you expect any in a truly dystopian novel.In the truest sense of hard-core old-fashioned science fiction, Butler's tale is a warning - it is speculative fiction. Butler speculates what would happen if the division of church and state were dissolved and corporate greed given a free hand. The tale is told in several voices, which separates it from \\"Parable of the Sower.\\" While Lauren Olamina's voice dominates, the switch to her Daughter's voice who disapproves of her Mother, and her crusade levels off and balances the extremes of liberal self-righteousness that could have easily neutralized the validity of this novel.\\"Parable of the Talents\\" is much better than its predecessor and is written so seamlessly, that you would not have to read \\"Parable of the Sower\\" to understand it. Butler has a better grasp of her characters and surer sense of where she's heading in this offering. The book matures significantly and reaches a sustained level of superb writing mid-way that lasts till the end of the novel.I'm saddened that Octavia Butler passed away before her time and before completing this saga. She was a visionary author with the chops to shatter the glass ceiling of the white-male dominated world of science fiction and show everyone how it's done.\\"All that you touchYou Change.All that you ChangeChanges you.The only lasting truthIs Change.GodIs Change.\\""},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I'm a big Octavia Butler fan, and consider her one of the most original and necessary SF writers of the past thirty or forty years. This novel, which really should be read after \\"Parable of the Sower\\" for maximum benefit, is nonetheless a hard book to get through in many ways. Without spoiling any specific details of the plot, let me simply say that it's a very upsetting story on a number of levels. Not hopeless -- while often unflinchingly grim, Butler doesn't write about people with no hope, but about pragmatic survivors -- but definitely bleak, as in Cormac-McCarthy-saying-whoa-lady-that's-a-bit-dark-isn't-it bleak.Nonetheless, as a chronicle of the challenges would-be prophets and their fledgling religions face during hard times, or simply as a cautionary object lesson in the ways entrenched elites move to protect their power, \\"Talents\\" is probably exactly as cruelly honest as it needs to be. I heard Butler speak once, and she commented that in her opinion the problem with human beings is that we're both intelligent and driven by a hierarchical mentality -- but that hierarchy was a much, much older trait. I've been turning that insight over in my head for seven years now, and it remains one of the more useful things I've ever heard someone say.If that idea provokes you too, and if you want to read a story exploring whether or not human beings can bring intelligence to bear without letting the struggle for dominance corrupt its fruits, then \\"Parable of the Talents\\" will challenge and engage you. I recommend it strongly, but not for days when you're already feeling depressed or misanthropic.(Finally, it's also worth bearing in mind that Butler apparently had a third book in this sequence planned before she died, \\"Parable of the Trickster,\\" and that \\"Talents\\"'s darkness may well stem from the fact that, while a complete narrative in its own right, it was intended as the second act in a three-act story structure.)"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I can't say that I found Parable of the Talents as thrilling as Wild Seed, but Butler's vision of an America that so easily slides into facism is especially chilling in light of the lout-in-chief currently in residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and recent political events. Reading this passage by Parable's President Jarret was especially eerie:\\"We are God's people or we are filth! We are God's people or we are nothing! We are God's people! God's people!\\"If that's not a portent of \\"You're either for us or for the terrorists,\\" I'll eat my bathrobe.Lauren Oya Olamina is a prophet who dreams of building a network of communities bound together by Earthseed, a belief system of her own creation (largely culled from Buddhist, pagan, and other nature-based religions with a little bit of Christianity thrown in). Ultimately these seed communities will work toward building communities in outer space, what Olamina calls \\"the Destiny\\". Among the ruins of a post-apocalyptic America, Olamina and her multi-ethnic band of believers live relatively quiet lives while working to spread the \\"truth\\" of Earthseed.Olamina and her band of followers are captured by rogue practicioners of \\"Christian America\\" (CA), the political/religious sect led by President Jarret. The Earthseed settlement is repurposed as an internment camp for vagrants, thieves, drug dealers, and anyone who isn't a CA follower. Olamina and her followers are separated by gender and enslaved for a period of seventeen months, and their children are taken away from them under the guise of saving them from an un-Christian life. After an (unlikely) landslide frees the captives, the Earthseed settlement fragments, and Olamina rededicates herself to advancing spreading the teachings of Earthseed around the world while searching for her daughter, Larkin.I found the novel's structure a bit distracting. While we're mostly reading Olamina's words, they're viewed through the eyes of her daughter Larkin, now called Asha Vere. Because the story is revealed through the eyes of a skeptical daughter who feels she was sacrificed at the expense of her mother's beliefs, it is difficult to trust Olamina's narrative. We admire her drive and dedication, but we can't help wondering whether she could have done more to find her daughter.I've been drawn to Octavia E. Butler's work lately, largely because her novels center around Black women who find themselves in unusual or extraordinary circumstances. While I'm no prophet, I can certainly relate to being uprooted and placed in a wholly unfamiliar situation. From what I understand, Butler's work is noteworthy because of the rarity of character-driven narratives told from a woman's point of view within the genre. Despite the upheaval her multi-ethnic casts must endure, it's comforting to know that we exist in future worlds, where we have heretofore been relatively invisible.Parable of the Talents offers no answers for how we might divert the uncertain political future that could become our reality if we're not careful. However, after reading it, we are left with a feeling of hope, that even though things may indeed become quite bleak, we don't have to accept being passive participants in our own undoing."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler promised this book by 1996, but it was worth the wait! Octavia Butler created a world that will hopefully never occur, but still seems possible. The characters she created search for solutions for the problems of today. I've read the reason she did release the book in 1996 was because she couldn't find answers. But she did find answers it might not have been the easier answers she fought she could create, but it was the answers that hard work and community is what we need to make the world better."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book is a sequel to Parable of the Sower. In my review of Sower, I had doubts about the religious writings and ideology of the main character, Lauren. Thus I really appreciated that here, Butler brings other voices into the mix, other narrators who question and even oppose Lauren's vision. This lifts her Earthseed religion out of its starry-eyed beginnings in the first book, and brings it into context as a noble but not necessarily infallible belief system, one that redefines God in quite secular terms.I still have mixed feelings about Lauren's Earthseed religion, but this book left me turning it over in my head -- even seeking out scholarly articles written about the book to get different perspectives on it. Any work of fiction that is so thought-provoking, well-written, and engrossing deserves five stars.I have to confess that before reading this book, I had no idea what the word \\"talent\\" meant in this context. I read the Parable of the Talents (the actual biblical parable, Matthew 25:14-30), and couldn't make any sense of it. When I finished Butler's book and still found the parable incomprehensible, I searched my library for information about it. (See now why I became a librarian?) Anyway, I realized to my embarrassment that a \\"talent\\" in the Bible is a monetary unit! Suddenly the parable made a lot more sense. I wish I'd had the presence of mind to look into that before I'd read Butler's book.Apparently, Butler planned on continuing her series past these first two books, but sadly she passed away before writing another. The two Parable books stand well on their own, however, and I recommend them to all readers, even those who normally stay away from science fiction."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Not necessarily a better read than Parable of the Sower, but more cleverly crafted. Interspliced with Olamina's journal entries is input from her adult daughter which adds a perspective not available in the first book.To me Parable of the Sower had a greater feeling of urgency. Wondering how Olamina would survive propelled me through the pages. Parable of the Talents feels slower and more repetitive. I lost count of how many characters were raped or molested. The majority of characters feel so flat and insignificant, it's hard to be concerned when tragedy finally catches up with them. But I don't think that hurts the novel. At heart it's an examination of what could happen after an economic collapse, how different classes struggle to maintain what they have, and how opportunists try to take even more for themselves. More importantly it looks at how religion can become a trap for the desperate or a tool for setting them free.While individual characters feel flat, the society Butler shows us feels very real. Clearly she's a well educated author, alert to the trends in modern politics and where they might be leading us. If you have any interest in anthropology, sociology, or politics you'll enjoy Parable of the Talents."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book hurts. It has the potential to do so, because the scenario presented is a very plausible one indeed. Butler describes no faraway utopia-like future with incredible adventures experienced on high-tech spaceships in a universe where the bad guys always loose in a happy ending.What she describes is one possible scenario of a not-so-far-away future; one step from now, or - as she might say - an extrapolation of what you can see around you, here and now. An all to possible dystopia, that - given the choice - we hopefully choose to avoid.But she also tells about persistence, trust and hope in a hopeless breakdown environment. Here no superheroes with super-natural abilities save the day or even the universe, but ordinary people following their own ideas of a world worth living in shape their future in spite of all obstacles.No convenient pastel-coloured fast food, but therefore definitely more the worth reading."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This book hurts.

The book follows up on the adventures of Lauren Olamina. Personally, I didn't like her, but the characters surrounding her were interesting enough that I kept reading. I enjoyed the ending (it was probably my favorite part of the book) and the representation of the Christian (shall we say overlord) denomination was accurate in my experience."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I have read all of Octavia's books, except for Survivor, which is hasn't been in print for some time. I am glad to say that I have never been let down. Never knowing what to expect, I accept everything her characters and their lives have to offer.Parable of the Talents, as did Parable of the Sower, made me so mad and upset at times I didn't know what to do. It aslo made me think. By expanding on current societal and environmental conditions, Butler creates a very possible future in this book, which is very frightening.I sit anxiously waiting for her next piece of brilliance."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The book was excellent and kept me interested however as I am finding with most of her novels she seems to end them in the middle of a thought. The ending was rushed which was so alarmingingly obvious beacause the rest of the novel was so deliberately paced. The relationship between the mother and daughter was not explored at all eventhough it starts off being the glue that holds the narrative together. The ending was an I-need-to-get-my-publisher-off-my-back-so-I-need-to-hurry endings. This does not detract from the ultimately satisfying read."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I came to this book after reading the Parable of the Sowers 8 times and being disturbed and shaken. The writing, as in the previous one, is masterful and pacing, - you keep going and going, not like in a thriller where you want see what happens - but because you are drawn into the world. The characters mean so much to you. I could barely read the section on the imprisonment. I had to put it down several times, jump around, come back. It is a disturbing dystrophic world yet the characters are disturbingly real and close. I wish and hope that Olamina got some happiness. As a mother I ached for her child and her problems and was upset by her child's selfishness as well. Less brutal than the Handmaid's tale, it was nonetheless a tale that will stay with me a long time. As with all Butler's tales, I am glad I own it, so I can go back to it."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I was mesmerized, horrified, grief-stricken, and elated by turns. This book took me through so many emotions, that I was exhausted when I finished. And yet, I desperately ached for the characters and their extremely human conflicting emotions. I highly recommend the book, and its predecessor, &quot;The Parable of the Sower;&quot; the book that changed forever the way I view divinity."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Finally she's come out with a new one and this 20th century griot has not let us down. Parable of the Talents is a compelling tell that is sure to keep you captivating well into the wee hours of the night. I couldn't put it down until I had completely finished it. Butler's vision of the future seems so accurate that it is literally terrifying. Her view on organized religion is also extremely thought provoking. Once again, Butler asks us to examine our hearts and souls as human beings, and through that examination to determine what our destiny will be. This novel is especially relevant to us as we approach the 21st century still harboring 17th century biases and hang-ups."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler brings closure to the life of the main character. She does this through a journey of joy, pain, revenge, and redemption. When you think that things couldn't get any worse, they do. However, Butler does so good a job at drawing the reader in, that you can't put it down. This is a definite gift for Christmas."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The future as presented by Octavia Butler in The Parable of the Talents is harrowing yet absolutely believable. Ms. Butler continues to provide superb chacterizations and weaves an exciting and fast paced story that is difficult to put down. The novel appeals on several levels - a look at religion and religious persecution; a look at oppression from the eyes of the oppressed and their struggles to overcome. The technological advances presented are very believable and fit in with current trends. The political and social climate she depicts are so real that it's scary. It's eerily reminiscent of Germany in 1939. I am hungry for more from Octavia Butler and eagerly await her next literary offering."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Reading the comments at the end of each book - interviews of Butler and the questions for a reading group - kind of let you into the thinking of the author and why certain relationships: Lauren Olamina and her husband, Lauren and her brother, Lauren and her daughter, Lauren and her faith \\"Earthseed.\\" Butler hints of religious bigotry and the overt merger of the secular-political and the sacred-spiritual. Butler's mother has a stroke during the beginning of the writing of Talents, and affects her writing and the relationship between Lauren and her daughter, Larkin. What causes her grief in Talents is the faith she created.Slavery and a form of share-cropping has emerged circa 2032, reminding me of a quote from Carl Sagan (from \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\"):\\"I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudo-science and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us-then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls. The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.\\"The zealot-thugs Olamina and her followers encounter are Christian-in-name-only, brutalizing them with canine-like \\"control collars,\\" and raping them repeatedly. Her own brother was so used by a slaver that she purchased him from, yet he is more like their Baptist Minister father. This causes considerable tension between the siblings, ulimately to irreparable ends.The book has several points-of-view and narrators: Lauren, Taylor Bankole, her brother Marcus Duran and her daughter Larkin. Butler keeps them distant and there's not a strong mother-daughter relationship despite one's desire to see it. It doesn't fit with the rules of the world Butler's created.Eventually, \\"reason\\" takes over and Earthseed has communities, scholars and wealth to leverage into the exploration of space. Limited information on the technology of the spaceships is given, yet you do get the idea it's a one-way trip with descriptions of suspended animation and embryos as passengers. At the time of the writing - 1999 - exoplanets were postulated, but hadn't been discovered, so it's left up to the reader to know where the space explorers were going to \\"spread Earthseed among the stars,\\" as well as the type of propulsion system, speed of the craft, how many, the political will gathered to pursue the endeavor, etc.There was apparently going to be a \\"Parable of the Trickster,\\" that wasn't written due to the author's untimely death in 2006. The author ended each novel with the respective parables, so in that spirit, I looked up some reference to \\"trickster,\\" which lead me to instead the Old Testement and a familiar verse:Genesis 25:26 KJV - And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] threescore years old when she bore them."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The only drawback to this incredible book is that it ends too quickly. It seemed to me that the ending was very non descriptive of all the work that the main character did. I give much props to Octavia Butler for creating scripture for an imaginary religion. This book and the prequel - Parable of the Sower are both important looks at the future. Some might say that it is pessimistic, but I think that something like this is possible sometime in the future, if not 50 years into the future. I also like the commentary on what could happen if public schooling were eradicated. This book makes me grateful for what does exist, but also makes me aware that these things are not enough and also that they are also in danger."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ms. Butler's books. As an African-American woman it was a relief to finally find a futuristic novel than had black people actively taking part in the future. Butler's vision of the years to come are both terrifying and wholly believable yet she manages to instill a sense of hope. I checked this novel out from the library and read it in two days. When I had finished I went to the nearest bookstore to purchase it for my own library. I cannot recommend this (or all of her other fiction) enough."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The Good: A wonderful book of ideas populated with interesting characters. The hunger for new spiritual guidance is a fit with today's situation. Much richer characters and plot than generic sci-fi / fantasy. The Bad: Definitely bleak at times ... but the journey is definitely the reward. Some of the characters / subplots seem to be fragments of a larger story that was edited down (or maybe seeds for new stories in the future). The Black: This book is mistakenly targeted at a black / minority demographic. It is less about racism (though there is that element) and much more about intolerance in general (blacks, women, the &quot;wrong&quot; religion, etc).Overall, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"the only problem that I had with this book is that it started slow. I guess i was still working with the speed that the previous entry, \\"parable of the sower\\" had left off at. All and all, it is beautiful.As with the last book, I was impressed with Butler's detail(the religon that Lauren created, the city that was built, the characters' beliefs). There was no disconnect between me and the characters that I was reading about, or the story. The struggle that lauren had endured to keep close to her faith was real. I rose and fell with her triumphs and loses.A promising writer must put this selection in their studies."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Continuing from \\"Parable of the Sower\\", this book finds Lauren and her followers in Earthseed as they struggle to make their small community thrive in the time of chaos in what's left of the United States of America. Actually, this is all told through the eyes of Lauren's daughter Asha, who, through her mother's journals and teachings, tries to understand the mother she hardly knew. A religious zealot became President of the country, and Lauren's community was destroyed for its heathen views and all the children were placed with other families, so Asha grew up never knowing her mother. Asha weaves together her own story with that of Lauren's struggles to rebuild her Earthseed community, and she tells of how she finally met her birth mother with the unwitting assistance of Lauren's estranged gay brother. The first half of the book is a bleak report of the atrocities done by men to women and by zealous humans in the name of religious beliefs. It nearly overwhelms the story and detracts from what Butler is presenting, but eventually this improves and it becomes the compelling story that it ought to be, although overall it's not as potent as \\"Parable of the Sower\\". Like the first book (and books by Margaret Atwood, Sally Miller Gearhart, and Marge Piercy), Butler expresses a fascinating feminist view of the political, social, and personal turmoil our country faces, and the potential path that could be taken."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I enjoyed this book largely because the characters, circumstances and plot were totally believable to me, even though they occur in a &quot;near future&quot; world. Is it still definable as science fiction when it seems like in ten years people might believe that it's fact?If you like post-holocaust, WWIII, survival, etc, you'll like this book. This book, and it's prequel (Parable of the Sower) are powerful, and are on the short list of books that have impacted me in a long-term memorable way.Read it. Read anything by Octavia Butler. I've never been disappointed by her, and this book is a fine way to understand how I can say that."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I never read Sower, but I read alot of good things about this book so I gave it a try. Glad I did. Every chance I got, I picked up this book. I was impressed by Butler's views of the future as a collapse of society and how it turns on itself any chance it can take. And of the (maybe pagan) religion she creates. But mostly by the characters. She can impress on you the earnesty of Lauren and the fight in her dispite all the atrocities that she's seen and lived though. A nicely written, well thought out novel with good charactization, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"At times one would think a person from the religious right participated in writing this book, however, after completing it, you understand the purpose; to show that humans can achieve the ultimate goal once a divine purpose is attached to it. At times the writing in this book is particularly gloomy, but realistically, it's not far from what some actually experience in their present day life. However, its the gloom and sorrow of the book that allows for the development of what the characters need, the &quot;restoring hope&quot; (that all-important human element).The parable of religion? Without hope, or what some may refer to as a vision, it's virtualy impossible for any people to move past their deteriorating conditions. It's this hope that Lauren Olamina solidly embeds within the doctrine of Earthseed, and that eventually allows for them to &quot;reach for the stars.&quot; One can appreciate the perseverance of Olamina to see her vision through, while at the same time attempting to right the wrong that was done to her, and thousands of others, by the religious extremists.My only disappointment was that the book appeared to end so quickly; would love to see some sequel that centers around the development of her daughter."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Parable of Talents (PoT) was a great book for me. Much of the SF/Fantasy I've read in the last few years depends on deus ex machina. See Star Trek -- at the last moment someone presses the red button on the alien artifact and the story ends -- not satisfying. PoT's plot is driven by people throughout. Olamina wants to build a future with Earthseed. Her husband, Bankole, just wants a future for their family. Olamina's brother embraces the Christian Authority as she runs from it. All this happens as the safety net on the lower and middle class breaks in the United States.PoT also rises above with its character depth. Too often, SF novels have characters that are either the author's ideal person or their concept of evil. The most interesting plots are not Good Vs. Evil, but Good Vs. Good; we get a lot of Good Vs. Good in PoT. True, much of the plot is driven, from off-screen, by Jarret and his Christian America, but the spot light is always on the protagonists and showing how they get along and deal with themselves, each other and the events around them.The down side is, the events of the novel are bleak. Rape, murder and other forms of brutality occupy most of the book. More than once, I questioned weather I really wanted this as entertainment, but the characters are so compelling, the pages turned themselves.The character Marcus Duran helps the story immeasurably, but he is not shown in the best light possible. The majority of the book focuses on Olamina with a parallel story on her daughter. Too many major characters can defocus a plot, but I wish more time was devoted to Marcus. If he had a more compelling character, the story would have been more interesting (to me, anyway).PoT's message -- &quot;turn your back on the poor at your own expense&quot; -- was interesting and easy to swallow after reading. I live in California, where the book is set, and see the motivations for the story all around me. PoT opened my eyes and I'm always grateful for that.The pacing of the story keep me turning pages at a rapid rate throughout the 400+ pages. The end, however, felt rushed. It felt like the book ended in the last 15 pages as if the author thought, &quot;Whoa, I must end this book. Now!&quot; Still, the ending was satisfying, if quick."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"Octavia Butler's grim visions of the future are thought provoking, if not totally pessimistic.

Butler's &quot;future&quot; is already here -- the walled communities, the police harassing the homeless, the gangs of vigilantes, the cults in the hills, the Christian fundementalism spurring on reactionary conservatism... strip away your blinders and it's all sitting there in front of you.

Now, the question is, what will I do with what I've learned? &lt;smile&gt;"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"An interesting read, with the Earthseed concept ringing hollow - it offers a destiny that's ultimately spiritually unfulfilling. Earthseed seems like just another &quot;what's good for me here and now&quot; belief system with the angle of settling amongst the stars as anything of consequence to strive for.

The theme of the unresolved oppression that continues to breed slavery is never far from her mind or pen. This book is striking to read because although Butler published it in the late 1990s, the danger of future of a U.S. run by Christian fascists led from the White House seems more more real than ever.For a factual recent history of Christian theocrats in the U.S. read Esther Kaplan's recent book With God on Their Side, and for a trenchant analysis of the philosophy and social base behind this madness read Avakian's Preaching From a Pulpit of Bones, another prescient work from the 1990s."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I can see why a black female author can have it in for the white, right, Christian fundamentalist movement. This movement doesn't seem to have the patience for those that don't fit it with their white bread view of the United States. It doesn't help their cause when they hint that Aids and the 9/11 tragedy are punishment from God.However, while she gets to release something she's holding in by describing what our country would be if they took over, it's definately fiction. First, there are too many educated, somewhat spoiled Americans who have tasted the good life this country offers, and don't find the more plain lifestyle these folks want as very attractive. Also, we're proving time after time that our country is too strong, with too much left-wing balance to ever crumble and resort to these people to run our country.Now take out the U.S. and plug in the Middle East, and you've got a more accurate novel. The type of government she describes in her book gets to assume power when there is so much turmoil in the country that the people will turn to the strongest power for stability. It also helps to control the media. It won't happen in the U.S., where too many people have Internet access, but for a country like Afganistan, which has been bombed into the Stone Age, and never made it back beyond the Middle Ages, this becomes a lot easier.So let's not build up Jerry Falwell as being more powerful than he is. On the other hand, the abuses fostered upon the citizens in this story are frighteningly close to what the Taliban inflicted upon their country just a few short months ago. This is the only beef I have in what otherwise is a very fine novel.As you've determined, the novel takes place in the not so distant future of the U.S., which has gone through enough turmoil that they've looked to an extremely right-wing government. The story is narrated by three different people: a man, woman, and their child. We get to hear their viewpoints on the world they try to build, how it is taken away from them, and how they reassemble their lives.It's debateable who is the main character (mother or daughter?), but I'd lean slightly towards the daughter. We are introduced to her early in her adult life, speaking of her parents, and not always glowingly. You see, part of the tragedy is that they were separated early in her life.Most of her knowledge of her mother is from the mother's writings. The mother started a kind of nature/religious movement, had somewhat of a following, and was known by a lot of people by these writings. So while you get the daughter in present tense describing what happened in her own past, you here the mother's writings as the parent's life happened. This structure works very well, and you get more and more into the characters as the story progresses.I liked the story very much, and it looks like this tale is headed for another version. It'll be interesting where the author takes it from there, but I'll look forward to it when it comes."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I would be the first to say that Octavia Butler is an excellent writer. However, I found this particular tale too depressing. My problems actually did not lie with the violence of the book. I was extremely bothered by an impression that every single character in this story was a victim (and that includes the villans). Even the ending did not seem any more hopeful. What is the point?"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"I'm a huge Octavia Butler fan but this is not one of my favorites of hers."},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"The late Octavia Butler is recognized as one of the world's most respected female sci-fi writers, and her book Parable of the Sower (1998) and Parable of the Talents (2000) helped her achieve this status.Both of these books have to be read to get the full story of Lauren Olamina, the books' African-American heroine. Butler, who loved writing apocalyptic type fiction (books focusing on what happens after the world is nearly destroyed) begins Lauren's story in Parable of the Sower. It is the year 2024 and people (namely Americans) have finally decided to go ahead and half-way destroy the world, resulting in America being reduced to the world's \\"lower power.\\" Our treasured dollar is now worth pennies, our system of government has collapsed, most American citizens live in poverty, and more than half are homeless. As one would guess, many people go crazy during this time. Besides being concerned about not starving to death or dying from the flu, people also have to worry about being burned alive by stoned druggies or killed for their shoes.Lauren, nearing puberty, lives in this world with her father, three brothers and stepmother in a walled community in California. As a result of her mother taking drugs, Lauren suffers from hyperempathy, a syndrome that causes her to feel other's pain--real or fake. But that seems to be her only weakness. She is exceptionally intelligent, creative, and strong-willed. Though a preacher's kid, her questions about God and how He could allow this kind of chaos to exist, turn her into an \\"unbeliever.\\" She walks away from Christianity to create and embrace a philosophy she calls \\"Earthseed.\\" This philosophy teaches that \\"God is Change,\\" as change is the only thing constant in the world. The philosophy is humanistic in that is calls for total responsibility of individuals to shape their lives as they work with God--as God is change. For example, an Earthseed verse in the book is: God is Change, God is Infinite, Irresistible, Inexorable, Indifferent, God is Trickster, Teacher, Chaos, Clay--God is Change; Beware: God exists to shape and be shaped.Beyond preaching just this, Lauren also believed that humankind's ultimate destiny was to settle other planets--no heaven, no hell.This concept of God may seem weird to many people, and very heathenistic to the religious. When I first read Lauren's idea of God and humankind's purpose I was slightly put off. But in those days and times the world seemed to be coming to a total end. It seems fathomable that a \\"religion\\" that calls for total belief in one's self and the hope of escaping earth could be founded and gain followers. After all, religion's main purpose is to give our lives meaning.After becoming confident that \\"Earthseed\\" could help give people renewed hope and purpose, Lauren began to plan how she could reach people. She hoped to one day leave her walled community to do this. However, she was forced out of her community while in her teens, as druggies stormed into her neighborhood, set fires to the houses, and raped, mutilated and killed most of inhabitants. Lauren escaped somehow, and found only two of her neighbors (an older man and woman) that had also managed to escape. She had already lost her father and oldest brother in childhood to druggies, and the rest of her family had been killed in the attack.Nearly fugitives, the trio set out on the highway to find another community, work where they could get it, or possibly to Canada or Alaska. They faced being robbed, raped, forced into slavery, or murdered while on their journey. As they traveled, Lauren began telling them about Earthseed, as she did with everyone who eventually joined their band--as people liked to travel in large numbers to avoid being robbed. She soon found several other empaths, as well as a man as old as her father that she fell in love with. He had a large piece of land, and although he did not believe in Earthseed, he agreed to let her set up a community to teach this philosophy/religion. The book ends with her trying to build and maintain this community.Parable of the Sower is one of the most thought-provoking fiction books I have read.Embracing the Real World (The Black Woman's Guide to Life After College)"},{"Title":"Parable of the talents : a novel","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read in my life.

Thank you so much."},{"Title":"The House at Otowi Bridge: The Story of Edith Warner and Los Alamos","review":"This is almost a prose poem about the beauties of the Los Alamos area and a life lived alone and apparently satisfyingly. Well, not entirely alone. Edith Warner, the subject of this biographical sketch, did live happily alone for a time -- how long a time? But then she was joined at the little house at Otowi Bridge by Tilano, a much older Indian man who was her companion until she died twenty-some years later. Edith was great friends with the Indians from the San Ildefonso pueblo, and with some of the scientists and support personnel at Los Alamos in the years when the bomb was being developed -- 1942 to 1945. It is this Los Alamos connection that has put her on the map, although her life was interesting enough in any case.But if you have at all a practical intellect, you will chafe at what isn't included in the book. Life in this remote spot presented numerous challenges -- how were they met? Edith soon after going to Otowi Bridge began serving teas -- that's how she met Robert Oppenheimer -- and later Oppie arranged that she should serve dinners to a couple of groups from \\"the Hill\\" each evening. But how did she get the food? Where did she store it? Did she have kitchen or garden help, beyond what Tilano provided?At some point a horse, a cow, and a dog appear in the narrative -- where did they come from? How much money might she have had and where did she keep it? She had a guest house too -- who did the laundry? Gasoline rationing during the war was mentioned as a problem, but for what would they have needed gas? Did she and Tilano have a car? Truck? Motorcycle? Where did she get the shirtwaist dresses she habitually wore?

While it's pretty good at conjuring up mental imagery, the writing is not terribly smooth. This is probably because Ms. Warner didn't appear to leave a very large diary, so the rest is filled in by the personal commentary of Ms. Pond Church who was a sporadic visitor to the &quot;house&quot; at best during the period and writes in a very different style than Ms. Warner. All in all, I just didn't feel it ever got to the heart of Ms. Warner's story, but it was a nice &quot;read&quot; nevertheless."},{"Title":"The House at Otowi Bridge: The Story of Edith Warner and Los Alamos","review":"This last weekend I delighted in this book left behind by a guest at my B&amp;B. It is without a doubt one of the most joyful and inspiring books that I have read in a long time. Beautifully told by Peggy Pond Church, it is the story of Edith Warner and her life near Los Alamos during the thirties and forties. How she created a simple home from nothing and how it became a mecca for her neighbors the world famous physicists of Los Alanos and also the local Indians. They came to her house for dinner, to take a respite from their secluded work at the Lab and in coming to enjoy her good food came to enjoy her friendship and serentiy. She live in close proximity to the Indians of San Ildefonso, and also became their friend, loving them, their children, watching them grow and enjoy with them their ceremonies and rituals. It is a poetic book of simple life and a good one and the great beauty of northern New Mexico.

I loved this story. A Philadelphia school teacher sent to the dessert to recuperate, only to return to her urban life and realize she can no longer live there. She returns to the dessert and makes her way in the simplest of ways: a garden and a tea shop.

Edith Warner, the woman who took the dessert to live simply, became a first hand witness to the changing of our world."},{"Title":"The House at Otowi Bridge: The Story of Edith Warner and Los Alamos","review":"This is the story of a woman years ahead of her time. She is a pioneer, not in the sense of someone crossing the prairie in a schooner, but more because she dares to live her life as she desires. Edith exhibits extreme courage in making herself almost an Indian tribal member by showing her complete acceptance of the Pueblo Indians and their ways.Edith Warner develops an astounding relationship with the scientists of Los Alamos as well as their wives gaining their trust and confidence. The little house where she lives is the freight delivery point for the people in Los Alamos and along with her pay for handling this, she also sells items such as tobacco and beer. She creates an atmosphere in her little house of safety and enjoyment. She becomes famous for her dinners cooked for the likes of Oppenheimer and Neils Bohr and their spouses. Edith had an Indian man helping her in the garden and around the house named Talano and it is rumored that he was also her lover. This was probably spiked by the fact that he slept in the little house although in his own room. This would be further proof of Edith being a woman well ahead of her time were it true.This book is but one of the myriad of stories related to the Los Alamos project and the creation of the Atomic bomb and it gives one insight into the humanness of these men who carried the weight of the world on their shoulders while trying to development a way to end WWII as well as this amazing woman who did her part quietly and humbly.

But both leading characters had their own demons. Way too much to contend with. They talked about it so often you were reading the next page to see if it got any better for them. It did when they relieved a little sexual tention but that wasn't steamy enough to say that it helped either one with the problems.

She's annoyed with the fire chief, Dan Egan, for missing his fifth appointment, so she agrees to go to him at the fire station when Dan's daughter Debra urges it. She is just about to examine him when an alarm goes off, so the stubborn doctor follows him to the scene of a mudslide, where they effect a helicopter rescue together. On their way to return the helicopter to its berth, they run into a bad storm, get hit by lightning, and crash land on a small island in the bay. They find shelter in a Coast Guard cabin and soon, in close quarters, are assailed by a strong attraction for one another. The problem is that they crashed on what would have been Natalie's wedding day one year before, had her fianc&eacute; not died of a heart attack only a few days before the big day. Dan is also nursing wounds from his wife's death by cancer two years earlier. Dan battles his attraction to Natalie until passion overcomes him, and then finds he doesn't feel guilty, he feels it's time to move on. Natalie is more well-adjusted and grabs onto her second chance. While the two dine on soup and roll around on cots in the Coast Guard cabin, a burglar is loose on the island, which leads to the inevitable showdown between the crook and our hero and heroine. This would have been the time to wrap it up, but the story rambles on with Dr. Giroux wandering listless and lonely through her too-large townhome while Dan pays a visit to the cemetery to say a final goodbye to his dead wife, and finally parts with his wedding ring. After, Dan has a long, heartfelt talk with his daughter about moving on, with Dr. Giroux. Finally, he goes to Natalie to propose, which is awkwardly executed. But, Natalie accepts and everyone lives happily ever after. Not a bad book, though the denouement needs an injection. Perhaps if I had ever lost a lover I might have found it poignant, but since I haven't, it lost me. I'm hoping my next venture into Courage Bay is more exciting."},{"Title":"Marine Life of the Pacific Northwest: A Photographic Encyclopedia of Invertebrates, Seaweeds And Selected Fishes","review":"I have a few other books & each has it's specific application but this one comes in real handy when I find something new & need some help ID'ing it.

His treatise on utilitarianism was written to explain the philosophical concept because he stated that it had been misutilized or mischaracterized by numerous influential people of his time. This version of his writings includes:Chapter 1. General RemarksChapter 2. What utilitarianism isChapter 3. Of the ultimate sanction of the principle of utilityChapter 4. Of what sort of proof the principle of utility is susceptibleChapter 5. Of the connexion between justice and utilityWhile much of his writing can be lengthy and occasionally difficult to understand, I find his written arguments contribute greatly to the development of logical thought. Perhaps my favorite quote from John Stuart Mill is \\"In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbor as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.\\"And that ...\\"Happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned.\\"This is a great introduction to utilitarianism and use of logic."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"This is my first reading of anything by Mill. This book is on several lists of great works and I can clearly understand why it is.

This book is quite short, and it is amazing what he covered in such a concise, yet powerful manner.This is the free kindle edition and it worked out great for me.

It is highly recommended that you reread this book every decade or so to gain additional insights."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Anybody hoping that this book will answer the challenges put to utilitarians today will be disappointed. There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however, is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Representative Government\\".Most of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are of higher quality than others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \\"Greatest Happiness Principle\\" that judges \\"that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\" In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \\"felicific calculus\\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \\"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and an answers that the person of what he calls \\"higher faculties\\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \\"better\\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \\"higher faculties\\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures rather than the base pleasures. Mill believes that utilitarianism should aim at the general advancement of mankind for it can \\"only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.\\""},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Many of the posted reviews refer to a different version of the text (i.e. Crisp vice Sher)Sher's version is an inexpensive and accessible (good font size and binding) edition of this classic.

Readers should note that aside from a short introduction by George Sher, this edition does not contain any additional analysis. Readers looking for a more detailed discussion will need to look elsewhere.

Mill is hands down the best review-mini-course available on Mill and his thought. This book is easy to read and follow, especially for a philosophical text. If you are a student who needs to understand Utilitarianism, look no further - this is your book. If you are teacher, this introduction provides an excellent breakdown of Mill's arguments that can be shown to students.The book includes 1) an editor's introduction - which is excellent - 2) an analysis of Utilitarianism 3) the text of the original essay itself - which is actually just 58 pages - and 4) extensive notes. By reading this book from beginning to end, you will gain a good understanding of Utilitarianism - as presented by Mill - in a very brief period of time.The most difficult part of the book to read is Mill's essay, but even this is accessible, particularly when compared with other philosophical works."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"The importance of J.S. Mill's Utilitarianism as a statement of the fundamental tenets of his school is indisputable. Equally unquestionable is the great influence utilitarianism has exerted upon the development of Anglo-American moral philosophy. These facts underscore the necessity of carefully considering whether utilitarianism, as articulated by Mill, offers a sensible or persuasive account of morality.In utilitarianism, \\"utility\\" is synonymous with \\"happiness\\"; both denote \\"pleasure itself, together with exemption from pain.\\" Hence utilitarianism is also referred to as the \\"greatest happiness principle.\\" However, the latter slogan is misleading insofar as \\"greatest\\" is taken to refer merely to quantity. Mill holds that pleasures can be compared not only quantitatively but also qualitatively; \\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\" There is an hierarchy of pleasures, and the happy life will be the life that contains the \\"greatest\\" pleasures both in the sense of the \\"best\\" or \\"highest\\" as well as the \\"most.\\"Indeed, Mill argues that the higher pleasures are such that no one who has experienced them would be willing to trade them in for \\"any quantity\\" of lower pleasures. \\"A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points,\\" Mill says, \\"but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.\\" Note that this is an empirical argument which implicitly postulates that the pain and suffering caused by heightened sensitivities is outweighed by the pleasures brought on by the higher faculties. At the back of this postulate is the idea, not articulated by Mill but informing his thought, that the supreme pleasure is the pleasure associated with knowing (cf. Mill's statement that \\"[n]ext to selfishness, the principal cause which makes life unsatisfactory is want of mental cultivation\\"). Philosophers prior to Mill had taught that the different capacities for enjoyment derive from different capacities for knowing. Partly on that basis, those philosophers concluded that philosophy was the best (happiest) way of life for man.But not everyone exhibits a burning desire to be a philosopher, to put it mildly. This observation points to a fallacy in Mill's argument. From the fact (assuming it to be a fact) that no one could \\"really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence,\\" it does not follow that no one could prefer a lower grade of existence to a higher grade of existence. Even if no one wishes to fall to a lower level of existence, it does not follow that everyone wishes to rise to a higher level of existence. For the higher faculties are not developed \\"by nature,\\" but \\"by art,\\" ie, through human effort, and most people, as Nietzsche observed, are lazy. What most people seem to want is to retain the \\"grade of existence\\" they currently enjoy, but in better conditions (better house, better car, better spouse, bigger bank account, etc.). It will not do to advert to Mill's quip about the pig and the human being and the fool and Socrates as a rejoinder. For in Chapter IV Mill explicitly holds that there are different conceptions/objects of happiness, and it is all too clear that he has no way of rank ordering those different conceptions. That account implicitly undermines the hierarchy of pleasures that he set out to establish in Chapter II. Indeed, the three objects of happiness he lists in Chapter IV (money, power and fame) would seem to be in considerable tension with utilitarian ethics altogether.That tension has its roots in Mill's incoherent attempt to derive ethics from psychology. This is a Humean criticism. Mill says that all men desire their own happiness. Happiness being the end of human action, it is also the standard of morality, which regulates human action for the benefit of all mankind. Hence the utilitarian standard, qua moral standard, \\"is not the agent's own greatest happiness, but the greatest amount [sic!] of happiness altogether.\\" But Mill does not explain how he gets from men desiring their own happiness to men acting to make other men happy. He fails to explain how a concern with being ethical can be located within his account of human beings as desiring happiness conceived as pleasure. That is, how does being concerned with living a pleasant life for myself generate a concern for acting morally? Mill attempts to ground morality in the sentiments of sympathy and sociality, but there are severe limits on the sort of ethics that can be generated by those sentiments. What this means is that Mill's doctrine fails to explain why we would take his doctrine seriously. Bluntly stated, the fact that we take Mill's ethical writings seriously is already a proof of the false foundations of Mill's ethics."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"One of the Classical School economists explains and defends a system of ethics that counted among its adherents Ludwig von Mises, one of the great Austrian School economists and philosophers.Utilitarianism, in John Stuart Mill's day and our own, periodically comes under attack from the spokesmen of organized religion. But Mill holds that his philosophy is completely compatible with religious morals. Mill even writes that the founder of Christianity was a utilitarian. Makes sense when we realize that one of the main features of the early Christians was jettisoning Judaism commandments that seem to have no obvious utility (usefulness). That attitude lead them to eventually discard the entire Torah.Mill imbibed Utilitarianism from his father -- British East India Co. executive and writer James Mill -- and their friend Jeremy Bentham. The two tablets of Utilitarianism are pleasure (acquisition of) and pain (avoidance of). Reduced to one it is the \\"greatest happiness principle.\\" Mill argues persuasively that these things are more hard-wired into humans than almost everything else. The pursuit of virtue, which some in organized religion see as being at odds with Utilitarianism, is actually a form of the pursuit of happiness for the virtue-seeker, those around him/her, and/or future generations. This adds to the \\"public good,\\" which is at the peak of Mill's values pyramid.Utilitarian concepts are all over America's founding documents, especially the Constitution. Interestingly, and ironically, Mill's essay was published at the time of the Constitution's greatest crisis -- the Civil War (1863). Mill makes no mention of the crisis or America's earlier successful marriage of Utilitarianism and federalism/limited government.Mill's \\"public good\\" and the U.S. Constitution's \\"general welfare\\" clauses helped open the gates to big government, Ayn Rand and other individual rights advocates point out. Sad but true. Although his ideas contain seeds for the modern welfare state, Mill meant his public good to be best achieved by free-acting individuals getting little or no prompting from government.How does the individualized commandment of \\"love thy neighbor as thyself\\" get turned into the collectivist Social Security Administration? Perhaps the psychiatric profession can explain it. I can't."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"If it was not for the fact that this book was assigned for the course, I would have thrown it onto the wall in utter frustration for the periodic-style prose in which it was written. Yet in those moments of painful reading I never let my intellect be neglectful of the realization that what lay before me belongs to the highest canon of ethical philosophizing. Mill's ornate style of writing was appropriate for his time, but to the modern reader it sometimes takes several readings to understand a difficult passage.I agree with the reviewer who noted that Chapter IV, unlike the rest of the book, is singularly almost unintelligible, not only for its long paragraphs, but also for its rambling diversions. Nevertheless, Mill's Utilitarianism should be a required reading for anyone with pretension for interests in issues of morality and social policy."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"'Utilitarianism' by 19th Century English social philosopher, John Stuart Mill is the classic statement of a theory of ethics which is bases its argument primarily on the question of 'What is Good' instead of questions of obligation on which many other classic theories are based.Today, Mill's theory and Utilitarianism in general fall under the shadow of an equally famous work by English philosopher, G. E. Moore, the great analytical work 'Principia Ethica'.Utilitarianism is based on determining what is good by what provides the greatest pleasure for the greatest number of people. All by itself, this theory leaves itself open to all sorts of difficult questions about whether great good for a large number of people is worth the suffering of a single individual and all sorts of variations on this theme.Moore's argument is simply that these problems simply point up the fact that what is moral cannot be reduced to statements of fact, such as the amount of pleasure received by a number of people.Oddly enough, Moore did not kill Utilitarianism. That is why Mill's work is still studied today. Unlike scientific theories, philosophical theories, being different ways of looking at the world, never entirely loose their insights, even some of the most absurd sounding notions such as Bishop Berkeley's solipsism.Like Kant's short 'Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals', the greatest virtue of this book is that it is a classic statement of an important position by it's most famous proponent in a relatively short work.It is not easy reading, but it's length means one can read and analyze it within the course of a week, which is why professors still assign it.A very important work."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Yes.

There is no answer to questions such as whether a terrorist can legitimately be tortured to reveal the location of a bomb, or whether an innocent life can be sacrificed to save many lives. What the book does have, however, is Mill's revised version of utilitarianism that is important because it plays a major role in his other works such as \\"Liberty\\".Much of the book explains and agrees with Bentham's version of utilitarianism that has no place for rights and replaces the concept of good/evil with pleasure/pain, but Mill's version of utilitarianism has an important difference - the claim that some pleasures are intrinsically superior to others, and if this is so then utilitarianism should strive to enable everybody to enjoy the superior pleasures.Mill defines utilitarianism as the \\"Greatest Happiness Principle\\" that judges \\"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\" In this he is following Bentham's definition, but Bentham had devised a \\"felicific calculus\\" to determine the amount of pleasure (and hence moral worth) arising from any given action. It depended on things such as the intensity, duration and number of people affected. Bentham did not believe that one pleasure is in any way better than another except in terms of quantity. He wrote, for example, that \\"Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.\\"Mill disagrees with this relativism, arguing that \\"some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.\\" In other words, quality is more important than quantity. Here we see the elitism that we find in all Mill's works. He asks how one can judge between the pleasure derived by two people from different actions and he answers that the person of what he calls \\"higher faculties\\" is the one to judge, if he can understand the relative merits of both actions and the other person cannot. Translating to a modern context we might ask why Mill would believe a Shakespeare play to be \\"better\\" than a TV reality show. Mill would claim that the person of \\"higher faculties\\" who fully appreciated Shakespeare would be able to see the merits of both and hence judge, whilst the other person could only appreciate the reality show and be unable to judge the relative merits of both.Mill seems to ditch the pleasure principle almost entirely at one point when suggesting that those with higher faculties are likely to find it more difficult to be happy because they realize the world is imperfect. But that realization does not make them envy the happiness of those with lower capabilities. In Mill's famous words\\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\\"It follows for Mill that if some pleasures are superior to others then it would be a good thing if more people could enjoy the higher pleasures. Mill believes that utilitarianism should aim at the general advancement of mankind for it can \\"only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.\\"This edition of \\"Utilitarianism\\" also contains Mill's 1868 speech on capital punishment delivered to the English Parliament. Mill supports the use of capital punishment for murder and has two main arguments:1. Capital punishment is much more effective as a deterrent than any alternative.2. Capital punishment is more humane than incarceration for life, which Mill assumes to be the only alternative to the death penalty. He writes: \\"What comparison can there really be, in point of severity, between consigning a man to the short pang of a rapid death, and immuring him in a living tomb, there to linger out what may be a long life in the hardest and most monotonous toil, without any of its alleviations.\\"Nobody of Mill's generation contemplated the modern situation where many murderers in Britain as in most other"},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Granted the book is hard to read given its somewhat old, long and sometimes monotonously written style.

This is a must read for anyone interested in utilitarianism and a good ethical mode of thinking in general."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Utilitarianism is Mill's most direct attempt to refine his inherited doctrine. Even more concise than On Liberty, this also essentially picks up where it left off, delving into the practical problem of how to deal with conflicting liberties. Mill retains the core utilitarian tenet that what brings the most happiness for the most people should be acted on - a very appealing doctrine in itself and put forth more palatably and persuasively than by the prior generation. However, utilitarianism's many critics will find little to convince them; however ideally attractive, many practical problems arise when issues such as relative happiness and harm turn up, as well as the thorny problem of how to enforce utilitarianism and punish transgressions. Mill makes some headway, covering nearly all conceivable ground in general principles but leaving much practical application unaddressed. It may be the most spirited utilitarianism defense ever but unfortunately is not complete, however admirable in many ways. That said, it is essential for anyone interested in Mill or utilitarianism."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"\\"Utilitarianism\\" gets assigned in freshman philosophy classes because it's short, well-written, and hugely influential. What else does one need to say? Perhaps only this:For sure, Mill's argument has holes. (Basically, he argues that maximizing the sum of happiness in the world must be the first principle of morals since all human actions aim at happiness. Yet even if we accept Mill's premise, his conclusion is a real leap.) And, sure, when utilitarianism is pressed to its limits, it gives rise to paradoxes beloved by philosophy profs. (Is it good for sadists to torture masochists? Can one person be killed to harvest organs for five persons? Should a judge put an innocent man in jail to defuse a lynch mob? And so forth.) But I'd still take Mill, with all his faults, over cautious, hairsplitting philosophy any day. His vision of a utilitarian society of high culture and universal benevolence was revolutionary in the Victorian Era. It still inspires today. And in the end, Mill got a lot right. Impartiality IS a key characteristic of the moral point of view. And we DO resolve many moral dilemmas by appealing to utility. It's easy to get hung up on the logical gaps in Mill's argument and ignore the core of truth. Any moral theory that doesn't give a big place to utility is seriously other-worldly.Bottomline: \\"Utilitarianism\\" is a great introduction to basic concepts of moral philosophy.

OverviewJohn Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism sets out a moral system that bases the good of any decision on the degree to which it promotes pleasure for the greatest number of people. By pleasure, Mill means not only those lower pleasures associated with the appetites, but also, the higher pleasures of \\"superior beings\\" that are associated with the enjoyment of understanding. The smallest amount of higher pleasure is greater than any amount of lower pleasure, for \\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\\"For Mill, then, there is no inherent good in any particular object; goodness is based on each object's utility in creating pleasure. All values are thus based on feelings and sensations. There are no normative principles in human nature that we can explore as we seek to discover what creates human happiness. Rather, in determining the good, we are to determine the sums of pleasure and pain for the aggregate of society and thereby discover which of the array of options before any one decision-maker is the one that promotes the greatest amount of pleasure. The moral decision-maker will choose that course of action that leads to the greatest amount pleasure for the greatest number of people.2. Critique of MillMill's theory on ethics is riddled with problems. One of them is the inherent difficulty involved in calculating the aggregate pleasures and pains of all of the people that will be affected by a particular decision. It is a burdensome and impractical way of coming to make decisions. Even if one could come up with general rules of conduct, the calculation as to when exceptions should be applied is similarly impractical. Similarly, it is nearly impossible to ascertain the degree of pleasure to be assigned to other individuals when determining whether a particular decision should be undertaken. Individuals who appreciate the \\"superior pleasures\\" will assign many more points to a chamber orchestra concert than will those who appreciate only the base pleasures. How can one determine with certainty the degree of pain and pleasure that third parties will experience, especially when the author of a particular decision does not personally know some of these third parties?3. The \\"Utilitarian\\" Golden Rule?Mill writes that \\"a utilitarian who believes in the perfect goodness and wisdom of God, necessarily believes that whatever God has thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals, must fulfill the requirements of utility in a supreme degree.\\" He even suggests that utilitarianism is line with Christianity when he writes that \\"In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your neighbour as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.\\" However, Mill's generalization is problematic. Although it is often true that the pain of one's sacrifice is outweighed by the aggregate pleasure of all of those who benefit from the sacrifice (as the case of the eternal happiness of all who are saved in Christ outweighing the pain that Christ suffered on the cross), it is not always the case. For example, there would be no incentive for a utilitarian to take a bullet for another person, since the pain of the utilitarian would equal the pleasure of the person being saved. Thus, whereas the golden rule of Jesus is a rule of unconditional love, Mill's utilitarian principle allows for self-sacrifice only in those circumstances where the aggregate of the pleasure outweighs the aggregate of the pain of all those affected by a particular decision."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Utilitarianism is a moral theory based on the principle that \\"Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\\"Mill sees happiness as humans' primary desire; hence, it is the basis for morality and justice. In defense of utilitarianism, Mill defines and tries to validate his position by relating justice and utility and arguing that happiness is the foundation of justice. While the whole argument can be presented in many ways, Mill tried to vindicate Utilitarianism from accusations such as: not protecting individual rights, measuring every thing in life with the same standard, and over simplifying happiness.From the man who once said: \\"Whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called\\", it seems that Mill ignored the absence of individuals' appreciation in utilitarianism. Knowing that Mill was raised in a strict utilitarian environment, and the mental struggle he went through to validate his theory is key to understanding this work. Instead of judging this work as a reasonable philosophical work, the reader should approach it as Mill's introspection through which he tried to justify his belief in utilitarianism."},{"Title":"Utilitarianism","review":"Classic book and it was free.

It completely debunks the idiocies of the 'game' of 'risk assessment' in a comprehensible, readable and intelligent way and comes up with a realistic, sane alternative.If you've ever been involved in a campaign against against a polluting industry, as I have, you'll recognise the following tactics used by them: Downplay estimates of hazard: Discount harmful effects experienced and reported by local communities as 'anecdotal'. Downplay estimates of exposure: Use complicated mathematical models or formulas that can only be analysed in a complicated computer program, that community groups cannot easily gain access to or understand. Downplay risks: Compare the risks to other 'voluntary' activities like smoking. Do not discuss whether the risks are necessary or whether they could be avoided entirely through reasonable alternative behaviours.It is on this common sense latter point that the book really concentrates. Mary O'Brien gives the example of a woman standing besides an icy river that she needs to cross. Four 'experts' are advising her. The toxicologist tells her the water is probably free of chemicals; the cardiologist says she is at little risk as her heart is sound; the hydrologist states that the currents are probably safe; and the EPA specialist tells her she will probably survive the crossing as it is a low risk compared to many other environmental problems. They are amazed when she continues to refuse to wade the river. Until, of course, she points to the bridge a few yards away which they all had conveniently ignored or failed to notice!O'Brien also emphasises the public right to know; after all, it is those living in a community who will suffer the impact of pollution. If we could actually name those individuals who will die from the effects of pollution, we could accuse agencies and businesses of premeditated murder. But why is it any different when they talk of a 0.1% increase in the likely number of premature deaths resulting from a process? Even though we can't name the people who will die, death is still death. And the polluting process still killed them.O'Brien calls for all government agencies and businesses to put their options in understandable language, and to consider ways of creating the least possible environmental damage. She argues that all citizens should be given easy access to relevant information, especially on health effects, and that we should have access to legal and financial resources to enforce environmental laws.For those campaigning on these issues, take a really close look at Chapter 16, 'Getting Started'. Here O'Brien gives step-by-step advice on how 'Alternatives Assessment' could be carried out, forcing regulators and industries to evaluate the real impact of their actions and forcing them to find the environmentally best options, not a statistical justification for the harm they are already doing.For campaigners, don't get swallowed up in the 'Risk Assessment' game. At the end, however much scientific expertise and statistical skill you acquire, you will probably be defeated. And in the process, you are helping to justify a fundamentally flawed approach. Instead, ask the basic questions, and try to get the local politicians, regulators and bureaucrats to take on board the real issues of 'should we be doing this at all' and 'what could we do instead'.Certainly the most helpful, and practical book of this kind that I have read in ten years of environmental campaigning.Adrian Fox Chair of Environmental Working Group, West Wiltshire District Council, United Kingdom"},{"Title":"Making Better Environmental Decisions: An Alternative to Risk Assessment","review":"This book raises a number of good points about Risk assessment and it's potential flaws.

There are indeed many problems with sole reliance on risk assessment and the author raises some good methodological points. However, her alternative to risk assessment is a somewhat ad hoc and feel-good process which she calls &quot;alternative assessment.&quot; I think it is somewhat disingenuous for Ms. O'Brien to suggest that risk assessors do not consider alternatives -- risk assessment is a further step by which each alternative is subsequently analyzed with analytic rigor to make sure all factors of hazard and exposure are accounted for. Perhaps we should heed Ms. O'Brien's advice and further institutionalize the consideration of alternatives. However, that alone cannot substitute the subsequent assessment and comparison between the alternatives. Ms. O'Brien, in my opinion, is presenting a sort of pseudo-methodology, that is predicated on a belief that the right to a clean environment should be placed before all other criteria. I agree with her completely that de facto, all communities have a right to a clean environment and pollution should never be inflicted upon them. However, individuals and communities, inevitably make choices about their lifestyles and may CHOOSE to tolerate a certain measure of environmental harm for other benefits. In this case they should have measurable indicators by which those choices are made -- hence the need for risk assessment.

His observation of people, analysis of the circumstances and situations he finds himself in bring the period to life in a way that any number of history books cannot.MacLean's account of his time in the USSR, especially his retelling of the Bukharin show trial, is fascinating and anyone has ever wondered how USSR came to end should read his account of its most disfunctional days before WWII."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"A great book. What a refreshing change from much of what currently passes for great books. Here is a man who accomplished so much and is able to describe his adventures in an understated fascinating way."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"I read this book in the 70's, and have reread it several time since. It is an absolutely marvelous account of one man's significant contribution to mid-20th century history. Fitzroy was friends with Ian Fleming and it is said that he was Ian's inspiration for the character James Bond. This very entertaining, well written book is a must read!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:U,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],P={key:0},j={key:1};function C(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(m,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(e(),w(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-a22a53c4"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/44.md","filePath":"people/44.md"}'),M={name:"people/44.md"},G=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{E as __pageData,G as default};
