Since wavelets representorthogonal functions in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on R, or on R^n for some n, it would only seem natural to merge the two concepts. But it takes originality to carry through the program: The book represents a success story in the application of operator theory to a current problem (in this case, wavelets) in classical analysis. What came out, for the theory of wavelets, was at first quite unexpected: You could have wavelets, it turned out, that are generated by fewer functions on R, or on R^n, thanhad been predicted by the more conventional approach to wavelet theory. One generator is enough! The new wavelets turned out to be localized in frequency domain, and they gave rise to a variety of new trends in wavelet theory, the wavelet sets being just one of them, multiplicity, and the dimension function are others."},{"Title":"My Kitchen in Spain: 225 Authentic Regional Recipes","review":"This book provides excellent, easy to follow recipes for a variety of course from Tapas to Holiday Fare, and it's all excellent.The book, generally, calls for simple ingredients which makes for delightfully rustic meals. The recipes are clear and suitable for even a novice cook. The several Paella recipes are excellent and the Flan is to-die-for. (This is the first time I've made Flan that has ever turned out perfectly.)Granted, there are no pictures, so this cookbook is more suitable as a COOKBOOK rather than a coffeetable book. The pictures are not necessary, as even a beginner could make the recipes beautifully, and a little creativity will help you to plate them well."},{"Title":"My Kitchen in Spain: 225 Authentic Regional Recipes","review":"\`My Kitchen in Spain' by Janet Mendel, one of the two major English language writers on the food of Spain, is not your definitive review of a food's culinary culture like Penelope Casas' \`The Food and Wine of Spain' or Diane Kochilas \`The Glorious Foods of Greece' or even Jean Anderson's smaller book on \`The Food of Portugal'. While it is a bit less than these works, it is a bit more than Patricia Wells' two books on cooking in Provence, which are very personal recipe collections from a single region of France. It is most similar to \`Rome at Home' by Suzanne Dunaway' or even to Mario Batali's \`Cooking from My Two Villages'. That is, it is a personal view of a region's cooking with a fair coverage of at least all the major topics of that region's cooking, if not being a comprehensive survey.Ms. Mendel gets on my good side immediately upon my opening the cover, where there is a very nice map of the provinces and major cities of Spain. The book's subtitle is \`225 Authentic Regional Recipes' and while the geography of Spain may be more familiar to most Americans than, say, the geography of Thailand, it is still a very important matter to have a map of your region with all the place names you mention on that map. Ms. Mendel's editors slip just a bit by mentioning places in Spain which are not noted on the map, but I will forgive them, as they are small villages and the location by direction and relation to the coast are clearly described.While I am sure that the recipes are authentic and I am sure that Ms. Mendel presents recipes from outside her immediate region, the presentation is not systematic by region. Rather, it is done by type of dish, leading off with the recently very popular Tapas. This chapter of 28 recipes begins with the big three classics, spiced fried almonds, olives, and the inimitable Spanish potato omelet (Tortilla Espanola). I was tickled when I discovered this dish and the related fact that the badly misnamed \`Spanish omelet' of diners across the country has virtually nothing to do with Spain. I immediately tried Ms. Mendel's recipe as this is a favorite dish of mine, and I found it to be at least as good as all the other recipes I have tried. My personal observation is that I may rather finish it like a frittata by sliding it under a broiler rather than flipping it. Even with a modestly weighted Calphalon aluminum pan, this was pretty messy business. I followed the author's recipe by slicing the potatoes on a cheap mandoline, but she says her son claims that chopped potatoes give a better result than slicing. I am almost inclined to believe that the best procedure is to grate the spuds, as the object seems to get a pretty tightly intertwined mix of egg and potato.The book has several sidebars on major Spanish culinary products, especially ham, sherry, and olive oil. She claims Spain produces the most and the best olive oil. There is no question that Spain produces the most. Many experts believe the best comes from Tuscany or Provence, depending on your tastes.The author takes a very odd approach to making substitutions for Serrano ham, if you can't find the real thing. She suggests either bacon or unsmoked pancetta. Two things are odd about this. One is that pancetta is, by definition, unsmoked and the other is that I think Italian or French cured hams would be much closer to Serrano than cured pork belly. This ties in with my sense that Ms. Mendel is not the very sharpest wordsmith. This has no influence on the quality of her recipes, only in the quality of our experience in reading her books.The next chapter is a rather smallish selection of five recipes for bread and bread byproducts (crumbs). While bread appears to be almost as important in Spanish dishes as in Italian, it is probably that Ms. Mendel is not herself a big bread baker.The soup chapter is probably worth the cost of the book, as it gives a very nice collection of seven (7) gazpacho recipes plus a little essay on the origins of gazpacho and how the author came to learn how to make this hallmark Spanish dish. After the gazpachos, there are ten recipes for other soups and thirteen recipes for one-pot meals from soups and stews.The egg and cheese chapter makes total sense with eight (8) egg recipes and three (3) custard and cheese recipes, since it is simply unlikely that the eggy \`Tortilla Espanola' would exist without a lot of similar dishes using eggs.The vegetable chapter reinforces the similarities between the Spanish, French, and Italian cuisines with 28 recipes for hot and cold dishes featuring artichokes, beans, onions, eggplant, asparagus, and potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.The rice chapter features paella, but makes it clear that there are Spanish rice dishes that are not paellas. The seafood chapter has the largest number of recipes and pages, including recipes for shellfish; finfish; stews and casseroles; and salt cod. The poultry chapter is much smaller with nine (9) chicken recipes and three others, including a recipe for a Christmas turkey. The meat chapter is larger (19 recipes, 11 with pork), but not even half as large as the fish offerings. The game chapter brings the count of land based protein almost even with the briny fare with eight (8) recipes for birds and hares.The centerpiece of Spanish sweets is, of course, the custard based flan. Otherwise, the Spanish seem to be light on sweets like their fellow Mediterranean Latin's, the Italians.This is a very nice book for cozying up to Spanish cuisine without getting too scholarly. It is a lot different from New World Hispanic cuisine (Add olive oil and subtract chilis, mostly) and therefore worth getting to know better."},{"Title":"My Kitchen in Spain: 225 Authentic Regional Recipes","review":"Janet Mendel has written a marvelous book for anyone interested in Spanish cooking, or who plans to travel to Spain. Filled with anecdotes from her 30 years of living in Spain, the book is a well-written and fascinating compendium of recipes from all over the country.

The story is beautifully illustrated by Garth Williams who also illustrated The Little House books. The 2nd volume is titled \\"A Brother For the Orphelines\\" and continues the story, although they do not have to be read in order, since the author brings out the characters at the beginning of each volume very well. French customs and holidays are depicted and the reading level the same as for the Little House books. I loved these stories in school myself, and my children have enjoyed them as well."},{"Title":"The Unifying Factor: A Review of Kabbalah","review":"This book should carry a warning label that lets you know it's a 230-page infomercial for the Kabbalah Center. It contains little that hasn't been regurgitated from \\"Rabbi\\" Berg's work, and what little doesn't come from him comes from fundamentalist Christians like Bob Larsen. The author's credibility is also damaged in its own right by lapses such as placing Pirke Avot in the Talmud, when in fact there's no Gemara for Pirke Avot, so it's only found in the Mishna. I was bitterly disappointed with the book."},{"Title":"The power exchange: A novel","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and recalled it to be an exciting read.

Sure, but today it might be over the issue of TSA gropings or Obamacare, or it could still be oil and gas. This book was areal page turner, lots of political intrigue.

Any student of the Mediterranean struggles of WW2, and of the pivotal role played by Malta and her desperately-straited supporting forces, in denying the Axis powers ultimate control of the 'Mare Nostrum'/'Mittelmeer' ~ and, hence, the Suez Canal and the oil-rich Middle East ~ cannot fail to be moved by this piquant collection of essays.Over 15 chapters, ranging from a strategic recapitulation to the bomb-fractured flightdeck of HMS Illustrious, from the fraught perils of lifeboat survivors to the daring and desperate defence put up by outgunned forces in the Battles of Sirte, and ultimately to the almost-unbelievable triumph of the famous Operation Pedestal (the 'Santa Marija' convoy of 1942) and the profound irony of the surrendered Italian battlefleet \\"lying at anchor under the guns of the fortress of Malta\\", Cameron superbly enables the reader to perceive, appreciate and imagine, this desperate succession of conflicts from a range of viewpoints.In advance of Shankland & Hunter's seminally eloquent \\"Malta Convoy\\" and well, well before Woodman's \\"Malta Convoys\\" this book remains a stand-alone for its vivid, often first-hand, style and the remarkable breadth and depth of its portrayals."},{"Title":"Thomas More (Science and culture series)","review":"Among those who admire St. Thomas More, there are those who do so for the ultimate reason that guided his life: his sanctity. To these I heartily recommend Christopher Hollis's biography of Thomas More. Mr. Hollis understands the depth of the man, the historical context surrounding him but most importantly he understands More's intellect. This biography is the best effort I have read (including Roper's book on his father in law) to decipher a man who has been held as the first exponent of communism (through his Utopia) and a staunch defender of the Catholic Faith at the same time. The author uses all of Thomas More's writings to show that in the end, it was the desire to do God's Will, and to follow Christ that guided him. Therein lies the key to understanding this seemingly contradictory man. It is therefore the author's central thesis that without understanding this one can easily miss the whole point about Thomas More. Again, to the lovers of this great man, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Up your bracket","review":"I bought my copy in 1980 at the U of Houston bookstore for 28cents at the close out table.

And to top it off, it's very expensive and takes 12-16 weeks of twice-a-week procedures to produce the results. I can't believe I just spent $$$ on an ADVERTISEMENT for a face lift!!! Very deceptive - this shouldn't be advertised as a \\"book.\\" I only gave it one star because they won't let you give a lower score!"},{"Title":"The Pan-G Non-Surgical Face Lift: Bodybuilding For Your Face","review":"This book is NOT about you exercising your own facial muscles. You need to get hooked up to a special machine located in Canada or Chicago, IL. It actually costs more than a face lift and needs repeating to keep up the slight results. Seems like a waste of time & money (to me). Just by writing & selling this book, the author has probably gotten her Pan-G lifts done free of cost for advertising and wears so much makeup it is difficult to tell if the procedure really works.

For theYellowthread Street Police Station, the countdown to the transition hasnot changed a thing. They are very busy working on various policeassignments....... Detective Chief Inspector Harry Feiffer dreads his task ofuncovering a murderer who scares his victims into ripping their owneyes out of their sockets. Corpses have been found everywhere on theisland. Detective Senior Inspector Christopher Kwan O'Yee struggleswith a visiting group of six crazed but armed demons, who nonchalantlystick a sharp knife into the law enforcement officer's desk as theircalling card. Detective Inspectors Phil Auden and Bill Spencer aretrying to unclog the plumbing that must have been put in the buildingduring Confucius' time. However, instead of clearing the line, thepair uncover a World war II aerial bomb that could go off any minute.This is only the beginning of the new day....... The sixteenth Yellowthread Street mystery is a humorous policeprocedural that has a lot of activity going on at the same time (like areal police station would have). Several of the subplots are veryinteresting and all the Hong Kong law enforcement official are fun toread about. However, a primary story line never surfaces, leavingreaders a bit disconnected with the overall humorous mishapsconfronting the local Hong Kong police force. Those fans of Mr.Marshall who enjoy his surreal comic writing style will want to readthis novel; however those who want a suspense-laden mystery as wellshould pass on this book and go to one of his previous Yellowthread tales that combine the sublime with a charged suspensefulmystery......Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Nightmare Syndrome","review":"I have given several of Marshall's Yellowthread Street Hong Kong police procedurals 5 stars, and deservedly so, for they mix suspense, mystery, and zany humor in wonderful combinations. This time, however, Marshall has strayed into the King-Koontz genre, and has failed---dismally.As usual, there are three plots, one involving Detective Chief Inspector Feiffer, one with his deputy, Christopher O'Yee, and one with Detectives Phil Auden and Bill Spencer. All 3 threaten the lives of these police officers more than in other Marshall books. But really! Is a bomb going to do away with Auden and Spencer? I doubt it. And is O'Yee going to be murdered by somnambulist thugs? Of course not. And is Feiffer going to die in some supernatural way? No way.The bomb plot, in particular, is massively overwritten, with the same sub-basement slime, bomb wires, and tension between Auden and Spencer repeated ad nauseum. The O'Yee plot is interesting, but O'Yee's repeated failure to get help---even though help surrounds him outside the police station and below, in the sub-basement---strains credibility.And as for the supernatural plot, well I'm not of Asian descent, nor have I travelled much in that part of the world, but I don't find it believable at all. A crime wave caused by an eighty-year old man using magical powers is just too much.I hope Marshall returns from left field in the next Yellowthread Street book I read, for I am fond of his characters and their travails. But this book is only a nightmare."},{"Title":"Mapping Inner Space Learning","review":"As a teacher, I found this book invaluable. It offers numerous nontraditional and visual ways of presenting data, and can be used in any academic subject.Nancy Margulies shows her creativity in other ways. She presents her ideas themselves in map form, and even suggests nontraditional resumes that summarize one's qualification in terms of maps. She includes simple sketches that can be used in maps, and these sketches, according to her, do not require artistic talent to draw.Margulies stresses the fact that there is no right or wrong way to present information in these maps. And, of course, one has to practice mapping ideas in order to become comfortable doing so."},{"Title":"Mapping Inner Space Learning","review":"I love this book. It's very straight forward and makes for a really quick read. Theory and discussion are written on the left pages, while the right side contains full size, wonderfully hand drawn, mind maps featuring some topic or style or technique that is discussed next to it. The book is broken down contextually by chapters. First it teaches readers the basics, then it gets into a few good uses for maps, followed by teaching you how to build a personal symbology. The rest of the book discusses techniques and uses for mapping in educational environments, an adult's personal life and professional businesses. It also includes an extensive bibliography and resource listing."},{"Title":"Mapping Inner Space Learning","review":"I would recommend this book to people who love to explore the process of mind mapping. For me, I am interested in how mind maps could help with studies, writing papers, and giving presentations. I did not find the book as helpful to me practically speaking. The book does offer a lot of creative insights and even addresses some artistic concepts that can help create beautiful-looking mind maps. There are even ideas on how mind maps can be used corporately or organization-wide in order to convey the principles and values of the organization. I probably will not use this book myself."},{"Title":"Mapping Inner Space Learning","review":"Mapping Inner Space is the first mindmapping book that I have purchased. There are many examples of mindmapping and many how-to guides on-line, but since mindmapping is most effective as a paper- or whiteboard-based process, having an actual book is helpful. Almost every left page has written text and the right page features mindmaps that illustrate the concepts discussed in the text or provide examples. There are color examples throughout the books. The mindmaps vary in quality, so you can see how complicated maps might look and also how quickly-drawn maps might appear. The application chapter covers many applications from using mapping as a daily and weekly planning process to problem-solving to sketching out your resume. There is also a chapter on creating your own symbols, again with several examples ranging from simple to complicated. In the short time I have had the book I have already used the visual mindmapping process to help memorize content."},{"Title":"Mapping Inner Space Learning","review":"I just taught a university course and wished I had read this before I planned out my lectures.

This method of teaching would go beyond just bulleting information. I would love to take a course in this method. My only difficulty is how to teach this way in a large classroom setting. The simplest way would be use an overhead projector, but I think an opague projector would be better--even better would be to combine powerpoint and this method. How to do this?

The LJ was imported here about the same time as the English were importing it. The English had the SJ410, 413, Santana, and the Samurai, which are all different names for what we call the Samurai. The Vitara is our Sidekick and Geo/Chevy Tracker, and the Grand Vitara is the same vehicle we have here now. There is the Jimny, which we never got, much to my chagrin.So if you are considering Suzuki 4x4s, or would like to know more of the history of the Suzuki 4x4, then you'll want this book. It telss the history and helps you pick out the right Suzuki, then helps you keep it nice after you buy it and gives hints as to various modifications you might want to make.

In chapter 7 he briefly discusses their origins. This was where I found the book wanting. There appears to be no definitive answers or agreement among scholars of the various disciplines. Was Tacitus right about their Germanic origin? Are they a pre-Brittonic people, or Celtic? Can archaeology and DNA testing ever provide us with some certitudes?Note, John King in his book \\"Kingdoms Of The Celts,\\" stated that the Picts clearly were not Celts.The remainder of the book is about the Picts often hostile relations with their numerous neighbors. The photographs and maps were somewhat helpful. This book posed as many questions as it answered. For that it was worth the price."},{"Title":"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom","review":"In order to appreciate the great wisdom to be found in Finding Enlightenment, you must first know the credentials of this wonderful biographer. J. Gordon Melton is the director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, the author of over 25 books, encyclopedias and almanacs, and an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church.Further, this unbiased scholar studied the teachings of Ramtha as well as forming a kinship with JZ Knight. It is from this place he wrote his biography of JZ Knight and Ramtha and the lessons to be learned from both. These insights enabled seemingly ordinary citizen JZ Knight to discover the One living inside her...and the means to uncover the hidden realities. This is the wisdom and knowledge now available to us, today!The foundation of Ramtha's teachings is Gnosticism...a belief that humans are angelic, perhaps even divine beings who are lost in a world of distractions, self-imposed limitations and confining traditions. We learn that Ramtha is a Lemurian who lived on Earth 35,000 years ago. His experiences and his desire to become the wind, and his ascension ultimately led him to God status. He is now back on Earth to teach us all he has learned...and JZ Knight with Ramtha's School of Enlightenment is his pulpit.Finding Enlightenment offers a path as well as a comparison to the many religions abounding today. A major difference? Ramtha teaches that there is no Satan. This basic difference allows his students to focus on self-discovery and self-growth...and not fear.This reviewer discovered in Finding Enlightenment a clear and unbiased view of Ramtha's teachings through his channel, JZ Knight. Thank you, J. Gordon Melton, for giving us insight into a woman shaman and an understanding of Ramtha's word!"},{"Title":"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom","review":"J. Gordon Melton is a VERY respected scholar of religions, and has written/edited many standard works in the field (e.g.,Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices,Melton's Encyclopedia Of American Religions, Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America).He has also written some works that are more controversial, considering as valid \\"religions\\" several groups that some observers label as \\"cults.\\" Three such books are:The Church of Scientology (Studies in Contemporary Religions, series volume 1),The Children of God, \\"The Family\\", and this book about the Ramtha \\"School of Enlightenment\\" run by JZ Knight, the \\"channel\\" for Ramtha (who is purportedly a 35,000-year old God/warrior from Lemuria).While some have cast aspersions on Melton for these latter books (even accusing him of being \\"bought off\\" by the groups, owing to his generally sympathetic treatment of them), I don't think this is justified; anyone who has read any of his encyclopedic works will realize that Melton is very sympathetic to ALL religions---from Islamic mystics, to \\"snakehandling\\" Christian churches.That said, this book is a fascinating survey of the teachings of Ramtha as presented by JZ Knight, as well as Knight herself. The focus, however, is on the School of Enlightenment itself, which was begun in 1988, and has had prominent students such as the actress Linda Evans. Melton notes that the average age of the beginning student was their 30s, and in their 40s for an advanced student, so these are not starry-eyed teenaged \\"newcomers\\" to the alternative spirituality movement.Melton says that \\"Having satisfied myself that JZ was sincere in what she was doing, I was ready to move on to the more substantive criticisms that had been leveled at her.\\" He is not naive; he covers questions such as, \\"Is JZ a fake?\\" He is aware of the accusation (for example, made in the December 15, 1986 edition of Newsweek) that JZ Knight has been seen \\"rehearsing\\" her Ramtha \\"act,\\" but Melton quotes an \\"insider\\" who suggests the a person simply witnessed Ms. Knight struggling with \\"becoming comfortable with Ramtha's presence.\\" He also mentions the 20/20 TV program \\"expose\\" of Ramtha that was aired on January 22, 1987, and all of the (unfulfilled) \\"doomsday\\" prophecies Ramtha made during the mid-1980s. He even covers JZ's advice to her followers to invest in her Arabian horse business, a venture that was unsuccessful.Whether one believes in the reality of Ramtha and of this message (I don't), this book is a highly informative study of a very interesting religious movement."},{"Title":"Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom","review":"I thought that this book provided a unique, somewhat unbiased perspective on Ramtha, the school and all the issues about it's origin's, growth, challenges, etc. It would be nice to get an updated version by someone more objective.

Not really a portrayal of Lewis and Clark themselves, it is more a glimpse into what the world looked like to the Nez Perce 200 years ago. It's told from the Indians' point of view, based on oral and written history collected after much research by Ms Swayne. Each stage of the unfolding story is contrasted with entries from Lewis's and Clarke's journals. The different views of the same developments provides real insight into the different world views and problems faced by the Indians and the explorers.It's a fairly short book written in the style of a novel, and is a good relaxing read for adults or teenagers."},{"Title":"Do Them No Harm: An Interpretation of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Among the Nez Perce Indians","review":"Few books have been written that tell about the Native American's side of history.

Zoa Swayne spent decades interviewing tribal elders and studying the journals before putting this book together. Clark met 3 Nez Perce boys on the Weippe Prairie, Zoa discovered the names of 2 of the boys. Lewis and Clark spent 2 1/2 weeks in the Nez Perce country building canoes before continuing on to the Pacific Ocean and nearly 2 months on the return trip, so there is a lot to tell."},{"Title":"Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Poetics of Social Forms)","review":"What is Utopia? And what relevance does it have today? These are the questions Jameson wants to ask and answer in this, his latest and most substantial offering since \\"A Singular Modernity.\\" \\"Archaelologies of the Future\\" picks up Jameson's larger project entitled \\"The Poetics of the Social Forms\\" (first hearlded in \\"The Political Unconscious\\") where he suggests that today's historical situation requires archaeologies of the future and not forecasts of the past--meaning, we must take as our political signposts a potentially different future, even if that means radically rethinking the present and seeing it as an archaic relic, instead of nostaligically clinging to the modernity project (a la Ulrich Bech or Jurgen Habermas). As such, Jameson pronounces Modernity, as a project, dead but simultaneously refuses to accept post-Modernity as the only choice, which for him would be accepting the cultural logic of late capitalism.It is within this context that, through a rigorous examination of the form of a Utopian text (most notably: More's \\"Utopia\\"), Jameson envigorates Utopia and claims it has relevance for us today. Jameson's defense of Utopia can be seen as far back as his \\"Marxism and Form,\\" while discussing Marcuse's Utopianism, Jameson affirms that Utopia--as a wild projection of a possible world--has more relevance than practical strategies. This is because Utopia relentlessly believes that an entirely new world is possible, not just piecemeal reformism.The major thesis of this book is that Utopia's primary contribution is that it allows us to break, in thought, with the current order of things. By projecting a hypothetical future, Utopian texts allow us to think of our present as a contingent and changing time that can be broken and revamped.The second half of the book amasses all of Jameson's writing on Utopia--minus the most recent essay \\"The Politics of Utopia,\\" published in \\"New Left Review.\\" I think they excluded this essay because the first half of the book basically is an extended version of the essay.If you are someone invested in Utopian studies, then, you must read this book. If you are someone who things Utopia is simply a wishful fancy of a too ideal world to actually be lived, then, this book will give you another perspective to consider."},{"Title":"Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Poetics of Social Forms)","review":"The leading, influential contemporary philosopher Frederic Jameson looks to the literary genre of science fiction for gleanings of the notion of utopia and utopian yearnings in late Modernism. With the failures of Marxist/Communist ideologies and the apolitical mood throughout Western culture, what remains of the idea of utopia which once played such a strong role in modern culture is to be found mostly in the science-fiction literature. Jameson takes on this latest topic with his characteristic thoroughness, exceptional acuity, and masterful synthetic capacity. The voluminous work with elements of literary critique, political/cultural analysis, and philosophical thinking is a survey of science fiction over the century of the 1900s and its shifting relationship to society. Jameson's approach is to focus on one major science-fiction writer (with science-fiction somewhat loosely defined) such as Philip K. Dick or Ursula Le Guin as representative of the topic is wants to take up; and then range through the topic by many references to other science-fiction writers and inclusion of respective aspects of the concept of utopia and relevant political, social, and scientific conditions to result in illuminations and renderings about the persisting, yet protean, idea of utopia. \\"Archaeologies of the Future\\" is one of Jameson's most wide-ranging and illuminating works on modern culture and its distinctive factors and idiosyncratic ways."},{"Title":"Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Poetics of Social Forms)","review":"As a huge science fiction fan I was excited to see that one of my favorite literary critics, Fredric Jameson, is publishing a new book of criticism that explores Utopian thinking in the works of some of the best writers in the genre: Ursula K. Le Guin, William Gibson, Philip K. Dick, etc. Now that I've read the book I feel I can recommend it for Sci-Fi fans and non-fans alike. Archaelogies of the Future is far more accesible than some of Jameson's earlier books, but it's just as essential. The writing style is straight-forward and balanced by a prodigious amount of scholarly expertise. He is constantly saying something unexpected and interesting, introducing ideas that I've never thought could be connected to Sci-Fi. He starts at the very beginning, with Thomas More's Utopia, and continues up to a review William Gibson's Pattern Recognition, which prompted me toward a whole new (favorable) opinion of that book. He makes me want to re-read every single one of the novels he writes about. Marxist criticism rules."},{"Title":"Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Poetics of Social Forms)","review":"No one is better than Jameson at defining modernity and postmodernity and addressing the many paradoxes surrounding any attempt at periodization. To me his ability to think and re-think modernity and postmodernity seems to be his most valuable and lasting contribution to literary theory. And since he can go on about anything from architecture to literature to painting to film Jameson can be very entertaining. If you have to spend your time with just one social thinker or cultural critic Jameson would be the one to spend time with. However, after awhile, all the fancy re-formulations of Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, Georg Lukacs...and all the sexy talk of paradigm shifts, seductive as it is, just starts to sound, well, so very dated. Ultimately, there is very little that is original in his thought when all is said and done as Jameson is not introducing anything new in the realm of social and political theory. What Jameson does and does well in these arenas is synthesize other peoples thoughts. Unfortunately for his more eclectic readers (that sounds odd, who could be more eclectic than Jameson?) Jameson doesn't really come across as all that eclectic as he's only attracted to one school of thought: the Frankfurt school. Its there he began and its to those thinkers that he returns time and again. Like his favorite marxists, Jameson has been detecting utopian impulses in mass culture since grad school. So even though Jameson looks at a variety of cultural objects in his work he always reads those cultural objects through the same marxist paradigm. Because he is always \\"engaged\\" in the Sartrean sense there is always something exciting about his work; at the same time because he never ventures outside his beloved marxist paradigm there is always something reductive about it as well. Despite being exceptionally gifted at refitting Marx in fashionable new prose every few years its really the same old same old. I think the most productive way to view marxism is to view it as a critique of humanism. This is also a productive way to view feminism and postcolonialism. As critiques they are each of inestimable value, but thinking through only one critique of humanist thought is limiting. To be fair Jameson does touch on feminist and postcolonial concerns but there is never any doubt when reading Jameson that there is a hierarchy of concerns in his work and its those (all white, all male, all western) Frankfurt marxists who have Jameson's ear and are setting his agenda.Jameson's real nemesis, as he defines it, is postmodernism. But the postmodern means so many different things to so many different thinkers. For some it defines an epoch; for others its merely a style of reflection or state of mind (which maybe amounts to the same thing). Some might even say that it describes a utopian state of mind because it describes a state of mind that is no longer worried about history or the government. But its a confusing word because its used to describe both a style of thinking or critique and the art object or epoch being critiqued. For hardline marxists the postmodern spells trouble because as a style of critique it means a whole new level of disengagment from real politics. Though Jameson's long engagement with the postmodern is presented as an ever-evolving critique of the modern/postmodern, to some like Terry Eagleton, Jameson's style of critique is itself really just another form of political disengagment. And I am sympathetic with Eagleton's view because in Jameson's books there is always a certain ambivalence as to whether calling something \\"postmodern\\" is a compliment or a criticism. Reading Jameson is a bit like reading the New York Times or Jorge Luis Borges: you get a bit of everything but what you don't get are any practicable solutions; just a sense that rigorous thinking, even thinking that leads nowhere in particular, is good for you.Don't get me wrong, Jameson is exciting for first-timers and I don't want to rob anyone of the pleasure of encountering Jameson at his best, but for that best I would go to _The Political Unconscious_ (a tome you will find on the shelf of every well-intentioned intellectual) or the hefty and heady _Postmodernism: The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_ (the favorite of art lovers who dabble in social & political theory). As for _Archaeologies of the Future_, this will feel like a one-note exercise (and a familiar note at that) to anyone who has read the previous two tomes mentioned.Maybe I'm just too firmly entrenched in a postmodern logic that is skeptical about everything, even itself, but to me it seems we postmodern subjects are brave precisely because we do not think in utopian terms. Utopians like to present themselves as liberatory thinkers but theres always something about thinking in utopian terms that reeks of an absolutist exercise and we postmoderns (who are not by any means a unifed group) are tired of the totalizing dogmas of the grand systemizers (& synthesizers). When you get down to it nothing is more boring than utopia because in utopia we are either a) victims of excessive social engineering, or, b) beings who no longer live in recognizably human forms and are thus no longer recognizably human. We love our half-finished world (with all of its half-finished liberal projects) and we love not knowing the future because knowing the future means that we know ourselves and we humans need a bit of mystery. Most of us know what we will be doing tomorrow at high noon but only because we are creatures of habit, but we also know that if we really want to we can change our routine. The same can be said of societies. The point of this entire book (and of much philosophy, social and cultural theory) is that by tomorrow at high noon we could all very well be doing something entirely different. But why a whole tome for this entirely relevant but entirely transparent point? We needed the Frankfurt marxists to tell us about utopian urges when they were deeply embedded in mass culture but why do we need marxists to tell us about utopian urges in science fiction when those urges are readily apparent?Modernists and postmodernists alike love to theorize change. (The difference between these two groups may just be that the latter group simply suffers from a more pronounced sense of cognitive insecurity). But the future (the one beyond tomorrow) and the past for that matter are simply elsewheres that never materialize. To a certain extent we are shapers of our life-worlds and yet we are also inheritors of a life-world that pre-dates us. We, as individuals and collectives, are humbled by the fact that we are not the sole creators of the world and that our dreams alone do not alter the fabric of existence. What we can do is make slight alterations (hopefully improvements) in the present. Piecemeal change is what a humanity that knows its limits (as well as its potentialities) can do and do effectively (or at least can do effectively at times). Its those who work well with others ( those who are a little bit of everything: marxist, feminist, postcolonial, postmodern, globalist...) who get things done. For this reason humanism, at its best, is and has always been eclectic. Like everything else humanism changes shape as it adjusts itself to and integrates new knowledges with old. Jameson is one of the few thinkers whose synthetic abilites allow him to move with the times. That said the very eclectic and very refined lens through which he views postmodernity, and, in this book, science fiction, is crafted to perform a very particular project and Jameson's project can be defined as an attempt to detect general tendencies in a time period or genre. What Jameson is not particularly effective at doing is determining what makes individual authors and works so powerful. Thus as a social thinker who thinks in broad strokes he is always interesting (if also always somewhat derivative) but as a literary thinker his method is not the most subtle when you get into the nuances of literary and human value."},{"Title":"Archaeologies of the Future: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Poetics of Social Forms)","review":"Call it a tome or call it a pan-gloss of science fiction, myth, philosophy and political theory. In \\"Archaeologies of the Future,\\" the fictional status of the former two blurs into the real, immediacy of the latter. From \\"The Alien Body\\" to \\"The Barrier of Time\\" from More to LeGuin, Fourier to Philip K. Dick, Jameson digs up works that are now relics of the past and reevaluates their relevance to our contemporary struggles. Dated by our own passage through \\"the future\\" that was once predicted, annihilated, feared and hoped for, Jameson's perspective is appealing to me, a philosophy nerd who has read little Orwell or Asimov, but it will be just as appealing to those who have yet to read Marx, Freud and Gramsci...just as soon as their done with \\"Brave New World.\\""},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"For those who've read and enjoyed Pressfield's GATES OF FIRE, it may seem hopless that anyone will ever write another tale of the Spartans in as moving and powerful a fashion. But this one nearly attains that goal. Here is a novel of two brothers, separated as babes, the elder a perfect Spartan paragon, the younger deformed at birth and abandoned by his parents to die of exposure in the wild. Rescued by a shepherd of the Helots, that people who were enslaved by the Spartan citizenry, the crippled child is raised and strengthened by his adopted people and taught to become their long dreamed of champion. But the Spartan blood of Talos the Cripple calls to him and draws him inexorably back to his Spartan roots even while the Spartans alternately torment and tolerate him, recognizing him as one of their own. Drawn into the great Battle of Thermopylae, the crucial plot-point of GATES OF FIRE, Manfredi's SPARTAN follows Talos in his struggles against the brutal inhumanities of Sparta and his own return to their ranks . . . and the conspiracies that characterized the ancient Hellenic world of the Greek city-states. The depth and poetry of Talos' personal experiences and the war in his soul carry this tale, though, perhaps, some of the other characterizatations grow pale by comparison. His Helot and Spartan mothers seem ghostly shades, even in life, while his beloved Antinea has but a bit part. The other Spartans are not much stronger and the plot feels a trifle contrived as we follow Talos from slavery to heroism and then to the point where he must choose a path between the two. The tale was compelling and kept me going throughout, but the ending felt just a bit too melodramatic, with one too many loose ends. But, in the end, this was a tale that aimed to spin a modern myth out of ancient Greek cloth, complete with prophecies and mysterious dreams and a sense of fate, and the gods, at work. Not quite a tragedy in the old Greek sense, it's nevertheless finely done for all its faults. If not quite perfect, it's yet a fine rendering of an ancient and, by modern standards, despicable people, though we come to see their humanity even through the harsh and brutal measures that define them. A good one and worth it, if you like historical fiction, especially the kind that comes to us from the ancients.Stuart W. Mirskyauthor ofThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"Let's cut to the chase: This novel is at least as good as Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" (an excellent book), but in two areas I feel it surpasses it. The first is that it is a faster moving story. The second is that although Manfredi, like Pressfield, clearly admires the spartans, he doesn't sanitize them quite as much. Both novels are written from the perspective of a slave, but Manfredi's Talos has feelings much more in line with what a slave would feel, I think. Both involve Thermopylae, but where that is the central theme of \\"Gates of Fire\\", here it is one occurance among many halfway through the story. Elsewhere in the reviews for this book, I found one reader who felt a little lost with a few of the characters. Manfredi does an excellent job of bringing to life historical figures such as exiled King Demaratus, but I admit that it may help to have a general understanding of the Persian war. Interestingly, the prose flows particularly well for a translation. If you like reading about ancient heroics, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"VMM is one of the greatest writer ever, he has such an in depth knowledge of the hellenistic, roman and greek period.

I had read all his books, the alexander trilogy, the lost legion and spartan and I always had difficulties in stop reading them and always end up rereading them all over again.in Spartan, VMM vividly described the spartan way of life and all the historical happenings that surrounded the spartan legacy, from the suppresion of the helots, the persian invasion, the famous death of King Leonidas and his 300 spartans, the earthquake that prompted the helots to revolt and the subsequent battles.VMM has a 'fluid' way in writing his works, hence he is not trapped in following the familiar pattern all over again which tends to happen to other authors, thus VMM managed to avaoid the boredom of a repeated story line.And an merit should also be rewarded to the translator, without whom the books will be non accesibe to the english readers. The translators had indeed managed to capture the very essence and beauty of VMM's works. 2 thumbs up for the translators.I recommend all of VMM books, he is truly a marvelous historian and story teller.

As a simple yet incredibly consistent and complex story, you get caught up in the action from the first page. So the book succeeds in the most important task: telling a good story.Second, Manfredi (or rather Christine Feddersen-Manfredi, the translator) tells the story using language that begs to be reread to be fully enjoyed. The book has almost poetic merit in places. Indeed, this book will get taken back to Thailand this summer for a second read! I'd highly recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"I've finished this book only days ago and still want to go back and re-read it again. It's a fantastic story. The story was about Talos and Brithos who were brothers but because of their unfortunate that they had to be separated and walked in t a different path. When time came, they met again but.......ANyway, it's boring to write the plot of the story for u guys to read, u could read it at the back of the book. My review of the story is that it's a very touchign story as I don't know much about twins stuff, their emotion towards each other....The second part is about mostly Talos and the war he had ahead of him which is also very good.I agree with one of the guy who wrote comment about Valerio not introduce some of the characters well enough and we might be a bit confused about some of the not-so-important characters but that wouldn't be much of a problem actually.Buy it ppl, I know u guys would like it. I hate to admit but I think it is even better than the alexander trilogy coz Alexander is my hero.....hehehhehe"},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"Talos is a young crippled Hellot man who is the servants to the great Spartan warriors. But when Talos has to defend a young woman he comes to the attention of a group of Spartans and not only that but the Spartan General looks at him with such pain in his eyes. The story follows two young men as they battle at Thermopylae - one as a Spartan warrior the other as a servant and leanr that together they can make a terrible pair. I really enjoyed this book and haing actually studied the time period that it describes I greatly enjoyed the different perspective on it. Though I did feel sorry for Talos and I must admit shed a few tears - which I don't do very often with books but is becoming more regular."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"You can always tell who favors or despises the Spartan legacy by what they write about. Although you can hardly call the Spartans sweethearts one still admires them for their discipline and the way they upheld their laws. Mr. Manfredi it seems didn't like them very much, and i can understand it. I did enjoy this book, although i found it a bit lopsided. It seems that Talos goes through alot of hardship just to disappear at the end. Sometimes he would be portrayed as happy as a slave then it would portray him as downtrodden. winch one is it?? well the story line was good, alot of these types of books always revolve around a servant and what he witnesses in his servitude. ie. (the ten thousand, Gates of Fire). This was kind of more about the Helots than the Spartans and the Messenian revolt. Its a good read, im not sure how much of this was made up, but its good anyway. Yes I love Historical Fiction and I've basically read all of these books in about 3 days or less but I think that I'm going to have to get used to the fact that i will never find another book as good as Gates of Fire...(sigh)"},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"\\"Spartan\\" by Valerio Massimo Manfredi is not really too bad of a book with a interesting plot and nice character development. It is very clear that the author has researched but sometimes the names gets confusing. Overall though, not a bad read for plain enjoyment."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"SPARTAN is a unique book in that it is the fictional story of a fellow who has one foot in the camp of the Lacedamons (Spartans) and one foot in the camp of the Helots (the Messenian slave race of the Spartans). Born with a deformed foot, the protaganist is a fellow named Talos who is rejected by Spartan society. In accordance with their customs, he is exposed. That is to say, left in the woods to die. Of course, as is the case in Greek mythology, he is picked up by a Helot and given a chance to live an alternate life.The bulk of the storyline takes us through the Persian wars, from the battle of Marathon through the climactic battle of Platea. It then continues on with the campaigns of the Spartan king Pausanius in Asia minor. Ultimately, we relive the earthquake which nearly brought Sparta to its knees, and spurred on a revolt of the Helots.There are a great many historical tidbits that the author creatively entwines Talos in. Of course, in doing so, Manfredi also takes some liberties and does a little bit of rewriting of history. Many who are familiar with this epoch of history will be a little disappointed with the denouement of the book as it offers a happy ending where history says there wasn't one.Nonetheless, this is a fine read & is worthy to be on the bookshelf of people who are fascinated by the ancient Spartans (like me!). This book will likely be compared toGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae. Like GOF, it tells the story of an unconventional Spartan Helot. The present book is not as intense as GOF, and paints with a wider brush than does Pressfield's masterpiece. I would recommend both books to those who are enthused about the Lacedamon tradition."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"Nice novel about ancient Sparta, which has few smaller weak points. For instance the description of the pontoon bridge construction by Persian engineers is presented obscurely. The description of battles are not very dynamic in this book, what causes that this book, which has very interesting plot is not so good as it could be. This book is even historically accurate."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"This is the second book by Manfredi that I have read - the first one being Last Legion - and I must say this was more intense than Last Legion. I have always wondered when people talk about joy and anguish being twin emotions. I could never imagine how 2 very different feelings could be as close. But reading this book makes you realise what it exactly feels like. To be exuberant and torn by anguish at the same time. This story is truly about Talos (Kleidemos), but his brother plays an important part in the story as well. In a way, Brithos is a fixed point of reference against the changes that occur in Talos/Kleidemos character. Its about the 2 lives that the Talos (Kleidemos) lives through and the choice he makes. I felt that this work might have had more stylish translation, it seemed to have a serene quality. I would recommend it to any history buff. Its a very moving tale. It can make you cry, but it definitely makes respect Spartans and Helots for who they were, and what they valued most."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"I had seen a lot of Manfredi's novels about and had attended a lecture of his when he was in Australia, so I was very interested to see what sort of a writer he was and how he would capture the period of the Ancient Greeks and Sparta.I must admit that I was dissappointed.While the storyline is ok (if not a little fantastic), it felt like I was reading a sort of laymans guide to Ancient Sparta. Integral cultural aspects of the Spartans were glossed over, while others were poorly explained and portrayed, ultimately (for someone who has read a lot on Ancient Sparta anyway) giving the novel a simplistic fantasy novel feel.Certainly not even close to being in the same league as Pressfield, Nicastro or Curtis Ford, I would have to say that if all Manfredi's Ancient Greek novels are like this, they are more for people with only a passing interest in the historical setting."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"There is no doubt that this author knows his history, and given his credentials he should. I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Legion, although the following movie fell far short of the original book. Spartan, however, never really explained itself the way I hoped it would. By the end, I was still confused about the mysteries surrounding the long-lost brother and his adopted people. The story zigzagged back and forth so many times that I lost interest and had to force myself to finish."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"Overall this is a worthwhile read with interesting historical facts woven throughout the fictional account. Portions that bothered me were the way Manfredi used character dialogue to explain the culture of the time. He would create conversation that basically would answer any question someone might have, but explaiend details that would have been everyday knowledge for people of the time. It felt like he was \\"dumbing down\\" the characters uneccesarily instead of creating a Glossary. An example is when a group of soliders runs into their barracks nude, from bathing after exercies, and meet with a command officer. One recruit says to the Officer something to the effect of \\"We would salute, but we cant as we are nude, and thats against Military rules\\". An Officer would know that and that would not need explaining to him by a lower ranking soldier. This type of unsensible explanation during conversations replayed itself multiple times and was annoying as well as made it seem like a book for a middle school age reading level. Other than these annoyances, I enjoyed the book and will keep it on the shelf, although it may not become a multiple read."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"&gt; Manfredi, author of the best-selling Alexander trilogy, is back with a new epic adventure. Two men, both sons of a valorous Spartan commander, are brothers by blood, but yet fate has destined them to be enemies instead. Amid the cruel law of Spartan, it was thus that the crippled brother Talos, whose genuine name was Kleidemos, was reluctantly separated from his family at birth. Yet, the Gods did not entirely abandon this baby. By chance, a helot finds Talos and saves him from the wild. Helots were a once proud race of men now enslaved by the Spartans. Therefore, raised by the helot shepherd, Talos lives in servitude while his brother, Brithos, remains in the mighty warrior class of Spartans.&gt; As the years passed, the two boys become men, both concealed from the existence of each other. It is till one day, when Brithos stands over Talos, ready to give him a fatal blow that he realizes that there is a special bond between them two. Their blood ties were still shrouded from Brithos, yet a mysterious force stopped him from killing his brother. Determined to find an understanding, both Brithos and Talos becomes entangled in a series of adventure, eventually discovering their identity as brothers.&gt; However, as war clashes between the Greeks and the Persians, petrifying incidents occur and Talos is left dealing with yet the many baffling puzzles of his life. When Talos finally learns that he is both a Helot and a Spartan, he is harassed by a final and decisive decision; the decision between whether he should pursue the footsteps of his noble father and brother, or whether he should lead the people that once raised him and gave him a chance to live. Full of passion and valor, Spartan is a thrilling novel that portrays a realistic scenario of the ancient world."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"Although this book didn't focus DIRECTLY on the '300', thier story was a very important part to this story. I did enjoy this novel but the reason why I only gave it 3 stars was because it had to many down parts for me. Not enough to keep me from reading, but enough to bother me a little.The story was a good one and I enjoyed the battle, blood, and gore! Exactly what a story in this time frame ought to have."},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"I'm halfway through this book and have to admit I can't quite agree with the over the top praise this author is receiving. Does he know his subject? Absolutely. At times though I think that he falls back into the role of professor and the unpronouceable (for me at least since the peoples and age of which he writes is not completely familiar to me) names come rolling out one after the other barely giving me time to digest one before trying to figure out who or what the next one is. I think he takes for granted that anyone picking up this book must have a working knowledge of the time period and be aquainted with all diverse people that filled the army of &quot;the Great King&quot;. I have to admit I am partial to Bernard Cornwell's writing and it was because of his praise printed on the cover of the book that I purchased it. I'm used to Mr Cornwell gently introducing peoples, customs and devices of a past age thoroughly explaining their purpose and existance in well crafted prose. I know the author is Italian and the writing feels like an interpreted work (I'm not sure if it was originally written in Italian which would explain a lot if it was)with stilted often very unrealistic conversations between the characters. I haven't so far gotten a very good sense of the characters either and feel they could have been fleshed out a little more. On the plus side, I have found the story itself intriguing enough to continue reading. It's almost as if I feel I need to finish this to see if it gets any better or was worth the read to begin with. Wish me luck!"},{"Title":"Spartan","review":"I'm halfway through the book now, and am seriously considering putting it down. See the other reader reviews for comments on the storyline. It is indeed a nice tale, set against a most powerful backdrop. However, it just feels like the author rushes through events at too fast a pace. Entire battles are described in a few paragraphs, what should be long prolongued drama filled scenes of major character death is boiled down to a few sentences. Really, the story told in this book is good enough to have been expanded into 6-8 books, but instead we are treated on a whirlwind tour spanning from the birth of the main character, to teenage years, to Thermopylae, to Platea and across the ocean - all in half the book so far. It's beginning to get tiresome."},{"Title":"Killer;: A journal of murder","review":"A modern-day, hardcore picaresque novel -- only it's a true story. Carl Panzram, an inhuman monster, pens his autobiography, blaming every one but himself for his brutal crimes against humanity. The movie based on the book distorts the savagery of the text. The Pranzram you meet in the text is NOT the same one portrayed in the movie . I enjoyed the way Gaddis framed the book with explications of important details of Carl's life and of American history in general at the time (a lot of it takes place in the early part of this century,) : it gave Carl's &quot;book&quot; fluidity and structure. Anyone interested in sociology or penalogy should pick up this book. If you're a crimewriter, you will particularly benefit from it. The book turned my hair gray."},{"Title":"Killer;: A journal of murder","review":"An excellent read that penitrates the mind of a serial killer. What's more shocking is that it actually happened! Panzram details his life from childhood through the hardships of adulthood which made him the hardcore savage animal that he ultimately became. I loved every minute of this book! It's a shame that it's so hard to find though or I'd buy my own copy and read it every night before I go to bed. I suggest that anyone who wants something new and exciting to read should pick up this work and start reading. The public library should have it. Get moving!"},{"Title":"Killer;: A journal of murder","review":"KILLER has been out of print for years, yet it is one of the finest studies ever done of a serial killer. Panzram was one of the handful of such killers who possess any real intelligence, and the book includes long excerpts from the diary he wrote in prison while cheerfully awaiting execution for his murder and rape of so many young men. I had heard a rumour in Poland last week that the book had been reprinted. Is it so? No library on the subject is complete without it."},{"Title":"Killer;: A journal of murder","review":"As the writer in 1997 said, a movie has been made, written and directed by Tim Metcalfe, can be rented in most video stores. Its a powerful drama and the only reason i can think of that it didn't get the attention &quot;Monster&quot; is getting today is that the public wasn't ready for it since the quality of the writing, directing and certainly James Woods acting should have been nominated for an Oscar."},{"Title":"Killer;: A journal of murder","review":"Why this has not been made into a movie or mini-series eludes me!Anyone who reads this book will see how far our prison system has come but how far it yet needs to go. It is the true story of a life wasted. Carl Panzram was not created evil...he was a created evil by mans inhumanity to man. I believe he possessed a great intellect as one can tell from his writings but this same intellect was disgarded to fester and rot from a very early age. Imagine...this man was deprived of any real kindness until it was already too late to make a difference in his life. Unbelievable, you say? Read this book and you will believe!"},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"I've never reviewed a children's book before. The trick, I guess, is to try to put yourself into the mindset of a 15 year old, not that of an adult - actually with this particular book, for me at least, it really wasn't very difficult at all!In any case, I flew through the book, and was sad when the end came, even after 400 pages. If these were the bed-time stories that David Field read to his children, all I can say is, what a gift it was for them.First off, Field's book is very different from Harry Potter. Actually, it speaks to an older, more mature teenager. Tommy, the protagonist in Friends & Enemies, for example, has a very different feeling toward girls in this story than Harry has in his. Tommy and Eloise hold hands, exchange longing glances and kiss each other on the cheek throughout their many harrowing adventures. The innocent love story that runs through the book, I would think, is a real attraction to readers in the mid-teenager years.And improbable twists are everywhere in the plot line! Like the cell phone that is transported back to the year 1599 along with Tommy, stashed inadvertently in his pocket, with which he can communicate with his mother, as well as his buddy back in England, both remaining in the 21st century. Then, the cell phone, \\"mobile\\" in the English vernacular of the book, must occasionally be slipped to a 16th century \\"Friend\\" to be carried back to the present to be recharged! Teenagers have got to love that kind of stuff!Tommy and Eloise are thrust into one hair-raising and scary situation after another in rapid succession, almost at the intensity of the Da Vinci Code! At every turn I kept asking, how are they ever going to get out of this one? But Field somehow comes up with a way for these teenagers-against-the-evil-in-the-world to escape in the nick of time.I'd give the book a PG-13 rating for the odd really-dastardly evil priest, or the murder of a soldier or palace guard.Remember, however, the \\"Friends\\" of the book are the ones who come through in a pinch, and \\"good\\" wins out in the end!If your teenager is outgrowing Harry Potter, and is looking for something more to sink his or her teeth into, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"I read this book in 2 days flat, and found it to be entertaining and full of adventures.Although Friends and Enemies would not be suitable for young children it would keep a child of 10 and upward facinated by the goings on of Tommy and Eloise and an adult would also find it entertaining whilst reading to a child or for their own pleasure.Friends and Enemies is a wonderfully well written book with a good mix of good and bad characters, especially the evil clergymen, and the gently blossoming romance between Tommy and Eloise, whilst the plot thickens and moves at a well timed pace.This book is well worth a read and I can assure you that you will wait the next installment with anticipation."},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"David Field, the author, is very talented. Not only is this book alive with a wonderful plot, realistic characters, great dialogue, and unique twists and turns, it's also exciting, fun and memorable.And the little bit of appropriate \\"romantic interest\\" shown by the young teens in this book is very true to life. It's all innocent--hand-holding, sly glances, and kisses on the cheek of the opposite sex--is well-written, and absolutely acceptable in a quality book of this nature.Even though it's a fantasy, in writing it, Fields obviously thought things through. His style makes it easy for his readers to accept his perfectly sensible explanations when asking us to believe the impossible. In other words, he has the writing skill to make believers of all of us.My hat's off to this author. I love reading and writing for young people, and he just might be my new mentor!!! At least, his morals are ones I will definitely emulate."},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"Excellent book: adventure, fantasy, suspense, humor, love - couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the second volume!"},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"A mixed-up holiday house swap sends Tommy and his family to spend their vacation at a French chateau. But Tommy doesn't end up at just any French chateau - this one has a time portal to the year 1599.Before he's even fully settled in for his vacation, Tommy finds himself four hundred years in the past, wearing uncomfortable clothes, and surrounded by people he doesn't know. Or does he? He's stepped into the life of Thomas de Romolue, and he seems to share the memories of the boy who looks just like him in 1599. And he falls immediately in love with the beautiful girl whose painting graces the walls in the present-day chateau - Eloise de Narbonne.Caught up in this new time period, he must act the part of this other boy, facing the evil churchmen who want to control him and the Romolue family. And his new love is threatened, so he must protect her at all costs. As Tommy and Eloise run from their pursuers, they join up with an unlikely group of characters who help them in their quest to reveal the treachery of the evildoers.In the sequel, Beings in a Dream, they finally figure out how to return to the present day, but Tommy has no idea how difficult the transition will be for Eloise. A modern day priest looks strikingly similar to the priest from 1599, and he's just as evil. Although they thought they had returned to safety, they must protect themselves in the present, just as they did in the past.Finally returning to 1599, Eloise is whisked away by the Count and Countess de Romolue to a safe place, far from Tommy. Now Tommy must find her before they can attempt to capture the evil priest from his brother's protection.The author portrays life in France in 1599 very realistically, even down to the little details like what kind of undergarments people wore, and where one would find a commode.I really enjoyed the light-hearted and sweet romance, and the antics of the unique group that comes to their aid. Tommy's use of his cellular phone, which amazingly enough actually works in 1599, was particularly clever. This is a great adventure, and I look forward to reading the third and final book in this series.Reviewer: Alice BergerBergers Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"This book really grabs you and holds you to the story, I can't put it down and if I do I dream about the characters in action."},{"Title":"Friends and Enemies","review":"Friends and Enemies is an entertaining adventure, which begins when Tommy is drawn back in time four hundred years while on holiday in France. I enjoyed reading this story immensely and found it very difficult to put it down at the end. I look forward to the sequel.Two aspects of the story particularly appealed to me. First, I enjoyed the characters and the way they interacted with each other. Tommy has modern attitudes, which contrast with the attitudes of the people he interacts with. On the other hand all the characters are very human and believable. Secondly, the plot is not straightforward or predictable - there is no remedy but to read on. I thought I might struggle to read 400 pages, but the plot and the characters led me through.In my opinion David Field is a talented story teller. My children are too young at the moment, but I will encourage them to read Friends and Enemies as young teenagers or maybe a little earlier. This story is also for those past their teenage days, like me."},{"Title":"My memories of eighty years","review":"My great uncle actually wrote this book. I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in politics or American history. He rubbed shoulders with the wealthy vanderbilts, and made many government decisions. Truly an inside look at an influential person."},{"Title":"My memories of eighty years","review":"This 1924 book is not an autobiography. The author does not mention his first wife who died in 1893 at all and does not name his second wife, whom he married in 1900. I learned about his marriages from reading the article on him in the EncyclopediaAmericana, not from reading the book. DePew's fame came from his speeches and his political activity. In 1910 he published his addresses and orations in 8 volumes! The book is not modest about its author and sounds like one would expect a garrulous man in his eighties who is used to being deferred to would sound, telling what a great guy he is and what great people he has known (every President from Lincoln to Coolidge!). The book was written before Harding died and DePew says Harding is \\"developing the highest qualities of leadership.\\" This quote illustrates a flaw in the book: he usually only tells us good things about people he knew, tho he must have known interesting unfavorable things about many of the people he talks about. All in all, I enjoyed reading this book by a man who was a household name in his lifetime but I suppose is unknown to most people today. I found the book in a college library. (I like college libraries--they don't weed out old books as public libraries too often do.)"},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"I found this book to be very touching and sentimental.

So you have to fill in all the rest yourself and imagine you're watching two people on a stage. You learn a little about their relationship, but not much. You have many blanks to fill in.I wouldn't mind seeing this as a play, but as a book, it was kind of hollow."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"Alan Zweibel's account of his friendship with the late Gilda Radner is astounding, and is described beautifully in this touching book. I was hooked from the very first page, and would lovingly recommend it to anyone.Using such a marvelous display of friendship and affection, Zweibel reminisces about the very early stages of their friendship all the way until her untimely death in 1989. Illustrations also accompany the pages, and add even more character to an already fantastic story.To those who remember Gilda, this book will serve as a gentle reminder of the struggle friends encounter when a friend battles disease. To those who do not, this book also gives insight into two very wonderful people whos friendship will never die- the talented Gilda, and her writer and best friend Alan Zweibel."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"A wonderful book detailing the late Gilda Radner's relationship with her close friend Alan Zwiebel.

In this poignant yet very funny book, the author pays homage to a woman he worked with for over 14 years and with whom he had sort of a love story.Using recreated dialogues between Gilda and himself, Mr. Zweibel recounts their first meeting on the set of Saturday Night Live when Gilda asks him if he will write a scene for her where she is a parakeet. From this opening story we then see their friendship forged as they work together, vacation together, get mad at one another and finally comfort one another over various events in their lives. Mr. Zweibel captures the essence of two young people in crazy business on the brink of great success beautifully and we revel in their friendship. There are so many wonderful moments I will remember like when Gilda talks about her fame and Alan is overjoyed when he gets a credit card and gets another one to pay off the first one. The when we read from the night when John Lennon dies outside of Gilda's apartment house to asking Alan to meet her new love, Gene Wilder. And as we are laughing all too soon our joy turns to sorrow as Gilda is diagnosed with ovarian cancer ending her life too shortly at 39.This is a wonderful love story about two people who meet and fall in love even if isn't the same kind of conventional love story you might have expected.Read this book - you'll laugh, you'll cry and end the bookWishing we still had this talented woman still among us and especially that our sort of love story with Gilda went on forever."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"If you are a fan of Gilda Radner's, then Bunny Bunny is the best book ever! The way that Alan Zweibel wrote about Gilda is so inspirational that you'll be saying Bunny Bunny as well! We all remember and love Gilda Radner and this book definitely allows her legacy to live on!"},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"We all love Gilda. How could you not? This play, somehow, makes us love her even more. It lets us into her world and see her insecurities as told by loyal companion Alan Zweibel. The treasure of the play is that every scene, even the ones written about Gilda and Alan's fights, are full of love for Gilda. You never fail to grasp how much Alan cared for her and we can't help but to care for her, too. Alan may not be the best playwright and some of the scenes certainly are underwhelming, but when there is so much admiration imbued in the words, there's no choice. This play is going to make you laugh your face off and cry your eyes out. When we performed it (With myself as the supporting characters) we had people crying in our lobby at the close of the show. Performing the play gives wonderful opportunities to actors. The chance to play Gilda is rare and completely enriching for an actress. Alan gives an actor a wonderful chance to control an evening and illustrate love and compassion. And for the actor(s) playing the support roles, you get full reign to unleash everything in your comedy arsenal and play handfuls of different characters. The best part about Bunny, Bunny is that even if you're not a theatre person and you NEVER intend on watching this play, directing it, acting in it, etc. you will still find this play well worth the read for its nostalgia, love, and beauty. It'll have you saying \\"Bunny, bunny\\" on the first of every month, too.PS As an additional bonus, Alan Zweibel is completely approachable and friendly. Read the play and send him an e-mail. He'll probably answer and it will be him, not some cookie cutter response from a publicist. He's such a kind soul."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"Given their talent, the collaboration of Alan Zweibel and Gilda Radner was destined to be successful and hilarious. Bunny Bunny gives readers a glimpse into SNL's early success and provides readers with vivid flashbacks of the wonderful personalities and humor that the world embraced. But even more touching, is the revelation of a special friendship and vulnerability that's rarely seen (or shared) in the industry. This is my holiday gift book favorite for my SNL-fan friends."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"I'm a big Gilda Radner fan & after reading another Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live (a book that was highly worth the read) I wanted to learn more about this great comedienne. The reviews on this book looked really good & I thought I would learn more from a person who actually worked with her one-on-one at SNL. However, what I received was an interpretation on Zweibel's relationship with Gilda and what seemed (in his mind, anyway) to be a romantic relationship that never was fully pursued by her. It made me wonder what her interpretation of it would be considering that most of her time with SNL was either dating Bill Murray or G.E. Smith. The book is written as a script - which is something that they do not tell you in the description or that I completely missed - but that aside, the tone comes off as whiny and a little like a figment of Zweibel's imagination of what happened. On the bright side, the book is a quick read, so at least I didn't waste a week of my life reading it. I wouldn't recommend it, however, to anyone wanting to get a more specific look into Gilda's life and times."},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","review":"What a wonderful friendship Alan Zweibel had with Gilda Radner.

Some of them are here and they tickle my heart to read and hear them again. I love the language and love the stories that go along with the sayings. With that said, what I find disapointing about this particular book is the lack of context for some of these sayings. Some of them go \\"richt o'r me 'ead\\" and without context or a description/translation are lost on me. Of course, I know this book is more of a tongue-in-cheek treatise of Doric sayings, but one can learn even from the comedic approach given the context or meaning. One for the collection, but a near miss for education and entertainment.P.S. I love all of Douglas Kynoch's other books.

I felt myself responding to his anecdotes and presentation of case studies in a similar way while I was reading Jung's biography, \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\".The book addresses those who feel a growing loss of control in their life, those who have realized all their dreams but still find something amiss, and those who in looking at their current life realize it's nothing like what they felt it should be.We should be aware of our own intuition, sense, and wisdom, yet as Hollis points out, this often is not the case. That what we believe are our personal reactions and motivators are in fact heavily laid by our parents, church, society, etc. We all of course are influenced by our upbringing, but often we adopt and internalize these influences in ways that disrupts or prohibits our own self from developing.I traveled for 3 years around the world, and when I returned to the US, I couldn't function. This book helped me understand why. I couldn't return to my old life or my old relationships. It wasn't so much that I had changed, but rather I was trying to reenter a life that was never really mine. Why do some of us stay in unhealthy relationships and then one day leave? Perhaps we get sick of our sickness, and realizing that we (conscious or not) often allow other's to influence, control, or divide our being in detrimental ways is the beginning. Until we develop this individuation, we are not really experiencing a real freedom of choice. And the way that James Hollis addresses this, and speaks to the reader is wonderful and delivered with an intellect based in wisdom and caring."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"I bought James Hollis' book, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, with great hope of reading something that would be extremely helpful and mind-expanding. I had never read a book with such a provocative title, so I had high hopes of finding something that would take me to new realms of thinking. Unfortunately for me, it did not come close to doing that. If anything, it did give me courage, however, to stand on my own and dare to offer a dissenting opinion to all the customer reviews before mine who thought it was a great book. I felt his sentence structure was very wordy and, thus, his main points could have been distilled into a book of about 50 pages, instead of 260. My biggest objection is that Dr. Hollis used very vague and general terms without ever definining any of them or giving any examples. He was clearly negative about New Age thinking, criticizing it for offering \\"seductive, ungrounded spiritual practices that seek to finesse the question of suffering,\\" yet he never gives any concrete examples of what he means or defines any of his terms, such as \\"seductive\\" or \\"ungrounded.\\" Most importantly, he talked quite a bit about \\"wholeness\\" and \\"being whole\\" yet never really defined what that meant, while learning how to become \\"whole\\" was the most important objective of the entire book! So, in the final analysis, I didn't come away with any further insights, any sense of greater clarity, or direction as to where to go next in this most important spiritual quest. Perhaps he was writing for an audience who needs no examples, as the previous reviewers didn't seem to need, but I do need examples and greater clarity to find a book meaningful and helpful. So, for me, the book was too frustratingly general and obtuse to be able to recommend it."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"When my only son went to college, I was struggling with the common issue of the empty nest, and finding meaning in the new chapter of life that I was beginning. A cynical parent I knew quipped sarcastically, \\"Get a life!\\" I've had a life, thank you, I responded inwardly. An all-absorbing, rewarding one. That's why I can't just turn off a switch and disengage.This woman's trite clich&eacute; trivialized the complex process of switching gears when one's kids leave home, glossing over the grief-loss component and midlife transition issues. A wiser, wittier friend offered this advice: \\"Find a new source of meaning, and try not to get too fat.\\"I perused many books about letting go of our college age kids and our old parenting role, and looking forward to the future. But this book by a Jungian psychoanalyst offered the richest, deepest perspective on the second half of life I had ever found.Like most books based on Carl Jung's depth psychology, Dr. Hollis' book is not for the squeamish or the shallow. It is not self-help lite, promising the reader magic, instant personal reinvention by learning a few superficial principles.Through a discussion of the lives of many midlife adults, facing crossroads requiring great courage, embracing the heretofore ignored \\"shadow\\" in their souls, Dr. Hollis invites the reader into the deep end of the pool. In the second half of life, the author asserts, it is our developmental task, to individuate, to become more authentically ourselves.Carl Jung's insightful quote about \\"the afternoon of life\\" might well be on the back cover of this book:\\"A human being would certainly not grow to be seventy or eighty years old if this longevity had no meaning for the species. The afternoon of human life must also have a significance of its own and cannot be merely a pitiful appendage to life's morning. The significance of the morning undoubtedly lies in the development of the individual, our entrenchment in the outer world, the propagation of our kind, and the care of our children. This is the obvious purpose of nature. But when this purpose has been attained - and more than attained - shall the earning of money, the extension of conquests, and the expansion of life go steadily on beyond the bounds of all reason and sense? Whoever carries over into the afternoon the law of the morning, or the natural aim, must pay for it with damage to his soul, just as surely as a growing youth who tries to carry over his childish egoism into adult life must pay for this mistake with social failure.\\"(\\"The Stages of Life\\" (1930).

James Hollis's book is in my opinion the best book I have read on mid-life issues. I would not describe it as a self help book. It is more like a book of wisdom on the nature of the process, but you still have to do the work. He is a professor of literature who transformed into a Jungian analyst. His spiritual orientation is comfortable and accepting. He takes a little bit of what I would describe as an existentialist point of view that I found discordant for me. His knowledge of literature and the ability to weave in bits and pieces from many literary works was fun. He comes from a Jungian perspective which works well for me at this point in life. I frankly feel that the Jungian perspective is one our entire culture needs to look at much more seriously. He brings great depth and wisdom to the Jungian approach to growth of us human beings.

In the second half of life Hollis highlights that the things that gave us a purpose and established us in the first half of life are no longer a guide to fullfilment later. He calls the reader to recognise what is good in their life and consider the value of the rest. He ask the reader to be open to the anxiety and uncertainty that the answers to these questions will bring. This he reminds the reader is a quest for meaning and so his book does not provide a cookbook of answers but a series of reflections on the issues that may present in the search.James Hollis is a Jungian analyst so the quest reminds me of the film \\"the Wizard of Oz\\" - one of the films I hate most! A consequence of this is Hollis assumes things will be well if we follow our souls destiny. This is what I would call a nice American Liberal Arts viewpoint but of course is not necessarily true. Hollis accepts that the quest is difficult and potentially very rewarding but does not address the flip side - i.e. what if it doesn't work out. Throwing off the shackles of ones old life is something that must be carefully considered in light of an uncertain outcome. This is an excellent book that I would highly recommend with the cavet that the reader in finding his or her destiny should \\"make haste slowly\\"."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"Not unlike James Hillman who reminds us that \\"psyche\\" means \\"soul,\\" and that psychotherapy is not treating, but serving the soul, so James Hollis expands and applies this concept to those of us who have reached the second half of life.

The book is convicting and at the same time filled with sentences of salvation. I only wish such a text was available to me in the first half of my personal and professional life.

It is so thoughtful and provocative that, to my surprise, I read it twice. My husband also read it, and it has led to such lovely conversations.James Hollis is not the purveyor of simple cheer or bromides. He is interested in helping us ask the question, \\"What new thing do I have to learn about myself in the world?\\"and then giving us some guidance in figuring out how we might possibly answer it.This book is neither hard nor easy to read.

With this process, comes insurmountable joy in every area of your life. With this book, you can understand how this process works, so that you can bring into your conscious awareness what has previously been hidden in the unconscious, and once this is brought into your awareness, personal alchemy occurs.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in bringing greater meaning into his or her life.

There were moments of pure revelation that explained to me really who I am; why I react to problems the way I do; why I continue patterns in my life that I know don't work. I also found passages that offered me validation for some of the paths I have taken, as well as the times I have trusted my judgement and core beliefs, even when they seemed at odds with what others wanted.

At 46 I find every chapter thought-provoking, and have read the book three times, once just reading it, then compelled to reread it while underlining a few passages and, finally, reading it while taking notes and journaling.Granted, he draws heavily from Jung, but the concepts are presented with a 21st Century relevance. I find that I actually take solace in its pages; with reassurances that, while this path is challenging, I am not alone in sorting out what carries meaning here in the second half.If you are younger than, say, 40, or you are a big fan of bullet points vs. elegant prose, then this book is probably not for you. But if 50 has too suddenly appeared on the horizon (or just blown past) and a little reevaluation might be in order, I think you'll find some gold in these pages."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"As with his previous books, James Hollis offers no easy answers, no magic formula for happiness, no 10 or 12 or 20 simple steps -- which explains the disappointment of some previous reviewers, I guess, who obviously wanted the hard work done for them. But isn't that one of the most pernicious illusions we have to shed, if we truly want to find personal meaning? We have to accept that *we've* got to do the digging, the discovering, the accepting. Even if we have helpful guides along the way, in the end it's up to us, since an adult is ultimately responsible for his/her life.So Hollis presents us with the tough questions, the ones we need to ask ourselves without flinching or making excuses for our hesitancy & failures. The poetry, the excerpts from literature & myth, are potent models & examples for us -- not to follow blindly, but to mull over & use as illumination for our own lives. Striving for wholeness & authenticity isn't easy, which is why so many step away from it more than once, unwilling to go forward. But it's the only worthwhile goal for life, especially the second half of life. Once we realize that our time is limited, that we must find or make our own meaning, rather than depending on others to provide it -- well, once you feel that in your gut, in the marrow of your bones, then you know there's simply no time to waste on self-imposed obstacles or distractions. Every day is precious, and should be put to good use. Whatever has wounded us in the past, whatever has hampered us, can no longer be used as an excuse: once we see & know what restrains us, then we're responsible for dealing with it. The choice is ours ... and perhaps that's what's so terrifying for some people.So here is a book to read, contemplate, and then read again. It doesn't promise instant happiness, only the prospect of hard but rewarding work. The quest for personal meaning awaits, and sooner or later we've all got to embark upon it.

I've read most of them. As a Jungian he is a master at spoon feeding the masses. Yet a major theme that Jung invested his energy into, namely the re-imaging of God, seems widely avoided by today's Jungians. It was critical to Jung to find a parallel or orthogonal way forward so that he would not have to abandon the Christian heritage he grew up with (his father was a Pastor). Where is the Jungian God hiding out now? They like to dance around the subject, intellectually agreeing that the \\"gods\\" reside inside of us and take up residence in various forms of neurosis. But where is the God that made matter and wound the laws of nature into the emptiest cube of space (wound in the rules governing matter before there were atoms to rule even)? The early conceptions of God were of course primitive but can a modern man be \\"whole\\" believing there is no God and no future but death? Is the purpose of psychology in the end to make us more comfortable on the road to non-existence? Enough ranting. I'd like to see some Jungian theories of God.

I would recommend this book to others, especially through Amazon."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"If you think that the subtitle of Hollis's book (\\"How to Finally, Really Grow Up\\") sounds vaguely, uncomfortably judgmental, you should probably go with that feeling. Hollis would most likely say that your unconscious, or your most inner psyche, or your \\"real\\" self is urging you to avoid the book because it--your inner, \\"real\\" self--knows what your fake, outer self does not: your real self knows that Hollis's book, although peppered with a few sound or accurate-sounding observations, is so thoroughly salted with Jungian generalizations and logical fallacies that most crops growing in that earth are sickly and frail, easily knocked over by the first strong gust of reason.Further, Hollis--or at least the Hollis persona that wrote this book--would seem also likely to tell you that even if you heard and heeded your inner, real self and so avoided this book, the avoidance would bring you no pleasure. For, you see, there is no peace of mind to be had, apparently under any circumstance: if you are depressed, it is because your subconscious realizes that you're living a meaningless illusion; if you are nervous or anxious, it is because you are breaking away from the illusion and therefore your subconscious is frightened at leaving the comfort of the familiar; and if you are neither depressed nor ridden with anxiety, then you clearly are not listening to your inner self and are, instead, content to live a hollow life in a state of sadly foolish, even cowardly, existential denial.Hollis's premise in this book is that \\"there is a will within each of us, quite outside the range of conscious control, a will which knows what is right for us\\" (p 21); that the mid-life crisis inevitably results from one's subconscious, all-knowing will conflicting with the conscious, yet always illusory feelings and ideas that one has about one's own happiness, destiny, and life; and that only by recognizing that one has been suckered by the illusions of the world and the mistreatments suffered in childhood will one finally be free to live the truly meaningful existence that one's inner will desires and needs. Then, you see, one will finally have grown up.Oh, and of course one will be emotionally uncomfortable then, too. But that's okay. Because *that* emotional discomfort shows that one is a spiritually intelligent, clear-eyed adult. Not like that other, previous emotional discomfort, which was present because one was being spiritually dull and blind.Hollis makes a few observations that are sound and helpful to recognize, for example about the difficulty usually involved in making life-altering decisions (30), the long-lasting effects that childhood experiences can have on adult behavior (47), and the self-destructive behavior of emotionally needy people (59). However, Hollis always either prefaces or follows these observations with over-generalization or, more frequently, the \\"either/or\\" fallacy, insisting, whether explicitly or tacitly, that the reader must agree with him or be wrong. In fact, Chapter Three, \\"The Collision of Selves,\\" is an extended version of a theme begun in Chapter Two as a way to discredit any reader who may find Hollis's assertions questionable. \\"Whoever has not discovered this truth about the fragility of our journey,\\" writes Hollis, \\"and the persuasive power of our necessary adaptations to this vulnerability, is living in a form of self-delusion that psyche, fate, or the consequences of our acts will sooner or later bring to the surface\\" (68).In other words, if you disagree with Hollis's book not only are you wrong, but that very disagreement is evidence that what Hollis writes is true.It's a neat rhetorical maneuver, one that smacks of the disingenuous, but it is completely necessary, for unless the reader accepts, completely and unquestioningly, Hollis's assertion of the power and correctness of the subconscious will as the \\"real\\" person, the book's argument falls quite apart immediately. Further, even if the reader is willing to accept the book's dubious premise--even if he or she does indeed trust James Hollis to define what it means \\"to Finally, Really Grow Up\\"--there seems little positive that can come from these pages, for the spiritually mature person, it seems, will simply be trading one sort of unhappiness for another. Hollis writes, \\"Clearly, psychological or spiritual development always requires a greater capacity in us for the toleration of anxiety and ambiguity. The capacity to accept this troubled state, abide it, and commit to life, is the moral measure of our maturity\\" (40).If one disagrees with those statements--if one feels that serenity or happiness is *not* inevitably a sign of spiritual blindness--then one might be well advised to skip this particular book and to spend one's hard-earned fifteen dollars elsewhere. There are many alternatives. In fact, no small number of available books, whether written by psychologists or spiritual leaders, maintain that emotional and spiritual wisdom eventually makes one feel *good.*However, if one really believes that peace of mind is unobtainable and/or that suffering is the only reliable sign of emotional or spiritual gain, then one should buy Hollis's book.

I was disapointed to see thatappoximately 15 pages into the book, a paragraph had been underlined in pen and askterisked. I might have been able to overlook this had the underlined paragraph been something that was of interest to me but it was not. I had purchased this book to read and then loan to client's in my psychotherapy practice and now I am reluctant to do so let they belive that I am endorsing the the statements in the above mentioned underlined paragraph.

Rather than providing insight, information, or inspiration about how people have come to find meaning in the second half of life, this book is one long harangue about the illusions and problems people have. There are many invocations of fancy metaphors (Greek tragedy, psychological lingo), but they serve more to show what a fancy education the writer has than to offer meaningful inspiration or guidance to the reader. The author goes on and on about how people ruin their lives and fool themselves, but never seems to get around to describing how to break out of these illusions and lead an authentic or meaningful life, besides \\"abandoning illusions\\". Of course everyone's path is unique, and so a pure \\"how to\\" approach won't work to untangle each person's uniquely tangled web, but providing concrete examples of successes, not just problems from his supposedly successful decades of work as a therapist would provide hope and some sort of guidance for those of us who realize we've reached a dead end and need to do something about it. That is what I was expecting from the title - this book definitely has not delivered."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"The information is great however, it is really difficult to read.

BE SURE TO ALSO READ \\"THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE\\" TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"The book is more appropriately entitled Introduction to Jungian Psychology because it primarily introduces and repeats endlessly the basic terminology and thinking of Jung. According to the author there is an essential Self and a soul and psyche which younger people constantly ignore. Instead they are under the sway of influences and perceptions that lead them down a path that will ultimately be in conflict with their core Selves. But people in the second half of their lives invariably have an \\"aha\\" moment where they realize something is wrong, and if their ego is sufficiently strong, they can begin a journey to finally becoming who they should be.There seems to be much to question here. The duality of the superficial self and the true Self seems to be accepted unquestionably. I'm certain that is controversial. Secondly all people have to make compromises with social realities, especially when one is younger. The author seems to think that such adaptations represent some kind of pathology. And furthermore, getting older does not make those social demands disappear. Obviously, some exhibit patterns of behavior that are clearly counterproductive, but that is not the author's main argument.There is little of practical usefulness in this book. There is the constant recitation of people not being who they should be, not living a large life, etc, with virtually no realistic, concrete analysis of social realities and possibilities for change. One can be in the wrong job or be married to the wrong person without violating one's true Self. One suspects that there are more useful psychological paradigms on which to base changes in one's life.As another reviewer commented, the author more than implies that a therapist is needed to lead one to the promised land. Why write the book? Who is his audience?"},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"When we are young, we dream of succeeding in a career, creating a family, establishing a social position in the world and making money, lots of it. In psychological parlance: developing and structuring our ego. With the coming of years, having achieved or not our first half of life goals, we get to the middle-age crisis and our objectives should change.The psychological literature abounds with books dealing with the subject. One of the best I recommend is \\"Finding meaning in the second half of life\\", by James Hollis. He is a Jungian analyst, but his writings do not require any knowledge of Jungian psychology. This book starts with the statement: Your life is addressing these questions to you. It follows eleven very trying questions that we have to answer if we search for happiness.The introduction and the eleven chapter that follows halp you to answer the questions, forcing you to think about your life and giving you a chance to be happy.Happiness; you won't get it if you don't find a meaning for your life. You better answer Hollis's questions. Otherwise, the crisis may come to you, sent by theFinding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow UpSelf, which is the divine inside our psyche. The objective of the Self is to induce us to change the way we face life, to correct our life journey. Our old objectives, valid for the first half of our life, have to be changed, and the Self creates problems in our life, stones in the middle of the road to induce us into the right direction, into the right journey of growth. As Jung call it, the journey of individuation.This is a must book if you strive for happiness.Roberto Lima Netto www.amazon.com/author/rlimanetto"},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"I started reading this book a few weeks back after having a deep depression and issues arise that had my mind on edge. The short version of what I found where, that while I do like some of the concepts and revelations that Dr. Hollis presents, his first chapter promises common, understandable language and I found the book to be a very deliberate, high level read. I think others in crisis could use more plain talk and less abstract supporting thoughts. That is not to say there is no value. Quite the contrary. I think once my mind is more settled I will turn back to this book for a more in depth, concentrated read. Then I'll render a more global review.Basically, my opinion is, if you are still in the throws of internal conflict, or the pain of life is still fresh in your mind, I think this book will be a difficult read. If you already have some perspective on your situation, and are open to look deeply at yourself and your part in the world, it has some good points and value."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"The content is wonderful (though am I the only person who thinks Hollis' books all start to sound the same?).

His latest contribution to a series of books I cannot live without is as exceptional as the rest. In an intelligent and thought-provoking manner, Hollis encourages the reader to examine what lies under the emptiness at mid-life despite having attained all of society's achievements such as marriage, career and financial success. He challenges us to discover what forces and fears formed us, and how our lives have been shaped as a result. His words lead you towards finding meaning and also a personal spiritual connection for your life. This is no \\"Step One: Do This\\" and \\"Step Two: Do That\\" formula that is all too common in self help literature. Instead, Hollis takes you to the place where you can actually understand why you do what you do, why your intimate relationships fail, why your work lacks meaning, and why you feel disconnected from the world around you. He teaches you how your responses to normal anxiety have taken you further and further away from understanding your life by avoiding the things that discomfort you. He gives you the courage to put aside your frenzied existence, and confront the wounds carried since childhood. I feel blessed to live in Houston where Hollis heads the C.G. Jung Educational Center and routinely teaches. It is rare to have access to such great wisdom. This book and the many others by Hollis, most especially The Eden Project, provide readers an opportunity to access the knowledge and experience of the world's leading expert on Jungian psychology. My life has been completely changed by learning from Hollis."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"This is a terrific book, really a synthesis of many undercurrents of psychological wisdom explored in contemporary terms. I savored it over several weeks, reading a few pages a day, so that I could fully absorb and reflect on James Hollis's insights. Both penetrating and accessible, the book also provided a common vocabulary to talk over the real issues with a friend going through a hard time. (\\"This book is me,\\" was how he expressed his feelings of relief and validation.)James Hollis writes with clarity and compassion about profound and complex dilemmas, in a deeply engaging way that reflects his personal and professional experience. The best thing about FINDING MEANING IN THE SECOND HALF OF LIFE is that rather than providing easy answers it asks the right questions, so that one is inspired to further evolve toward her own truth. I also recommend James Hollis's other books for their soulful exploration of meaning that can be pragmatically and creatively absorbed."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"In these times of extensive power-posturing, blame and fear-mongering from our leaders, it is a relief to have this voice of genuine strength and courage gently working its way into our psyche and society. This voice is James Hollis, Ph.D and he blazes the path toward giving meaning to the second half of our lives.We can learn how to forgive the unavoidable mistake called \\"the first half of our life\\" and go confidently forward into the second, with our compassionate guide, James Hollis.With his writings, he serves as the scout that we need to enter this uncharted territory within ourselves. We need not be scared to enter these depths. We can do this effectively if we read and heed the words of this sage.I credit Hollis and his book \\"Eden Project, in Search of the Magical Other\\" for saving my marriage. I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship. Hollis will guide you in an eloquent way through relationships and where we tend to go wrong in them. I look around me, at all the dissatisfied couples and think, they could save a lot of misery and money if instead of getting new partners, sports cars and face lifts, they just bought a copy of the Eden Project. It is not light reading, it is not band-aid psychology, but it is well worth the effort.Now Dr. Hollis will guide us through the second half of life with this book.

Any book that has a 16 page introduction to make sure the reader is properly positioned for what is in the book is a good sign. As avertised, no quick fixes are available in this book.

The author clearly recognizes a problem which faces all of us in the second half of life and often earlier and offers the challenge of a solution. My problems with the book are (1) it is hard to read often because of what I perceive as the author's default to academic writing and not writing which is geared to a general audience not used to such complex concepts professionally expressed. Expressing the ideas the author wants to communicate in layman's terms would have been more effective in communicating the content; (2) more concrete examples of the concepts of projection, complexes, etc. would also have made me as a reader more comfortable with what I thought I understood from the book. Other authors I believe have been able to express Jung's concepts in ways more easily understood by those of us who are not philosophers or psychologists. Despite these concerns, I highly recommend the book because Dr. Hollis discusses an issue all of us knows exists even if we deny it and frequently his prose is engaging."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"I found this book a godsend at this stage in my life.

Many terms that other authors attempt to describe such as psyche, ego, transference, etc., are really very difficult to follow. Hollis does an exceptional job in breaking Jungian terms open for the reader. Of course, this does not say that it is a particularly easy read as I believe the book is probably most beneficial for someone who has studied psychology somewhat, even if on his or her on. The most amazing part of the book (for me) is that the author really speaks to the crisis of mid-life. As someone who feels as though he has just faced this :) the book was most helpful not in telling me what to do, but rather the questions that I need to reflect on to live a fuller life in the second half of life. I have recommended this book to others as well. I look forward to reading Dr. Hollis' other books as this was my first."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"I really enjoyed this book--read it three times.

In fact, it can be a very frustrating book. It does an excellent job of raising issues you probably need to address, but offers nothing by way of how to address them. I imagine if you ask the author about this, he would say your issues need to be addressed in therapy over a long time.

I have bought many of these books and given them to friends and family. Hoping, if only, they will read a sentence or two every once in a while. Highly recommended for anyone going through that time that comes mid-life (whenever that time comes does not have to be any specific age) and the soul searching begins of why am I here, what should I do that has more meaning to me, what is life all about and how it affects me and how I can affect life."},{"Title":"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up","review":"A must read for baby Boomers wondering where their journey leads.

Every chapter alternates from one timeline to the other. First chapter tells of Paul starting a pilgrimage of sorts on what would have been the 6th birthday of his dead son. He is going to the seaside town where he died, and where Paul lived some of the few moments of happiness in his life. Chapter 2 reels back to his days in art school, where he met his wife Ruth, and where his days of true happiness began. Paul had a very sad childhood, among secrets and hidden feelings, his mother dead and his father emotionally absent. The death of his son gives Paul an opportunity to reflect on his losses. As tragic as his pilgrimage is, it ends up on what to me sounds like a hopeful note of acceptance."},{"Title":"Crustaceans","review":"Andrew Cowan's newest novel begins in sadness: the narrator Paul addresses his dead son Euan with a muted sorrow that finds the beauty in the most simple of scenes. This quietly emotional novel continues on a journey of the past to explore Paul's relationship with Euan as well as with others integral to his life, including his own father. Illuminated by his grief for Euan, Paul's life comes into sharp focus as the author leads the reader inexorably to the conclusion.This is a purely literary work, recommended for those who love language and the meanings of gestures, who like to discover greater truths through the details of ordinary lives. Cowan's prose is lyrical yet clear, at times self-conscious but always impressive. His abundant talents for literary fiction are on full display in this book. However, if you are searching for an uplifting book with a compelling plot, I recommend that you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Thinner At Last","review":"The book jacket describes Phen/fen in these terms: &quot;These totally safe, fully endorsed medications are NOT amphetamines and are NOT addictive...&quot;These medicines never were proven safe or approved by the FDA for combination treatment.

The drug company's lawyers and their medical spin doctors would confuse the issue of just how dangerous these medicines are, but their danger is not limited to heart valve damage, or PPH.

Some have have experienced psychosis and suicidal depression coming off of these drugs.It would please me, someone who experienced some of these symptoms, to see Dr. Lamm and Simon and Schuster share in the staggering financial liability because of the Phen/fen disaster.Something tells me that Dr. Lamm et. al. will slither away from legal responsiblity, but lets hope not from moral responsibilty."},{"Title":"Thinner At Last","review":"Dear sirs,I read Dr. Lamms book in May 1996 upon my introduction to the drugs.

Eagleton asks us to think critically about what these words imply, instead of accepting interpretations which we may have inherited.It is extremely theorectical, very much academic and written in a style can feel like the author is deliberately trying to exclude readers. It is full of specific literary references - most of the time it doesn't make a huge difference if you don't know the work in question,but other times it does. Eagleton slows down for nobody, nor is he one to offer explanations for certain things where they might be needed.This book is not about international relations, foreign policy or the differences between civilizations. It is a reflection, and as such it works very well indeed. Overall a commendable piece of work."},{"Title":"Holy Terror","review":"As early as the first page of this work Eagelton shows his political colors. He accuses the Pentagon and the United States of being guilty of terror in the same way as those Islamic groups which deliberately target civilians are. This is an irresponsible and mistaken claim.In fact Eagelton's method of mixing literary references with matter- of - fact happenings give a sense that he has no real experience , no true understanding of the subject. The gruesome cruel deliberate targeting of civilians for political purposes is not much illuminated by abstruse and complicated jargon- making.Terror's is not holy. It is Evil."},{"Title":"Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri Tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy","review":"NOMADS OF SOUTH PERSIA was written in the 1950s when the (nearly always male) researchers tried to conform to a perceived scientific norm. At the time, Barth wrote a book for specialists, not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However, anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today, or, if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work \\"social history\\" now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology, you will have a hard time following several chapters. However, there are a number of interesting matters, for example, the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally, nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle, due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger, sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary, not as separate ethnic groups so much, but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers, but among nomads, though all were subject to the chief, each household maintained considerable freedom and, as long as they had enough animals, economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic, social, and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time, or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice, given a reader more sense of people and place, examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent, or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas, self-revelation was not often thought of in that era, we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was, and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said, but with three months, he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus, if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri, a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead, Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that, but questions do remain."},{"Title":"Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri Tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy","review":"Had a paper to do in school and this was one of only around two books I could find.

Author Wislawa Szymborska, who earned the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996, offers poignantly insightful lyrics that cut straight to the emotional quick of the reader. A Memory: We were chatting / and suddenly stopped short. / A lovely girl stepped onto the terrace, / so lovely, / too lovely / for us to enjoy our trip. // Basia shot her husband a stricken look. / Krystyna took Zbyszek's hand / reflexively. / I thought: I'll call you, / tell you, don't come just yet, / they're predicting rain for days. // Only Agnieszka, a widow, / met the lovely girl with a smile."},{"Title":"Monologue of a Dog","review":"This is a set of selected poems by Wieslawa Szymborska.

I like the arrangement of this book, each line is translated on the corresponding line on the following page."},{"Title":"Monologue of a Dog","review":"Lovely, thoughtful, deep, unusual, musings on painful or fascinating contradictions...SO EASY to READ and UNDERSTAND.

It is truly inspiring."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"I first read this book more than a decade ago and can still remember how it made me feel, can't say that about many books. For those who crave the fast pace of the big city fueled by high speed internet and espresso with a smart phone near at hand this book is probably not for you. If you daydream about escaping the frenzy then this is the book for you. That it was written 70 years ago makes no matter it's as relevant as ever. The story line rambles and goes off on unexpected tangents just like life in the country. It leaves the read with a craving for a slower pave of life in the country. Do yourself a favor read this classic."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"Interesting writing style, like that of a storyteller. Informative, yet refreshingly humorous.

It didn't seem to go anywhere. The author just kept describing things without much rhyme or reason.

It is a good book though. I enjoyed reading it very much."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable to read you will ever find. It is written in such a clear, humorous and timeless style that you would swear it was written yesterday instead of in 1942. Each chapter answers a question that would arise upon hearing that one had decided to live in the deep woods of Maine---how you do school your children? How do you keep in touch with society? How do you keep house? There are pictures and the kind of nitty gritty details we all like to read! In addition to just being great to read, I think this book is a very important one. I would say it had a part in starting at least two trends. One is the back to the land movement. At the time it was written, you just simply didn't decide to get away from it all and live in the woods! I think this book, which was extremely popular when it came out, put some unique ideas in a lot of heads and may have had a big part in giving people ideas about alternative ways of living. Also, I think it's one of the first autobiograpical books of its type---written plainly but with humor about a unique way of living. I think this book, which in my knowledge has never been out of print, is really one of the key non-fiction works of the 20th century. But don't read it for that, read it because it's fun to read and you will love it!"},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"Louise Rich is not what you might expect a person who has given up the &quot;essentials&quot; of life to be. She is not trying to escape, not trying to save the wilderness, prove a point or return to her roots. Her motivation, quite simply, is that she likes where she lives and is willing to put up with a fair amount of discomfort to stay there. Moreover, she is mightily amused by the questions she is frequently asked by friends and acquaintances, the most common being:&quot;How do you make a living?&quot;&quot;But, you don't live here all the year round?&quot;&quot;Isn't housekeeping difficult?&quot;&quot;What do you do with all your spare time?&quot;&quot;Don't you ever get bored?&quot;&quot;Aren't you ever frightened?&quot;&quot;Don't you get awfully out of touch?&quot;&quot;Do you get out very often?&quot;and&quot;Is it worth-while?&quot;Rich's eminently practical, and amusing answers to these questions form the basis of this book and will keep you grinning from ear to ear for hours.It is clear from the start that Louise and her husband Ralph are more than capable of taking care of and amusing one another, and things only get better with the addition of various family members. These include Gerrish, their friend and handyman, son Rufus, daughter Sally, postman Larry, a skunk, five huskies, a marten and an ongoing parade of visitors, neighbors and &quot;sports&quot; (that's backwoods for tourists).You will be treated to Rich's opinions on a wide variety of subjects, including women's fashions (and why she couldn't care less what she wears in the woods), the futility of trying to do housework when you're married to a man who loves motors, how to plan meals that take the weather's idiosyncrasies into account, the best way avoid getting lost, cut with an axe or burned by a stove. Even better, you will be taken along on a whole series of hilarious escapades as Rich learns how to cope with life in the woods.With wry amusement she tells of the day she and her husband delivered their son on their own, her trip to the &quot;Outside&quot; after not having left the woods for 4 years, and the afternoon she spent cooking dinner for a bunch of lumberjacks. Here too are entertaining stories of playing tag with a family of foxes, going berry picking, pulling porcupine quills out of dogs, learning to tie fishing flies and locating hunters who get lost.The real gift of this book however, is the chance to spend time with Rich herself. Here is someone it would be worth a long hike through snowy woods to visit. You'll feel like you've made a friend by the time the book is finished."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"My mother gave me this book many years ago when I was a young woman. I was a bit &quot;blue&quot; at the time and she said it always gave her a lift to read it and hoped it would do the same for me. Did it ever! I've read it at least 10 times over the years and will probably read it ten more. Louise Rich's description of life in the back woods of Maine in the 30's made me want to go there and parts of the book are hillarious. It truly makes one long for a simpler, gentler time."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"Like many others, I was lucky enough to discover &quot;We Took to the Woods&quot; in a used book store. From the first page, Mrs. Rich's description of her family's withdrawl from urban life to the peace of the Maine woods transports the reader to another time and place. The long winters spent by the fire with favorite books, the eager anticipation of the monthly mail delivery, the excitement over the first thaw and the opportunity to replenish the barest of larders...her descriptions of everything from her summer and winter homes to the garden and surrounding woods bring you into her world. And is there anyone who after a long day at work and longer trip home doesn't want to turn off the lights and see only stars and treetops overhead? The best bedtime reading, guarantees many nights of sweet dreams."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"A friend gave me this book when I was at a very low point in my life. My wife and I read it together, over a long weekend, and packed the car Monday morning. By Wednesday we had our old house listed and Friday we put in an offer on 40 acres with an old farm. We haven't looked back since; but we have given copies of this book to all of our old friends for Christmas."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"I was eight years old when Louise Dickinson Rich's thick book appeared, its jacket cover inviting me down a snowy path to a snug home in the pines. It was my first adult book; the fact that Mother was reading it at the same time gave the experience added zip.The book is not a biography, not even a memoir. Instead, in a very informal, conversational style, Rich answers key questions people have asked her about her life as a writer, a wife, and a mother deep in the far north woods of Maine. One question per chapter: \\"Aren't You Afraid? Don't You Get Bored? How Do You Make A Living?\\" Her answers are candid, funny, detailed, and enlightening.When, as a young bright college student, Louise had men breathe into her ear, \\"I NEED you!\\" she took the avowals with a few grains of salt. But when her husband Ralph comes racing into their snow-wrapped log house with blood dripping down his arm and bellows, \\"Louise, where ARE you? I need you, goddammit!\\"--she knows it's stark truth.Rich's backwoods life details an earlier time, of course (the late Thirties), but even in that time, her way of life was an anomaly. \\"Outsiders\\" thought her life must be quaint, or picturesque, or outlandish.Rich's no-nonsense approach sweeps these fantasies aside and shows us the reality of, say, making a week's worth of dinners out of three tins of chipped beef and a box of soda crackers. Or dealing with a sudden inflamed appendix when the snow has closed all roads to Outside, but the ice on the lake is too thin to drive across. Or why she enjoys being the preferred partner on the other end of a cross-cut saw. And how you make a satisfying community out of two other families, three heavy-drinking loggers, and a picturesque but comfort-loving sled-dog.I loved this book when I was eight, and again when I was in my twenties. Reading it for the third time now in my seventies (delighted that it was still available at amazon.com), I find it does more than \\"hold up\\" as a delightful read; it satisfies as thoroughly as one of Louise's long-simmered deer roasts must have done."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"\\"We Took to the Woods\\" is as charming and delightful a book as you will ever find. It's the story of a city woman living on a remote Maine river with her husband and children. She's not poor, nor a rube, nor does she display the eccentricities one associates with people who flee to the wilderness. Rather, she seems happy, well-adjusted, and full of sympathetic tales about the few -- very few -- people she comes into contact with in the course of her daily life. And she really did live in the woods --the nearest store was a long boat ride away and she didn't go \\"outside\\" for a four year stretch. Her township of Upton had a population of 182.The book is set up in chapters that answer questions: \\"Isn't housekeeping difficult?\\" or \\"Aren't you ever frightened.\\" One of the better stories in the chapter, \\"Aren't the Children a Problem\\" tells about her husband delivering the author's baby in the dead of winter -- and greasing it with olive oil which he kept to dress his trout flies. The new parents discuss what they are supposed to do with the hot water always called for when a baby is being born -- and they decide to make coffee.For the modern reader, the highlights of the book are probably tales of the trials of living without conveniences. The Rich houses -- they had a winter and summer house -- had no plumbing. Heating and cooking were with wood. What you needed for groceries was delivered by boat once a month; the Sears catalog supplied the rest. For anyone who has ever thought wistfully of fleeing civilization, this is a humorous primer of both the rewards and hardships of such a life. It deserves a permanent place on the short shelf of Americana classics.Smallchief"},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"This book is a great read for anyone who's ever had the desire to just chuck it all and head for the woods (a desire that seems to wax and wane like the tides, popular one decade [1970s, for example], totally passe the next). Today taking to the woods for many means building a $500,000 \\"rustic retreat\\" with pool, hot tub, and wine cellar included. For Louise Rich, back in the 1930s (the book was published in 1942), things were much different.For one thing, her house had no plumbing. Water had to be hauled to the house in buckets. Supplies and the mail came by boat. Life was no picnic for her and her family. But, of course, there were trade offs. The beauty of the place, for one. The living as one with nature. The need to be resourceful, and the feeling of pride and accomplishment that goes with it. Trade offs worth the hardships, Rich makes perfectly clear.Rich captures the flavor of her idyllic spot in the Maine woods a few miles east of Upton along the Rapid River (the swiftest river east of the Mississippi, even though it is only about four miles long). She describes what life is like there, how the busy summers are a prelude to the slow, long winters. She talks about her neighbors, the loggers, the animals they encounter, how one endures and enjoys life in the woods. She describes the effects of the hurricane of 1938 and the havoc is caused even there, so far inland. Her prose style is clear and direct, and she truly makes the reader jealous of her situation rather than sympathetic. It's an excellent book, one that I've read a number of times, always with an I-wish-I-was-there enthusiasm. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"Rich, a very resourceful woman, raises her family in rural Maine in the 1930s.

Even more surprised was I, given her modern voice, when I realized that \\"We Took to the Woods\\" was written in the 40's. References to using Model T's to haul logs (sacrilege now) clued me in.It is sure fun to read about how even back then people wondered how someone could stand living in the backwoods of Maine.

Louise Rich's account of her life in backwoods Maine during the 1930's and 40's was filled with insightful, witty and meaningful observations of what it takes to live this kind of life and how much she really loved it. I enjoyed all 11 chapters with their cute, questioning titles such as:Chapter IV: Isn't Housekeeping Difficult (Louise says: NO, as she's no housekeeper).Chapter V: Aren't the Children a Problem (to which Louise quips: Aren't children always a problem, no matter where you live?)Chapter VIII: Aren't You Ever Frightened? (sage Louise says: There's nothing to be afraid of in the woods -- except yourself).Rich's folksy, honest and sometimes acerbic New Englander writing style is refreshing and engaging and you take away alot of deeper truths that are just as applicable to living in 2010 as in 1940."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"Louise Dickinson Rich's WE TOOK TO THE WOODS is an odd but interesting book, well worth the read. Rich and her husband lived without plumbing or electricity in the Maine wilderness during the 1930s; the book was published in 1942. Rich chronicles her everyday and extraordinary experiences--from low-tech cooking to unassisted natural childbirth--in a sort of forgotten, hip but stylized vernacular that brings readers smack into her unheated living room. At times dated, at other time remarkably fresh, this book is a fascinating and engaging read chock full of Yankee work ethic and Puritan can-do. Not quite \\"literature,\\" this unique book has staying power."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"This is, simply put, a wonderful six year outing into the Maine backwoods of 1942.Although she did like the woods and wanted to unearth the simple life, it turns out that Louise Dickinson Rich moved to the back country in search of identity. As she says, \\"Happy people are not given in to soul searching\\".Her stories are many and her writing is flawless. Descriptive, humorous and sincere, Louise was a rare and genuine author.The loggers, the summer resort folks down the way, the few neighbors scattered in the forest, how to survive the cold, frigid winters, all the little adventures here and there, what she liked and didn't like about nearly everything, country wisdom...and most important, how she found peace with herself.A Gifted, Talented Read."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"While this book was written over 50 years ago, I found it quite contemporary. Louise Rich writes in a down home fashion about everyday events in the North Woods with humor and a very unique voice. She occasionally bursts into a vein of discription of her surroundings that is lyrically satisfying without becoming cloying.I would have enjoyed knowing this author, perhaps spending an afternoon over a pot of tea."},{"Title":"We Took to the Woods","review":"I've owned this book for years; I found a first edition in perfect condition at an estate sale & I've been hooked ever since!

I wish the author was still living so I could thank her for writing this book. I, too, would like to head to the woods. I guess that is why I bought this book. I read every word and hung on to each experience she had in the Maine woods. The book takes place in the late thirties and early forties so they had no cell phone or tv sets to make connections with.

Many will be surprised to learn that the legal foundation for sexual discrimination was adopted in England and America as late as 1765, with the publication of Blackstone's Commentaries, a misrepresentation of English Common Law that held sway over the courts for more than a century and created a psychological climate that has persisted well into our era. Under the influence of Blackstone, married women were legally declared nonpersons, chattels of their husbands, with no individual rights. Although the Commentaries were not unprecedented, the Women's Rights movememt of the mid-1800s cited Blackstone as the prime authority on the legal subjection of women.\\"In this book, Mary R. Beard traces the vital impact of women on history, from the female philosophers of Greece, to the chatelaines of the Middle Ages, the brilliant hostesses of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French salons, the early feminists-both male and female-and the 'liberated woman' of the twentieth century. Woman as Force in History is an extraordinary accomplishment, a fascinating barometer of the rise and fall of civilized man as reflected in the treatment of his most valuable ally, woman.\\"\\"Mary R.

I heard about the adult version when it first came out, but didn't know there was a Look-Alikes for kids. I don't know what the age recommendation on this it, but my 3 1/2-yr-old is absolutely fascinated by it! Guess what he's getting for Christmas! And since I love things like this, everytime he says, &quot;Mommy, come look at my library picture book&quot; I drop what I'm doing and sit down with him. To me, that is the ultimate compliment - this book has prompted me to sit and concentrate on spending time with my child more often, and that's priceless. And believe it or not, most of the objects in the pictures aren't that obvious to adults, so when I point them out to him (excited that I myself found them), he's absolutely delighted. We've tried to push toys on our son that are not passive, where he sits and watches a battery-operated thingy do whatever it does, toys that encourage active participation and imagination, and I can't imagine anything better than this book. Just my thought, but I think this book and the original Look-Alikes are invaluable tools for teaching people of all ages to thing outside the box, shift your perception, and that's something that's good for all of us!

The ocean, the mountains, the vegetation, flowers and incomparable climate make this a unique paradise. Hiking here is a sublime experience and its possible to do it year-round since the temperatures rarely dip below 50 degrees. If you're a dedicated hiker and have missed Santa Barbara, please try and remedy this. You'll spend some of the best hours of your life hiking in this incredible place.This book is one of the best hiking guides I've found for the Santa Barbara area. If you're a beginner, there are plenty of short treks for you, mostly clustered around the beach or city. There are also a dozen moderate hikes and quite a few trail descriptions for streunous jaunts, all of these in the mountain areas. The descriptions of each trail is quite good and the driving desriptions to the trailheads is adequate (I haven't gotten lost yet from following their directions). I recommend this guide for everyone fortunate to hike in this beautiful locale."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Santa Barbara California: 82 great hikes","review":"I have been a Santa Barbara resident for over twenty years and my family and I have enjoyed many of the featured hikes in the book.

Sometimes the listed mileage is simply incorrect. Seems like the author may not have been on many of these hikes recently or at all."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"\\"Silent Coup\\" is an important work of \\"Watergate Revisionism\\" that brings the Radford spy ring into the picture. In short, senior Pentagon officials at the Joint Chiefs of Staff level authorised what amounted to an \\"unofficial\\" spy operation targeted at the White House. They wanted to keep tabs on Kissinger and his secret diplomacy. Kissinger's moves were shaking the way US foreign policy had been conducted for a generation, the Chiefs believed they were being left out of the loop.The authors see US national security chiefs as going beyond this illegal, unconstitutional and somewhat amateur snooping on Kissinger to a more sinister, and ultimately successful, effort to remove Nixon, or at least, deflect fall-out from the downfall of an administration already heading for a crash, away from themselves. Central to their thesis are the numerous links between various Watergators and the CIA, a VIP Call Girl ring (itself under CIA influence) used by the DNC and the past relationship between former USN briefing officer Woodward to both Admiral Radford and General Alexander Haig, whom the authors picked as \\"Deep Throat\\". The label \\"coup\\" however may be somewhat misleading. The authors are not so much talking about a Latin American putsch so much as political jujitsu by Haig and the Joint Chiefs.Much of this material is discussed by other Watergate revisionists, for example, Jim Hougan in \\"Secret Agenda\\", although often framed in a different explanatory narratives. \\"Silent Coup\\" to it's credit provides numerous references and attachments as evidence, especially for the Radford spy ring. This isn't always the most enjoyable reading experience.There are some benefits beyond Watergate revisionism too. In detailing the Radford spy ring they outline some of Kissinger and Nixon's tactics in laying the foundations for detente. We learn, for example, that the US tilt towards Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistan dispute was related to Kissinger's use of Islamabad as a back channel to Peking. This tilt became important under later administrations as Pakistan's General Zia emerged as the empressario of US-UK- Chinese support for the Afghan rebels. As the US may be drawn deeper into Pakistani politics in the years ahead, this episode may receive greater attention from historians.During the Nixon / Frost interviews, Nixon mentions a national security dimension to Watergate. Was he alluding to the Radford spy ring?Since \\"Silent Coup\\" the identity of Deep Throat has been revealed to be the FBI's Mark Felts, not Haig. But as Jim Hougan has pointed out via his web site, Felt was formerly the head of the Bureau's controversial \\"Cointelpro\\" program. So Hougan casts reasonable doubt on the explanation that Deep Throat's motives were those of an outraged constitutionalist.Despite more recent developments and revelations, \\"Silent Coup\\" is likely to be a valuable reference for students of the Radford affair and Watergate generally, even if some of the authors' more disturbing conclusions are themselves due for revision."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"&quot;Silent Coup&quot; is the result of one of the most important journalistic research efforts of the modern era. It details an alternative view of the Watergate Affair, and blows a mile-wide hole in the commonly-accepted account of Woodward &amp; Bernstein.As distasteful as it may be to some readers, the work generally supports the long-held claims of the G. Gordon Liddy camp, i.e. that Woodward &amp; Bernstein's accounts in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and their following books were merely an extension of John Dean's version of Watergate, wherein Dean is innocent and everyone else is guilty. However, while the book vindicates Liddy's testimony as to fact, it does not paint much of a flattering picture of the convicted felon otherwise.Colodny &amp; Gettlin expose Dean's supposed role of &quot;fall guy&quot; for what it is: self-serving lies, and lies that were (or should have been) known to the Watergate prosecutors who used his perjured testimony, given in exchange for leniency, to bring down the Nixon Administration. A carefully researched and meticulously documented thesis is posited by the authors, namely that Dean essentially sent the White House up the river in order to save his own neck and conceal his own critical involvement in literally every aspect of the Watergate crimes and cover-ups.Specifically, an overwhelming case is made that Dean, in order to squash his own involvement in a seperate legal matter pertaining to the surreptitious use of DNC headquarters in Washington as a front for a high-class call-girl service, and in which his own future wife Mo was complicit, instigated the burglaries at the DNC in hopes of removing evidence belying his association therein. The DNC burglaries were conveniently tucked into the overall dirty tricks program against the advice of most of the operative conspirators, who, as Liddy has stated, saw no value in hitting the DNC. The value of the break-in, the authors show, was to Dean and Dean alone.The other primary bombshell dropped in &quot;Silent Coup&quot; is the very under-reported fact that journalist Bob Woodward was, astonishingly, a former Naval Officer involved in extremely sensitive communications intelligence, and that Woodward almost certainly briefed Alexander Haig and others in the Nixon White House in an official capacity prior to his departure from the Navy and rapid rise to the unlikely position of star reporter for the Post, and, conveniently, the lead newsbreaker in the Watergate matter! This direct link between Woodward and the Nixon White House should have disqualified Woodward from reporting on the matter. It did not disqualify him, because those who should have known about the link apparently either didn't know, or didn't care.This fine history of the Watergate era covers many other pertinent related topics, including the establishment of a top-secret communications &quot;back channel&quot;, which Nixon instituted in order to sidestep the State Department and Pentagon in sensitive dealings with the former USSR, Red China, and in the prosecution and settlement of the Vietnam War. The evidence shows that the back channel was illegally compromised by Haig and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The implications with respect to the larger Watergate scandal are addressed in detail by the authors.The work also touches many historical issues exposed by the Watergate investigations, not the least of which is the implication that Nixon may have known the truth behind the Kennedy Assassination, and that some those connected to Watergate may have been directly involved, namely E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and perhaps some of the Cuban &quot;Plumbers&quot;. Again, this history encompasses more than just Watergate by virtue of the enormous amount of studious research that was necessary to document the central arguments contained within.The importance of this book is further magnified by the fact that a large number of the players in the Watergate affair are deceased; fortunately for history, the authors had the opportunity to interview most of the now-dead key players prior to their passing.This book is must reading for anyone interested in Watergate. The book's radical rethinking of the common wisdom of Watergate is both refreshing and disturbing, not only in its treatment of the facts of the case, but as an expose' of the secret agenda of Bob Woodward."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"If Bob Woodward didn't exist, he would have to be invented. And he was.SILENT COUP is not a perfect book--by the very nature of the subject perfection or certainty are excluded. But there is a lot of plausibility here; the ideas and main thrust of the authors fit in quite well with a lot of other pieces.Robert Woodward, a mainstream icon of what passes for journalism nowadays, is a significant piece of this puzzle.**It turns out that this darling of the 'liberal' media, has solid conservative credentials, bourgeois upbringing, Yale, US Navy; one Yale professor described Woodward as a \\"crypto-fascist\\"**Woodward's cozy comfortable relationship with, and access to numerous presidents and administrations (what would you conclude if you constantly saw a policeman being welcomed to the home of a notorious gangster; is it plausible that presidents would invite an 'investigative reporter' to shadow them, if they had even the remotest doubt as to his pliability and docility?)**his repeated failure to point out blatant, fundamental policy misdeeds that would not have eluded a bright 12 year old**My uncle worked on the Post for years; the fundamental conservatism of this paper's owners and therefore of its editorial policy--as distinct from its cosmetic public 'image' as a progressive news outlet--was well known to insiders. Stories that didn't fit the establishment world-view of the paper simply didn't get written; the popular notion of Woodward as a fiery, risk-taking champion of the truth is Hollywood tripe**the CIA and FBI had long-standing and quite successful programs to cooperate and co-opt members of the press; Woodward's instrumental role in channeling leaks engineered to bring down Nixon (whose detente with the USSR and overtures to the People's Republic were distasteful to the Pentagon-Industrial complex) and recent activities to legitimate and act as a well-respected 'fig-leaf' to the engineered 'Global War on Terror' follow a long and inglorious tradition dating back to Walter Winchell."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"Silent Coup:The Removal of a President is a very interesting Watergate book, but James Hougan's Secret Agenda is better. But who is/was \\" Deep Throat \\", certainly not Mark Felt. Just my opinion. Dean is the bad guy here, but their are many \\" bad guys \\" in he Watergate tail, Haig & others are not heroes."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"Having just completed Silent Coup this afternoon, I felt compelled to comment. The resignation of Richard Nixon was my earliest political memory and ignited an interest in Watergate and politics in general that I carry to this day. I don't believe, as some do, that this was an effort to protect/redeem Richard Nixon, nor a conscious effort to discredit the Washington Post. Instead, as is usually the case, a true and objective historical perspective is not always clear amidst significant events(i.e. Kennedy Assassination, Gulf of Tonkin, Iran-Contra, Panama-Noriega, Kosovo, Columbia, our current World Trade Center tragedy).It is my belief that Bob Woodward was the only reporter at the time of the Watergate break-in with the access to discover the story as it unfolded. Unfortunately, the source/sources of this information was limited. It is not a surprise, assuming Haig was Deep Throat, that there would be a certain spin to the Woodward &amp; Berstien coverage of the story. It is only after the passage of time and the publication of multiple biographies that we can begin to piece the entire puzzle together.It is safe to assume that the whole truth will never be known, much less verified. What is unique about this Colodny &amp; Gettlin effort was the extensive and expansive interviews with most of the key players, the analysis of conflicting stories in so many biographies of the critical figures and the presentation of several versions of certain events(Dean vs. Liddy, Haig vs. Ford, etc). Whether you agree with the conclusions that are reached in Silent Coup, this book provides the broadest perspective on Watergate I have read to date."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"The only review I ever read on Silent Coup was in the Los Angeles Times when the book was first published, and the review took up an entire page in the book review section. The best version of the book is the paperback, where the authors tell of what happened after the hardback version was published. As an example, Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes read the book and wanted to do a report, but the higher-ups at CBS told him he couldn't do it. Wallace tried several times afterward to do a 60 Minutes story, but was stopped each time. Because of the author's statements in the book, John Dean launched a 50 million dollar lawsuit, but his lawyer, after reviewing the book and the author's notes and interviews, dropped the lawsuit. Why? In the view of the two authors, John Dean was the total insider (and more) of the Watergate scandal, because he was the only one granted full access to the investigation, and this was under Nixon's direct order. The author's premise of taking all the books, all the magazine articles, all the newspaper stories and putting them in chronological order is the basis for the book and tells the reader that out of all the people involved in Watergate, there are two individules whose stories do not match the overall timeline established by the author's investigation. Nixon was not one of them. There are many conclusions to be drawn from the book, but the one that stands out to me the most is this one. Why did the Democratic-controlled congressional committee running the investigation seal certain evidence in the national archives FOREVER (and is it still there?)! You'll have to read the book (the paperback version is the better choice for the entire story) to find out. The liberal media has never given this book any credence, and possibly for good reason. They just might have got it all wrong! I believe so.in addition: may, 2006former fbi agent mark felt revealed he was the 'deep throat' in the watergate affair. this may be totally true, but i still have issues with the watergate scandal based on 'silent coup.' and have some questions about mark felt.1. 'in silent coup' the authors believed that only four people knew about the oval office taping system. mark felt was not one of them, and it was the washington post, according to 'silent coup' that kept pushing the watergate committee to ask if there was a recording system in the white house. remember alexander butterfield?2. in a book written by alexander haig, he denied being 'deep throat' IN A FOOTNOTE. one has to wonder about that one. there are three sections, if you will, on deep throat stories during watergate. the middle section has no deep throat stories. why?if alexander haig was deep throat, does this come into play anywhere? first third, haig was white house military advisor, or something to that effect. the last third, haig was white house chief of staff. the middle section, where there were no deep throat stories, haig was in belgium, as nato commander. this was the conclusion of 'silent coup.'3. going back to bob woodward, again he worked in the white house during his military career, where he was spottted talking to alexander haig, no less by an admiral who would become chief of staff at the pentagon. woodward has said he never met haig in the white house.4. has mark felt really granted an full-fledged interview to anyone to 'time stamp' the facts, so to speak? it would be really interesting if the authors of 'silent coup' would do the interview.5. finally, maybe in reality there is really more than one 'deep thoat.'"},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"This book asks the eternal question: Are we too paranoid or not paranoid enough? It is a highly entertaining alternative history of Watergate. This book raises some serious questions that simple minded Nixon hatred cannot dispel. Considering that we continue to learn secrets of WWII and that Watergate is thirty years more recent and considering that most of the prinicipals are still living, I find it highly likely that more revelations lie in wait. I recommend reading this with Watergate by Fred Emery which gives a conventional history of the topic. Both books make clear that unanswered questions remain."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"The book is objectively written and relies heavily on eyewitness accounts of the events leading up to the resignation of President Nixon. I did not feel that there was any attempt to &quot;white-wash&quot; the episode, rather, it is an attempt to show what really happened. The role the main stream press played was disgraceful. It was obvious to most people at the time that the press was in the midst of an unprecedented feeding frenzy over the Watergate affair. It was not obvious that the presidency was under attack by self-serving individuals out to save themselves from their own misdeeds at the expense of the President and the country. The press and academe has a lot to atone for in presenting such a distorted look at this episode in American history; this book provides the necessary information for the reader to see through the distortions and realize the true motives and betrayal that occurred. This book provides extensive references to other works that have been written over the years by the players involved and official documents generated as the events unfolded. Richard Nixon is portrayed fairly and is not presented as a demon or a saint. I highly recommend this book and feel it should be required reading for American history classes in our high schools"},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"I truly believe that SILENT COUP is one of the most important books of the 20th Century. It shows what the Watergate affair was really all about (something far different from official conclusions), and is backed by firm evidence. (This is no Oliver-Stone-like hallucination.) If you don't read this book, you will be denying yourself the truth about an important chapter in U.S. history."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"This is an eye-opening, page-turning book.

Also, if you doubt the facts in this book (like the previous reviewer), check out the data Len Colodny gave to the University of South Florida's library: exclusive documents and tape-recorded interviews that were used to write the 1991 best seller, including hundreds of hours of interviews with top players in Nixon's administration, along with nearly 4,200 pages of affidavits, transcripts and correspondence. And the idea that only Nixon-lovers would believe this book: I detest Nixon, and I still believed this book. And I don't see how anyone could NOT believe this book. Read it, read it, read it!!! ..."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"The thesis of this intriguing investigation of Watergate is that the break in was actually meant to cover up embarrassing information about John Dean's wife, that Dean and Haig ill served the President because of their own private cover ups (Haig was hiding a spy operation by the Joint Chiefs aimed at the White House) and that Haig was Deep Throat. The authors provide enough documentation and their scenario makes sufficient sense, that I, for one, am willing to believe that there is a substantial element of truth here. If nothing else, the reader will look at the Woodward/Bernstein version of Watergate with a much more jaundiced eye and will view Dean with the contempt he so richly deserves.But, after all is said and done, Richard Nixon was still our worst president ever. Having decided to get out of Vietnam, he inexcusably dragged the war out for several more years. Detente with the Russians nearly lost the Cold War for us and his expansion of the Social Welfare State nearly bankrupted us and was a betrayal of Republican principles. Regardless of his level of personal involvement in the events surrounding Watergate, he created and tolerated an atmosphere of lawless paranoia in the White House, which virtually guaranteed that such incidents would occur. And the White House tapes reveal a man whose temperament was ill-suited to being the leader of the Western world--his easy anti-Semitism and contempt for virtually everyone had no place in the Oval Office. That he might have been victimized by disloyal staffers does not excuse his abysmal performance as President, nor his flagrant disregard for the civil liberties of his enemies, supposed or real.This book is an enjoyably iconoclastic challenge to the received wisdom about Watergate, but even if every word in it is true, none of it matters that much; the coup was a good thing.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"I saw a show on CSPAN with some BBC reporters who have investigated the claims of this book.

Mr. Woodward had formerly been a Navy lieutenant whose daily job had been briefing the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon, and relaying daily their communications to General Alexander Haig, who was the president's White House chief of staff during the Vietnam War, according to Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, in their book Silent Coup.It's interesting that Nixon's chief of staff HR Haldeman, in his autobiography The Ends of Power, wrote that when Nixon mentioned \\"the Bay of Pigs thing\\" in the White House tapes, he was referring to Watergate CIA burglers E Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis being arrested in Dealy Plaza within minutes of the murder of John Kennedy in front of the Dallas police station (the photographed \\"tramps\\"). A civil libel jury in Hunt vs Liberty Lobby, 707 F2d 1493, found Hunt \\"guilty\\" of that murder, as proven by attorney Mark Lane, author of Plausible Denial (court docs online). Hunt's paymaster in Dallas was CIA agent/director George HW Bush Sr Knight of the British Empire, according to declassified CIA memo and J Edgar Hoover's memo. Hunt's wife Dorothy was assassinated on sabotaged United Airlines flight 553, while delivering a payoff from Nixon to the Watergate burglers, when her airliner blew up, killing all on board. Hunt's son St. John Hunt videotaped E Howard's deathbed confession to his involvement in the assassination of JFK (video online).Another bombshell in Silent Coup was the reported fact that White House attorney John Dean's wife was a prostitute and pimp in Washington DC, hired to blackmail Democrat politicians. That makes convicted-felon Dean a pimp and extortionist as well. Democrat Congressman Barney Frank performed a similar duty as gay pimp and cannibal snuff kiddie porn for George Bush Sr at Bohemian Grove with Paul Bonnaci and Johnny Gosch (a/k/a male hooker Jeff Gannon who spent 200 nights in the Bush Jr White House according to Secret Service public records), as reported by Nebraska senator John DeCamp in his autobiography, The Franklin Coverup, and reported in 100 news articles by the Washington Times and DC criminal court convictions. To salvage his evil presidency, Nixon plotted to bomb the Republican National Convention, and blame bogus terrorists, as he plotted to terrorize USA with bogus terrorism in Operation Northwoods (declassified 2000). Northwoods plan including DC assassinations, bombings, sabotage of US military base in Commie Gitmo Cuba, hiring enemy soldiers to attack US military bases, building fake aircraft to simulate enemy aircraft and shoot down US military aircraft and civilian airliners, and hijack US airliners by remote control (as in 9-11-2001). Nixon was the father of Op Northwoods, that General President Eisenhower warned us about his VP Nixon's \\"military industrial complex\\".All historians and journalists require Silent Coup to study our Gangster Government."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"This book really has the Nixon fans salivating revenge against the conventional (and well-proven) theory of Watergate.Admittedly the book is written in a breathless and entertaining style with piles of interesting history thrown in...but does it refute the &quot;conventional&quot; Watergate story?Before you jump on this so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; bandwagon, crying &quot;foul&quot; against the prosecutors, democrats and the press, be advised that:1) The White House tapes are direct evidence against a lot of what's in this book.2) Errors were made in gathering evidence (i.e. a Haldeman claim to a certain phone call on a certain date that's out of whack with the White House phone log.)3) It's a subjective opinion, but many of the interview subjects don't sound very credible. I don't like &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; footnotes.4) 60 MINUTES WOULDN'T DO THE STORY! So what! An independent production company in England (Brian Lapping Associates) wouldn't touch this story either because they just could not make the story stick (in it's view of Watergate, other elements have some merit.)England, known for having much more of a penchant for scandal than the US certainly wouldn't suffer for doing a new expose, but they didn't because the facts couldn't be supported.Lapping Associates ended up filming a terrific 5-part documentary called Watergate which ran on the Discovery Channel in 1994, watch that instead.5) MIKE WALLACE WOULDN'T DO IT? Mike Wallace filmed an 2-hour special a few years after this book came out on his OWN where several of his subjects claim the whole John Dean-call girl ring was a crock.Please, if you have to make up history to sell books, get the right publisher: Marvel Comics."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"I'd give this minus stars, if possible.It's hard to imagine how the authors can present this tripe with a straight face. By focusing narrowly on Dean and twisting enough facts and telling some outright lies, they make their case. But to believe it, we have to believe that Nixon, Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, etc. lived in isolated bubbles and never communicated with each other. All they knew about the world, the learned from the evil Dean.And oh, yeah, Enemies List, Tax Evasion, suborning perjury, and all the other little pranks of the Nixonian era? Nah, I never heard of them either."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"Colodny's work analyzes the Watergate scandal in a manner that satisfies Occam's Razor. Though some speculation is involved, Colodny's scenario fits the personalities of the key players and does not rely on the superhumanly diabolicalview of Nixon that sold many books in the seventies. He may be the first writer on Watergate to consider the possibility that Nixon,though morally capabable of crafting the eventsof the break-in, did not order it.Polarized audiences looking for a scathing demolition of Richard Nixon or a saccharineyabsolution of the man will not find their preconceptions reinforced here, and perhaps this is partially responsible for the mainstream media'sfailure to give this work the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"The previous reviewer's statement that, &quot;even if every word in it is true, none of it matters that much; the coup was a good thing&quot; is ridiculous, and an absurd &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; logic. Yes, Nixon should have been removed BUT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE BEEN HEARD DURING AN IMPEACHMENT HEARING instead of being manipulated into resigning by Al Haig. But Al Haig was frightend about what would come out about HIM in an impeachment hearing, so manipulated Nixon into resigning. Despicable. Just this week that I write this, a defamation suit regarding this book against G. Gordon Liddy was dismissed by the judge. So the truth of this book has been held up in a court of law. It's one of the most incredible books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"This book is rife with logical fallacies, assertions without evidence, unsupported conclusions, etc. The authors do an exceedingly poor imitation of research. They collected a large amount of documentation, but 1) that is not the same as gathering evidence, 2) much of their gathered documentation is trivial and unimportant, and 3) they have ignored and omitted evidence that does not support their conclusions. Some of what they claim is not backed up anywhere and is apparently made up whole cloth.For example, they assert that Bob Woodward, because was a Lieutenant in the Navy, briefed his superiors on ultra-secret classified projects. They reached this conclusion by asking everyone who worked with Bob in the Navy if he ever briefed anyone. All of them said \\"no\\". Except one person. Silent Coup authors Colodny and Gettlin jump to the conclusion that, because no one else knew about these \\"briefings\\", Woodward's briefings must have been Super Secret! It does not occur to Colodny and Gettlin that the preponderance of evidence said Woodward did not, or that the one person who said he did could have been mistaken, or that there could be other explanations. They simply conclude that because everyone close to him denied it, Woodward must have been giving Double Super Secret Briefings to Al Haig! and continue on.Just an embarrassing piece of work, full of easily disproved falsehoods, innuendo and rumors presented as fact, and incredibly stupid thinking. If there is ever a \\"Jump to Conclusions\\" bingo game, you could put a picture of this book as the free space in the middle.I own a lot of books on Watergate, and I keep this book around just to remind myself how terrible it is. You can flip to any page and read something ridiculous or clearly false. In fact, just as I was typing this review I did so: page 291 of the paperback, Colodny and Gettlin assert that \\"Given the trust displayed by Deep Throat in his dealings with Woodward, it is virtually inconceivable that the relationship could have developed anywhere but the Navy.\\"The actual Deep Throat, Mark Felt, is mentioned in passing once in the entire book. (Also, Felt never served in the Navy.)"},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"I think it's pretty well established that Nixon himself ordered the Watergate break-ins, in order to get pre-election dirt on Hugh O'Brien and the Democratic party. He had learned that Howard Hughes was giving money to the Democratic Party. Hughes, the paranoid, demented billionaire in Nevada who dropped his support of Nixon after Nixon authorized Nuclear testing in Nevada, had been an albatross on Nixon during the California governor's race, and Nixon figured he could use the same angle in his \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign against McGovern.So, hence the slow, painful unraveling of a Presidency. This book is an after-the-fact attack piece on one of the few men who developed a conscience and told the truth in the Watergate hearings. It is a clear attempt by the neo-cons to rewrite history and cast the \\"good guy\\" as the bad guy. Don't waste your money on this book. It's pure tripe.P.S. -- read John Dean's \\"Conservatives Without Conscience\\" to see his reaction to these allegations."},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"I have never liked John Dean and this book gave me 450 more pages of reasons to dislike him. Ok that might be a bit much, but the authors basically blame Dean and Haig for most of Nixon's problems. The book gives the reader a great overview of the Watergate scandal and what took place behind the scenes. If you have read a number of books on this topic then this one has a new and interesting look at what really happened. Not to give too much away but the authors make a claim that it was actually a few people that were on the Presidents staff that pushed, tricked and caused Nixon to make the mistakes he did which resulted in him resigning. We also get their guess at who good old Deep Throat was.The authors do a very good job in detailing out all of the research they did to come to their conclusions. It looks like they read every book on the subject and talked to about 90% of the key players in the event. They give us all the instances where the statements that Dean made were just not completely correct and detail the many instances where Dean was completely wrong in many of his statements. They also have an interesting dup in the form of Woodward, which was an interesting tidbit. Overall it is hard to completely take all responsibility away from Nixon. The statements he made on tape and the full range of dirty tricks and abuse of power items that Nixon did just went too far to think that the issues around a Watergate cover up would be beyond him. The book is very interesting and is full of great insight into the administration. If you are interested at all in Watergate then you will really enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Silent Coup: The Removal of Richard Nixon","review":"This was a great read before the identity of Deep Throat was revealed. Mark Feld must have been laughing up his sleeves when he heard the theory postulated in this book. Having said that, this is a lot of fun if you're into \\"true\\" political drama.

It is so bogus that the lies hurled at John Dean in here were so false Dean sued the publisher/author and won big money and ended future publications of the book. Seriously, I'm the biggest watergate buff around. I've read over 30 books on it, including one by just about every person who played a role in it. Simply put, this is the worst one and is so out of left field that it is just sickening. I'm honestly astounded by some of the reviews this book has got. The only explanation I have for them is that thos people are either conspiracy theorists to the biggest degree, or this is the only watergate thing they've ever read, and just don't realize the facts and that almost all the entire book is not just false, but has been proven false and libel in open court. If you want good books on watergate start with \\"all the presidents men\\" then \\"blind ambition \\".

Also would be useful for the psychology professional without specific or with dated cognitive neuroscience background, or others intending a research or applied clinical career in the area. Appropriate background would necessarily be at least an undergraduate course in cognitive psychology, with additional help provided by biological psychology or a medical professional in neurology. Discussions of principles and mechanisms are at a &quot;functional machinery&quot; level and thus would not make sense to those without some previous training in those principles. It just isn't a basic text, thus, no glossary of basic terms is included. Yes, the material is both abstract and complex, but so is brain function, and we are just beginning to learn. There are very, very few textbooks that survey this area which only became a separate field of study sometime around 1986. Other reading material in the field consists entirely of professional level chapters in compiled and edited texts. The only other broad survey text that I know of is Marie Banich's book on the related area of Cognitive Neuropsychology."},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"I have used it in an upper division undergraduate psychology class, and in my students' rankings of textbooks, this book has consistently been ranked higher than any other text I've used.The level is beyond a simple introductory psychology text, but is very appropriate for the upper division course.The numerous full-color illustrations and photographs are especially helpful in illustrating key points.It covers the full spectrum of the neural basis of cognition, from simple perception through the biology of emotion to the basis of consciousness (with very interesting case studies of brain damaged patients throughout)."},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"This book is more like a bunch of journals bound together. The authors introduce new words without previous qualifications. For example, in the chapter of binocular vision, they added spatial normalization and various other models, without telling what exactly they are! Also when I tried to find these terms in relatively basic texts I was unable to find them. Same was the case with internet.It is definitly for advanced learner. (I am doing PhD in neuroscience and still finding it very difficult)To clarify zillions of issue I have to sit with my mentor. Although she is very nice but still the discussion needs a lot of time, which is difficult for her to take out in her busy schedule.In short, this book is recommended if you are doing a specific research and want to know extremely minute details of the ideas, certainly not for a introductory or intermediate learner."},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"Research in cognitive neuroscience has exploded in the last two decades, mostly due to the rise of experimental techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission topography, but also due to the ability now to simulate neuronal behavior computationally. This book, written by leading experts in the field is written for the student in mind, so anyone with a strong curiosity about what has been accomplished in cognitive neuroscience up till now will gain a lot from reading the book. The study of the brain is fascinating and there is every indication that a thorough understanding of cognitive processes, including the nature of consciousness, will be achieved in this century.Just a small sample of some of the questions that arise from the reading of the book include:1. What is the cause of akinetopsia, i.e. loss of motion perception?2. What is the relationship between learning and memory?3. How limited is short-term memory and where are sensory memories stored?4. Why were \`working memory' models proposed and what evidence is there to support them?5. What is the difference between declarative and nondeclarative memories?6. What is the connection between amnesia and the medial temporal lobe?7. Just how accurate are the experimental techniques of PET and fMRI?8. Is damage to the hippocampus sufficient to block the formation of new long-term memories?9. Does damage to the medial temporal lobe and diencephalic memory systems affect both episodic and semantic memory?10. What brain systems support procedural memory?11. Is there any evidence that brain lesions can affect the perceptual representation system but leaving the declarative memory untouched?12. How much is known about the molecular mechanisms of synaptic strengthening in long-term potentiation?13. Just how much is known about the neural organization of language?14. What evidence is there for domain-specific knowledge systems that are evolutionarily adapted?15. What is the nature of the segmentation problem and what is its relevance in the neuronal modeling of language use and acquisition?16. Is reading represented by a specialized input system?17. What are the differences between the modular and interactive models of language comprehension?18. What evidence is there for the garden-path model of syntactic analysis?19. What is the nature of agrammatic aphasia and what causes it?20. What is semantic paraphasia what causes it?21. What is the nature of Broca's aphasia?22. What connection, if any, is there between the size of the corpus callosum and autism?23. Why, from an evolutionary perspective, is it advantageous to have hemispheric specialization?24. How does the frequency hypothesis explain hemispheric asymmetries in visual perception?25. How effective are the computational models of visual system?26. What experiments indicate that cortical cell number cannot by itself fully explain human intelligence?27. In contrast to nonhuman animals, why do humans try to find patterns in sequences of events, even though they are informed explicitly that the sequences are random?28. What evidence exists for a \`generative assembling device' in the left hemisphere?29. How are movement plans represented?30. What is the function of \\"mirror cells?\\"31. To what degree does learning play in producing purposeful actions?32. Do representations within the motor cortex change as a function of practice?33. What is the timing hypothesis of the role of the cerebellum in motor learning?34. What causes Parkinson's disease?35. What are the executive functions?36. What is the difference between working memory and associative memory?37. How is information activated and maintained in working memory?38. What is the nature of recency memory?39. What is the dynamic filtering mechanism and what experimental evidence is there to support it?40. What are schema control units and what role do they play in response selection?41. How can emotion be defined in order to carry out a neuroscientific science of emotion?42. What role does the amygdala play in the processing of emotional stimuli?43. Are the neural systems of emotion and cognition independent? Interdependent?44. What is a somatic marker and what role does it play in decision-making?45. What neural systems are responsible for controlling facial expressions?46. What is genetic specificity and genetic pleiotropy?47. How can one determine whether a neuronal structure or behavior is functionally significant to the organism in the environment to which is adapted or whether it is an epiphenomenon of evolution?48. What is the role, if any, of subconscious processing?49. What is the nature of access-consciousness?50. How close are neuroscientists to a science of consciousness?"},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is not best suited as an introductory textbook; however it seems to work fine as a source of information for the student who has already taken intro psychology. There is a lot of terminology, but everything seemed to be very well explained. We did note an error or two. Overall I think this book is great."},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"This is a well written and comprehensive book by some of the best known researchers. I will not review most of the scientific content as it should be largely unexceptionable from these well known researchers, but provide here a list of typos and comments which I sent to the authors. Those interested in the discussions of consciousness and behavior may wish to see my other reviews.General comments:1. This book like thousands of others trips over the vexing gender problem of \\"his or her\\" or \\"he or she\\" etc. Though it is now politically correct to use both and many authors reverse the sexism by using \\"she\\" I find it very distracting especially since \\"they, them and their\\" work perfectly in every case with no sexism implied. This simple truth seems to escape everyone. Perhaps one of these days the Kleinefelter's support group may organize and assault all the text writers for not using \\"his AND her or it's\\"!2. Here are some really stunning illusions (when they work) not mentioned here and rarely elsewhere. They are some of the most striking things you can do in your living room that reveal the tenuous nature of our perception. It would be a good way to start discussions of perception, realism, reality and certainty etc in psychology and philosophy.I'm abstracting it from a Xerox I made some years ago from a book.First illusion: Sit blindfolded in a chair with Person B sitting on another chair in front of you facing same direction.Have Person A stand on your right side and tell them \\"take my right hand and put my index finger on Person B's nose. Then move my hand rhythmically so that the index finger repeatedly taps and strokes their nose, randomly like a Morse code. At the same time, use your left hand to stroke my nose with the same rhythm and timing.--in PERFECT synchrony.\\"After 30 or 40 seconds you may get the feeling that your nose has stretched out to 3 feet or that you are touching your nose at 3 feet away. The more random the better the illusion. Works about half the time. Author says it shows \\"that the mechanisms of perception are mainly involved in extracting statistical correlations from the world to create a model that is temporarily useful\\".Second illusion: get a dummy rubber hand and then construct a 2 ft by 2 ft cardboard wall and place it on a table in front of you. Put your right hand behind the cardboard and the dummy hand in front of the cardboard. Have someone stroke your hand and the dummy synchronously while you look at the dummy. In a few seconds many people experience the stroking arising from the dummy.Third illusion: Sit in front of a table and hide your left hand under it. Have someone tap and stroke the surface of the table with their right hand (as you watch) and use their hand simultaneously to stroke your left hand, which is hidden from view. You must not see the movement of their left hand(use cardboard partition if needed). After a minute, you may experience the taps and strokes as coming from under the table surface. \\"on the few occasions when I accidentally made a much longer stroke on the table surface than on the subjects hidden hand, the person exclaimed that his hand felt lengthened or stretched to absurd proportions.\\"CORRECTIONS AND COMMENTS ON THE TEXTP 98 middle --free FROM interferenceP 151 line 1--SUPRANUCLEARP 159 rt col middle nerve fibers INNERVATING theP186 legend fig 5.24 despite HIS...HE clearlyP256 fig 7.7 ARTICULATORYP279 fig 7.28. what are the black areas in the scans?P284 fig legend.

And Searle does NOT say we never understand consciousness etc, only as you note in the next sentence that we will not with our current descriptors. One point is that we don't even know how to recognize what a explanation or description of consiousness, thinking etc, looks like.P530 Searle refers to Dennet's view that our mental life is illusory (or something else which amounts to it) as \\"an intellectual pathology\\" and he reviewed Dennet's book as \\"Consciousness Explained Away\\". . Yes, I know he rails about Searle not responding to his criticism of the Chinese Room but Searle has been answering countless objections for about 30 years (eg, in Hofstadter and Dennet's \`The Mind's I' (1981)) and says there is nothing new to answer. The Chinese Room is the most famous paper in modern philosophy. In it Searle shows how it is clear, from a strictly logical point of view, that digital computation is not the same as thinking and further that we don't even know how to recognize a process as thinking when it's not being done by a person. No, the Turing test does not solve this problem. He is NOT saying it's impossible to make machines that think and points out that we are putative biocomputers that think. These are extremely simple logical points but they escape most people. For further discussion of all these issues and how Wittgenstein anticipated them brilliantly some 75 years ago please see my review of Hoftstadter's \\"I am a Strange Loop\\".I go for a dip in Wittgenstein when philosophy and psychology bog down trying to explain the mind (ie., always)--still to me the best cure for philosophy, though not an easy study. Also, since they mention color language, if you have never read it I recommend Wittgenstein's \\"Remarks on Colour\\" for the most insightful discussion of the use of color words I've ever seen. Sadly the author of the MIT Encyclopedia article on color (and nearly all other discussions of color) are unaware of it but of course this is part of the collective amnesia for the work of our greatest natural psychologist.P535 I know about Purkinje, eyetrackers and stabilization and have seen this instrument in operation, but the details of the operation of the eyetracker and the exptl. technique still seem opaque.P549 Summary--John Searle(and I) do not agree that consciousness is a great mystery anymore than wetness is a great mystery of water. Consciousness is just a property of the brain as wetness is of water. See the papers on his web page (as of 05-2005) at UC Berkeley on his philosophy of biological naturalism or any of his recent books on the mind and the brain-- marvelous antidotes for reductionism, holism and philosophy in general."},{"Title":"Cognitive Neuroscience, Second Edition","review":"I am a fourth year neuroscience major and found this book to be extremely verbose and boring.

Some of the inclusions will tell you what to listen for and the like. Since I will hopefully be starting to do some collecting, I'm sure this book will come in very handy with its rating structure of each artist/recording."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"Let me begin by saying that, as an academic, I love well-written criticism, and this is an impressively researched tome containing the history, recording info, personal biographies, and hundreds of insightful reviews of jazz, all interwoven into a wonderful tapestry that will have you pouring over these pages for decades to come.That said, there are a few obvious shortcomings to the Penguin Guide, first and foremost Cook and Morton's personal biases that will leave fans scratching their heads. In addition to some blatantly obvious favoritism, the system by which they rate recordings is also in question. The main quibble here is that they claim to use the crown accolade as a personal choice, something that is purely subjective and shouldn't rub fans the wrong way. But if the crown is indeed a personal choice, then the entire guide is, as well (one can't be subjective and objective at the same time). It's important to acknowledge this going into the guide because, in the end, the crown can't be dismissed as something aloof which simply floats over what is otherwise a collection of objective reviews. It's a rating, like all others in the book.So let's begin with the favoritism. If it's free jazz or avant-garde we're talking about, expect reviews to be generous and at least half a star higher than they perhaps should be. And if it's British free jazz or avant-garde we're talking about, then expect reviews to be at least a full star higher than they should be. Tony Oxley, David Murray, and Evan Parker are good examples of this type of rabid adulation that Cook and Morton harbor for such musicians. Seriously, some of these guys have a career average of 4 stars, and not even Miles or Trane managed to pull that off in the Penguin Guide. That should tell you something right there.And now the disfavored. If it's West Coast, Cool, or Third Stream jazz, then expect reviews of such material to be somewhat off kilter. Musicians of these genres are continually placed on a lower shelf when it comes to the authors' tastes. The Penguin Guide's crown status eludes such notables as Miles Davis, Harold Land, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Chico Hamilton, Brubeck, and Paul Desmond. No crown for Birth of the Cool, no crown for the Mulligan/Baker piano-less quartet, no crown for Take Five, no crown for Chet Baker Sings, and no mention of Curtis Amy's Katanga anywhere. Seriously? I had to search high and low before I found Al Haig sitting atop the West Coast pile with Esoteric, a lesser known recording (and arguably far from being the finest West Coast offering out there). Indeed, of all the cool jazz/west coast recordings listed in this guide, only Shelly Manne's Blackhawk stuff and Stan Getz get a fair shake. So if you agree that the reviews for these artists are somewhat off, I would recommend adding at least half, maybe even a full star to any of their entries.Swing isn't a period Morton and Cook seem to respect all that highly, either. Glenn Miller, a huge figure in swing, doesn't even have an entry in the guide, and Benny Goodman goes puzzlingly uncrowned. The Carnegie Hall 1938 performance was a high point for jazz, but instead of praising it as the milestone it is, Cook and Morton accuse Goodman of trying to orchestrate the whole thing as a career topping move. Now this is something, which, even if it isn't utter nonsense, shouldn't devalue this important jazz document one bit. And yet, in the end, they give it only four stars.Additionally, Benny Goodman's small group recordings on Columbia with Krupa, Hampton, and Wilson, enormous in their influence upon musicians and listeners alike, fail to achieve the coveted crown, as well. If Benny can't knock it out of the park with either of these recordings, then you know something is wrong. This type of historical revisionism is maddening to say the least.Duke Ellington, one of the true giants of jazz, gets short-changed, too. Take Newport 1956, for example. This was another defining moment in the music of jazz, but even with Gonzales' 27 choruses restored by a superimposed VOA recording, what should be hailed as a lost classic receives only four stars. In fact many of his most important recordings get glossed over by the authors time and again. The only crown Duke garners comes from an obscure date in Fargo from 1940.Now Cook and Morton's bias aside, another shortcoming lies in the fact that the Penguin Guide addresses only those recordings which are currently available, something which creates frustrating omissions in a recording artist's career write-up. On the surface I suppose it helps to know what's currently available, but most if not all people buy their music online these days, so the dreaded words \\"out of print\\" are no longer the roadblock they used to be. You can find almost any recording online from an e-seller these days (be it vinyl, cd, or mp3 download), which makes these omissions in the guide frustrating. Conversely, it becomes beneficial to Cook and Morton as they can justify another edition of the guide every few years.As for the physical layout of the book, the print would seem to have become slightly smaller, as well, and I can't say I'm all that thrilled with the font.But in the end, if you can forgive the bias that crops up and overlook the glaring omissions therein, this is still a wonderful tome of knowledge that will lead you to some exciting places in jazz. Sometimes I just read it for the stories and the quality of writing Cook and Morton bring to the music."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"Just wanted to add to all the wonderful 5 star rated reviews that it might be a very good idea to buy all the editions (as i did). Many are still available and quite cheap as they are looked at as 'old' books. Particularly the first 4 or 5 have many many cds (and in the case of the first 2, many lps too) that are available but that simply were left behind for whatever reason (mostly to give space to newer recorded work and newer re-editions). Gradually many were left out in the newer Penguin editions. I usually go to the older editions to find albums that i suspect were reviewed earlier and 65% of the time i find them (or some comment that will at least encourage me and keep my interest in that particular album). For example, when i wanted to go deeper into the discography of Peter Brotzmann i found about 12 or 14 lps (many available now as cds) with great reviews and info on them. These reviews vanished after the 2nd edition. The same with many FMP Label artists that simply were not issued on cd at the time of writing thus giving me some info on some very obscure records.Maybe you are not as crazy as i am about music but believe me one edition of the Penguin Guide to Jazz is not enough. There is just too much music!!"},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"This is my essential guide for learning about and shopping for jazz. There is great detail about the recordings (although play list information is limited) and the ratings are a good guide to overall quality. The only problem is, of course, that it is impossible to keep current will all of the newly released recompilations excerpted from multiple previous releases. Still carefully reading of the Penguin Guide can provide good clues as to which recompilations are worthy of purchase and which are best passed up."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"I have often referred to the book as a shopping guide to find artists that I know nothing about. Like any critics, they have their biases and their bias is often touted as gospel if you take it at face value. For instance, Sheila Jordans' Muse records \\"Lost and found\\" is rated as superb-I disagree completely (and I love her singing)-it feels like going through the motions with a high production sheen to me. So opinions differ-that is what it is all about. With personal subjectivity coloring ones' aesthetic \\"objectivity\\" there can be no universal standard and there shouldn't be.You might find yourself in a mute argument against these guys mostly worthwhile opinions when you buy something they recommend and are not as impressed as they were, but that in itself can help you focus and shape your own music aesthetic compass -which is not a bad thing at all. I have been steered wrong on occasion, but I have been pleased when it really comes together-like Jane Ira Blooms 'The Red Quartets' -fantastic album! I feel that as much music as these guys have listened to, they are at the mercy of how attuned they are at the moment when passing judgment. No one is totally riveted to music 100% of the time when you are listening to 5 discs in a row. Attention will wander, emotional receptivity and the moment are not coupled-Cecil Taylor during the dinner hour with the wife?-probably a distraction-and the review might read \\"not his most engaging work....\\".There is a rote shtick that both engage in when evaluating an artists' recordings that is invariably a by-product of assembly line reviewing. Just like a jazz musicians' personal cliches amount to their style. I stopped at two editions finding little merit to buying a third one. There are, of course, glaring omissions-why is not Tony Purrone in this guide? One of the very best guitar players walking the planet, who by their own admission (when reviewing a Jimmy Heath album \\" the exchanges between Heath and Purrone are wickedly clever\\") is someone that begs attention. Should have followed up, because he is just that and more.What about Sam Rivers' small label recordings in the last two decades? Criminal. But then again, no one store or person can know or have all that is worthwhile in the music. Buy one guide and that will probably serve you well. Two, Three, four?-a waste of trees and money."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"This is the best available discography of jazz.The only flaw is that they only include what's currently available so no mention of Harlem Hamfats for example.But complete personnel and recording dates make it invaluable.Think you can get this info on the net?

Unfortunately there are not more comphrehensive sources. This is not a book for beginners to jazz, but it won't suit the needs of the serious jazz enthusiast. I don't think the Ninth edition will be any better than the eighth. But since there is nothing else out there except scouring the web, it's the only thing we have.

As a long time (30 years) musician who is new to the jazz world, I really needed a guide to help me wade through the monstrous amount of recorded jazz. This book is proving quite effective in the task. I especially like the \\"Core Collection\\" notations on those recordings that are considered must haves for the jazz aficionado. The list makes it easy to select what to search out and buy next, either by artist, style, instrument, backing musicians, recording era, you name it. One of my gripes is that the core collection is not listed all together in one index somewhere (I went through all 1500 pages and noted them down myself), which would have been a great help. I also didn't like the fact that the authors sometimes fail to mention when you are going to have one helluva a hard time finding certain recordings, either because they are so esoteric, so long out of print, or just plain way out there.

Some are wonderful, informed, intelligent remasters of classic and obscure jazz performances which the collector loves to lay his or her hands on. There are also crap reissues of Jazz clearly issued to pick up a quick Euro or two. There are individual CDs and sets: some good, some bad. All the tracks on these resissues have fallen out of copyright in the EU. In others words, the recordings are over 50 years old. We do not have this loophole in the sound copyright laws here in the US. So it is very exciting to lay your hands on some favorite obscure recording on an import CD that you used to have on an old 78 or LP or have recordings from several different labels all on the same CD or in a box set. (Soon the public domain copyright law loophole in the EU is changing to allow only recordings 70 years old to be issued legally.)The reason for this introduction about import Public Domain reissues on CD is this:When one is reading this latest edition of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings it is informative to see the reviews of all these PD reissues that are available in the UK and Europe. However, here in the US these titles are not readily available unless you track them down as imports on Amazon. I for one would like to see reviews of \\"legitimate\\" label CD reissues which are available worldwide from the original record companies.

This book is packed with unreleased and rare recordings i hadn't heard of, and, as an avid and passionate jazz connoseiur myself, it was a nice surprise. Overall, this anthology contains practically every known recording in the last century, however i was disappointed that it failed to highlight several key and influential players, AS LEADERS of the young lions movement in the early 90s- Stephen Scott (pianist), Antonio Hart (alto sax). For example, the book mentions hot new players Robert Glasper and Marcus Strickland as leaders, but only focuses on the sidemanship of Joey Calderazzo, Aaron Goldberg, Darren Barrett, John Ellis, or Kenny Kirkland.--i realize it would be impossible to mention every single recording to date, due to the immensity of this ever-changing jazz community, however vast it may be. If anyone doesn't know the previous names i mentioned, please go to your nearest record store and buy at least one of their albums and it will not disappoint.

Never mind that the material has been available for some years on the Jazz Oracle label. And this is a crown CD! The second major problem is that many of the star ratings don't match the text.

Bear with me: I've been a dedicated jazzhead for 20+ years and have bought an ungodly number of CDs based on word-of-mouth, industry buzz and personal encounters. Today was the first time I've ever looked to the Penguin Jazz Guide for shopping advice. (I found a rare Bobby Hutcherson CD at Amoeba and consulted the store's 2008 Penguin Guide to determine the lineup.) Well, they didn't include it. So be it.But then I started thumbing through it, looking up some of my recent favorites. Morton and Cook's smug, dismissive, snarky, often hostile reviews were appalling. Who are these guys and what are their musical credentials? If I'd been taking their advice these last twenty years, I would never have heard some of the best new jazz that's out there. (Kurt Rosenwinkel is \\"boring\\"? Please, that's as tonedeaf a statement as I've ever heard.) This guide does a tremendous disservice to jazz if it's dissuading buyers from taking chances on new artists.

I was terribly sad to learn that, between the eighth and ninth editions, Richard Cook passed away. Morton's affectionate obituary -- done as a PGTJ review -- is quite touching and amusing.If you are new to the Penguin Guide, this is a great an edition to start with as any. The core information remains valid and reasonably up to date, and the prose -- knowledgeable, candid, humorous, and snippy -- is as engaging and delightful as ever. Longtime Penguin Guide connoisseurs, however, may be confused by some of the revisions and decisions that went into this edition. Before I begin knitpicking (and I'm only halfway through it), please let me say that all of what is below is marginal and in now way a reflection on the overall quality of the book. Buy it...Now for the small stuff.While a lot of mistakes have been ironed out of the last edition (mostly copy-editing-type errors), there are still annoying inconsistencies, especially with accidentally crediting, say, a piano player with bass in the personnel listings. Also, there is a lot of weird inconsistent spacing in the columns. A small complaint, perhaps, but Cook and Morton work with limited space, and any mis-handled space is wasted space that could be filled with more of their great writing. In general, the copy-editing continues to disappoint me.Also, check out Bobby Previte's bio entry -- it seems to actually be a review from a different section of the book. C'mon, Penguin editors!More confusing, however, is what the authors have decided to reinstate and remove. Morton makes it clear in his forward that they have had delete entries of somewhat marginal figures whose discographies have not grown of late. Understood...and yet:- Michael Mantler, yanked from the last edition, is back in, although he has not released anything new (actually, he's put out a best-of that was not included in his entry).- Terje Rypdal, who HAS released new music since the last edition and remains a major figure in European improvised music, is now mysteriously out.- In an situation that repeats itself many times in the book, entries for artists like Rod McGaha and Steve Masakowski are re-inserted, having been deleted from the previous edition, despite having no new releases. This is just seventh-edition text repeated for no good reason. Meanwhile, Jeff Coffin has released two new albums, but his entry has been deleted.Cook and Morton seemed to have missed some key new releases, too, such as the PSI reissue of Evan Parkers \\"Topography of the Lungs.\\" On the upside, Blossom Dearie finally gets an entry.This book is a big ol' organic thing, and such maddening inconsistencies are really petty in the grand scheme. Don't listen to me -- buy the book and listen to Cook and Morton."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"I have been acquiring The Penguin Guide to Jazz since the 4th Edition. The Ninth is an excellent continuation to the best publication for Jazz Collectors and new converts.What is great about The Penguin Guide is that it serves the collector audience as well as being the best guide for those who has been bitten by the Jazz bug but who are seeking a road map for what is a brand new immense universe.For the 2000+ CD Jazz collector, the exhaustive amount of information isn't gathered together and structured better in any other book built for the same purpose. The format which includes all of the necessary details such as dates, players, labels and locations fuels the avid collectors need for information. Without a doubt, recordings are presented that even the most thorough collector has missed or is reminded of in the Guide.Of course, the funnest part of this colossal book is the rating system. The star system with the peppered Crown scoring is both affirming and maddening, i.e. how could McCoy Tyner's, \\"The Real McCoy\\" not be granted a crown but some other lesser (in my opinion) album get the award. But the surprises are also great. A friend of mine sent me a copy of Steve Harris & Zaum's, \\"Above Our Heads The Sky Splits Open\\" a few months before I ordered the Ninth Edition. My friend from Texas noted that he thought this might be one of the best contributions to Improvisational Jazz in recent years. Finding it in the new edition rated as a Crown record was a high point.Of course, any avid Jazz fan will find artists not represented. Albert van Veenendaals absence particularly surprised me.All in all, this companion is 99% perfect and essential for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the greatest music.p.s. I am curious about any future plans to convert the Guide to an interactive software/DVD format ?!"},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"Of course this is a great reference, and with each edition, it gets better. Neophytes should not be scared off by the massiveness of the book. In fact, it's Core Collection and Four-Star-Plus-Crown features make it a good place to get an overview of jazz, and sort out what to buy from the thousands of jazz recordings available.One thing to keep in mind, though: reviews, no matter how authoratative, are opinions. Some of the four-star recordings here are ones that I wouldn't give a second listen to. Some of my all-time favorites rate only 2 or 3 stars. Not that I'm right, but tastes do differ. On the whole, I think there is a bias toward the more experimental, avant-garde recordings. This actually makes for a good counterpoint to the hatchet job Ken Burns and Wynton Marsalis did in their PBS series, but still, it is a bias."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"I always look forward to the new edition of the Penguin Guide to Jazz, and Cook and Morton don't disappoint this time around. By this point, there's no need for me to comment on the quality of the reviews -- they are consistently well-informed, thoughtful, pithy, and with any dash of sarcasm always undercut by genuine affection and reverence for this music. This is essential for any jazz lover -- be he/she a neophyte or someone already waist-deep in the music.Their are some formatting developments in this edition. The index, absent from the last edition, has returned. I was pretty shocked and disappointed when it didn't make it into the last edition. They have introduced an \\"In Brief\\" section at the end of entries, which wraps up minor albums in an artist's ouevre. Generally it focuses on less essential titles -- works that are adequate but not spectacular -- and leaves the body of the entry to cover the highs and lows. Not a bad thing.I will say that this edition suffers from poor copyediting. Some albums appear twice in the artist entry, and some sentences are clearly missing nouns/verbs/adjectives. Compared to the golden standard of previous editions, this is a bit disturbing.And I guess Cook and Morton finally succumbed to all the nay-sayers who said that Michael Mantler is not jazz -- he is out of the book.

Similarly, many of the listed CDs are NOT readily available in the US. CDs listed are heavily slanted toward European releases, a vastly disproportionate percentage of the reviews are for the French Melodie Jazz Classics series. Since many older tracks are often gathered in similar \\"Best Of\\" type releases, it would have been possible to cross check existing compendiums by track title, but the only track listings are for a few specific tracks on a CD in the text of the review. So... for a book that is supposed to be a buyers guide, it falls far short in completeness. Well, it is published in the UK, and is probably a lot more useful there.All that said, the reviews that are there are usually interesting, sometimes even enlightening. Unlike most efforts of this kind, the personnel listings for each CD (at least the ones I checked) seem complete and accurate. The capsule biographies manage to capture a lot about each artist in a concise form my old journalism teacher would have admired. While the highest rated CDs are mostly great choices for a beginning jazz library, there are two many levels of quality amongst the four star (highest rating) choices. On the plus side, the reviewers do deal with remastering sound quality, a significant issue particularly with older material.The editors omitted most CDs which would have garnered 2 stars or less.

You won't find a better compendium anywhere. For some reason jazz continues to remain a veiled subject.

They cover the artists down through the years, noting which are the most important CDs to help you round out your collection. They provide many trenchant observations and clue you into new artists, as well as uncover a few gems from the past that are back in print. It is best to hold onto back copies because the authors only cover what is currently in print, so selections vary from edition to edition."},{"Title":"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition","review":"What an excellent tool this is--as well as a fine read.

It seems a bit ridiculous to publish a book of reviews in this day and age. \\"All Music Guide\\" is online and as a result more up to date. They may not have a written review for every release in an artists discography but at least they list it and rate it. AMG seems to be more generous in it's ratings and reviews than Pengiun.

The reviewers at Downbeat seem to have a similar perspective. I appreciate that because as a result I now enjoy listening to many European \\"avant garde\\" artists that I may have never known about otherwise. \\"All About Jazz\\" is another online source for reviews but their philosophy seems to be \\"if you don't have anything nice to say.....\\"As always tastes vary.

The courtroom drama is as good as those in Scott Turow's and John Grisham's novels. Who framed Hester, and why? That's what William's about to find out. . .The three friends face life and death together here, and you can truly feel the bond that's been established among them. Though they don't always like each other, their loyalty and valor in helping one another makes this series a real delight. A great read all the way around"},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"I Have read most of Anne Perry's novels and I am a great fan. All of her books are set in England of another era. Anne Perry has two different settings and main protaganists. The first series and most popular is The Pitts(husband and wife) a detecting team in early Victorian England. Her more recent series features Inspector Monk in the late 1800's.&quot;The Sin of the Wolf&quot; features Inpsector Monk and with this book, Inpector Monk has finally reached a point where he is a likable character, in prior novels Monk is portrayed as a good person but not one who you could warm up to. With this novel, Miss Perry makes you like him.There is one more very fascinating aspect to Miss Perry's novels and that is the research she has put into them. When I read anyone if her books I feel like I am getting a very accurate description of not only the times and the people but the way they acted towards one another. England was a very class oriented society and these novels force you to recognize how man has treated man over the centuries.I should explain, I read mysteries constantly, 2-4 a week, I have read most popular and unpopular authors out there. What keeps me coming back to a certain author is the characters, if I like them, then I want to read all their adventures, so if you are like me, then Anne Perry is a great find"},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"While I agree with those reviewers who cite the courtroom scenes in Sins of the Wolf as terrifically compelling and am delighted with the developing attraction between Hester Latterly and William Monk, I cannot agree that this is one of Perry's finest mys teries in the Monk series. In fact almost every turn of events brought a new jolt of incredulity. As an example, why oh why does Monk make the long and arduous trip (in pages as well as distance) to Northern Scotland to learn a bit of information about on e of the members of the Farraline family which he could so easily have learned from the family member himself and which in fact had no bearing whatsoever on the resolution of the mystery? To be really petty, must Hester turn up at the Farralines one day a fter the conclusion of her trial (and surprisingly cordial and unembarrassed the Farralines are too, considering the mess they'd thrown her into) still wearing her prison garb? And the confrontation and chase scene at the end seemed to me to smack more of a spaghetti western than a quality denouement. In my opinion Perry did much better with the earlier Monks, and I hope to discover she does just as well in the subsequent ones."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Although I read all of Perry's \\"Thomas Pitt\\" murder mysteries first, I'm nevertheless developing a liking for this series, set a generation earlier, in London of the late 1850s. William Monk, police inspector turned private eye, and still dealing with amnesia in this fifth outing, is not a particularly likeable person. He's rude, arrogant, and self-righteous -- but so is his frequent investigative, nurse Hester Latterley, lately returned from the Crimea. The third leg of the narrative tripod, defense attorney Oliver Rathbone, is much less so, but he can be rather stuffy, too. This time, Perry sets the crime, Monk's investigation, and the subsequent trial in Edinburgh, which gives her the opportunity to explain on numerous occasions the function of the Procurator Fiscal and to bring in the uniquely Scots trial verdict of \\"not proven.\\" (She also makes Monk travel by rowboat and horseback to the remote village in the far north of the Highlands where she herself now lives.) The plot, which involves family secrets and a murder committed to protect them, is one of Perry's better efforts in recent years. This is also the first novel in either of her mystery series in which there appears to be no prominent social issue or failing for the characters to struggle with and fulminate against."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"First, I must admit I did enjoy the book, and read it non-stop till two o'clock in the morning. You find yourself really caring for what happens to the characters. The bad point, though, is that they seem to be the only thing carrying the story forward. The author has us, delve alongside Monk, into the secrets of the Farraline family, and, frankly, there are so many of them it's ludicrous. I won't give away the plot, but you have to know that so many things end up being unearthed-it's practically one shameful secret per character-that it makes you wonder, a bit sarcastically, why they all happen in the same family, and how Monk comes to discover all of them practically within the space of a week. This is stretching belief a bit thin. On the plus side, though, it's a compelling story-but definitely not very realistic."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Former Crimean War nurse Hester Latterly accepts an engagement that will occupy only two days of her time, because she is between private duty positions and finds the advertisement intriguing. She will travel to Edinburgh and escort an elderly lady from there back to London, providing Mary Farraline with both companionship and a trained nurse to see to her needs if Mrs. Farraline should become ill. She will also administer the night and morning doses of Mrs. Farraline's heart medication, which are pre-measured and part of a familiar routine. Hester enjoys her patient's company, and settles herself for sleep on the night train without any clue something could go wrong. She awakens in London to find her patient dead, and when she opens her own baggage after leaving the station she discovers a brooch that she knows is not hers. She also knows she did not take it, but the patient's family does not believe her and reports her to the police as a thief. After a physician's examination of the body identifies the cause of death as a massive overdose of digitalis, the charges change from theft to murder.Hester's friends include private enquiry agent (and former police inspector) William Monk, brilliant barrister Oliver Rathbone, and Lady Callandra Daviot. All three rush to prove her innocence. When the Scottish authorities decide that Hester must be tried in their courts, in Edinburgh where the train journey began, Sir Oliver must change his role from Hester's defending counsel to that of advisor; because he cannot practice law in Edinburgh, and he does not know the man hired to do that in his stead. Nevertheless Monk continues investigating the Farralines, among whom the real murderer must surely be found...if he can only accomplish that in time to save Hester from the rope.Perry's usual literate prose and fast pace make this book a pleasure to read, and her characters develop - as they always do - in ways naturally resulting from the plot. Also as usual, the overriding theme goes beyond that plot as Perry explores the ways in which a murder investigation reveals secrets the people being investigated (the innocent as well as the guilty) would much rather keep concealed. I found the conclusion a bit rushed, but otherwise this is a marvelous piece of work.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"No one does Victorian ambiance better than Anne Perry. Her mise-en-scene is perfect; her characters well and thoroughly developed; her storylines always clear and often surprising. The early Victorian underworld in the Monk series is baldly presented to clarify the strict sociatal limits that existed in that era. Perry has specific \\"causes\\" that she espouses in her work, i.e.: the broad mores that separated men's rights from women's rights, the abysmal treatmeant of women and how easily they could lose their \\"virtue\\" and be tossed aside in a society that was unquestionably patriarchal and strict but all too forgiving of men's mistakes and roughness, the arrogance, insensitivity, and sense of entitlement of the upper classes, \\"acceptable\\" shady business practices and the social havoc they cause, the need for better medical care especially in recognizing the role of nurses taught to care and treat and not merely empty the slops and scrub the floors and then receive pay in \\"porter\\" rather than coin, perpetuating the lowly lives and disdain heaped upon them. The plight of the poor and of women is front and center in all Perry's work. She also very bravely takes on the sex trades and their destruction of humanity, all of which is primarily wrapped up in the priorities of the upper classes. Injustices of all kinds find airing in Perry's Victorian mysteries. Perry is always a good read."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"This is easily the best entry in the Monk series. The mystery was great, and the personal interplay between Hester, Monk and Rathbone was excellent. This was also the book where the emotion between Monk and Hester finally wins out over their reserve with each other, and the results are endearing. A must read for anyone who likes this series and these characters."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Sins of the Wolf (William Monk Novels)i just started reading this mystery series and it is fabulous. This book in particular had me on the edge. I have just finished the next one in the series. I enjoy the character development from one book to the next."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Anne Perry is a talented historical murder mystery writer. She shows her skills here as she has in her previous and subsequent works. I just wish her personal history had remained unknown as the circumstances of her own offence bear absolutely no resemblance to the wonderful characters and well researched historical locations she creates. One thing Perry has in common with her characters is courage. Courage to write and continue writing after her &quot;past&quot; was made known. To see such matters raised in reviews by the likes of booklist makes me wonder whether the reviewer was trying to draw some sick comparison or use the fact to assist in the marketing of the book to those whose only real interest is personal morbidity. Booklist even got the facts wrong, including the wrong country of occurrance and imprisonment. A good book, as this is, deserves to be reviewed on its merits not the childhood history of the writer however shocking that might be."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Definitely not her best. I skipped at least 50 pages or more. Needed better editing.

A problem is that a lot of the book is devoted to Hester's predicament. Unfortunately this lacks any real suspense as the outcome is fairly obvious. The family of the murder victim, the Farralines are interesting but Perry spends too much time away from them. The revelations at the climax hint at a darker, much more interesting novel, had the book focused on them more. Pitt and Hester also prove to be rather irritating this time. The developments in their relationship are handled well but Perry's descriptions of their heightened emotional states becomes very tiresome, as Perry tends to repeat herself over and over again. So,there is a good story here but it's overwhelmed by the regular characters."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Good Service from this provider. Book came in the condition advertized.

The time period of her books is also a strong drawing point to me.I enjoy envisioning the places, people, time.This book is a backward look at Monk as I have been reading her more recent issues. Just love her books."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"The Sins of the Wolf By Anne PerryThis novel takes place during the Victorian era. The main character, Hester Latterly had been in the Crimean War. She had served as a nurse under the supervision of Florence Nightingale. Florence was said to be \\"second only to the Queen herself in the respect and admiration of the country.\\" During the war the weight of responsibility placed on Hester's shoulders was great, as a senior officer was not always available to make the critical judgement. It was an age of trains and horse-drawn carriages. Mary, the woman Hester was looking after, was born the year after the fall of Bastille. Mary remembers the times when the Emperor had all of Europe under his heel- the emotion, the spirit as they expected an invasion every day. They had lookouts on cliff tops and beacon fires ready to light the moment the first Frenchman set foot on the shore. However England had been secure all of Hester's lifetime. People also used to frighten the young children with stories of Burke and Hare. This is a true story of two Irishmen who started selling corpses to a doctor so he could teach his students anatomy, then progressing to robbing graves, and finally to murder. It all came out in 1829. Burke was hanged, but Hare never was. The story was that he was still alive in the present day of the novel. Mary had a brother killed in Waterloo. Waterloo had been the greatest land battle in Europe, and the end of an empire. Men of all nations had fought to exhaustion till the fields were strewn with the wounded and the dead, the armies of Europe, as Lord Byron had said, \\"in one red burial blent.\\" As the book continues, part of the plot takes place in the Templelands. This was land that belonged to the Knights of Templar during the Crusades. The dress is broad, sweeping skirts, elaborately decorated sleeves, and bonnets. The trial, which occurs in the novel, takes place in the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh- governed by one queen, one parliament, and fifteen men in the jury. The trial is held in Scotland. Which is of importance as they find the defendant- not proven. This is a verdict, which didn't exist in England or America for that matter. It basically meant that the jury found the defendant guilty, but had no way to prove it. Just the same, she could not be tried again. The historical role the main character, Hester, played was a nurse in the Crimean War. She had an incredible responsibility to do the best that she was capable of, at that time, day after day. However she also realizes that the trust and responsibility, and the power to act for herself were the two aspects of the war that she missed the most profoundly. Now she often found her decisions to seem so trivial. She had seen a great deal of suffering. What she thought to be the worst of all her experiences was not the injuries, but the rats and waking up cold. She longed to know that there was nothing else alive in the room but her. She also realizes the blessing of being filled with not thoughts of herself, but only what she could do for others. As she only thought of her patients, it left no room for her to think of her own sorrow and suffering. Hester Latterly accompanies Mary, an elderly woman, to London by train. She is hired by Mary's family to be her nurse, and simply to keep her company on the trip. They both go to sleep on the train, however in the morning Hester arises to discover Mary is dead. It is discovered that poisoning kills Mary. Hester is found with one of Mary's expensive pins in her bag. She is accused of murder because she had access to Mary's medicine, and seems to have stolen an expensive piece of jewelry. She is tried in Scotland. Meanwhile her friend Monk is practically living with the family of the deceased trying to discover who truly killed Mary. Hester is found \\"not proven\\" and is released after an intense court battle. She and Monk then return to the family of Mary to discover the dark secrets of the family and the true killer. This book has several themes. The obvious theme is never to lose hope. There is a point in the novel where it looks as though Hester will be found guilty and hanged for the charge. She all but gives up hope. Her two detective friends and her lawyer work very diligently, and are able to set her free. The title, The Sins of the Wolf, is a biblical reference. Communication through words is what sets us apart from beasts. However once we pollute our language with lies, we can no longer be reached. We have become isolated. There are three great circles of hell- the leopard, the lion, and the wolf. Deceit, corruption, and betrayal are the sins of the wolf - the lowest circle of hell, the deepest pit of all. Hester's theme in the novel is her unknowing longing for true friendship. The actual killers wanted riches, but even their riches were counterfeit. Their lives epitomized the sins of the wolf- corruption, deceit, and betrayal and in the end they ended up with nothing. Conversely, Hester's life was filled with truthfulness, honesty, and loyalty, which led her to a true and complete friendship. This novel educates the reader about the Victorian era by placing a fictionalized mystery in an authentic setting. It gave excellent descriptions of the dress, the court system, the education, and class interactions. One young woman of a high social status was forced to hide the fact that she was helping the poor to read. She was rich and proper, and it was thought that she shouldn't be associated with men of a lower class. The fact that they were poor only heightens the urgency of literacy. In today's society, it shows that the illiterate and poor must be first taught to communicate, for only then can they become anything in life. The poor shouldn't be forced to stay in a lower class because no one will help them when they have the drive to become great. I definitely recommend this book. It is extremely interesting, and kept me guessing about the killer and the motive throughout the entire novel. The level of reading is not too difficult, and it is a quick read. The plot is filled with surprising twists and suspense. Anne Perry has created an intense novel, and a wonderful mystery."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"I picked this book up when an office was clearing out more because it was free than out of interest. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it through and through. Murder mysteries are not my usual forte but Perry has a knack for developing characters I came to care about. I've come to understand that this is actually a series and the main character is a recurring one but it still stands on its own very well. It isn't often a female gets the lead in a murder/mystery and I'm glad that she's feminine, smart, and capable.I was pleased with the historical setting (Victorian England) and found it pleasantly accessible and written in a concise contemporary style."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"I am in the process of reading Perry's Monk books in order.

This was my least favorite of all Anne Perry's novels. It was compelling insofar as I had to keep reading to see the conclusion, but I figured out the villian early on in the book. And, quite honestly, as has been stated in other reviews, it really stretched the imagination to accept all the scenarios regarding the family members. And, the bickering between Monk and Hester is distracting. I'm sticking with William Monk because I love his character and, I want to see the relationship between him and Hester flourish. This series, more so than the Pitt series, I believe, is better read in order."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"I enjoy both the William Monk and Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Series--I had missed Sins of the Wolf--the beginning of Monk's Romance with Hester. I was gripped with mystery and appalled by the terrible conditions for prisoners and the less fortunate at this time in Great Britain. History and mystery come to life, with a spine tingling finish. A great romp!"},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"Anne Perry never dissapoints. Her attention to detail transports the reader to another time.. Monk and Hester give me troubles so real and compelling that I forget my own.If you enjoy well written period mysteries these are the finest."},{"Title":"The Sins of the Wolf","review":"When I was reading this book (my seventh in the \\"Monk\\" series) I hardly realized what the title was because I was reading it on my Kindle. However, when I finished, I recognized that the title of the book was ingenious. Anne Perry is so clever and such a good thinker and writer. So, one must ask: \\"who was the wolf?\\" and \\"what were the sins?\\" The title may be a biblical reference to Jeremiah 5:6--and also an allusion to Dante's Inferno. Dante, in his epic poem, uses a she-wolf as a metaphor for sins of uncertain symbolism during his walk through hell. And, at the end of this book, Monk names them.The main character is Hester Latterly. She is on her way to Edinburgh to escort an elderly woman on a return train trip to London. She arrives at the Farraline house and spends one day with her patient Mary's family, which includes two daughters and two sons-in-law, two sons and one daughter-in-law, and also the brother of her dead husband. Some reviewers have complained about all the characters but that's because they haven't read carefully enough.After reading six previous Monk books, I have come to know Hester as if she was part of my family. And, I must admit I became very uneasy when she was falsely accused of murdering, Mary Farraline, as they were returning to London from Edinburgh. At first it was thought that Mary died of natural causes, but later after autopsy, it was found that she died of an overdose of her own digitalis heart medicine innocently administered by Hester.Previous to her arrest Hester goes to see her friend, Lady Callandra Daviot, and while looking for pins for her hair, she discovers a gray pearl and diamond brooch belonging to Mrs. Farraline in her own bag. She immediately goes to see her friend and barrister, Oliver Rathbone, for advice but on her return to Callandra's, she is arrested for theft and taken to jail--later to be accused of murder.Monk is immediately dispatched to Edinburgh by Oliver to dig up evidence against Mary's family members as only they had access to her medicine case and her jewelry box. Monk deviously gets to know the family, but doesn't find anything that will help Hester. In the meantime, she is suffering in prison and seems to be losing hope.Oliver learns that Hester will have to stand trial in Edinburgh. Callandra hires a Scottish barrister named James Argyll to defend her with Rathbone as an advisor. Anne Perry is brilliant when it comes to describing the trial, word for word. I especially liked the testimony of Florence Nightingale whose reputation was \\"second only to the Queen herself.\\" And, Hester's testimony was the epitome of a woman of character and honesty. At the end of the trial, Hester is released but is not judged innocent.Thus, Monk continues to look for the person or persons who murdered Mary Farraline. Each member of her family is suspect, but after a perilous journey and a close call for both himself and Hester, the case is solved. I enjoyed getting to know the characteristics, both good and bad, of each member of the Farraline family including their dead father. And, Monk finally realizes that he is strongly involved in friendship with Hester although he doesn't consider it love. You will like the descriptions of England and Scotland. The actual place where Anne Perry lives is referred to in this story. And I enjoy reading about the Victorian era. Perry always includes bits of actual history such as the tale of Burke and Hare, two Irishmen who sold corpses that were used to study anatomy, and of course, the Crimean war where Hester served under Florence Nightingale.So, have fun and try to solve the mystery."},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"A theory so plausible and eloquently argued that you want to give yourself a V-8 forehead slap. Freedman looks at the Ten Commandments (yes, he addresses ALL ten of them) in relationship to the Primary History in the Bible (the nine books from Genesis through Kings, minus Ruth). Along the way he disburses some very interesting information that will enhance Bible readers' future experience with the Bible texts: he explains the practice of &quot;the pairing of texts&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, makes compelling points about Jeremiah's relationship to the Primary History, contrasts monotheism with henotheism and monolatry, and gives a fascinating explanation of how the Hebrew divining stones, the Urim and Thummim, probably worked.I've always felt Bible readers have made the mistake of elevating the Torah/Pentateuch at the expense of the rest of the Old Testament. Freedman's thesis seems to defend the integrity of the Hebrew Scriptures as a whole. He shows how the Israelites broke each of the Commandments they received in the wilderness. Not only broke them, but with minimal adjustments to sequencing, Freedman shows that they broke them in order. This breaking of the Commandments constitutes a &quot;scarlet thread&quot; that runs through the Primary History and that ultimately explains why the Israelites suffered defeat and exile at the hands of God's enemies. But there are ten commandments and only nine books in the Primary History. Which commandment does not get represented by a specfic sinful act in a book of its own is a mystery Freedman does not answer until the last chapter. The suspense makes this highly accessible scholarly work, a bit of a page-turner.If you read this book and enjoy it, you might also like the equally fascinating but more ambitious &quot;Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds,&quot; by Donald Harman Akenson."},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"No bones about it, this book is well-written. Freedman gives a quick review on the development of Hebrew monotheism out of the older Canaanite polytheism, and then proceeds onto his argument. The argument is well-written and at least superficially persuasive, but after thinking about it I'm not sure I'm convinced. Freedman makes too many assumptions about the \\"symmetry\\" of the Ten Commandments that have no precedent in the text itself; in his discussion of the symmetry of the Bible as a whole I was afraid he was getting dangerously close to numerology or such similar pseudoscience, but thankfully, as befits his reputation, he stuck to accepted methods of analysis in the end. But sticking to accepted standards does not make your argument air-tight: as Freedman himself admits, there are many exceptions to his \\"rule,\\" which he dismisses, but which I find personally to be damaging to his thesis. The fact that he has to make covetousness a \\"background commandment\\" is, as has been noted, special pleading, as is the placing of the first two violations in Exodus, with none in Genesis (none that he counts anyway; in reality there are many in Genesis). This means that the nine commandments are broken in eight books instead of nine. His rearrangement of the order of commandments 6-8 is not as solidly based as he claims either, and there is actually no breaking of the fifth commandment (the example Freedman gives is in reality a law, not an actual event, but he makes an excuse for this as well). Overall, I think the \\"patterns\\" Freedman claims to detect are just coincidence, but this is a great book to read none-the-less because it is honest, scholarly, and novel."},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"David Noel Freedman does it again with this enoyable book. The title makes it sound more radical than it really is. What Professor Freedman does it take note of an interesting pattern that concerns the Ten Commandments and can be found in the Bible's &quot;Primary History&quot; (Genesis-2 Kings). His manner of presentation is easy to understand and interesting. Plus, there are a number of photos and illustrations and fascinating excurses. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"It's rare to find a well-written, well-informed, highly-original book on any subject, much less the heavily-mined territory of Biblical Studies. Unlike Bloom's The Book of J, this book is actually written by a respected biblical scholar.The book explains many of the unusual word choices and locutions you encounter if you manage to read the whole thing, especially the differing order of commandments across the Old and New Testaments. Some of the discussion smacks of special pleading (can't make the commandment against covetousness fit your theory? must fit in as a 'background commandment' for the rest...).Overall, however, the author makes a very persuasive case for an outside editor who edited in references to the 10 commandments thruout the early books of the Old Testament. The author treats the subject matter with reverence and tact, and the 'editor theory' helps explain the remarkable cohesiveness and literary quality to a book compiled over a millenium.Nicely illustrated and written almost as a detective novel, this book is highly recommended. Plus, you now have only nine commandments to worry about (oops, forgot that covetousness one)!"},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"Freedman's premise is a little stretched. He has to eliminate one commandment and shuffle the order of three others. Nonetheless his work is an intriguing, thematic study of the Hebrew Bible. His conclusions challenge conventional notions of Biblical authorship and compel the reader to dive in and explore both the narrative and the moral message of the Bible."},{"Title":"The Nine Commandments : Uncovering the Hidden Pattern of Crime and Punishment in the Hebrew Bible","review":"Re: the omitted &quot;10th&quot; commandment -- it's no mystery that coveting was also the commandment that tripped up the Apostle Paul (see Romans 7). While breaking the other commandments would be known by outward acts of disobedience, the commandment against coveting was the commandment that preceded and underlay the breaking of the others, yet remained hidden within a man's soul (and sometimes even hidden from himself) until it manifested itself by the breaking of one of the other commandments. James also lays the blame for man's sins on coveting (James 4:1ff). Freedman is right to single out this commandment from the other nine, as it's the scarlet thread (Freedman's oft-used term for his thesis) that ties the other nine -- indeed, man's whole fallen nature, INCLUDING the cause of the Fall (Eve's desire/coveting of the forbidden fruit) -- together. Recognizing this leads one to the Apostle's cry (and solution) in Romans 7:24-25. Failing to recognize this leads to the abortive attempts at righteousness that the Apostle also describes in Romans 10:3.But back to the book: This is so well-written, so accessible, that the most ill-educated (biblically) layman or laywoman can read this with pleasure and understanding.

This dictionary treats the Hebrew language as the Holy Tongue, and therefore etymologically treats it in and of itself, and how the precise meaning of every one of these Holy words must be determined in order to truly understand the Bible.It talks about how words that sound similar can have similar meanings, how they are connected to one another, and how substituting and/or rearranging letters gives rise to new roots.The dictionary is arranged by roots. According to the dictionary, words cannot have identical roots with different meanings, as they can in the BDB. Underneath the heading of each root is the various meanings of the root, noun and verb. It even considers many words such as &quot;but&quot; and &quot;also&quot; to come from a root, which the BDB does not (only nouns and verbs), I believe. For each meaning it cites a Biblical verse with that word in it. However, the dictionary's most serious shortcoming is that it is not grammatical enough and does not specifically state the different constructions of the verb (However, this can be determined, if one knows Hebrew grammar, by the Biblical quote cited).It also has internal contradictions, assigning (by accident? I hope so) one word three different roots (&quot;Nabhelah,&quot; &quot;we shall confound,&quot; is listed under the roots NBL, BLH, and BLL. Brown-Driver-Briggs, among most others, lists it under BLL).All in all a useful book for determining the exact meaning of a word if one knows Hebrew grammar. Another plus is it is possibly the most interesting dictionary I have. If I were forced to sit and read a dictionary I would choose this one."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Samson Raphael Hirsch","review":"I have found this book to be a very good supplement to use side by side with my Hebrew Lexicon. Where my lexicon points me to a a shoresh I reference this dictionary for further study. This book is perfect for someone who knows Hebrew (for the most part) and is simply trying to supplement their understanding. It is a dictionary that I can actually have fun sitting down and reading through the various shoreshim. It may be a bit rough around the edges in terms of grammar, and the novice in Hebrew may find some elements of it hard to understand. I would recommend this highly for the study of the Tanakh."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Samson Raphael Hirsch","review":"This is not a book for beginners, so I need a lot of help with it. Hebrew words are based on three-letter roots and then modified for grammar and syntax. It is supposed to be easy, but not for me. This book really gives insight into word development. I recommend it to anyone who is seriious in their learning."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Samson Raphael Hirsch","review":"The BEST tool for learning Biblical Hebrew more in depth. This is the one book I would not give up when reading the bible in Hebrew. It's very easy to use, concise and to the point. Wherever my bible goes, this goes also! It's all about the &#34;root words&#34; and how many meanings they can have. I also have &#34;The Analytical Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon&#34; which is great if you want to look up a word directly from the Hebrew Tanakh, with every word letter by letter, every verb conjugation, etc. But it's also &#34;harder on the eyes&#34;. If you're seriously studying, you need both. But this Etymological Dictionary is by far the most needful, especially when getting started. Once you begin delving into Hebrew, you can never have enough dictionaries. Praise the Lord, there are now so many tools out there.

This book bored me to the point where I was skipping pages and skimming paragraphs waiting for something to grab me. I liked Cass and Orla, but never warmed up to Jason - Cass's bear of a friend with a reportedly horrible temper and missing wife. Dante Chase gave me the creeps, too. Yes, yes, haunted by his past and all that but where was the appeal? I never got to the point where I understood why Cass liked him so much. The physical descripton of him was unappealing, as was his personality. A disappointment. Read \\"Every Woman For Herself\\" instead."},{"Title":"Singled Out","review":"Not as brilliant as her previous book, but still exceptional. Didn't care as much for the hero as in the first book. Several amusing deranged characters as backup make for fun reading."},{"Title":"Singled Out","review":"Cassandra \\"Cass\\" Leigh is a famous horror writer. Writing horror novels is a way to purge herself of past demons that still haunt her nightmares. Nightmares that are courtesy of her parents' idea of punishment, being locked up under cupboards for hours on end. She has a long-term lover, who is married, named Max. Max has left Cass in the U.K. and taken his wife off to America for about a year, leaving Cass all alone. Cass has always thought Max and she would eventually marry, have children, and grow old together. Now she realizes that it's never going to happen. Being in her mid-forties, it is probably too late for her to even get pregnant.Jason, her long time friend, has developed a crush on her, due to the Vampirella costume she wears while she does crypt-o-grams (singing telegrams). He has told Cass in no uncertain terms that he would GLADLY let her use him to get pregnant! At the same time, Dante Chase, the new owner of the U.K.'s most ghost-infested manor house, Kedge Hall, has caught her attention. Now, THERE is a man even more haunted by his past than SHE is!Every year the vicar has a slave auction that Cass volunteers for. The public bids on the volunteers, and once their indentured servant is purchased, the winner has a slave for one day to do chores for them. (Nothing kinky.) Max, Jason, and Dante are each determined to bid for her. And Cass somehow knows that they are all after more than a little light dusting or palm reading. Oh, did I forget to mention about Cass's little talent? If she touches someone she can feel their emotions, sort of an empathy talent.Through it all is her crazy family. Her father calls often and leaves long rants on her machine calling her the spawn of satan and preaching brimstone. Her mother won't speak with her. One of her brothers climbs rocks for fun. The other brother is always stoned, and is quite a character through this whole book, and her \\"sweet\\" sister, Jane, is anything but.***** This book will have you chuckling out loud as you read. Never a dull moment in this novel. And I could not help but L-O-V-E Cass. She is a riot and so easy going. If the author of this little gem, Trisha Ashley, ever decides to give up Contemporary, she could go into horror! Cass is always daydreaming scenes for whatever horror novel she is currently writing. I found myself as fascinated with Cass's writing as I was with Cass herself! Author Trisha Ashley is an author to watch as she buds out with all her talents. Count me in as one of her new adoring fans. Highly recommended reading here! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Singled Out","review":"Popular horror writer Cass Leigh believes that her personal life is an even bigger horror tale than her novels. For about two decades Cass had an affair with a married professor; she always dreamed that one day she would be his spouse instead of the other woman and raise children with him. Instead Max has crossed the Atlantic to America with his wife at is side leaving the middle aged Cass with regrets and sorrows.Already feeling like her poetry writing sister, two brothers, and her parents are right that she is the devil's offspring or at least his \\"Twisted Sister\\"; matters become worse as men insist on new roles in her life. Her long term pal Jason suddenly desires her and Dante's past makes her past look like heaven. Finally, even the village vicar wants Cass as he wants to matchmake the former mistress to the highest bidder at a charity slave auction in which Max sans spouse competes with salivating Jason and brooding Dante for Cass.This engaging chick lit tale subtly pays homage to Jane Austen while offering a solid amusing contemporary story that chick lit fans will appreciate. Cass is the center of the novel as all relationships come and go with her whether it is her lover, her family, or the other men in her life. Trisha Ashley makes her champion a full person who wonders when and how life had begun passing her by. The rest of the cast provides support but pale in comparison to the incomparable Cass.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Singled Out","review":"This is my first but not last dip into Ms Ashley's world.... wow.... i have wit like that, but hers is hundred times more brilliant and funny... what a gift.

Toddlers might even learn some colors, although the primary educational experience at this age is learning what a book is and does.Unfortunately, while the sliding board book concept is very fun, it is not long-wearing.

We have always enjoyed Murphy's pop-up books, such as Colors and One to Ten, because of the beautiful colors and the terrific paper art.

At the top or side of the page is a solid tab that allows the child to pull out a picture of an animal with that same texture on it (e.g. the red page has a ladybug hidden in it like the one printed on the cover of the book).This book is a favorite because the sliding mechanism is very well made, so my daughter is generally able to work the pages herself with little or no help from me. She recognizes the colors and textures on each page and names the animal before she pulls the picture out and then really enjoys demonstrating that she was right.

Shelley Duncan knows nothing about the workings of the band Quicksilver, except what she's culled out of rock historian books or rock critic's pages. The majority of the book is written like a Jackie Collins novel with it's graphic descriptions of sex in an attempt to titilate the reader. Her jealousy and lust (disguised as contempt) for band member Dino Valenti is obvious and laughable. There is also a lingering resentment towards womanizer Valenti for being \\"a bad influence\\" leading her husband Gary astray towards more and more other women and a far less family oriented lifestyle. News alert lady - that's what rock 'n' roll is all about. Shelley had no interests or career of her own during her marriage so she chose to hang around the house waiting for her husband to come home. As the old saying goes 'If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen'....but it took this ditsy dame 10 years to figure that out. There is also the question of whether some of her story actually is fact or fantasy - there is an author's note at the back of the book which reads: \\"Facts and memory may become different realities with the passage of time\\". Indeed!"},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"It was a gift to a good friend.

I imagine many kids may not have heard of them ( unless they read Guitar Player Magazine, where Quicksilver's other guitarist, the late, incredibally inventive John Cippolina, is a revered figure...) but they were very popular, so the 'rock star' sobriquet is deserved.The book is a delight to read and Shelly does a good job of telling us what it was like living day-to-day in the fabled 'summer of love' era.What I feel makes the book so charming is her struggle to make a decent liveable home for her family, keep her straying man in line and have some kind of life with her friends-the usual ordinary stuff, while living in the center of one of the last great mass cultural experiments this country experienced. Among her peers were the members and extended families of the Dead, Big Brother, etc etc..Ms. Duncan is quite frank about her sexuality, and her mixture of blossoming feminine awareness and old-school 'stand-by-your-man ' values is a refreshing change from the usual political rants ( male or female ) about those times. Having never had a sister myself, I learned some things about women's inner workings that surprised me. Her reasons for brief extra-marital affairs should be read by all men in serious relationships.Although never a druggie, her descriptions of her two, obviously important experiences with LSD are among the best I have read.I witheld one star because of several minor complaints. I wish there had been a little more about the shows that Quicksilver played, for one. The book suffers from some bad typos and editing problems. And her description of New York accents--well, take it from a New Yorker, they are OFF!Another plus, however--the stories about John Cippolina, who she must have adored, and his family are wonderful.

This is a very sexy book.I really enjoyed Shelley's book and highly recommend it to anyone wishing to view Life on the inside of an important rock and roll band during the heyday of the San Francisco Sound..."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"I happened to be fortunate enough to be part of the San Francisco scene in the 60's. Hung out in many a doorway, waiting for many a dance-hall doorway to open to get inside to listen to the changing times we were caught up in through the wonderful music that these bands were playing; Quicksilver, the Dead, the Airplane, Big Brother. We were part of the \\"cult\\" of the time, myself and my good friend Eddie the Roach. We spent our days over in Berkeley selling necklaces and silver items that we'd make at Golden Gate Park to finance our constant concert-going habits. I had the privilege of meeting Ms. Duncan through my girlfriend, Christina, who had a two-year-old sweet blonde little girl named Moonbeam. Christina and Shelley became really good friends via a friendship through their children. With this I want to say that I was really surprised that a wife of Gary Duncan, who was always stoned (Gary, that is) along with the rest of the band, was so opposed to, and did not do drugs because she was dedicated to being a good mother and provider for her children. She was one of the most caring, sensitive, down-to-earth woman I'd had the pleasure to know.This book is not about the band. It's not about musicians. It's about what a wife, woman and mother had to endure while raising children. Coping with drugs, a philandering husband, and being surrounded by capitalist, parasitic so-called \\"I'm your friend,\\" kind of people. Yet, Shelley survived with her mind and spirit intact. As I'm writing this, I realize I'm compelled to rebut \\"Cynthia's\\" borderline libelous attempt to demean a wonderfully written narrative of Shelley's personal experiences that no one else could have written except for Shelley. How dare Cynthia stand from the outside--obviously where she was at that time, spewing her negativity. It did not just come naturally. She had to work at it. She obviously was not a friend of Shelley's and the Quicksilver family. They would not have put up with her kind of thinking. The Quicksilver people were earthy, talented, and cared for one another. This kind of leads me to believe that there really isn't a \\"Cynthia\\" out there. This may very well be coming from a disgruntled old, mean ex-QMS hanger-oner who, like a tick on a hound dog, doesn't know when to let go.Buy the book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"It is funny how we treat musicians. We enjoy their music, we buy their albums, we accord them celebrity status, we want to know all of the salacious details of their lives and we try to keep them in some form of stasis so that things never change. Even a relatively competent local band has it's share of fans and if they begin to achieve some commercial success they soon assume all the trappings of stardom from the roadies to managers and the groupies.For many of us born in the 1950's pre-eminent would be the Beatles, the Fab Four, who galvanised millions of us, men and women alike into some form of mass hysteria, and their are many, who still cling to their heroes of yesteryear and hold out for the latest release of some Holy Grail of unreleased Beatle music.The initial attraction for me of this particular book was that the author was the ultimate insider witness to one of the most revered of the legendary Bay Area bands of the 1960's: Quicksilver Messenger Service. My prime motive was to learn more about the formation of the band and their music but I quickly found that this was a book about a relationship born out of love but no less a part of the story of the birth of a legend because of that.It is very hard not to be sympathetic with the author's tale. The summer of love began for her much earlier than in 1967 and she, in effect, lived the dream. Unlike many others who have followed in her path, as the spouse of a rock star, she did not begin her relationship as a groupie. In the early days at least that was one direction from which there was no competition. As time goes by and success rears it's ugly head then all the perquisites which attend with that success follow on as sure as night follows day. I do not condone the rock star behaviour or lifestyle but observe that it must be very difficult for anyone undergoing the success to be strong minded and strong willed enough to resist all of the temptations that they come across. Unfortunately, succoming to those temptations has real, very hurtful effects on others.This is a remarkable, open account of a young woman's love for her man. It is a brutal recognition of her development from a somewhat naieve young girl to a battle hardened woman throughout trials and tribulations that less strong willed characters would have wilted beneath. It is a compelling account of the love and devotion to her children and her small coterie of friends who have remained true to this day. It is an indictment of selfish behaviour of a talented rock star who was unable to resist temptation.Alas, this book is not about the music as such but it does provide the starstruck with some insight into what it is to be a professional musician. The constant practising, especially when one of the most gifted members of the band, John Cipollina was such a perfectionist, the late nights, the touring, the constant time away from home and family, the long long road to success only to find out how ephemeral that success may be. There is insight too into how insestual the relationships can be and the emotional wreckage inflicted upon everyone involved. One can think that success and wealth are appropriate compensations for the lives they lead and the effects on their families but surely no amount of money and wealth can ameliorate the damage on the discarded wives, girlfriends, children and groupies, nor can it mitigate the shortened lives of many musicians who surrender to the attractions of drugs and alcohol.I think that Shelly Duncan has survived as a strong and resilient woman who espouses much of what many of us believe is the true spirit of the sixties. Gary Duncan is shown to be as weak as most men are and to be a very human figure rather than some sort of rock god. It is a truly beguiling account of the other side of this life which I and millions like me discoverd in the 1960's and I wholeheartedly commend this book."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"Whenever I'm asked to try to describe the feeling of what it was like to be in San Francisco (and Marin) back in the '60's, I tell the person to listen to \\"THE FOOL\\" by Quicksilver Messenger Service.

Along with these 2 great guitar players were David Freiberg, Greg Elmore and Jimmy Murray. What a band!Trying to capture that feeling of walking up the stairs at the Fillmore Auditorium or Avalon Ballroom, and walking into what was a visual/audio carnival, is extremely difficult. That said, Shelley Duncan paints a vivid picture so clear that I'm there again. Life is indeed, Love. It was fun to go back in time to remember places like the lodge at Muir Beach, The Human Be-In (what a trip THAT was!)...it was all so beautiful until it fell apart.The book is very personal (it reads like her diary)... But that's why I loved it. She's honest and straightforward and I appreciated that.I highly recommend this book, if you want to get a real feel for that period and gain some extra insight into what made Quicksilver Messenger Service one of the great bands of that era.And don't forget to listen to THE FOOL! Life Is Love!"},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"As a big fan of Quicksilver and an audiophile, I found this a likeable read about, as the title intones, the trials and tribulations of a rock star's wife and life. It's written from a woman's point of view and confirms what we've just always suspected. How does a sexy, male rock star carry on even though he's married. Also, how a typical teenage girl from California met up with and bagged one of the famous pioneers of the San Francisco Sound in a psychedelic sixties band at it's peak of fame. The flavor of the times is rekindled for those fans of the flower power era. It is a point of view not oft heard from the other side of the curtain. As a old hippy chick and a flower child, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"When I bought the book, I expected to learn about Shelley's husband the rock star as well as about Shelley.

The title of the book referred to Quicksilver Messenger Service more than to Shelley and it should not."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"I bought this book hoping to gain some insights as to what made the music of the Quicksilver Messenger Service so unique and exciting. Though some episodes of the band members' personal lives were interesting in a way, the non-musical author's view of the band is very limited and the rest of the book is mostly about her growing up to be an adult while being a wife of a popular San Francisco Rock guitarist at a time when all the counter-cultural phenomena such as acid tests, dance concerts with psychedelic music, flower power, and free love, were in full bloom. But as the author's knowledge or understanding of these subjects are very limited, her writing boringThe story begins when she met and fell in love with Gary Duncan who played in a local band, went after Duncan to San Francisco, moved in with him, and married him at the age of sixteen, when Duncan was twenty. It seems that the author and Gary were in two different phases of their lives even from the beginning, and not really have connected spiritually, intellectually, or culturally. Duncan listened and played guitar to the music of Miles Davis, with his aspiration to play the best music he can muster, had a direction in his life, and went his way. The author was dismayed even when Gary practiced with the band longer than she expected. All she wanted was Gary's body next to hers. It's clear that she did not understand Duncan's needs.She may have had a different marriage experience with Duncan if she were interested in some of the stuff he was into; the music, motor-cycling, or sailing. Instead of making the effort to establish some common threads with her very talented husband, she seemed to have competed with all the things he loved and liked, and naturally her story reveals that the chasm continued to widen.The author stuck around Gary bitching and moaning while his fame and glory as a Quicksilver Messenger was good to her ego, and left Duncan when his career with the band came to an end and need love and support most. I was very relieved to read that soon after the author left, Gary was rescued by Dara who became his second wife, and is still with him to this day."},{"Title":"My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir","review":"GREAT BOOK!!!!

So here we have the next best thing, a well-written book by a biographer who had full access to the family archives and was himself an aviator.The book covers Sopwith's amazing life, from ballooning and early motorcars through the Sopwith Pup, Camel, etc. on to his second company, Hawker. While in the beginning Sopwith was a designer and pilot, his main strengths were in organization and picking the right men for the job.This isn't one of those \\"self-made\\" men stories however. It appears that the Sopwith family was immensely wealthy, and Sopwith's interest in yachts, motor cars and planes all began as rich man's hobby.This book is well-written and chock full of carefully selected anecdotes that illustrate what it must have been like to know the great man himself."},{"Title":"Peirce on Signs: Writings on Semiotic","review":"Selection of writings by Peirce.

That's the essence of what I take from reading &quot;To See the Dawn.&quot;The book is a collection of reports and proceedings from 1920, from when the First Congress of the Peoples of the East was held in Baku, a port city on the Caspian Sea in Central Asia.At the time, Baku was the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, and the congress was called by the Azerbaijan Communist Party in cooperation with the Communist International under the leadership of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party.The congress drew more than 2,000 delegates from workers' parties and anticolonial groups from across the region, including Afghanistan, Turkestan, India and elsewhere. These delegates attended the gathering to learn more about the revolutionary process unfolding in the Soviet Union, and inspired by the Bolshevik leadership's support for self-determination and the anticolonial struggle.That was key, the reports in this collection show, because the Russian czar and the old colonial powers of Great Britain and France played up religious, ethnic and national differences as a big part of their strategy of keeping working people divided. When the delegates realized that these differences masked much of what they had in common as working people and farmers, it opened the road to cooperation and trust.This book illustrates how powerful that lesson could be once again in that still-divided part of the world."},{"Title":"To See the Dawn: Baku, 1920-First Congress of the Peoples of the East (Communist International in Lenin's Time)","review":"The Struggle of the Oppressedby: barbaragreenway 04/27/03 02:27 pmrating:This is the perfect book to be reading right now with the current situation in the Middle East!

This is not just a \\"get out of debt\\" book or a \\"make real money\\" book. It is a book that reminds its readers how many of us stray from fiscal health, suckered in by the 'race to get ahead and then fall behind' values common to the vast majority of Americans - materialism, status, name brands, immediate gratification, antagonism, impermanence, gluttony, lack of responsibility, even lack of contentment. Ramsey knows all too well that when it comes to fiscal restraint and good money habits, this is not a virtuous society. He recommends solid values to counteract the mainstream of American life - patience, delayed gratification, humility, cooperation, peace, communication, contentment and, of course, paying CASH. I wholly applaud this philosophy.But, merely as a qualifier, I do want to let the prospective reader know that Mr. Ramsey's work is not secular. Bible passages, a Christian perspective and religious messages (such as suggesting prayer and counsel with clergy) set the tone much of the way, and the book is geared (not entirely but mostly) toward traditional and fairly conventional nuclear families.As a more daring and thorough departure from those seemingly ubiquitous American go-getter values that lure so many into dire straits (such as 'the more you buy the more you save'), I can heartily recommend the popular classic \\"Your Money or Your Life.\\""},{"Title":"How to Have More than Enough: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Abundance","review":"Consumer debt has long been a problem of most americans.

It is true that some people find his way of thinking to basic or too easy to be helpful.

The characters tell the story of the teeming wildlife on a large Texas ranch in the mid-1900s Texas. When you are through with the story, you will feel a deep kinship with the sense of place the story depicts. It will make you long for it, and long for other places you have come to love."},{"Title":"The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness","review":"Rick Bass is a totally unique writer... these tales at once seem like they have travled thousands of miles, yet they are also decidely planted in the post-modern world.These stories, as the title suggests, are concerned with the borders between civilized man and the wild... the wilderness. These are not really plot driven stories. (even, &quot;myths of bears&quot; which is a chase story, seems to have a foregone conclusion due to heavy foreshadowing). They are instead concerned with the unraveling of the human mind, the unforgiving but beautiful face of nature, the primal force of desire. One is compelled to read on, fascinated. The language is sparse, but poetic. It really does the job. &quot;The myths of bears&quot; is defintely the selling point here... one of the best short stories of the last 20 years. The rest is certainly interesting, especially &quot;Where the sea used to be&quot; which seems sort of like a sketchbook leading up to his masterful full legnth novel of the same title. These are stories that you'll find yourself reading over and over. Really amazing stuff. There are some images I just can't get out my head."},{"Title":"The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness","review":"I've followed Rick Bass since the publication of his first short story collection--The Watch--and enjoyed every book, both fiction and non-fiction. This collection is no exception. When I read Bass, I have to do it slowly. His stories always affect me emotionally, and I have to wait between readings to catch my balance. The first story is actually rather shocking in its violence. The second story is my personal favorite--truly a fine piece of literature. The third, the novella, gives the reader a feel of the wild. The only quibble I have with it is the sense that the author has difficulty writing from a woman's perspective. But that's a small thing! I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness","review":"The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness is actually three novellas in one book. The first is a somewhat interesting tale that has some suspense combined with Bass' always vivid imagery of the arctic wilds. I found the second story to be a confusing jumble of characters mixed with cumbersome metaphors concerning oil wells and mortality. The third is somewhat better in that it has beautiful imagery and a gentle, simple storyline. The only drawback is that almost absolutely nothing of interest occurs in the whole story. For those readers looking for a work of art translated into words, The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness will satisfy. If, however, you read a book to see something happen, you will probably be disappointed by this one."},{"Title":"The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness","review":"Although the title story is more descriptive than plot oriented, this book is worth buying just for &quot;The Myths of Bears&quot;.

The second novella, &quot;Where The Sea Used To Be&quot;, adds a great balance to this book, providing the reader the chance to cool down their nerves after &quot;The Myths of Bears&quot; with a greatly relaxing story about an oil seeker.

In this, her first single title and the third in her &quot;Tanner's of Texas&quot; series, she has constructed an emotionally deep story filled with vivid description and her own unique humor.In Tanner's Millions we are introduced to Kayla, a struggling waitress and college student, whose smile is only rivaled in size by that of her heart. When she spreads her sunshine to a brooding, troubled cowboy she has no idea as to possible consequences. And consequences there are when the cowboy turns out to be none other than Ry Tanner, a world-renowned former surgeon and heir to the Tanner fortune. Ry's desire to return the kindness shown him unfortunatley backfires when the press gets hold of the fact that the waitress has received a tip to the toon of $30,000 and make their own assumptions.Kayla is forced to hide from the many reporters inundating her for information on her &quot;affair&quot; with the newly divorced, wealthy doctor. Despite attempts to quiten the speculation and rumors, Ry is eventually forced to hide Kayla out on the family ranch. Now with one very angry waitress and a troubled former doctor living together in the same house things are bound to happen. Pressure on the two is intensified as together they face mysterious incidents on the ranch, a greedy ex and Ry's own personal demons. As the two grow together, they discover that they want much more than an &quot;assumed&quot; affair.Peggy Moreland kept me hooked with her wonderful characters and the emotionally gripping plot. Mixed with bits of humor, I found this book to be impossible to put down until I had finished the very last page. I look forward to finding out more about the Tanners of Texas and to seeing more single titles from this very gifted author.This is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Tanner'S Millions (Author Spotlight)","review":"This book is just as compelling to read as the other 4. And, I suspect that when the final brother's story comes out in November, it will be just as good as the others. My critique on this book is that I believe Peggy Moreland did stretch a little to get Dr. Ryland Tanner, the world-renowned surgeon (and 3rd of the 5 brothers)back home and needing to contemplate his life, his career vs his personal goals - when he finds out what these are. Finding himself attracted to a college student/waitress in a local bar got my interest in the beginning; and gifting her with a large check so she could continue her college education (while expecting nothing in return)brought the sub-plot to the fore. In fact, I think the last half of the book was even better than the first half because the story and the characters had been defined, and Peggy just flowed smoothly right through the \\"affair that isn't happening\\", the \\"hurt\\", the \\"anger\\", the \\"misunderstandings\\", the banding together of the other 4 brothers to \\"be there\\" for Ry when he comes face-to-face with our heroine (Kayla), and the apologies begin. Lord, I just love these stories."},{"Title":"Tanner'S Millions (Author Spotlight)","review":"I really did try to like this book. I certainly expected it to be good, since I've read most of Peggy Moreland's other books and enjoyed most. But this book starts out good and gets boring and stupid really fast. It's filled with cliches and stereotypes (particularly college students, most of which I personally never experienced in my years at college). The heroine starts out fine, but quickly becomes, well, an idiot, with over-blown reactions, spouting off typical &quot;you've wronged me!&quot; sayings that make any intelligent female reader grit her teeth and want to fling the book across the room.I couldn't finish this book. Maybe it gets better after page 154, but I figured I'd wasted enough time on it. I won't give up on Peggy Moreland, but I might buy the next one used."},{"Title":"Keys to Chinese Language: Textbook I (Bk. 1)","review":"I'm impressed with this book's functionality, especially for students who already speak conversational Chinese, but need to learn how to read and write Chinese. The book focuses on learning individual words as well as combinations of those words, so it teaches at a pace that favors those with a background in Chinese. However, the book's organization is frustrating: the first section of each chapter is entirely in pinyin while the actual Chinese words are in the second section.

Prof. Sasz maintains that the mind is not the brain, the mental functions are not reducible to brain functions, and that so-called &quot;mental diseases&quot; are not disases but are refelctions and manifestations of the way persons deal with problems-in-living. Because of his respect for human dignity and human freedom, Szasz is a classical liberal whose writings are compatible with the freedom and liberty issues characteristic of the so-called &quot;right wing&quot; section of the political and spectrum. Szasz is incisive, pungent, brilliant, insightful on the role of the threaputic industry within the totalitarian state and the uses of psychiatric voodoo for control of persons and thought. Accordingly, he comes across as a spokesperson of the liberty-freedom perspective -- what Alice in Wonderland said is the same thing as love, namely, minding one's own business. AS Szasz, points out, the psychiatric concept of &quot;disease&quot; attempts to make the mind, will and emotions a material object which supposedly can be &quot;treated&quot;. His view of human freedom shapes his view of politics. The &quot;mental&quot; illness are social constructions in the form of political arrangments for exerting power over other beings -- exactly what the Totalitarlian Left sets itself to accomplish with self-rightous vigor. The various functional mental illness are real behaviors, but they are that, behaviors, not diseases or &quot;symptoms&quot; of &quot;disease&quot;. Statists, who begin with an ethic of control, tend to oppose Szazian thought. Szasz, who does not begin with a political platform, does article values of freedom and recognition of the religious and ideological nature of psychiatric voodoo, does make conclusions which are favorable to human freedom rather than to a global psychiatric ward. Prof. Szasz presents is one of the foremost, perhaps the foremost challenge to the theology of psychiatry and the efforts of that psychiatry to subject mankind to its impirmatur."},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry","review":"Thomas Szasz (born 1920) is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center. He is a well-known critic of psychiatry, of the social role of medicine in modern society, and is a social libertarian.He states in the Preface to this 1976 book, \\"In this book I shall try to show how schizophrenia has become the Christ on the cross that psychiatrists worship ... and how our understanding of both psychiatry and schizophrenia may be advanced by approaching this 'diagnosis' as if it pointed to a religious symbol rather than to a medical disease.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"Real medicine thus helps real physicians to treat or cure real patients; fake medicine (psychiatry) helps fake physicians (psychiatrists) to influence or control fake patients (the mentally sick).\\"\\"Briefly put, I have maintained that the intervention institutional psychiatrists call 'mental hospitalization' is, in fact, a form of imprisonment; that the imposition of such loss of liberty on innocent persons is immoral (and, in the United States, unconstitutional); and that the phenomenon psychiatrists call 'schizophrenia' is not a demonstrable medical disease but the name of certain kinds of social deviation (or of behavior unacceptable to the speaker).\\"\\"But if all so-called mental disease is brain disease, if all mental disease is really only the 'mental symptom' of conditions such as paresis and pellagra---then it makes no sense to have two classes of brain diseases: one neurological, and the other mental. Instead, it would be necessary to insist ... that mental diseases are not diseases at all...\\"\\"The greatest symbolic and social power of 'schizophrenia' lies precisely in its being inextricably tied to the idea of disease and the institution of medicine. Thus, an effort to offer a nonmedical model for schizophrenia is about as feasible, and futile, as would be the effort to offer a nontheological model for the Eucharist.\\""},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry","review":"T.S. Szasz reminds us that schizophrenia never existed in any medical records before the 20th century. It is an invention, or merely a new label for a kind of behaviour that previously belonged to other medical or social classifications.As most of his readers already know, Szasz rightly believes that there ain't no such thing as a mental illness. Not as long as we mean &quot;illness&quot; like we mean it when we speak of any &quot;illnesses&quot; except the so-called &quot;mental&quot; ones. What we call mental illness is actually merely a certain kind of (litteraly) /abnormal/ (out of the norm) behaviour.Schizophrenia is a myth.A must read for open-minded people not too obsessed with that &quot;libertarian-conservative&quot; sticker..."},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry","review":"Szasz once again lampoons his fellow psychiatrists in Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry. He first details psychiatric history at the turn of the century and howthe discovery of paresis as a true disease lead them to use it as the paradigmfor all &quot;mental illess.&quot; He then challenges the hypocritical views of &quot;anti-psychiatrists&quot; Laing and Cooper, showing how their values represent collectivism and communism rather than individualism and liberty. In the chapter entitled Schizophrenia: Psychiatric Syndrome or Scientific Scandle, He sarcastically demonstrates the conflicting hypothesis, treatments, statistics, and research that are normally used to prove the seriousness of Schizophrenia. He concludes powerfully by comparing psychiatry and other social sciences to religion and theology, both whose purpose is to control the mind and heart of man. The book will certainly make those who have a stake in the medical model of schizophrenia cringe when the truth about their pseudoscientific enterprise wins out."},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry","review":"For some reason, there is a prevailing belief that Thomas Szasz is a champion of the rights of the mentally ill. In fact, he is a right-wing libertarian, and his views on mental illness follow logically from his political views. This book leads one to wonder if Szasz has ever actually met anyone with a mental illness.Starting from the premise that there is no such thing as mental illness, he is led to the delightful claim that people with &quot;so-called mental illnesses&quot; are just deliberately acting crazy (it is not clear why anyone would want to do this, especially in the light of the emphasis Szasz lays on the horrors of forced treatment, etc.) and should just be forced to &quot;pull their socks up&quot;. He opposes the defence of not guilty by reason of insanity and the provision of state support for those unable to work because of their &quot;so-called mental illness&quot;. He demonstrates the level of his compassion for people with schizophrenia in such quotes as &quot;Of course, schizophrenia may be said to be like a journey or like a disease; but it is also like many other conditions or situations, like being childish, aimless, useless, and homeless, or being angry, obstreperous, conceited, and selfish.&quot; He accuses those more sympathetic to people with schizophrenia of &quot;allowing incompetent, destructive and self-destructive persons to wallow in their self-contempt and contempt of others...&quot;.It is interesting to contrast this with the lyrical and intensely compassionate writings of authors such as Kay Redfield Jamison and Oliver Sacks, a biologically-oriented psychiatrist and a neurologist respectively."},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry","review":"Szasz is a libertarian with hatred for totalitarian governments.

I feel this book is a good companion to those who practice EC, as it had some good ideas and talked about somethings I haven't read or seen discussed in the EC community. For example, with EC we are taught that babies have sphincter control from birth or shortly thereafter, but no one ever talks about the fact that it takes time to develop FULL control, or that at a certain age they start pushing their pee out instead of just letting it out (although I can attest, my son pushed his out very early, but just not as much as he did later). With EC you don't use praise, but using praise in a certain way can aid potty training. Overall I feel the philosophies in the book are congruent with EC principles. They do recommend starting around 9 months (for EC it's any time), so this might be a helpful book for someone wanting to start with an older baby or get their EC'ed baby potty-trained. It's an easy read.My son is 23 months and this book had helped me understand him a little better and I started potty-training him 12 days ago and he is making really good progress."},{"Title":"Potty Training Your Baby: A Practical Guide for Easier Toilet Training","review":"There are few ideas in this book.

The communities' way of celebrating it may differ, the age may not be concretely defined, but the distinction of crossing over from one level to another that changes the celebrant forever, is just as distinctive and every bit as significant an event.In the book, I'm Home: What It's like to Love a Woman edited and compiled by author Ann Wells, Wells examines this \\"crossing over\\" by allowing the lesbians who contributed to her anthology to recount their often poignant experiences in their own way. For some it was a tender awakening of feelings, such as those reflected in the author's own piece, Not Until You. For others, it is a stirring of passion detailed in the poems, Sorry I Made You Late For Work by Miriam Axel-Lute and Addicted to You by Jacquie Buncel. For Alison Dubois, in Remembering Heather, it is the retelling of a tragic tale when a classmate, turned lover is brutally murdered by her estranged husband.After sampling a few pages of this anthology, the reader will understand and appreciate why I'm Home: What It's Like to Love a Woman was bestowed the Editor's Choice award by iUniverse. The stories and poems contained within this collection are entertaining, enlightening and a must read for anyone with a heart.They present a segue into a world that for too long has often been shrouded in mystery, disdain and darkness. These stories give understanding, meaning and depth to this experience in a way that is both comprehensive and personable to the reader. You will feel their joy, their pain, and their struggles.In essence, these women's stories are the lens into this introspective world, telling us and showing us what it's like to truly love a woman. And like all couples in all cultures, they have their share of triumphs and tribulations as they fight, and cry, and love deeply.Perhaps the only down side to this anthology is in the knowledge that it is a relatively small volume, only 100 pages that will easily be consumed quickly leaving the reader wanting more. A must for any collection!"},{"Title":"I'm Home: What It's Like to Love a Woman","review":"Betsy,Please contact me regarding the anthology.

As is the case, usually, when I get \\"hot\\" on an author I grab everything I can get my hands on and read it in no particular order. That is the case here. Terkel, widely known and deservedly so, as the author of oral histories concerning the pressing social issues of class, race and gender of working people (in the main)in America was also in his earlier career a popular Chicago disc jockey concentrating on jazz (and a little blues and folk as they intersected jazz). I had not previously known of that part of Studs' life and only became aware of it through reading his last work, a memoir of sorts but really a series of connected vignettes, \\"Touch and Go\\" (well worth reading by the way as background to his interest in the jazz figures highlighted here). Previously my knowledge of jazz was formed by the likes of Nat Hentoff and John Hammond. Apparently I have to revise this list to include Studs.Why? As a member of the Generation of '68 my tastes were formed by blues, folk and early rock and roll and only incidentally by jazz. However, once one delves into the roots of all of these forms one can only understand the attractions when one sees the influences all those forms had on each other. Without going into a dissertation on the subject (useless in any case) jazz is a core beat that expressed one form of music that had its roots in the South, among blacks and was a reflection of the rural life that was being left behind as America became more industrialized. Jazz is the music of the city, as blues is (before World War II at least) the music of the southern countryside. But enough. Read Studs and you can see how the music developed (and was retarded as well by the rules of racial separation as whites looking for real music, other than the standard fare of likes of the Paul Whitman Orchestra or Tin Pan Alley, fell in love jazz after World War I).Many of the names of the performers highlighted here have are the classic expressions of the jazz idiom. King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, The Empress Bessie Smith. The Duke (Ellington), The Count (Basie), Lady Day (Billie Holiday). Yes this is the royalty of jazz. For those who follow this space you already know of my devotion to Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith. Less well know is my devotion to the \\"king of Swing\\" Benny Goodman of the Peggy Lee days in the 1940's, Dizzy Gillespie of be-bop in the early 1950's and Duke Ellington of the early 1940's. Well, if you want to know more about them read on. By the way. This little book's format is an early example of Studs Terkel's easy style that he would work into an art form when he went full bore at his oral history interviews later. The only fault I would find here is that Studs is a little light on female singers. No Peggy Lee of the Benny Goodman days, no Margaret Whiting, no Helen Morgan, No Ivy Robertson. Oh well, I have always been a \\"sucker\\" for a \`torch singer'. Maybe, Studs, except for Billie, wasn't."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"Unlike many other books on Chechnya, this one offers a unique ethnographic account and analysis of this war and of what preceded it. Although very academic, it offers 'direct voices' of Chechens (mostly) that either suffered the war or have escaped it and now live elsewhere. The book does not attempt to glorify or condemn either side but, on the contrary, demonstrates how hawkish parties in both Moscow and Grozny have committed acts of political shortsightedness that dragged the country into war.While this book is not going to satisfy anyone whose opinion has already been formed, especially anyone who views this conflict in terms of a small brave nation fighting against an imperial monster, it is more scientific and balanced than any other book that exists on this subject in English. It also takes a stab at Western preconcieved notions such as a failure to recognize ethnic cleansing of Chechnya in 1991-94 when the city of Grozny has been cleansed of non-Chechens who were forced to leave the republic or killed, their appartnments having been taken by the militants.In short, this book will please you if you are looking for a balanced account or if you have an open mind and are not already set in condemning the Russians. After all, these are Chechen voices too."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"Following the tide of change that resulted in the breakup of the Soviet Union, the people of Chechnya proclaimed their independence in November 1991. Inevitably, many events took place between the newly formed nation and the Russian Federation, leading to the invasion of Chechnya by Russian troops in early December of 1994. A conflict that Anatol Lieven, the author of Chechnya: Tombstone Of Russian Power, has referred to as \\"the greatest epics of colonial resistance of the past century\\". Thus, for the next ten years, one bloody war after another reduced a thriving country to rubble; the Chechens enduring unimaginable suffering with no end in sight. To date, the struggle for self-determination has somehow, develop into an \\"Islamic\\" guerrilla war. Chechnya: Life In A War-Torn Society is not an account of the war; rather it is a reflection on a Chechen society forced into a never-ending, cruel and traumatizing war. The author of this scholarly text, Valery Tishkov, is currently the director of the Institute of Ethnography and Anthropology at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Therefore, his views on the conflict can be deemed authoritative and to some extent, biased.In the first five chapters, the author seeks for the answer by explaining the historical context of events such as Stalin's atrocious deportation of the Chechens to the lifeless steppes of Kazakhstan during World War II, which the Chechens suffered in silence, undoubtedly created bitterness in their memories. Yet he asserts that it is not a reason for the unending conflict. Nor, according to Tishkov, do ethnic, tribal, or religious disparities explain the tragedy of this war. Tishkov however places the core of the problem in the early stage of Boris Yeltsin's presidency when rivalries between factions paralyzed the operations of the government in dealing with the Chechen crisis. He perceives the bloodshed as the result of unresponsiveness and puzzlements on the Russian leaders when the Chechen crisis first emerged and the reluctance to deal with General Dzhokhar Dudayev, whom the author introduces in chapter six, while the situation is still in control. All through the book, Tishkov observes the first war and its aftermath through the eyes of fifty-four Chechens whom he and his associates interviewed at length. These \\"informers\\" have infused his account of the war with an exclusive directness and subtlety. Their recollections offer a distinctive ethnographic description and analysis of the war, the outcome, and what precipitated it.According to the survivors and Tishkov, the Chechens success in the first war can be attributed to the use of \\"guerrilla warfare\\", with tactics such as ambushes and attacks on the enemy's lines of communication which the author of Resisting Rebellion, Anthony J. Joes, stated as one of the vital strategy for insurgents to succeed. Tishkov goes on to express his admiration for the Chechen fighters' ability to overcome the psychological fear and intimidation and master the techniques of guerrilla warfare. Nevertheless, in chapter seven, when they staged and recorded their attacks, Tishkov portrays the exhibitionist behavior of the Chechen fighters as acts of terrorism. The author fails to realize that it is one of the ways that terrorists can get their objectives across to a wider audience. In his book Terror In The Mind Of God: The Global Rise Of Religious Violence, Mark Juergensmeyer, the noted sociologist and the Director of Global and International Studies, explains it as a theater that terrorists use to conduct terror for their audiences whom they are trying to terrorize. Yet, Tishkov fails to mention the atrocities that Russian troops committed on the Chechens that provoked the situation in the first place. On the aspect of religious, from chapter eleven to the rest of the book, Tishkov emphasizes the negative influences of Arab outsiders in the conflict, such as the al-Qaeda terrorist's network, whom he feels is using Chechnya as a stage determined to turn it into another Islamic state similar to the Taliban of Afghanistan. Tishkov's Chechnya: Life In A War-Torn Society is a recommended book since it does not try to venerate or condemn either side of the conflict but to expose how the war-monger parties in both Moscow and Grozny have made the erroneous political decisions that brought war to the Chechens and terrors to the citizens of Russia. Last but not least, the reader of this book must approach it with an open mind and not to form their judgments prematurely. Such as, in the view of some Westerners, the conflict is being about a small brave nation fighting against an imperial monster, or, in the view of Russia, an armed coup d'etat in Chechnya led by General Dudayev, resulting in the rise of an aggressive paramilitary regime that challenged both the Russian state and its armed forces. Nevertheless, it is a conflict that for Russia, according to Joes, who ranks it as one of the most disastrous counterinsurgent experiences on record, with the full implications of which have yet to manifest themselves."},{"Title":"Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"This is a very good book about the Chechen War written from the viewpoint of the fighters. Most books on this topic are written by Liberals apologists for terrorism, who sympathise with the rebels and blame Russia for the terrorist acts committed by Chechens. Others are by extreme Conservative Christians who just hate all Muslims. Chechnya went from being a struggle for independence to a Holy Jihad.

Admittedly, I came to Tishkov's work skeptical: he is Russian, after all. For those of us perhaps a little too eager to see local resistances to 'imperial' power and statehood as liberatory struggles, Tishkov engages us in a real marvel of anthropology, teasing apart threads, and questioning assumptions. Like Baiev, albeit in a very different way, Tishkov's professionalism, his belief in the rationalism of the anthropological method, carries this book. It is certainly possible he may have carefully selected and then edited his informants' words, but to what end? Throughout the book I was successively impressed by his unwillingness to engage in \\"a debate over the truths of who did what during the Chechen war.\\" This is not to say that Tishkov avoids pointed commentaries about either Russian hubris or Chechen entrepreneurial violence, but it is to say that he does a profound job in helping his readers understand the precarious nature of war and peace, especially in a cultural climate where \\"even the slightest of differences can be used to justify violence.\\""},{"Title":"Show Me God: What the Message From Space Is Telling Us About God, Revised Edition (Wonders, 1)","review":"This is NOT a full-fledged book review, but a few comments I had when I was done reading Heeren's book.Before reading a book, I usually ask myself in writing several questions such as these:* Question#1: How can I reconcile the Bible (God and faith) with Science (nature and reason)?* Question#2: What difference has Heeren's 1995 book made in 15 years (2010) in the RENS (random evolution by natural selection) vs. iD (intelligent designer) debate?In answer to Question#2, on the inside cover of Heeren's book I wrote by hand, \\"In his 1995 book (Heeren, 1995), Heeren makes a compelling case for the existence of God, appealing to self-proclaimed atheist scientists and scientific discoveries during the 20th century.

That this melange is successful, leaving the reader with the feeling of discovering a shiny, perfectly crafted jewel, is a testament to Haskett's craft: the sure, fluid, and precise writing of an author confident of his voice and his vision of what makes us all tick. Beginning in Wyoming, the story takes Duncan Delaney, the hero cowboy painter, and his fiercely loyal Native American side kick, Benjamin Lonetree, to the streets of Los Angeles, where they meet with a cast of other unforgettable characters--bikers, strippers, cops, robbers, agents, hobos, convenience store owners, and personal injury lawyers--in a melting pot of adventure, comedy, love, crime, art, tragedy, sex, and violence. On its surface, this highly entertaining story drives the novel through a series of scenes, some hysterically funny, others so touching as to make one cry, that would make this novel a worthwhile read for anyone. At the same time, however, Haskett deftly weaves into his plot a complex exploration of appearance and reality, the necessary joys and sorrows of human relationships, and the value of cultural diversity, that serves both as an uplifting reminder that life should involve excitement, discovery, laughter, and tears, and a timely warning about the dangers of stasis, assumptions, and prejudice. This novel serves as an introduction to a serious and very talented new author."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Delightful, picaresque characters, snappy dialog, some truly funny moments, and a pace that never leaves you flat-footed: Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom is comic circus of strippers and bikers, cowboys and Indians, and fine art.

Have fun, but don't whine. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom by A. L. Haskett is a wild, dark, poignant and vastly entertaining \\"black\\" comedy set largely in modern day Los Angeles.As the novel opens Duncan is living on his mom's ranch outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. He does a bit of field and maintenance work around the ranch, but his key interest is painting-he does hackneyed cowboy and Indian scenes on black velvet to sell by the roadside to tourists.On one fateful day he sends his buddy Ben Lonetree out to peddle a real painting of Ben's family. In Ben's absence, Duncan's domineering mother (his dad died years ago in a freak accident) gives him an ultimatum Duncan is loath to acquiesce to. When ben returns with $600 for the family painting and the address of the buyer in LA who wants to see more of his work, Duncan is off to the left coast.There he gets involved with a zany and colorful bunch of characters-an artsy crowd, a couple of motorcycle gangs, the denizens of a strip club by his apartment, and so on. He falls for one of the strippers, whose affections he must compete for with a \\"butch\\" lesbian motorcycle mama.When both Ben and Duncan's mom arrive on the scene to weigh in on Duncan's departure from Wyoming and his current situation, the sparks really begin to fly.The action is fast, furious-and funny as all get out. The characters are lively and engaging. Duncan himself is portrayed perfectly, though the angst and anomie of his beloved-Pris-is a bit overdone.Duncan's confusion and angst is occasionally relieved by dream visits from his dad. These visits act as precursors to action ahead as well as act as a device to illuminate Duncan's character and worldview.The book as a whole is very reminiscent of Christopher Moore's writing style-bright, vivid characters, wacky action, a bit of the phenomenological-and funny and entertaining as all get out.My only real criticism is the editing-there are more typos and misspellings and grammar lapses in this text than in 100 other books you could choose at random. Doesn't anyone associated with this effort own some sort of spell-check?That nit-pick aside, this is a wonderfully engaging story that would make perfect plane and/or beach reading. I loved every minute of it!"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"There are two things you need to know. First, I am a friend of the author. Second, thank God he wrote a great book that kept me reading start to finish. Now I don't have to avoid him for the next 20 years.The characters are fresh and come from a place of which I have little familiarity. He vests his players with interesting personalities that I come to know and care about. Next he takes them to a place that I know all too well and paints it in a way I've never quite seen it before. The author's intimacy with all of his characters, and his right on descriptions about the world around them, made me feel I was a participant in each scene, not just a witness to the parade.For most of my adult life, writers have seemingly taken the same 10-12 fictional storylines and re-written them in different places and times, often entertaining, but usually familiar. In the past year, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; are examples of truly one of a kind stories. Duncan Delaney falls right into that category of unpredictabiliy.Read it, enjoy it, and hope there is another one in the making."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I get a little ticked off whenever someone gets a favorite author and decides that no one else is worth reading. Like some others, I too bought this book because of the comparisons to Tom Robbins only to find it's really not so much like one of Tom's books. Thank God! I love Robbins, I've read every one of his books, but hey-zeus creesto, just because I like pistachio doesn't mean I can't enjoy a little rocky road every now and then. Robbins always makes me smile and makes me think long after I've put one of his books down, but Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom made me laugh out loud in more than one place. I will not be forgetting Duncan or his best friend Benjamin Lonetree for a long time, even if neither had me thinking particularly deep thoughts. This book is about feelings, love, jealousy, and maybe a bit of redemption. Don't expect Tom Robbins, cuz you won't get it. But you will get a good, satisfying read."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I've done \\"The Oprah Picks\\", explored the \\"Beat Generation thing\\" Dabbled into Delillo, Camus, and lately Ian Mc Ewan and thought..........now what?I was post 9/11-ed, and depressed by the newest Orange Terror Alert, sad and weary, and oh so weary. I thought, it's time to throw the baby out with the bath water and check out some funny stuff, and so I did! I started looking around here for some customer recommendations for some humor and ended up here. I needed a laugh and that's exactly what I found! The only problem was, once I decided to read this book, I wanted it now, and I searched all over Colorado and nobody could help me. Then, alas (a) book store said they would order it for me, I waited for 3 weeks and then they said....................We just can't get that book for you after all, so, I ordered it here!This book is better than \\"Two store-bought pistols\\" as my beloved Southern Grandmother used to say. Yippee ride em cowboy, giddie-up all the way to Los Angeles, the home of the eccentric, absurd and wild and crazy. I should know, I used to live there.Duncan, the protaganist, is a nave Wyoming cowboy/velvet painting slacker, that gets an ultimatium from his Mom to grow up and get a real job. An intriguing Californian woman comes through town, buys one of Duncan's paintings and this is where the adventure begins. He ends up in Hollywood across the street from a strip club and ~!@#$~, my lips are sealed, you need to read it for yourself cuz it was oh so fun and entertaining.All I can say is I truly enjoyed the diversion and am now exploring Christopher Moore's \\"Practical Demonkeeping\\" cuz I just can't leave this Tickle me Elmo state of mind, as I patiently await Mr. Haskett's next book."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I bought this book because of the good reviews it received on Amazon and because it was compared to the works of Tom Robbins and Christopher Moore, both of whom I love. But, to compare this book to those authors' work is downright insulting to Robbins and Moore. This book wants to be a screenplay and it reads like one. The dialogue is so trite that it made me cringe to read it and the character development was also very poor. It was very difficult to finish this book even though it was relatively short."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Duncan Delany is an aspiring artist, son of a rich Wyoming rancher, who gets an ultimatum from mom (get a real job). Instead, he flees to Los Angeles, lives in a run-down apartment, and has adventure surrounding the strip joint across the street, and multitudes of characters in the neighborhood.I had a hard time getting through the first third of this book. It seems to open up and just dump characters at your feet, without a lot of set up, and I found that somewhat difficult to absorb. As the book settled in, I was able to keep track of all the characters, but by my count, there is no less than 20 secondary characters which seemed to overwhelm the story, and this is all packed into 180 pages. There's a good story in there, that has its share of outrageous moments peppered throughout. I would give it 3 stars but the ending is quite imaginative and rounds it up to 4. When I finished it, I was glad I stuck with it and read it.Not that is should matter, but the title and the cover are awesome...."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Enormous fun. The characters are fresh, the dialogue sparkles. The book is extremely funny, sometimes laugh out loud funny yet still manages to be also tender, and touching. It creates then sustains a wonderful rhythm; the plotting is clever with plenty of twists and surprises. Above all there's a freshness and exuberance to the writing that made me very sorry to see the book end."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I just finished A. L. Haskett's delightful book, Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom. To be honest, I was a little put off by the title but the cover art and the book description caught my interest. I started the book one evening and didn't put it down again until I finished later that night. I don't want to give away the plot so I'm not going to go in to specifics. I can say that the lead character, Duncan Delaney is one of the most interesting and fun characters I've read in quite a while -- and as I said in the title of my review, his friends and family (especially his mother and her boyfriend) as well as all the associated characters are just too fun to read.I live in the southwest and the author's descriptions of the desert are right on target. I can't exactly call this a southwestern tale (although in part it is) and I can't really call it a love story either (although in part it is). What I guess it most reminds me of is a tale of adventure and love and friendship in a southwestern world with almost a Kurt Vonnegut type feel to it. I hope that makes some kind of sense, the book truly transcends most genres. It is a really good read.Check this one out. Mr. Haskett is a great writer that, if this book is any indication, we'll all be reading more of in the future. Go for it -- you'll be glad you tried something new in the literary field."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"With \\"Duncan Delaney And The Cadillac Of Doom\\", A. L. Haskett takes the standard, perhaps best represented by Tom Robbins and Christopher Moore, and twists it into something of his own. While mostly humorous, as the stories of Robbins and Moore are, Mr. Haskett mixes in some violence and sadness to leaven the tale. In that mixture are an eclectic mix of characters, some very likeable, and some detestable, that provide a good counterpoint to Duncan Delanaye's journey of self discovery. I suppose some won't like that he deviated from the standard genre , but I applaud his massaging of that style and creating something a little different. And while I don't think the Pulitzer Committee will be considering this first effort, it may be that they will have to consider future ones from this author. Even if that prestigious body declines, Mr. Haskett has provided an entertaining read for those of us who don't need \\"experts\\" to decide what's worhtwhile. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun story to help them escape from the ordinariness of life."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I went to look for Tom Robbins and was gifted with Mr. Haskett. It was fun to break into one of the frequent giggles as the story unfolded. I for one would buy anything you write. I wait with paitience......"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"For a fast paced novel featuring strippers, bikers, and a lot of beer, Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom really snuck up on me, For the first half of the story, I kept waiting for some zaney action dark comedy like Chuck Palahniuk or but gradually I came to realize this is much closer to the Tom Robbins style and in particular his classic Still Life with Woodpecker.In Duncan Delaney, the title character Duncan and his love interest Pris are Robbins Woodpecker (Bernard) and Leigh-Cheri. In Cadillac of Doom, only Duncan is a red-head, and the personalities are somewhat reversed with Pris as the dangerous one with some self-destructive habits and Duncan the generally quieter artistic soul. Duncan and Pris also share with Woodpecker and Leigh-Cheri the question of how to make love stay (although more subtle in Duncan Delaney than in Still Life) and sadly they share a heart-wrenching ending (no spoilers here though). Pris isn't quite celibate but she's got some close enough similarities in this regard to provide another Leigh-Cheri reminder.There's a major plot turn that really turned me off, involving incest and some other very uncomfortable sexual situations. It's not presented in a voyeuristic manner but up to that point the story had been fairly light and it took such a hard turn into this sexual darkness that I simply wasn't prepared. It's not a subject I'd ever knowingly wade into reading. But, it's such a powerful factor in the character's life in this story that despite the awful nature of what's happening, the book and the story rise above it.So, am I saying that A.L. Haskett is Tom Robbins? No, not on the strength of one story. But this is a great story."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"They say the journey is more important than the destination and I would say the same about Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom. What a ride!The book kept my attention throughout. I didn't find it boring or too long. There were some funny moments, but I wouldn't say this is a comedy or even a dark comedy. The dialogue is witty and amusing. I thought the characters were well developed where necessary. Although often seemingly timid, I really liked Duncan Delaney. I enjoyed reading about him and taking this journey with him. I wish there were a little more as I felt the ending was a bit abrupt. I think this was intentional, but I would have liked a little more closure.The writing was amazing. AL Haskett is a talented author to say the least. If a book with cowboys, Indians, strippers, motorcycle gangs and artists could interest you. I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I'm a big Chris Moore fan and bought this book entirely because he said so. I must say, I'm a little upset that A L Haskett hasn't written any other published novels because this book was just excellent. I looked forward to getting off work so I could get home and continue where I left off.Not only is it well written, but is a great story, and has an underlying message that spoke to me clearly. In a world filled with greed, materialism, lust, and an over valued sense of superficial beauty, Duncan Delaney knows what makes him happy and what is truly important to him and utterly disregards the shallow values and expectations of others. He refuses to be controlled by social expectations.It's one of the best books I have read and I highly suggest you go pick up a couple dozen copies because you will find yourself handing them out to your friends so they can experience what you did."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"First let me say this book was not at all what i expected.... I think i was expecting something more supernatural, but instead got this fantastic story of love and loss with plenty of funny, laughing out loud moments. Duncan is loveable from the start, his best friend Benjamin is a riot and the rest of the characters are as diverse as you would expect in a story centered around hollywood and wyoming! truly a great find."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I don't understand why Christopher Moore's name keeps coming up in discussions about this book (and I realize that I just brought it up again). The only similarities I see between the two authors are the bizarrely intriguing titles. I honestly feel that this book is much deeper and richly written than anything I've read by Moore, and I wish I could find more information on this A.L. Haskett person. It almost seems like Haskett wrote this book and disappeared again.That said, I have to recommend this book to everybody. I was put off by the title, thinking that it was going to be one of those barely coherent bizarro stories, but I was pleasantly surprised and immediately addicted when I was introduced to the namesake character and his friend.As far as characterization goes, Duncan Delaney is the bee's knees. No character in this book is unimportant. Even the walk-on characters are laid open as Duncan's artwork sends each individual viewer into a beautifully nostalgic reverie.The use of Duncan's dreams as both a window into his past and an \\"intervention of the wise sage\\" technique make the story just that much more beautiful, and every part of the book feels rewarding and important. The humor is sharp and funny. The conflicts are intense and wonderful. And, of course, the antagonist is NOT a demonic car that chases people down or shoot hellfire or anything.If you enjoy reading, read this book. That's all I can say. You'd be better off getting it from the internet, as most book stores don't seem to carry it."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"The writer of Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom introduces the reader to some strong characters - Fiona, Woody, Benjamin, and Duncan. He teases us with snapshot glimpses into their past and future. The novel center on Duncan's search for himself and love in hedonistic Los Angeles. The reader is left with the desire to follow the adventures of his family and friends as they seek the same. Can we watch for a sequel?"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I recieved this book as gift from a family member who I had introduced to Christopher Moore. To her credit she found this gem that C. Moore had recommended.And they were both right on target. What a rollicking, page turning read.A budding painter ventures to LA and finds subjects and people that were beyond his imagination. His art draws acolytes from a strip club and they fast make themselves fixtures in his apartment.The guiless painter ( Duncan Delaney) has left Wyoming and a poor relationship to find that the most intriguing of women are the least simple to understand.What's great: All of the salient characters are well fleshed.The plot gives some nice twists.Laugh out loud contrivances.Fantasy explicating real life.What's not: Too short.It's a fun game that Haskett plays and there is craziness around every corner. Haskett drives home a message - \\"I was a victim of a series of accidents - as are we all.\\"So A.L. Hasket what about that next book?"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I too can't understand the comparisons to Tom Robbins. This book has unconventional characters and some freaky plot points, but it is basically a tightly crafted tale in a traditional narrative style. Benjamin Lonetree is the best Native American character in any book I've read since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I would forget about who Haskett reminds you of and just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"A friend of mine sent this book to me for Christmas a year or so ago and it took me awhile to get around to reading it...which I deeply regret now. It is a wonderful read, lightning-quick, filled with joy and laughter as well as angst and heartbreak.The protagonist, Duncan Delaney, is a young artist who would rather sell Old West scenes painted on black velvet featuring his best friend (and certified hell-raiser) Benjamin Lonetree on the side of the Interstate than run his family's ranch. A meeting with an agent on the way home to LA (Los Angeles, not Louisiana) gives Benjamin a new love interest and Duncan his ticket to both personal salvation and ruin; the art world is ready for a &quot;rustic revolution&quot; and Duncan has the eye to lead it. But is a 21-year old artist who has yet to come to terms with the circumstances under which his father died years ago ready for the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles? And is living across the street from a strip club with access to strippers-with-secrets, bouncers, and lesbian bikers REALLY the best way to acclimatize himself to his new surroundings with his mother and ex-girlfriend hot on his heels attempting his reclaimation?Absolutely. And it makes for some great reading, too. It won't take more than a weekend to complete; definitely pick this one up."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I bought this book after seeing it advertised after searching for books by Carl Hiaasen. the ad said, &quot;better than Hiaasen? you decide.&quot; The humor is similar, though not as dark as Hiaasen. Gentle at times and hard at others. Very well written, fast paced, interesting and likable characters, all like Hiaasen. Better? Not as good as Striptease, but better than Stormy Weather. I very much liked the book and hope to see more by Hasket in the future."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I do a lot of reading but I really gauge my books on how much I would prefer to sit and read them vs. doing something else (e.g., watch television, go to the movies, see friends). This is one of those books that call on you to read them when ever time allows. It's a hard book to put down and I was really engaged by the storytelling and the variety of characters. Take this book to the beach and relax and get caught up in the world of Duncan Delaney."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"After reading Duncan Delaney I see why some reviews compare the writing to Tom Robbins. There's the same quirky characters and off the wall plot. The writing is more carefully crafted than Robbins, and not as exuberantly indulgent. Take your pick. I'm always aware that Robbins is grinning there behind the typewriter, and I'm there grinning with him. With Haskett, I was less aware of the writer and more aware of the writing. Take your pick. Anyway. I completely enjoyed this book and was sad and disappointed, not by the ending, but because it ended so too quickly. As a big Robbins fan, it's good to see someone new come along that can help bridge the gap between Tom's books."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"A very entertaining read until the last 20 pages. Be warned this book has a totally out of the blue, depressing, and creepy ending that moves at a considerably faster pace than the rest of the book. Don't get me wrong, a lot of bad stuff happens to the characters in this book, but there is an air of satirity to it all that helps you to like the characters more and more with each tribulation, until the end that is. There is nothing endearing about the painfully tragic ending, which is so inconsistent with the dark humor that runs throughout this story. Not sure if my kindle edition cut it short but this was by far the worst ending to any book I've ever read. That goes for the plot twist as well as the closing sentence... Just awful. Otherwise entertaining but no comparison to TR."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I happened upon this (Kindle edition) book and have to say that I really enjoyed it. I found the story, characters and dialogue a little quirky and very diverting and entertaining (i.e., it was a good read). As soon as I finished it I started looking for additional works by A.L. Haskett, only to find that s/he has yet to publish a follow-up. I'll be eager to read anything further that Haskett writes."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Very amusing, brief and funny. I recommend Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom to anyone who likes lighthearted plots and characters with unusual, even bizarre personality traits. I look forward to other books by this new author."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"This is great book. I loved the characters. You can't beat a book with cowboys, strippers and lesbians. It was a fun and easy read."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Read this book just for Benjamin Lonetree if nothing else. What a great character. The rest of the book is really good too, had me laughing in a number of places, but I really like Lonetree and I hope to see more of him in the future."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. The pace was slow, the plot was pointless, and the characters lacked depth. I purchased this book based on reviews that compared the author to Tom Robbins. I had very high expectations based on those reviews. Unfortunately, this book did not deliver."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Being a big fan of Christopher Moore's, his endorsement swayed me, so I bought this book. People have compared him to Tom Robbins, and it's an accurate comparison. This book has a solid and yet dreamlike feeling to it that suspends reality. The book is also hilarious, from the love-struck Benjamin who still manages to throw out cringe-worthy one-liners to the art world that Duncan finds himself immersed in.A. L. Haskett is definitely an author to watch. There are certain moments and phrases that are a bit heavy-handed and break the spell, but it will be interesting to watch him as he works out the last few kinks in his writing style. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I really really enjoyed this book. I bought it on a whim after Amazon recommended it to me because I bought \\"Just a Couple of Days\\" (another good one).. Anyhow the characters in this book (especially Duncan and Pris) just come to life. What I really like about this book though, is the way Duncan admires Pris so inncocently. It reminds me a whole lot of how I admire a certain friend. You'd have to have read it to know what I mean, but Duncan Delaney just radiates a good vibe, innocence. I love books that make the characters come to life like that, so that you know what their take is on any given situation, thats how I felt in this book. This is the type of book that will literally make you laugh out loud, almost shed a tear, yell at a certain character(s), etc. It's also a quick read, the type of book that can be read in a long lazy afternoon. I'd certainly recommend this one for a rainy day and for anyone who just enjoys a highly emotional yet very funny tale."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"You're going to love Duncan Delaney if you're male. Between he and his buddy, they do just about everything that you ever envisioned yourself doing, perhaps not exactly, but in concept at least. Things move fast, and there's not a lot of words wasted in this story. It's not long, you'll probably read it in a day. But it's very satisfying. I'm not sure if I'm going to read it again, but I'm not going to give it away like all the other books that I read. At least, not for a while."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I bought this book because of the reviews that associated it with Tom Robbins work, only to find few similarities. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the book entirely! I found it a quirky, fun, and interesting read and I am glad to have found another author that I hope will produce much more in the years to come! (It'll make the wait for Robbins books more bearable...)"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"\\"Quick, easy and fun\\" ... yup, that's how I found A.L. Haskett's debut novel, Duncan Delaney & the Cadillac of Doom.I'm not sure why Bantam compares Haskett to Tom Robbins per se. Actually, I would compare him to Hemmingway or Chandler just as much as I would compare him to Robbins, which isn't saying there's an obvious comparison at all, really. His characters are unconventional, sure, but his writing style is simple, streamlined and almost journalistic. This, all in all, makes the book easy to zip through.The only issue I had was with Duncan Delaney; I didn't find him a great protangonist. I didn't find his dialogue all that real, which made it difficult to keep my interest. But Benjamin Lonetree, on the other hand, is great fun and redeems Haskett's ability to characterize. His dialogue is fresh, his actions are bold, and he just outshines all the characters in the book."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I think I found this book by the comparison to (and favorable review of Christopher Moore). It has great dry humor, a mind-boggling (to me) cast of eccentric characters, and a very poignant and inspiring set of endings (because in a sense it has more than one ending). I sure do hope this guy writes more, I am on here looking because I see this was written way back in '00. This is definitely one of the best books I have read in the last few years. This would make a fantastic movie.Note - It's now the Year 2012. Why is Sarah Palin still in the news? I'm back, and I still think this. Christopher Moore has jumped the shark apparently, and many writers in this subgenre try way too hard. I think this would make a great movie starring John Cusack, or whoever plays those roles these days. The Native American friend is a great role for whomever.This book is only 2.99 on Kindle, only one penny used. I guarantee you, this is first time author, lightning in a bottle writing and you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"&quot;Duncan Delaney&quot; is a great read. It reminds me of early Tom McGuane or Tom Robbins. The story moves right along, from Wyoming to Hollywood, and it kept me laughing all the way. The characters are always entertaining, if sometimes a bit surreal or cartoonish (but in a good way) and I always cared about what happened to them, sometimes more than the charcters seemed to care about themselves. It's both funny (laugh out loud funny) and touching, but I felt a little let down at the ending. I look forward to more from Haskett, and will definately buy his next book."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Right from the very first page, Haskett drew me into his story. With a deft hand, he conjures up images, characters, and feelings into your mind. As Duncan travels from the open vistas of Wyoming into the concrete canyons of Los Angeles, Haskett takes you along for a rollicking and sometimes rowdy ride. The characters that he describes in the book jump from the pages and become part of you. At first, the character are simply acquaintances but by the end of the book, Haskett's characters are &quot;family&quot;. If you enjoy reading a book with vivid and gritty urban characters, imaginative writing that creates strong feelings in you, well written words that can make you laugh aloud at times and bring tears to your eyes at other times, this is the book for you. You will enjoy it and re-read it again from time to time so that you can experience the universe of human emotions again."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I definitely laughed out loud a few times while reading this book. The writing is pretty solid, and the story is entertaining. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"This was an enjoyable quick read, very funny. The characterization was fresh and interesting and the descriptions of L.A.'s wasteland truly amusing.It was just not at all what I thought I was buying based on it being offered by Amazon as a &quot;lesbian&quot; book. Sure there are lesbians in it, but the categorization of it as &quot;lesbian&quot; at this site has always meant to me written by lesbians, for lesbian readers *and* featuring prominent lesbian protagonists, not just side characters. Saying this is a &quot;lesbian&quot; book would be like saying Basic Instinct is a &quot;lesbian&quot; movie because the female murderer was bisexual.So I'm not at all sure why Amazon *features* this novel on its list of books recommended to lesbian readers. That aspect of the story is about 20% of the novel; all the other novels on the Amazon list run 80-100% about, by for and concerning lesbians."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I'll start with my summation...I love this book. It grabs you and holds on...Quirky characters and hillarious plot twists.... Duncan is more human than most of the readers...He knows what he wants and endures the path that gets him there...A lovely cast of characters...well written....nutty."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!!

It was short and took forever to finish reading. I don't understand why it is recommended to me..repeatedly, but I really didn't get anything out of it."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"There are books that define categorization, and this is one of them. I bought it based on the recommendation of someone who had read a few of my reviews. Not something I'd normally do, but when I looked at what people had to say about the book, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm definitely not sorry I did. This is a charming, picaresque little novel with a dark subtext that's dealt with deftly and without undue stress. The characterizations are delightful and well done; the narrative zips along like a smart compact car. The only reason I've given Duncan Delaney four stars instead of five is because of the weirdness of the editing that, in places, actually alters the meaning of what is being said. Compound nouns are strangely split into two words: i.e. run away, instead of runaway. Normally hyphenated expressions are left without the hyphens. There are way too many quirks of editing (or non editing) that detract from what would otherwise have been an entirely pleasurable reading experience. That said, I heartily recommend the book. It says a lot without overstating matters."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Duncan's story is an odd-ball blend of adventure, comedy, tragedy, love, regret, good luck, bad luck, friends, enemies, and thrown in for good measure, a cat.I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but before I realized it, I was hooked. I just gave myself over to Duncan's world. It was a wonderful time but over too soon.I generally read science fiction, mysteries, and adventures. So when I came to do this review and re-read the product description, I found myself wondering why I ever selected the book in the first place. Don't know, but I'm sure glad I did. :)"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"\\"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom\\" is a stunning debut novel. Don't let the irreverent title throw you - by turns it's both laugh-out-loud funny and choke-back-tears sad. Haskett is well on his way to developing a style all his own, which is something like a cross between Christopher Moore and Cormac McCarthy. Though the stop-and-go cadence takes some getting used to, Haskett's timing is dead-on: He knows how to spin a good yarn! I'm not sure if we'll ever see a follow-up from this author, but this book by itself is something to be proud of."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"I found &quot;Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom&quot; to be highly entertaining. I was hooked on page 1 and I found myself unable to put the book down until I was finished.Haskett deftly develops each character even while he moves from scene to scene at a rapid pace. He fills the story with colorful characters, witty dialogue, and humor that had me laughing out loud. He explores the full range of human behavior in this book, with sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, but always entertaining results.A thoroughly enjoyable book! I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"\\"We'll paint all day and fornicate all night. Not with each other or domestic animals, of course. With women I mean.\\" --And quotes like this may be one of the best reasons to read this book. I see that there have been some negative reviews of this book, and everyone is entitles to their opinion, so here's mine: I nearly laughed myself to death while reading this book. Okay, so maybe this brand of humor isn't for everyone, but I found it more than amusing.I love the characters and the fact that they all have stellar personalities. The kind of trouble the main character gets himself into was just the right formula to keep me turning pages. For those of you who are offended by swearing and other taboos, this book might just make you throw it down and stomp on it (unless you are reading it on Kindle...that might be bad) but for anyone else who appreciates the lighter side of life and can judge a book by how much fun you had reading it, this might just be the thing.I loved it!"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"This is one of the more difficult reviews for me to write. I guess saying I am ambivalent is an understatement. I think I was having trouble identifying with or relating to the characters. None of them reminded me of anyone I know or have known well, and it made it hard to become attached to the people and therefore what happens to them. And I've known a lot of um - interesting and different characters in my life. Other reviewers have indicated the story seemed to drag on endlessly, but on the other hand, a lot was going on, so it was not lack of action.I found myself enjoying some of the zingers, and comebacks, especially from Benjamin. But I didn't see any laugh out loud moments, as some have mentioned, and I certainly wouldn't consider \\"humor\\" as a feature of the book. It was not trite, stale dialogue, and there was a sardonic sense of humor to the beatings, maimings, and deaths, but not the kind of humor I laugh at.There are a lot of characters, so keep your score card handy, although you will start to keep them straight after a while. There is a twist to the ending, but with the whole book rather twisted, I really expected something along those lines from the moment it was first set up.A 3 rating is middle of the road, but there is quality to the writing that should be worth something. And a story that is certainly not trite or stale also has value. But something was dragging the story down, and I can't really identify what it was. There were a few frayed edges that didn't fully fit (like the inheritance - that was an unsatisfactory side trip that seemed to go no where of value to the story). So with the strong points offset by weak points, I guess the 3 rating says it best for me."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Nothing profound to say about this book other than it was a a cool read, I got the characters and it was worth my time.

I was out of my mind in a manic spree at some point before dawn and in rare form -I was quite drunk. I was alone in my house. I remember setting something on fire. The fire took place in the fire place but what I burned was not typical -clothing or art work or something and I sat down in a room in my house where people never venture, and i drunkenly read this book in one long jag. At times I would laugh deep, down-from-the-gut belly-laughs and I was glued to the chair, captivated, biting the ends of my fingers down to bleeding, jagged nubs and Id blink away the pain and continue reading. I remember breaking down crying at one point reading it. Not a single tear or anything like that, I mean full-on sobs. I broke down crying on one page and guffawed the next, and so on. The characters have depth. They are conflicted, with corners and flaws and doubts and history. Its an awesome book. I wish I could find out more about this mystery author."},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","review":"Its true that I liked the book... after I read it.

But well into Chapter Three, Ms. Wysocki was still giving a preface, and assuring the reader she would get to the nuts and bolts of her strategies any minute.By the time I got into Chapter Three, I saw that the book is so laden with glaring grammatical errors and typographical errors that I began to wonder about the accuracy of the text. Examples: laundry \\"shoot\\" and \\"Suzy\\" Ormond; \\"parent's\\" when the plural was meant; James Clavell's \\"Nobel House,\\" the spelling of which is repeated in the same paragraph. (It should read \\"Noble House.\\") There are one to three such mistakes on almost every page so far.I made my living as a proofreader and editor for many years. It's tedious work but someone has to do it, and I love it and am very good at it. I still \\"informally\\" proofread any book I pick up. There are so many word usage and spelling errors in \\"Don't Waste Money...\\" that I can't \\"read through\\" them.If Ms. Wysocki's manuscript is loaded with sound advice and is factually correct, she was done a great disservice by those who readied her book for publication. It's a shame, because her style is appealing and her credentials sound.

Unlike many financial advisors, this book doesn't advocate you become a miser, rather shows you how to spend on quality, not quantity - provides simple tools for assessing real need - and provides insight into money saving techniques I never thought existed. I started using the author's advice the very day I finished the book - and saved about $200. For example, I had no idea you could negotiate your physician's bill.I especially enjoyed the techniques for &quot;money recovery&quot; -- how you can give your money a second chance if you happen to waste, not spend. If you're a parent, or an uncle (like me) there's a special section on kids you won't want to miss.Ms. Wysocki is down to earth, practical, respectful of her audience and doesn't admonish them for being wasteful in the past, rather what they can do, starting today (&quot;Remember, I'm on your side&quot; she states near the end).It reads almost like a novel - showing you how to spend by illustrating of real-life events, situations and stories - many are hilarious. If you like to laugh, you'll love this book. If you want to spend while you save, read it today."},{"Title":"Don't Waste Money, Spend it!: Undecided","review":"The fun little stories gave good solid examples of how Lisa Wysocki came to acquire the knowledge she shares in her book.

I loved the part about chips and dents being OK at her house. What a great way of looking at it. When you realize people are more important than a perfect house, it all makes sense. This is a humorous fun book for those of us who don't or no longer need to squeeze every nickel but love a good deal and want to track that our money is going where it needs to go.

One of its foremost pioneers is Karl Shuker, who has a doctorate in Zoology and Comparative Physiology from the University of Birmingham. Dr. Shuker has collected dozens of his cryptozoological articles in his book From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings. The book is a fantastic journey through every corner of our planet. Throughout the journey the reader encounters a parade of rarely seen creatures, including: whale-sized sharks, man-eating elephants, and blue tigers. Dr. Shuker's writing style is educated and fanciful. The result is a book that can be enjoyed by cryptozoological novices and veterans alike.The Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot are perhaps two of the world's most notorious cryptozoological entities. Dr. Shuker presents a far more diverse group of lesser-known creatures. In fact, two of his chapters deal with newly discovered animals and proven hoaxes. This impressive collection of creatures would appeal to anyone interested in animals or the unknown.Dr. Shuker uses thorough scientific research and eyewitness accounts in each of his articles. For example, in his chapter devoted to sharks Dr. Shuker describes an incident involving a very large shark: \\" They told him that their series of heavily weighted three-and-a-half-foot crayfish pots had been carried away once by a shark of ghostly white coloration and so extraordinarily immense that they estimated its length to have been anything between 115 and 300 feet.\\" Dr. Shuker then goes on to explain that recent research on fossilized megalodon (prehistoric shark) remains have proven that sharks over 50 feet did indeed exist, a mere 11,000 years ago. Dr. Shuker believes the fishermen who saw the shark were shocked and therefore exaggerated the shark's length. Most of the creatures discussed in the book appear to be highly elusive and rarely seen by man. Others like the monster salmon of China, 33 feet in length, are alive and well.From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings is skillfully divided into eighteen chapters. Each chapter discusses a certain type of monster, such as: mystery bears of the world, giant jellyfishes, and the graveyard of monsters. The book has many illustrations and contains illustration credits to help locate the source of an illustration. There is also a selected bibliography and an index of animal names. This book would be useful to zoology students, science-fiction writers, and passengers aboard a long plane trip. Dr. Shuker clearly explains scientific information and presents each animal with the enthusiasm of a proud father. The number of animals presented in the book is incredibly lengthy and richly diverse. It has provided countless hours of enjoyment, and the book itself has held up quite well, with minimal wear and tear.From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings sheds light on a subject not usually discussed. With this book Dr. Shuker has made a significant contribution to the field of cryptozoology. Dr. Shuker does not limit his research to the common lake monster; he discusses the existence of the Golden Fleece and the macabre eating habits of sheep during food shortages (they bite the heads off young birds). Dr. Shuker's book is a sometimes frightful, thrill ride through the zoo of the unknown."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"Although I've always been big on the paranormal, and supernatural, and all things abnormal, this was my first strictly cryptozoology book and I thuroughly enjoyed it. It's not the sort of thing you sit down and read strait through, but I had a hard time putting it down. It's fascinating and extremely well written, and very informative. It was a stroke of luck that I happened to run across it in the bookstore, and I think that anyone with even the slightest interest will be more than pleased."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"This book is a wonderful resource for anyone interested in cryptozoology. Shuker provides information on not only well known animals like nessie, but includes very rare and non-mainstream animals. My only complaint is that the few pages dedicated to each animal is not enough. I was so captivated by Shuker's writing that I would have liked to see more indepth analyses of each animal. The pictures, woodcuts, and engraved images were well done and appropriate. I recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about animals science has not yet discovered."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"This is an excellent book on cryptozoology. lots of information great for us investigators and scientists. lots of good info and case studies. wish it was on kindle."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"Could the Dodo bird still be hiding out there?

Shuker ignores brainless sensationalism and writes with a mind that is at once open and analytical. His approach is that of a confirmed scientist who marvels at nature's capacity for producing known and yet-to-be revealed wonders. With a writing style that is relaxed and laced with subtle humor, &quot;Flying Toads&quot; is a book that is hard to put down and even harder to end."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"An outstanding guide for any and all interested in cryptozoology. Well and wittily written, informative and entertaining. Perhaps Shuker should have written a longer book of even greater depth and detail. Alternatively, he might have described fewer animals, while focusing on those of stand-out interest. I, for example, would have liked to have known a great deal more about monstrous jellyfish. And what about those giant and sinister toads of China! These observations (hardly criticisms) indicate how much I enjoyed the book and how sorry I am that the voyage ended much too soon."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"Only one question - if you are seriously or even mildly interested in cryptozoology, why isn't this already in your collection??Highly recommended."},{"Title":"From Flying Toads to Snakes with Wings : From the Pages of Fate Magazine","review":"While it appears that most of the previous reviews were from dedicated cryptozoology buffs, I had a much more &quot;normal&quot; use for this book.

I found this book here by accident and bought it and I have to say that I was plesantly suprised.

It might be useful to anyone beginning to explore Kubrick's body of work, or anyone interested in having a mini-encyclopedia of cliff notes. Be warned that the book contains notes on all of the endings to Kubrick's films, so if you do not wish to ruin the endings, perhaps you shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"Not particularling illuminating or informative, at the very least it collects portions of commentaries from some of the best film critics (eg Pauline Kael). Beyond this there is not much positive to say. Often Kagan can't even provide accurate summaries of Kubrick's films (one example is that he confuses the identities of the condemned men in Paths of Glory, and this effectively renders his thematic analysis of that film useless!). Kagan also seems to miss the entire point of certain films. One wonders why he even bothered writing such a book."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"Yes, Kagan does make some foolish mistakes in summing up Kubrick's films. However, this is a nice book for anyone interested in the late Stanley Kubrick, a film genius whose works ranged from sexual thrillers and science fiction epics to period dramas and war films. It contains some nice photos, as well as just enough information about each film. I bought it after seeing only three of Kubrick's films and it compelled me to see five more."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"If I could give less than one star, I would. This book sheds no light on Kubrick's genius whatsoever. The majority of the book is a sort of Cliff's Notes on nearly every film Kubrick has made. The capsulation of these films are so brief and hollow, that he covers a work like A Clockwork Orange in a mere 20 pages. Not only that, but the book is full of errors when lines are quoted and references made. If you want a REAL book on Kubrick, read Mario Falsetto's works on this directoral master. I will use Mr. Kagan's, however, as a beer coaster."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"The main problem with this book is the overall sloppy job of writing. It is clear that the author failed to take notes during the films, for his descriptions are filled with incorrect statements about things as basic as the story and other errors. In his analysis of The Shining, for example, he spends a few pages recounting the plot. In doing so, however, he switches many of the events around and getting them out of order. Furthermore, he also has a habit of getting the names of characters mixed up, or getting the wrongs names altogether. If you're looking for a much better book on Kubrick, try Thomas Nelson's Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"I don't know why film critics think they can get away with this kind of thing. Imagine if somebody tried to &quot;critique&quot; a novel, a CD, or any other type of work by retelling the narrative (or lyrics, or whatever) in his own words. Dismissed without a second thought, needless to say. But film critics write 'em and get 'em published. To what end, I don't know.That said, this book plumbs new depths in that it's ALL the author does. There's no technical background or critical apparatus at all, merely scene by scene retellings of the films along with a bit of blather about &quot;themes&quot;. The book's errors have been mentioned, but it should be reiterated that these are of a number and level of ignorance that's truly jaw-dropping. (My favorite is Kagan's identification of the drunken Shriners of &quot;Killer's Kiss&quot; as &quot;some kind of street entertainers&quot;.)One of these days, Kubrick will get the film-by-film analysis he deserves. This one ain't even a beginning."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"If you're looking for a collection of poorly-written and badly inaccurate plot summaries of Kubrick's work set alongside a summary of critics' reviews of his films, this is the book for you. Really a terrible work. There's literally LESS here than you would get from watching the films yourself and consulting the some of the fine Kubrick sites on the web which collect far more insightful critiques verbatim."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"I have a theory: Kagan needed to write a thesis. He decided that Kubrick's work demonstrated the repetition of certain themes, and decided to &quot;argue&quot; accordingly. He wrote synopsis' of all Kubrick's films, then added a few pages to the end of each to justify his [Kagan's] &quot;arguments&quot;.And voila -- a thesis, a C-, and next year it's the PHD...This is sophomore stuff. If you want critical insight read Nelson; if you want Bio, read Lobrutto; scandal, read Baxter; character, read Herr or Raphael; general information, read Cimet or Walker."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"Norman Kagan should get an &quot;editing&quot; credit rather than &quot;author&quot; credit. This book on the cinema of Stanley Kubrick is basically an accumulation of articles, interviews and reviews of his films and his life. Albeit some of it was interesting, the book is nothing I found original. At the end of each chapter, however, the author does take it upon himself to interpret the films in a manner in which he sees a destructive, non-sexual, non-emotional Kubrick. That of obsessive and homicidal. Attempting to make a &quot;connection&quot; in all the films which I believe is poorly attempted. I would move elsewhere to find word on Kubrick and his films."},{"Title":"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick","review":"Kagan's tome on the works of Stanley Kubrick breaks ranks with the films it seeks to illuminate by accomplishing something those works do not - Kagan's tome is terribly BORING and ultimately says very little about the subjects it hopes to explore.Yes, the Third Edition covers every Kubrick film right up to Eyes Wide Shut, claiming to be the only book on Kubrick to do so. Even if that boast is true, it does very little to address the glaring flaws that make this book one to be avoided.While all of Kubrick's films are covered, most of the text on each are rambling, haphazardly written summaries of the films' plots, information we presume a student of Kubrick will find wholly unnecessarily. Worse still, he often spends more time summarizing than examining; 21 pages are devoted to regurgitating the plot of Dr. Strangelove, for instance, with just 11 pages devoted to examining the film. Kagan throws a bit of editorial comment into those summaries, but such content is sparse and rarely enlightening.The summaries are preceded by a brief - sometimes as brief as a paragraph or two - bit of text introducing the film. Generally speaking, entirely worthless.Finally, each summary is followed by a half-hearted, and often too brief, attempt to examine the themes of the film and how Kubrick attempted to display those themes. Kagan manages to cut and paste portions of reviews that back his observations, but he rarely presents them in such a way to truly bolster his argument (or make the argument interesting for the reader), and for stretches one wonders just how much actual WRITING Kagan did. These thematic explorations are often so brief as to be frustrating, too. Barry Lyndon fans, for instance, will wonder if Kagan even SAW the film based on the two whole pages it gets.In the end, however, the book fails because it offers the reader no real insight into the cinema of Stanley Kubrick. Not in the creation of these films; the production; the historical importance; the cinematic importance. Virtually nothing is offered on the history of these productions, how Kubrick went about creating each film, notes of interest, or reasons why the films stand out from the pack - things one would think are essential in a boom called \\"The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick.\\"So why two stars for a book so, well, bad? It is a valuable resource in that it summarizes some Kubrick films no longer readily available for viewing. Kubrick students may find some of use for this book in that, at least.

I picked up this book in a little Gloucester bookshop a few years ago, but I've finally just had a chance to read it in its entirety. What a Joy! It reminded me that the stresses and travails we encounter in our daily lives are so trivial at best, compared to the world we pass by everyday. The author's recollection of his boyhood on the Argentinian pampas and his adventures with snakes and birds and vizcachas made his words come alive, and I felt I was there with him. A treasure and one I would read to kids who have the gift of spirit in them, and to remind them that all of what he wrote is disappearing."},{"Title":"Far away and long ago: A history of my early life","review":"We badly need to have this book once more available. Full of insights into the meaning of human life in nature, it also chronicles the passing of a virgin landscape in S.America with the coming of a predatory civilization. Hudson came of age with little schooling but endless hours of observing life (especially birds) and reading. His friends in England, where he went in his 30s, often wondered why he was habitually sad. This profound reminiscence explains why."},{"Title":"Far away and long ago: A history of my early life","review":"Hudson is a wonderful writer, and this is a first hand account of his childhood in gaucho land, with invaluable glimpses of Buenos Aires at the setting of Rosas dictatorship and after."},{"Title":"Far away and long ago: A history of my early life","review":"Written in 1918 by this Englishman who tells about his life as a boy in the Argentine Pampas. Filled with intense melancholy -but at the same time joy- that those recollections produce in his memory. Whoever reads this biographical account cannot but adore this man.He achieves the difficult task of making us readers see nature, wildlife, and human beings with the same eyes as his young and avid ones. He talks a lot about plants and birds, and this to me is the only minus I can find, since I sympathize with his love for nature but cannot go along with his terminology. He describes the people he met and that left in him a greater impact. His family, the daily chores at home and in the fields; but above all we get to feel like a child, to see that far away wilderness with the innocence and vulnerability of a little kid.However, the book wouldn't have been more than a picturesque story of an English child in the Pampas if it wasn't for the last 3 or 4 chapters. The death of his mother, his illness and the sentence inflicted by the doctors of a short life, the angst of knowing that his beloved nature, trees, birds and all to be lost soon, produces a struggle of faith against the pullings of new-come Darwinism and its partisans. A struggle that millions must have gone through -as the author admits- but I can't think that anybody could describe it so beautifully.How different those two men must have been: Darwin and Hudson. \\"Darwin, writing in praise of the gaucho in his Voyage of a Naturalist, says that if a gaucho cuts your throat he does it like a gentleman: even as a small boy I knew better- that he did his business rather like a hellish creature reveling in his cruelty.\\"Hudson's parents were Protestant Christians, true believers. Not all his brothers inherited the parents' faith: the desire for immortality is not universal, as he mentions. But W.H.Hudson's desire was enough to grant him the faith he so much struggled to retain in the passage from childhood to manhood.An inspiring story, humbling and beautifully told."},{"Title":"Far away and long ago: A history of my early life","review":"I read Green Mansions on Jan 6, 1946, and was blown away and all these many years later I treasure the enjoyment and appreciation which I had for that book. When I became aware that Hudson had written a history of his early life, I was glad to locate and read a copy of this work, first published in 1918 (though the copy I read was published in 1925). Hudson is primarily a naturalist, and I have no particular interest in nature; yet this account of the first fifteen years of Hudson's life growing up in Argentina I found, after a time, increasingly interesting. The final chapters especially caught me up. His sensitivity to birds, and all the fauna he found in his area of Argentina, as well as his astute observations of the people among whom he and his family lived, are of great interest. This book fittingly memorializes the boyhood years (1841 to 1856) of a master of English prose."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"The negative reviews I've read so far are trashing the book because it wasn't what they expected it to be: a nostalgic, easy read to be enjoyed while sipping hot cider. The book doesn't present itself as such and is clearly an academic and scholarly survey of the holiday.I found the book to be a slim, well-written text that still manages to cover a wide range of topics and provide tons of interesting facts and figures. Rogers' main thesis is that Halloween, a holiday that continually reinvents itself, continues to provide \\"a space for transgression and parody,\\" even as it is appropriated to fit the social and political needs of the culture. Rogers explores this thesis by examining the origins of Halloween, its history in Britain and North America, its similarities to Mexico's \\"Day of the Dead,\\" urban legends and popular reactions to the holiday, its representation in Hollywood, and current trends in its celebration. He ends with a few guesses and questions about the holiday's future. A thorough analysis without getting bogged down in any one aspect."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"This book has an amazing amount of information in it about Halloween from the Celtic period to post 9/11 and anyone wanting to learn about the history of the holiday over this entire span should start with this book.I can't fault the author in any way for what is written, my problem was with how it was written. It didn't seem as though the author enjoyed the holiday and that made the writing seem kind of gray to me, not enjoyable as it would be with someone who really loves the holiday.Still a great reference book though."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"As other reviews suggest, this is not a ghost story or for those with short attention spans. Dr. Rogers is a professor of history, and he has produced a correspondingly scholarly book of history, including names, dates, argumentation, and references to his source materials. When I found the book, I was mainly interested in the early history of Halloween, and the first part of the book delivers it. And it's an important contribution, contrasting with pop-histories that paste later Christian traditions on to early Celtic celebrations, and basically dismiss a thousand years of Christian development as something like \\"And then they tried to Christianize it because those darned pagans wouldn't go away\\". Halloween evolved as the cultures celebrating it evolved, and you can't understand its celebration today through a single slice of time in history.I was tempted to give it four stars instead of five because I thought the author put too much space into Halloween movies, and not enough into the early American development. But he was bringing us up through its modern celebration in the US and Canada, and movies are an important source and reflection of the culture, so I suppose that serves his intent.You shouldn't try to learn any subject from a single book. Excellent companion books are \\"The Pagan Mysteries of Halloween\\" by Markale, for its early history, and \\"Halloween: An American Holiday, An American Tradition\\" by Bannatyne for its American development, if you ignore her pre-American history of it (for reasons which are explained comprehensively in Ronald Hutton's \\"Triumph of the Moon\\")."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"Single-subject histories on the likes of salt, codfish and even the color red have become a fashionable lately, and this book is a fine specimen of the genre. It traces the history of the celebration of October 31 from Samhain, the year cycle rite observed by the pagan Celts in Britain, to the many ways it is marked in North America at the time of the new millennium. His central thesis, supported by myriad examples and illustrations, is that Halloween has always been a liminal time, a boundary between autumn and winter, this world and the other world, life and death. Drawing from the theory of anthropologist Victor Turner, he argues that liminal times are also periods of ritual inversion in which the obverse of cultural values, however they are construed, are temporarily allowed to emerge into public consciousness and celebrated before being relegated once again to the cultural closet. Whether these oppositional symbols are spiritual otherworlds, as they were for the ancient Celts, or consist instead of what is disavowed by the dominant cultural paradigm, Halloween provides a framework during which they can be publicly explored and performed. This central feature of Halloween, more than any individual rite or symbol, constitutes the core of the holiday that has endured for over a thousand years. From Celtic Samhain to globalized celebration of consumer culture, Halloween seems to attract to it the oppositional and the carnivalesque. No wonder, then, that is has become a popular target for the invectives of conservative Christian ministers and their congregations, who label it \\"Satanic\\" and call for its suppression. But the suppression of culturally contested symbols never successfully eliminates the ideas behind them. In fact, as Turner and French cultural historian Michel Foucault argue, these oppositional images are fertile ground for cultural renewal, and provide alternative ways of envisioning reality: they are cultural countersites where social mores and pretensions can be mocked, parodied, and lampooned with impunity, and an alternative universe can temporarily be imagined.This excellent book will appeal to a wide range of readers. It reads fluidly and easily, is theoretically well-informed without being jargon-ridden or using theory as a bludgeon, and could easily be adopted for use in large undergraduate courses on cultural history, folkloristics and anthropology."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"First let me say that this book is like a history book on the history of halloween.

And as I learned the rituals along with my children... my wonderment increased. This book is in part an attempt to make sense of that story and to assess the holiday's wider cultural significance... Here I argue that Halloween's capacity to provide a public space for social inversion or transgression held it in good stead at a time when other potentially raucous holidays were becoming more institutionalized and domesticated.\\" (Pg. 8-9)He observes, \\"The notion that Samhain was a festival of the dead was first popularized by Sir James Frazer in the now classicThe Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion: A New Abridgement from the Second and Third Editions (Oxford World's Classics)... In fact, there is no hard evidence that Samhain was specifically devoted to the dead or to ancestor worship, despite claims to the contrary by some American folklorists, some of whom have presumed that the feast was devoted to Saman, god of the dead.\\" (Pg. 19)He notes, \\"The Puritans of New England... detested the holiday. Increase Mather... approved of the ban on saints' days and thought any holiday suffixed -mass, whether Hallowmass or even Christmass, to be an unnecessary concession to the Antichrist.\\" (Pg. 49) After noting that October 31st was increasingly a night for vandalism and rowdiness, he adds, \\"Insofar as rascality could be tolerated at all, it was better that it be rendered child-like. The logic of this argument led inexorably to the trick-or-treat.\\" (Pg. 86) He suggests, \\"civic and industrial promoters hoped to eliminate its anarchic features... and restore social order to the night of 31 October.\\" (Pg. 88)He rebuts exaggerations about \\"tainted candy\\" being passed out (e.g., \\"Since only two deaths and relatively few injuries have been reported from the tampering with Halloween treats, it might be tempting to suggest that the new era of Halloween sadism was simply a product of media hype\\"; pg. 93). He concludes, \\"Halloween is currently the second most important party night in North America. In terms of its retail potential, it is second only to Christmas... Halloween can also be seen as a homogenizing force, as the epitome of North American mass culture.\\" (Pg. 163)This book might be criticized by some as overemphasizing some aspects of the celebration (e.g., gender-switching costumes; movies), but it is a very broad and informative historical explanation."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"You need to love the history of HALLOWEEN in order to appreciate this book.

It reads like a college professor's thesis full of large, exaggerating words and sentences rather than a reader-friendly book.The only other distracting thing about this book is it's continuous mention of homosexual Halloween traditions. This history gets its own introduction AND chapter, which is quite distracting when when you are trying to read the history and then reminded about the parades and flamboyant costumes of the gay community.Aside from this criticisms, this is an informative book. If you want a brief history of Halloween, go somewhere else. But if you want a true (time comsuming!) commentary, then this is a good find."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"When the time came to read this year's Halloween book, I chose Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night by Nicholas Rogers. I was looking for an interesting, scholarly treatment of the holiday. I didn't find it.That's not to say that I didn't learn anything. According to Rogers, Halloween, as it is celebrated in the United States and Canada, was basically brought to the New World by Scottish and Irish immigrants. In those countries, Halloween apparently grew out of Pagan autumn festivals and the Christian holidays of All Saints and All Souls days. The Day of the Dead had a similar origin in Mexico. What began in the US and Canada as a celebration of Celtic pride evolved into a night of teen and adult rowdiness, which was in turn tamed into \\"trick-or-treating.\\" In the last few decades, the commercial engines have behaved like a positive-feedback loop: Because Halloween is popular, there is money to be made, so it needs to be hyped and marketed to make it more popular, so more money can be made, and so on.See? That didn't take 170 pages. The remaining space is occupied by the author supporting his conclusions with data and argumentation. The data generally amounts to lists of single sentence anecdotes gleaned from various Canadian and American newspaper editions published in late October and early November over a wide range of years. There are also a number of illustrations, including festive holiday snapshots taken by the author. The author's argumentation is based on induction from these published data points -- as well as stories from his colleagues and dentist -- to explain their significance as only an academic could. For example, this gem is put forth as part of the discussion of the relevance of the Halloween movies by John Carpenter to the actual holiday (p. 121):\\"For it could be argued that Myer's murderous interventions are facilitated by the collapse of Halloween as an inclusive family holiday and its transformation into a set of generational consumer rites in which family mutualities are neglected.\\"What?! The plots of the six Halloween \\"films\\" are discussed and their commentary on the holiday is \\"explored.\\" It is hard to take this kind of scholarship seriously when it takes slasher-flix so seriously."},{"Title":"Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night","review":"Holly and Alexander, you two just stop it right now!

You know, a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane in rural/suburban America.Oops.This is actually an academic treatise where the author wants to discuss social inversion, gender identity, and queer politics. No offense to the author, but most people don't regularly use the term \\"social inversion\\", let alone bring it up constantly in conversation. If you are a cultural transgressor looking to be affirmed in your okayness, this is perhaps a good book for you. I was looking to be affirmed in my nostalgia, so I am out of luck.(Normally I don't review books down because I disagree with the author; however, I feel that this is marketed deceptively.

It includes much material not found in Scribner's original, 1940s, three-volume publication.This RICHLY AND PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED MIT Press edition is THE ONE TO HAVE.Although a major figure in American philosophy, writer of one of the finest novels set in America (The Last Puritan) and an aknowledged master of English prose, Jorge Ru&iacute;z de Santayana (1863-1952) was born in &Aacute;vila, Spain, of Spanish parents and retained his Spanish nationality until his dying day, never becoming an American citizen.He wound up in Boston because his mother's first husband, the captain of a yankee clipper, was a Sturgis from Cod city. They met and married in the Philippines, then a Spanish colony. After this brief marriage, which produced 3 Sturgis children, including the only person Santayana ever truly loved, his half-sister Susana Sturgis, the widowed Mrs Sturgis married Santayana's father, an elderly Spanish colonial official. They soon separated and at age 6 little Jorge, who could hardly be brought up in &Aacute;vila by his old father alone, was sent to his mother, who had taken up residence in Boston with her first husband's well-off relatives.While outwardly a successful &eacute;migr&eacute; student, Santayana nursed deep anger against his mother (her portrait in these m&eacute;moires is devastating) and never forgave the slight done to his father, whose austere Castilian livelihood had not been able to compete with those Yankee greenbacks.Santayana studied at Harvard and in Germany and was aknowledged to be so brilliant he was offered a teaching post at Harvard when hardly out of graduate school. But the powers-that-be there never liked him, or he them. His haughty, very \\"foreign\\" outward appeareance, all dressed in black like a Castilian; his cold sardonic humour; his atheism; his paradoxical love for the Catholic esthetic; his political conservatism; his homosexuality: all these were inimical to the worthy Brahmins who ran the University.On his side, he despised their sentimental, smug progressivism; their senseless liberal religiosity; their childish moral earnesteness--all concealing a brutal sense of entitlement and power.Santayana's successive promotions to eventual full-professorship were systematically delayed, notwithstanding his being one of the most celebrated members of the faculty. Once the crown was conferred upon him, though, he threw it in their faces, resigning his professorship in 1912. The proud Eternal Outsider moved to Europe (England, Spain, Italy) were he lived the remaining 40 years of his life. He never set foot in the US again.This autobiography is one of the most fascinating such documents ever created. All people depicted are unforgettably etched in acid, with a calm Pascalian insight into their souls that is almost terrifying. Santayana was a profound skeptic of human sentiments, an austere, stoic Spanish Epicurean writing the richest Emersonian English. A thousand times more percipient than Tocqueville, Santayana's point of view, the magisterial clarity with which it is propounded, are indeed uniquely prepossessing: here was the last philosopher of antiquity, mysteriously issued forth from medieval &Aacute;vila to address, in English, the corny foibles of the American century...in lucid Lucretian periods.One can scarcely conceive of another book quite like this."},{"Title":"Killer Priest: The Crimes, Trial, and Execution of Father Hans Schmidt (Crime, Media, and Popular Culture)","review":"Killer Priest by Mark Gado is an electrifying story expertly told. Hans Schmidt, the only priest ever to be executed for murder in the U.S., had character flaws that surfaced during his childhood in Germany. He had no use for his brothers or friends, but became transfixed with religion and killing. When adolescent sexual fantasies become intertwined with images of death and slaughter, problems are almost certain to arise. As an introverted teenager, the intelligent and scholarly Schmidt drifted into ecclesiastical studies. However, the character flaws and sexual conflict deepened and he ran afoul of the law. He became a thief and a forger who was ostracized by the clerics that knew him.Gado's meticulous research traces Father Schmidt's twisted childhood in Germany, through his years at the seminary in Mainz, his flight from Europe and eventually his first clergy assignment in Louisville, Kentucky. A missing nine-year-old girl case raised questions at his parish and Father Schmidt suddenly leaves Louisville and heads for New York City. There, he secretly married a beautiful young woman in a ceremony he performed himself. When her dismembered body parts turned up in the Hudson River, a city became mesmerized by the spectacle of a Catholic priest arrested for a murder...and the possibility he was a serial killer!As a seasoned detective, Gado carefully lays out the investigation and the manner in which the detectives built the case against Schmidt. Once it got to court, Schmidt, ever the manipulator, attempted to hide behind the insanity defense - creating the disturbing risk that the killer could have been turned over to the custody of the Catholic Church.Gado's experiences in homicide and death investigation, his first-hand understanding of the criminal mind and his ability to dramatize a story so effectively combine to make Killer Priest an excellent read."},{"Title":"Killer Priest: The Crimes, Trial, and Execution of Father Hans Schmidt (Crime, Media, and Popular Culture)","review":"I was very interested in reading this book when I heard of it.

I've been researching this case for a number of years and have found no evidence that Schmidt was ever at St. John's.

The plot of the story is basically a question for Sue Snue: What do you want to be? The first few pages highlight what her uncles do, asking her if she wants to follow in their footsteps. The next several pages ask Sue Snue if she wants to be a whole host of other things: baker, astronaut, cowpoke, etc. (Incidentally my 3-yr old daughter wants to be a \\"canner of peas.\\" Surely it's just a phase.)Sadly, the illustrations seem to favor the children's show more than they do the drawings of Dr. Suess. The rhymes are adequate, the made-up words are in the tradition of Dr. Suess, and my daughter does enjoy the cameo appearance by Fox in Socks (\\"He got out of the bottle!\\"). Unfortunately, on the second-to-last page Sue Snue interrupts the narrative to give a speech filled with meaningless cliches advocating the sole virtue of postmodern relativism--narcissistic individualism. Dr. Suess's books generally aschew moralizing, opting instead for mere silliness and, at worst, mischeif. Sue Snue, on the other hand, tells your child to \\"be [her]self\\" and \\"be true to [her]self.\\" Sue Snue defiantly wags her finger at the crowd and and says (I paraphrase), \\"No one can tell me what to do, not even Mom and Dad!\\" On the last page (SPOILER ALERT!) she is congratulated for this attitude. Excuse me, Ms. Snue, but no one was telling you what to do, merely asking. So it's suddenly wrong to ask your child what they want to be when they grow up? I am happy for my daughter to imagine being different things (two weeks ago it was architect, last week it was farmer). How, exactly, does one imagine \\"being oneself.\\" Also, since when is Shakespeare's Polonius an expert on virtue? If you like Dr. Suess, stick with the real one.

Not only does it have all the problems already described by the intelligent reader from Australia, but there is something else terribly wrong with it: The message that it is Ok, even noble, to defy, ignore, and dismiss the directives, opinions, and desires of your parents and family.

Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook is much improved over the freebie notepad version they gave out a few years back, but it suffers from a lack of focus. The small size, spiral binding, and tabs suggest it is intended as a first responder or incident commander handbook, but occasional topical discourses suggest that it is meant as a textbook. As a result, it is hard to find the information that would be needed on the scene (an index helps, but only slightly), while the coverage of the various topics is too uneven for it to be a good text. In some places, it seems to be simply a compilation of information from various (US) field manuals.There are some good ideas, but they seem to be sabotaged by the execution. The checklist version of the &quot;Agent Indicator Matrix&quot; (based on the Defense Protective Service model) is a good idea, but it is spread over three pages (instead of being arranged to fit on two facing pages in a landscape presentation or provided as a foldout) so that it can neither be copied easily or used easily in the book. A section on the threat of stolen military munitions, after noting that stockpiles in other countries are not as well secured as those in the US, then proceeds to a description of US weapons without describing distinguishing characteristics of chemical munitions relative to conventional munitions or how the munitions described might relate to foreign munitions.There are also some surprising errors in the hodgepodge of facts. The volume I purchased indicates that it is from the sixth printing, so I have to presume that most typos have been corrected. One particularly egregious error is in the characterization of liquid phosgene as &quot;...not hazardous except as a source of vapor.&quot; This statement is highlighted in a little box with a finger pointing at it on page 106, and repeated on page 108. While certainly it is the vapor that kills, liquid phosgene splashed into the eyes is known to produce opacification. Subsequently, it is stated that &quot;Phosgene [vapor] does not damage the eyes or skin...&quot; Yet it is well known that concentrated phosgene vapor will irritate both the skin and eyes, and, while this would not be fatal, and is usually not permanent the downplaying of these risks is certainly inappropriate, to put it mildly.To try to close on a positive note, this book does have some good information salted in various odd spots. If you are responsible for a training program, it would be a good book for you to look at, provided it is not the only reference you use. The table of emergency decontamination materials found at a K-Mart, for instance, suggests an obvious bit of homework for your trainees.In summary, this handbook should not be your first or only purchase, but it probably has a place in a comprehensive library.

Like Chuck Klosterman, Hunter discovers heavy metal at a young age and immediately falls in love. Unlike Klosterman, Hunter takes his love to the next level - starting a band.Hell Bent for Leather is at once endearing and frustrating. Hunter is honest about his love affair with metal (I'll pause here to note that roughly 5% of the bands Hunter cites would be classified as metal today), but he's also a bit too embarrassed, as if he has to apologize for enjoying music that critics universally loathed.As a straightforward memoir, Hell Bent for Leather is a compelling and completely enjoyable read. This tale of a wannabe rock star, presented by someone who can actually write, was what kept my interest. Hunter's various expositions on the different types of metal, while humorous, were either inaccurate or unnecessary (or both), and tended to fail where Fargo Rock City succeeded.I didn't love everything about this book, but Hell Bent for Leather was still a very enjoyable look at a young man's quest for rock n' roll stardom, and the impact this kind of music can have on its listeners. There is enough in the way of humor and personality to make up for its occasional flaws, and I could definitely see it appealing to anyone who enjoyed Fargo Rock City."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"Although I'm just over half way through, I think I've now read enough in order to express a thought out opinion on this book. Currently being on page 169 (Chapter 10), my opinions of the author and the book have changed immensely. Claiming to be the \\"confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict\\" would imply that he took being a heavy metal fan to the extreme and enveloped the reader with funny stories about those endeavours and about how he first became addicted. Indeed it starts off that way and he regales us with the amusing stories when he first discovers heavy metal in the medium of AC/DC's \\"Let's Get It Up\\" at the ripe and impressionable age of 10.The comical stories about being the outcast heavy metal fan are comical especially in regards to his relationship with his Father and him not liking his sons musical tastes. The start of the book is quite promising and I flew through the first 5 chapters in a second because I found the story so enjoyable. What the booked turned into, however, was a disgustingly mutated tale of musical elitism and false modesty. This is especially apparent in talking about his days experimenting being in bands. He constantly describes his fellow band members in an extremely negative way, and although he does refer to himself in a sort of modesty describing his own flaws, I got the sense it was false and he was simply doing it to not make himself sound arrogant about his own abilities.I'll give Seb Hunter credit where credit's due and that is he's very knowledgeable about the subject at hand. He knows his stuff in regards to the particular bands, instruments and history about this particular genre. The book throughout is told in an embarassed tone and although I haven't gotten as far as to when he drops the heavy metal habbit, I can see from other reviews that he clearly is embarassed by his heavy metal \\"addiction.\\" I place the addiction in quotation marks as, although he does become a hardcore fan of the genre he's by no means an addict and in fact to claim it's an addiction is to imply Heavy Metal is a bad thing and should be kept away from.In fact Heavy Metal is something of the opposite as it's a beatiful and energetic genre which embraces all forms of musical ability. In fact I'm listening to AC/DC's \\"For Those About To Rock We Salute You\\" and I have to say there's nothing to be embarassed about. Seb Hunter wasn't an addict, he was a typical posh kid who endeavoured into a stage of rebellion. He was the typical student type that we can all relate to. He didn't wash very often, he had silly hair, wore silly clothes and tried his hand at being in a band. I'm especially disappointed by this book as it was praised by a man I highly admire by the name of Bill Bailey. Did Bill even read the book in its entirety? Maybe he just read the first few chapters, did what I did and enjoyed it and thought \\"that's enough to praise it wholeheartedly.\\"I wouldn't recommend it. It had its good points and I'll praise Seb for that, but the fact that he's a typical rebellious teen who went through a stage we all did, doesn't really make his story worth telling in my opinion. If you want to learn about heavy metal pick up a Heavy Metal Encylopedia, but don't pick this up looking to laugh and enjoy it all the way through. I'll try and finish it and if my opinions change once again I'll update the review, but I'm not counting on it."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"Seb Hunter does just a brilliant job paying Metal it's long due respect, concurrently embdedding just the right bit of wry Brittish humor and colloquialism, so that we don't take any of it too seriously. The important take-a-way, is that for anyone...I mean anyone who felt the goosebumps up their back when they first really FELT metal, those feelings and that energy and affectation were real. Anyone can make fun of it now, but if you were there, you know who you are and you will be underlining passages in nearly every page of this book. Without necessarily cognating it at the time, Metal was a first glimpse for many to grab onto something to really feel passionate about. And now, as an older, \\"wiser\\" person, I realize those experiences are just too hard to come by."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"Kind of a strange book. It seems that the only people who would be interested in this would be metal fans, yet the author seems to look down on metal and it's fans. Kind of insulting. I have to admit though, I laughed out loud quite a few times. Fun read if you don't mind being treated like an idiot for liking this type of music."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"Mister Seb Hunter is a really good heavy metal historian. It was passionate to read mister Seb' description on looking metal, dressing metal, sounding metal. His description of the differents varieties of metal: from glam to black metal. And his description of Heavy Metal's majors players: the almighty great Guns N'Roses, Poison, Hanoi Rocks, Venom, Manowar, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, KISS, the Great Kat, and the colorful King of Crap Mortiis. I'm not a particular death metal and black metal fan. But at least they keeps Metal alive and they seem to believe in what their did. Norvegian black metal are really serious about their music.But this book could have been perfect without a major downfall! The Seb Hunter's confessions!The majority of mister Hunter' confessions are pointless, boring, and uninteresting. So boring than I didn't bothers to read the last half of his \\"confessions\\". But I devored each and every words of his view on Heavy Metal's history. This book created a new found interest about Norvegian black metal and metal vixen The Great Kat. I love her nasty attitude!!!So Seb, I suggest you to write an encyclopedia about Heavy Metal history. I will be the one to buy it!"},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"This reads like the lives of so many during the hair rock period of the 80's, including myself. And although I also frequently flirted with glam side of metal (RATT, Dokken), I was a thrasher through and through. Hunter has a wonderfully light humorous touch and the parts where I found myself laughing the heartiest the parts where he described exactly how I had behaved then. If you want to have a good laugh at yourself pick up a copy of this book. And if you enjoy it as much as I did, you will also be ordering all those albums you sold ages ago to support your band's drug habits: Led Zeppelin Four, Highway to Hell, Master of Puppets, and Holy Diver."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"This book contains a very witty analysis of heavy metal culture, from its long hair, bullet belts, and tight jeans, to pointy headstocks on electric guitars and Marshall amps. Whether you are a fan of metal or not, you will find much to laugh at (or with).These observations on the metal scene are interspersed throughout what is actually a story about the author's ups and downs, on his quest to become a metal superstar. So while the commentary on the metal scene is more or less universal, the rest of this book is one man's journey.It doesn't necessarily detract much from the book, but it will probably be disappointing to anyone who reads it, that it is ultimately a story about how the author got out of the metal scene, and not a celebration of it."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"\\"Hellbent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict\\" by Seb Hunter is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. Part autobiography and part heavy metal primer, the book would be funny for anyone, but is especially meaningful for those of us who love heavy metal. At times, the author looks back at himself and certain aspects of metal fandom with a roll of the eyes (after all, who doesn't have a picture of themselves from their teens with a somewhat ridiculous haircut and ripped jeans?) but overall he treats the subject with the respect one would expect from a life-long fan.Hunter's life story parallels that of most metal fans. The book spans the author's history from the first time he heard ACDC's \\"Let's Get it Up\\" as a 10 year old, his introductions to all the various styles of metal as a teen, through various bands he played with, and eventually the crash when the realization that the career of Rock God has passed him by. Personally, I recall most of the same events in my own life, including the first time hearing Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" as a child, being mesmerized by it, expanding to Iron Maiden, Scorpions and Metallica in high school and then eventually joining a metal band in college, which ultimately went nowhere. For any of us with similar stories, this book is especially funny and interesting. However, Hunter's wry observations and dry English wit make this an entertaining read for just about anyone.If you don't know anything about the metal subculture, you will by the end of this book, however, if you do, he really nails most aspects of what it means to be a fan of this type of music. When his band forced a keyboard player on Seb, over his protest, he points out the following: \\"Motorhead don't use keyboards. If Lemmy saw a keyboard, he'd vomit. Slayer couldn't even pronounce the word, let along plug one in.\\" He discusses the long hair, of course, in detail, as well as how to dress metal. If a fan of a particular band were to bump into another fan of that particular band, \\"what you want to be wearing is the limited edition tour t-shirt, the faded one and, most importantly, the one with the tour dates on the back...preferably for a gigantic world tour with tons of dates in Germany and places you've never heard of in America\\". Metal guitars, the best live album of all time (need you even ask, \\"Live After Death\\" of course) and which bands he would have thrown a two-liter bottle of piss at during the various Castle Donnington concerts (Meat Loaf, Bon Jovi, Thunder, Extreme and Warrior Soul amongst others).The author's father wanted him to get rid his first Venom album, and he argued \\"but it says they're At War With Satan....Dad!\\". I went through the same thing with mom and \\"Kill \`em All\\". I was reading this book while traveling through Europe, usually on a train. People would often look at me strangely as I was laughing out loud like a loon, but it's impossible not to with some of the lines Hunter throws out there. Discussing the big Four of thrash, \\"Slayer couldn't do a ballad if you sprinkled their breakfast cereal with ecstasy and sleeping pills and locked them in a room with just harps\\". On Metallica's downward spiral post Master of Puppets (if you only ever buy one thrash album ever then buy this one), \\"They not only recorded a ballad...produced by Bob Rock no less, Bon Jovi's producer. It wasn't long before they'd cut their hair, recorded a live album with an orchestra, dressed in suits and....tried to sue their fans for downloading their music from Napster too....I would certainly call that a demise\\". Give this book a read, it goes by fast, has great pictures illustrating the author's points and will absolutely make you laugh out loud over and over."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"I got this book at the library looking for the book Motley Crue wrote, and I loved it! I couldn't put it down.. Me being a girl, far past the decade of decadence of the 1980s, I wanted to know what it was like. Seb Hunter told it like it was, from his eyes. He grew up with ac/dc, iron maiden, judas priest, and many others, and decicated his life to being an extreme heavy-metaller. He had the hair, the looks, the clothes, the band, the drugs, and the girls. He told you everything you wanted to know about being a heavy metal rock star (the guitars, the solos, the music, the shows). The only bad thing about this book was that it made me so jealous that I grew up in our time of rap, and hip-hop. I want to live the life of glam metal. Seb Hunter has a brilliant voice, and first-hand experience. I read it in 2 days."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"It's hard to write one of these sorts of heavy metal confessional books for a few reasons. One is that anyone who was listening to INXS and U2 back in the day will care little about your opinions of the best Saxon album or the most authoritative Anthrax lineup. The other is that people who were into this sort of music will endlessly disagree with you about what year was the most awesome Monsters of Rock, so you might alienate them with your opinion. Nevertheless, Seb Hunter lays it all out for us here: his early addiction to AC/DC, his later worship of Iron Maiden and Hanoi Rocks, and his attempts to pick up a guitar and slam out the three chords needed for a good garage band.Like Klosterman's oft-compared _Fargo Rock City_, I didn't entirely agree with some of Hunter's judgements and statements. (Motorhead's _1916_ a concept album?) Maybe my background in Midwest America was different than his in England, but we both worshipped many of the same groups, so the common ground made this worthwhile. I also experimented with very amateur attempts to put together the next Metallica with bad instruments and worse musicians on a Sears tape recorder, so I applaud his ability to tell his story. This is good writing and a great bunch of episodes, although all came to a closing a bit sooner than I wanted it to. Overall, a good book if you've got a leather jacket in the back of the closet and still remember the pre-Nirvana days with fondness."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"I got an advanced copy of this a couple of months ago and couldn't put it down.

Being a couple years older than Seb (and, having gotten into rock/metal at a younger age), I was able to re-live some of those old memories, albeit with a UK twist. I like how he intertwined his autobiographical stuff along with the \\"history of metal\\" aspect... it kept things interesting, and I found myself laughing out loud while reading on the subway."},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"I am currently half way through Seb's tale on Heavy Metal baby steps and enjoying every single page. It is amazing how the love for this sometimes controversal sometimes predictable musical genre can bring people together regardless their origins, age or sub-genre of choice.I grew up here in Brazil and was a teenager in the 80's, but reading Seb's account on how he got hooked up in metal in Britain feels like I am reading my own life story.Everyone who once worshiped Angus Young and Lemmy Kilminster will feel tremendous empathy for this book, and regardless of the turns one might have made in life (you may now be a respectable lawyer or a brain surgeon), if once you wore that ragged black t-shirt, long greasy hair and played air guitar in front of your mirror, after reading this book you'll feel metal pumping in your veins again.

Really fun to read, brought back a lot of memories!"},{"Title":"Hell Bent for Leather: Confessions of a Heavy Metal Addict","review":"I enjoyed this book, but there seems to be some details that the author seems to have overlooked or admits to researching online in the book. There is a picture of Mortiis that he claims is one of the more popular death metal artists currently - Mortiis was at one time in the black metal band Emperor and now has an electronic industrial band going, so this would be misleading to people unfamiliar with this artist- he hasn't released a heavy metal album in a decade now, 5 years at the time this book was published! Seb also tries to summarize the history of Mayhem leaving out many important details and admits to not knowing about Sepultura, referencing their horrendous debut album as the one to listen to by the band. Aside from these details it is a great read, but the author has a condescending attitude of knowing more about heavy metal than the reader which irritates when you know far more about a band or genre than him, seeing that his on page writing seems to be talking down to you. Unintentionally funny things I found in the book : Seb's seeming disgust of American culture, yet he worships LA glam bands. Mr. Hunter references Amazon.com for information on bands and subgenre's of heavy metal he doesn't seem to understand very well. In this book Seb Hunter does a wonderous job of reminding those of us into heavy metal about the glam trend that forever seems to haunt the heavy metal music genre.If you're into underground metal and know who 1349, Anaal Nathrakh and Carpathian Forest are then you can pass this book up and read something like Lords of Chaos. If you want a coming of age story set to a soundtrack of Hanoi Rocks, GNR and the Crue then this book is for you. I must admit that it's a good story, but not up my alley. I was hoping for something with more underground music in it, although the author does try to scratch the surface of black metal, thrash metal and death metal but there is an air of contempt thrown at death metal and such brief information about black metal bands he might as well have just mentioned Venom and moved on. I'll give it 3 stars because it is a great story, but the author's obvious distaste for underground heavy metal had me feeling betrayed at this man proclaiming himself a \\"heavy metal addict\\" - Seb should have called this book \\"I was a glam rock junkie,\\" it would have been a much more accurate title."},{"Title":"The Message: Gods Revelation to Humanity","review":"This translation is a good one to be read and compared to more traditional and literal translations, expecially for the non-Muslim reader.

According to Kawabata, this longing increases with age, and one romances ghosts from the past, using the present to conjure up their memories from the depths of a forgetting mind.The leading story, \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" is among the best, most powerful Kawabata stories I have ever read. It shows an author in full command of his style, able to arouse a startling depth of emotion using a limited palette of words and scenery. The story is simple in conception, disturbingly erotic in nature, and stunning in execution. An old woman runs a brothel for impotent old men, housing unnaturally sleeping virgins who have no performance expectations of the old man, nor incriminations for their inabilities. The old men may lie with them, hold them and drink in their youth and beauty free from the hard reality of their own impotence. The sleeping girls will never know who was with them, or what was done. The only forbidden act is sex.The story is pure eros without sex, the desire of the impotent. The leading figure in the tale, Eguchi is \\"still able to function as a man,\\" unbeknownst to the brothel keeper. He knows what it is to desire more than the girls are willing to give, and the tension between his desires, the rules of the house, and the depressing reality of Eguchi's future impotence combine and take form under Kawabata's guiding hand. With each girl he sleeps next to, Eguchi wanders through his memories, remembering his youth and the girls he shared it with. Such a story can only come to one ending, and reality comes crashing into his fantasy. A stark and gripping tale.The remaining stories, \\"One Arm\\" and \\"Of Birds and Beasts,\\" suffer in the aftermath of the powerful \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties.\\" \\"One Arm\\" in particular is a disappointment, perhaps due to its too-surreal situation, and an old man who borrows a young woman's arm (given quite willingly) then proceeds to romance and fall in love with the limb. As with \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" this is eros without sex, desire without lust, but it lacks the honesty and fantasy/reality blend that makes the former story so strong.\\"Of Birds and Beasts\\" is good enough, and a better story than \\"One Arm.\\" Completely lacking in eroticism, this is another tale of an old man who seeks companionship, this time in all sorts of dogs and birds. His house is full with his menagerie, and he and his lone maid tend to the creatures with something less than love. Each new animal holds his attention for a few weeks at most, before it is filed away and forgotten in the background. Like \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" each new animal summons up memories, this time of the birds that the old man kept accidentally killing, then buying a new set. A sad and lonely story to be sure, but with the same emotional depth one expects from Kawabata.\\"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories\\" is worth buying for the lead story alone, which is widely considered amongst Kawabata's finest. Author Yukio Mishima (\\"The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea\\") considered it his personal favorite. Edward Seidensticker's translation is subtle and enjoyable, far superior to his somewhat heavy handed translation of \\"Snow Country.\\""},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"Every time I enter the realm of magical realism I feel as though there's no going back. The intense and sometimes disturbing descriptions in the stories make you think and reflect on the surrealism and powerful message behind the writing. Having read House of the Sleeping Beauties, I realize that no other category of literature is as profound as this one. I love all of the stories in this book, especially &quot;One Arm.&quot; This incredible and strange story awed me. There is a recurring theme in the stories: men's perverse obsession with women, particularly young girls. The message is very ambiguous, which means that you have to read between the lines in order to grasp the meaning. Yasunari Kawabata's work is very similar to Banana Yoshimoto's. These Japanese authors write stories filled with interesting language and mystical messages. I strongly suggest that you read this!"},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"Kawabata's magisterial short novel is a beautiful but sad reverie about life and death, young and old, sex and coming impotence.Sleeping with sleeping girls ('a deathlike sleep') was 'a fleeting consolation, the pursuit of a vanished happiness in being alive.''The sleeping beauties are for an old man the recovery of life, but also a sadness ... that called up a longing for death. The aged have death and the young have love, and death comes once, and love comes over and over again.'Kawabata's writing is subtle (the old man is tempted to breach the house rules) and intimistic (the descriptions of the ethereal bodies of the sleeping virgins).But, as the great Japanese writer Yukio Mishima expresses it perfectly in his introduction, this book is a pregnant reflection on 'the terror of lust by the approach of death.'A masterpiece."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"These strange and haunting stories of strange love are written with a disturbingly quiet and even hand. It's a genius read. Kawabata is the master of beautiful disaffection. His characters do not feel pain when you think they should, and one recoils, but is drawn back in to the stories. At the core of Kawabata's work is a pessimism about the value of life itself-even while the protagonists are involved in secret obsessions. Fascinating, beautifully written, haunting."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"these 3 short stories are masterpieces of twisted erotica and deep psychological insight as only kawabata could create. i never tire of kawabata's juxtaposition of the beauty of japan and the complex, tormented minds of his characters. why do japanese masterpieces like this always translate into such gripping english? seidensticker deserves high praise for rendering this work with such grace."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"This is an excellent story, although it is a little different from much of Kawabata's work. I gave this book four stars only because of the bizarre nature of the \\"other\\" stories. The main story is outstanding, written with wonderful detail and descriptive prose. It is an intriguing story that will hold your attention until the end. It is well worth purchasing the book for that story alone. Kawabata has a way of examining human feelings and exposing those elements that are common to all people. His characters often have me visualizing concrete individuals that I have known, including myself. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a touch of eroticism that stimulates both the higher and lower recesses of human nature. I would caution readers that the introduction by Yukio Mishima contains spoiler material, and should perhaps be read after reading the first story."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"In three short stories, Kawabata creates a world that is chilling, uniquely lonely and undoubtedly beautiful. He makes bizarre possibilities (parting with an arm for the night, for instance) seem part of the flow of normal life - outliers, perhaps, but part of the usual. Each story makes ones ears buzz and eyes widen. Masterpieces all."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"By all means read the stories when you're young. The exquisitely sparse prose, even in translation, takes on the plasticity of Japanese pottery.But the full impact of the book--especially the lead story--would only be felt with a little aging. Once, I would have considered the actions of the vampish old men despicable. Now I empathize with their quiet desperation.In House Of Sleeping Beauties, beauty and death lie side by side in the same room. Old Eguchi, the protagonist, resuscitates the remnants of his youthful sexuality in physically manipulating sleeping girls like inflatable dolls. The one-way communication both excites and repulses him.Eguchi and his horde of old companions descend upon the hapless girls with fangs creeping out from every pore of their skin. Like eunuchs, they substitute their impotence with sexual aggression of mind and spirit. The withered, rotting flesh of the old men press against the fragrantly smooth skin of the young girls, sucking life out of them through osmos-synthesis. It's an act drenched with desperation and vulgarity. But this clinging on to life at all costs is a basic fact of existence. Life feeds on life.Read the stories when you're older and feel a shiver run down your spine."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"I enjoyed the writing style, poetic and eerie. But the overall creepiness kinda got to me. I knew what I would get going into this, but I couldn't read the whole thing myself, just the first story. I would, however recommenced the book if for no other reason to push your boundaries."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"I was a little reluctant to begin this book, but proceeded anyway, and was blown away by its haunting beauty. Despite the premise, I did not find the title story at all erotic. While Eguchi likes to think of himself as not yet old and senile, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that his self-awareness is suspect. The old procuress who first ushers him to the crimson velvet room tells him, \\"listen to the waves. And the wind\\" and initially, when Eguchi feels the stirrings of passion, the wind roars and the waves crash. The reader questions, are they real, external? or internal? As the story progresses and Eguchi begins to be more at peace, the roaring wind and crashing waves give way to soft raindrops on a quiet sea, or gentle breeze and fallen leaves.I think it's a mistake to read this novella on a purely literal level. In my opinion, the story is less about an old man paying to sleep with naked girls than it is about a dying man coming to terms with death. By the end of the book, the reader may question whether the events were real, whether Eguchi is in a \\"house of sleeping beauties\\" or a \\"house of old men\\" (page 92), a nursing home where he hallucinates between daily medications.The novella succeeds beautifully on several levels, and the writing is masterful. Pay attention to details, to the 'petal dropping camellia' and the overwhelming red dahlias, to the seasons and the 'reproductions' on the wall.A beauty of a story if you can set aside your distaste for the premise on the surface."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"I had to read this collection for a class in college many many years ago. We actually only had to read one of the stories, and I ended up reading the entire thing cover to cover.At least once a year, I reread it to see how well someone can construct a world around a theme, in this instance, the theme was loneliness.Outstanding work."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"Kawabata is a great writer, but these three stories are not his best work in my opinion. The title piece, by far the longest in the book, is a sensitively-written story about a sad, kinky practice. I have no idea if it ever really existed. It has to do with old, impotent men who sleep (literally) with drugged, naked young women who know that they will have \\"customers\\", but not whom, and not what they will do. Actual sex is completely forbidden. Most people will not find this story erotic, though Mishima Yukio, the famous writer, calls it that in his introduction. The words &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;poetic&quot; seldom came to my mind, though &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot; did. The protagonist, Eguchi, sleeps with a number of different \\"beauties\\", each of whom reminds him of something in his past. Also, \\"there seemed to be a sadness in a young girl's body that called up in an old man a longing for death.\\" (p.59) The end is stark and brings out the inhumanity of such fantasies or such practices. If you like this sort of subject, introversion in a rather sick way, an attraction to body parts separate from the whole human, a peeping Tom version of eroticism----a style of ailing or macabre fascination similar to that found in Tanizaki Junichiro's \\"The Key\\" and \\"Diary of a Mad Old Man\\"----then this book is for you. The other two stories: \\"One Arm\\" and \\"Of Birds and Beasts\\", are also about such lonely, introverted men, (\\"autistic\\" comes to mind), with rather unpleasant themes. I did not like either one. I admit that the writing is good, the translation brilliant; it is just my own taste in subjects. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"When I red \\"beauty and sadness\\" I thought that It was the masterpiece of the japanese literature. I love Yasunari Kawabata, and I think that \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories\\" is the most poetic book I ever read. It's chilling, amazing, and when you will read it you will kidnapped from its incredible pathos."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"\\"House of Sleeping Beauties,\\" and the other short stories in this collection, all deal with the themes of idolization of virginity, degradation, fetishization of the body, and so forth. While this may be food for thought for early and even late 20th century readers, the 21st century reader might not get as much out of it. As with many modern Japanese works, Yasunari Kawabata transcends any cultural barriers by focusing on things that are alien in any settings, and themes that are universal to anyone who has ever struggled with any sort of \\"hang up\\" about [anatomy]."},{"Title":"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories","review":"...get away with it. Hmm...when I heard the argument of the story, about the house of the sleeping beauties (if you still don't know it read the reviews below), I was seduced by it, I thought it had a lot of potential, and that it could be something really good, refreshing and erotic. The result was not that far from my expectations, but didn't reach them either. The story is very predictable, offers no surprises, a little dull. The best part are Kawabata's descriptions on the female anatomy of the sleeping beauties, from the point of view of the main character, and old man who feels old, but still young enough to be embarrassed to attend such place. As I said, don't expect surprises, the best attitude to approach the book is to try to enjoy the author's descriptions. Don't expect much from the plot, nothing really happens. The other stories are alright, but not much more honestly.Enjoyable, but you won't miss much. Maybe I set my expectations to high because Yasunari Kawabata is a Nobel prize."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"If you enjoy space concepts and illustrations from the 50's and 60's, then this book is a must-have. If you're a baby-boomer, then chances are your vision of what exploration should look like was created by Chesley Bonestell. Once you've seen one of his paintings, the moon just doesn't look right anymore.This book is a great value. You'd have to collect dozens of out-of-print books to come close to the images collected in this one volume. In addition to the art reproductions, the story of Bonestell's life is well written and illustrated. He is a fascinating character in his own right, apart from his art. This book has the clear signs of a work done by authors who love their subject and know it well. If you have a soft spot for the romance of space, this book will go to the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"If you were about 10 years old in 1950, there was very likely a moment of absolute epiphany in your young life. In my case it occurred in the Junior High library in about 1950. From the shelf I pulled a large dark blue book about 8 by 11 inches in size. Even the end-papers were stunning, color plates of the surfaces of Mercury and Jupiter. But, thumbing through, I actually began to tremble when I got to facing pages 132 and 133! It is safe to say I have never recovered from the sight. I now have two copies of this book, one at home which I purchased in about 1951 and one in my office, which I purchased a few years ago. It was THE CONQUEST OF SPACE, by Chelsey Bonestell and Willy Ley.Who was this incredible artist, Chelsey Bonestell? Although I collected books illustrated by Bonestell throughout the 1950s and 1960s, I knew little about him personally until I found a trade paperback about him in the late 1970s or early 1980s, which gave a broad overview of his life and work.The present book is a greatly expanded version of that earlier work, 256 pages versus 133 in the trade paperback. Since that paperback came out, both Chelsey and his wife have died, but I think it is safe to say Chelsey's work is more appreciated than ever. Here you'll learn of his childhood, his work as an architectural renderer and movie matte painter, and his entry into space art at an age when most men are thinking of retirement. Chesley lived to be nearly a hundred, and was able to compare many of his painted visions of other worlds to actual photos taken by astronauts and robots. But none of these photos have the incredible artistic validity of Chelsey's own vision. As many have commented, where Chesley's vision disagrees with reality, it is generally Chesley's vision which is the better.For several generations, whenever anyone thought of space travel, or explorations of other worlds, it was Chesley Bonestell's vision they recreated in their mind's eye. Few artists have ever had or could ever hope to have such an impact.Whether you are an old fan or are discovering Bonestell for the first time, this is a rich feast of his art, which ranges from architectural renderings to recreations of long-vanished Spanish missions of California."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"I am among the hundreds of thousands -- perhaps millions -- of people who owe their lifelong interest in matters of astronomy and space science to a childhood discovery of the art of Chesley Bonestell. I remember vividly pawing through the pages of &lt;I&gt;The Conquest of Space&lt;/I&gt; at the age of about ten, my mouth open as I saw the marvels of the universe displayed.It was thus actually rather nerve-racking when I opened this new book for the first time. Could the reality of his art possibly match my childhood memories? Could all of that vividness and excitement have been magnified in my mind's eye over the succeeding decades? Was I in for a disappointment?I most certainly was not. If anything, the fabulous art inspired and excited me even more than it had way back then.And there's a lot of that art here -- a real feast of it, superbly reproduced. And I discovered as I kept turning the pages, hands quite literally trembling as I discovered treasure after treasure. Even more excitingly, I found that Bonestell had worked in areas of art I'd never suspected before: fabulous landscapes, stunning sketches ... I have perused many, many art books, but I've never before reacted quite as strongly as to this one.And it gets better. There's a long, beautifully written and utterly fascinating illustrated biography of Bonestell written by Ron Miller. It's almost as if one's getting two books in one.An earlier reviewer (who cannot spell &quot;Chesley&quot;) talked of this as if it were an expanded version of &lt;I&gt;The Conquest of Space&lt;/I&gt;. He was talking through his hat. This is a completely new book covering the entirety of Bonestell's career both visually and textually; it contains a big selection of illustrations from &lt;I&gt;The Conquest of Space&lt;/I&gt; (all the best ones), but they form only a small part of the huge and sumptuous collection on display here.This is a gorgeous book, and an extremely valuable piece of work -- the authors/compilers deserve the highest praise for having brought this treasure to us."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"\\"The Art of Chesley Bonestell\\" is an extremely high quality Science Fiction art collection that comes around once in a decade or two. The last Chesley Bonestell collection of this calibere, \\"Worlds Beyond: The Art of Chesley Bonestell\\", was published in 1983. Chesley Bonestell's art goes back to the golden age of Science Fiction of the late 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. His work was displayed on the covers of SF periodical magazines, SF paperback books, and Space Science books of that era. His style is realistic and his work is breathtaking! His concepts of other-worldly-visions are naturally realistic and have a Zen-like feeling of mystery to them. The color plates in this book are of awesome quality. I guarantee this book will increase in price, as the 1983 collection has. The 1983, \\"Worlds Beyond: The Art of Chesley Bonestell\\", sells for around $100 or more. Buy this 2001 book, \\"The Art of Chesley Bonestell\\" now, because it will only cost MUCH more after it goes out of print."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"I bought this book for the space art but found out there are many other excellent paintings to go along with them. Bonestell's art makes you want to be at the places he's painted except for places like New York under nuclear attack and ancient Egypt being bombarded by comets. The space art is incredible. I only wish I could get large prints of some of the pictures to frame them. I'm even considering buying another book and cutting out some of the pictures that are barely large enough to frame."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"Bonestell's other world paintings launched my lifelong interest in astronomy. Reading about, and seeing images of his work leading up to that era, which coincided with the early years of my own life, gave me a much better appreciation of the \\"Father of Modern Space Art\\". The book gave me ample substance for giving a talk on Bonestell's life to my astronomy club.The used book's condition was exactly as advertised. I couldn't have been more pleased!"},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"The first Chesley Bonestell cover that I ever saw was the one for the October, 1963 Anniversary issue of _Fantasy and Science Fiction_: the one depicting a cratered, moonlike planet orbiting a white and orange double star in the constellation Sagittarius. A year later, the October, 1964 _F&SF;_ cover by Bonestell depicted two rockets with ion drive engines emitting a blue glow as they passed the moon on the way to Mars. And the October, 1965 issue of _F&SF;_ featured the same two ships viewed from another angle heading away from Mars back to Earth. The incredible realism of these paintings literally changed the way that I looked at the world. Through the art of Bonestell, places like Mars and Saturn and Jupiter and beyond became as solid and detailed as my own back yard. I drew copies of these paintings with my set of colored pencils over and over again. But I knew that my drawings would never be as good. \\"How did he do it?\\" I wondered. \\"How did he do it?\\"None of these paintings, alas, are included in _The Art of Chesley Bonestell_ (2001), ed. Ron Miller and Frederick C. Durant III. But a lot of others are; and if none of them elicit a Burkean feeling of awe in you-- well, then, there's not an aesthetic bone in your body.My favorites are \\"Saturn as Seen from Dione\\" (154-155), \\"Mars as Seen from Phobos\\" (192), the end of the world landscape with the dead astronomers and the sun going nova (200-201), the dramatic \\"Descent to the Moon\\" (205), and the old-fashioned but awesome landscape of Jupiter (233). But ah, my friends and oh, my boon companions. There are also the sun and the planets painted to scale (172), the illustration of Velikovsky's _Worlds in Collision_ (173) which almost makes his pseudoscience credible, the Taj Mahal (170-171), the funeral on Mars (90), the stormy atmosphere of Beta Crucis (163), and the planet off the double sun of Beta Lyrae, with its stark rocks and red spiral sky. This last painting inspired me to write a sword and sorcery story set on that planet (which is now best forgotten). And there are more. Dozens more.There is a fair share of biographical information in the book. There are the movies that used Bonestell's art. (_Destination: Moon_ was only the tip of the iceberg.) There is information about the lovely Ruby Helder whom Bonestell painted and married. There is some information about why Bonestell got along with Arthur C. Clarke but not with Robert A. Heinlein. And there is useful information about Clarke, Willy Ley, and Robert S. Richardson who collaborated with Bonestell on some lovely and gracefully written astronomical textbooks. If you can, buy this book. If you can't, talk your librarian into ordering a copy."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the wonderful reviews here? This book sold new from Amazon in 2001 for forty bucks and look at it now. It's that way for all of Mr. Bonestell's books. I'll never get tired of viewing the wonderful views of planets, galaxies, suns and the list is \\"astronomical.\\" I had the privelege of corresponding with Mr. Bonestell about one of his paintings, not included in this book. His insight into why he portrayed the Milky Way Galaxy as it hung in the sky beyond a couple of cliffs over a well lit plane of snow was very interesting. I speak of the one on the cover of Fantasy and Science Fiction October 1970. Those depictions are the most pleasing for me. The classic Saturn as seen from Titan is of that form. Wouldn't you love to step beyond those mountains and walk onto that brightly lit snowy landscape and view Saturn and the terrain of Titan? Of coures we now know that Titan is covered by clouds, methane lakes and ammonia snow but that doesn't take away from that painting at all.I have several of Mr. Bonestell's books with those marvelous paintings and this book is a definite for Chesley Bonestell fans. Of course the book covers other art besides the space views. It shows us the well rounded ability of this artist. The book is well organized with paintings and text to go with it. This book is one I'll continue to cherish along with the other ones."},{"Title":"The Art of Chesley Bonestell","review":"Wow! Anyone who is a fan of Chesley's art needs this book.

Even more than that, it's a book biased toward New York which contains every implied slander of Texas that one can meld into a narrative about hackers. I like the description of MOD, and thought the authors did an excellent job of building up the character of these kids, but find that for the size of this book, it missed an absolute raft of important knowledge. Why do people hack? What, besides damaged egos, makes it thrilling to have forbidden knowledge? How could our society be so incompetent as to leave these giant security holes everywhere? And finally: what was the global hacking culture like, outside of the spacy little land of New York City? The boys from LOD are treated as props and their contributions ignored, which is infuriating to someone who is familiar with the goings-on in the computer underground at that time. Also, technical writing is not difficult, and while this book tries to stay non-technical, I have to ask \\"why?\\" There are interesting details which are overlooked and could have been conveyed in English. These authors do a credible job of buildup, but then hype a few incidents into some metaphor for cyberspace, and consequently halve the strength of their book. I would recommend this to people who cannot simply pick up a copy of \\"2600\\" magazine or \\"Phrack\\" and figure it out for themselves, but not to anyone who cares about the heart, soul or brains of hacker culture."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This is a fascinating journey into the world of international computer networks just before the birth of the Internet. While I do not fully understand the technical aspects of computer hacking in those days (much less now), my lack of knowledge did not hinder my understanding of the tale woven by these two fine authors. Good and evil are drawn with muddy lines, and the boundaries between curiosity and destruction are hard to define. I wavered between sympathy for the hacker protagonists and sympathy for those they hacked. In the end, I felt a little cheated by the sympathetic slant the story took. I think I would have more feeling for those boys if I could have seen how they changed and matured once the whip came down. Paul is the only one I feel could have actually turned himself around and made good, but perhaps the others truly did so. The book was published nearly ten years ago.

This was one of several books on the 1980s-1990s hacker scene that I recently read, but thus far I consider it the weakest. Initially I found it interesting, but as the book progressed I found the characters increasingly boring and shallow. Overall I felt the authors glamorized the lives of kids who expressed their teenage frustrations through digital means. The MOD story may sound novel to some readers, but having lived through the period in the book I can say this is one story of many that could be told.Other digital outlaws from the same time are far more interesting. It's probably no accident that Kevin Mitnick is still active, or that Cliff Stoll just recorded a Webcast on \\"cyberwar\\" at Harvard. Characters from the so-called \\"Great Hacker War\\" between LOD and MOD exist mainly in Wikipedia pages or books like this. You can safely skip reading Masters of Deception and instead read one of the other hacker history books I've reviewed recently. If you have a deep interest in peering inside the mind of teenage phone phreaks in New York and Texas, you might like MOD. It is ironic that no book titled Legion of Doom exists!"},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This book definitely caters to a certain type of audience. It is written in a very fluffy, personal style, although it does contain some technical jargon. I enjoyed both the fluff and the jargon, but readers who would prefer it to be all of one or the other will be disappointed.The characters are very well portrayed (I use the term &quot;characters&quot; because the book is written almost in a fictional style), although I sometimes questioned where reality ended and the author's influence began. Each character is given a few pages of background, helping us to identify with who they really are and trying to define their motives.My only objection is that the story tends to jump from one viewpoint to another without much of a bridge between the sections. I suppose this is because the characters come and go, and because the plot isn't terribly focused, but it makes it hard to follow what's going on.Regardless, anyone who has ever had dreams of being a hacker, or understands (or wants to understand) the compulsions that really drive them, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"What can I say?

Many attributes were exagerated and also some of the timeframe is off. It does make for a terribly nice story howerver. And the writers were justfied in displaying it this way, Most of the public would not be able to enjoy it if it was not written this way. Also neighther Alan nor Julio'z true representation throughout the trial was show, nor was alan's representation in the key incidents which the judge cited as being instrumental in the jail sentencings of john,mark,paul and eli listed. Why would that be important? because you see the true pepetrators wernt sentanced at all. Also the Secret Service wasent not adiquetly portrayed throughtout the book, and jason's particular involvment with tymnet was not clearly shown. It is a trajik shame that the government and our system felt it nececcary to punish thease kids in this way but thats life.

As I expected, my impression from reading this book was that it is yet another &quot;get something on the shelves while [fill in the blank] is still a hot topic&quot; release. It was because of this that I did not enjoy the first few pages very much. The authors come off as not really knowing anything at all about the subject on which they are writing. I would also say they could have used a good editor. By the second chapter, however, I decided to stop criticizing the writing and the exploitive topic, and try to just enjoy the story for what it is, light-hearted fluff. I did.

Factual and detailed. The Masters of Deception is more a feelgood fuzzy kind of sociological study, light on facts and correlations. Not one to read a second time."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Back in 1990 a small gang of telephone hackers managed to bring down the entire AT&amp;T long lines network through what was essentially very crude hacking: They found the login and password for a major AT&amp;T switch, and they shut it down. In terms of technical skill, this is about as sophisticated as disabling a car by stealing the battery. But at the time, when AT&amp;T was looked on as the rock Gibralter, it was shocking that a group of kids could manage to bring it down so easily.Since then, both phone switch technology and the skills of hackers have increased, phone and computer technology has exploded in dozens of new wired and wireless services, and the Web has replaced the phone company as the target of many a youthful discordian. Given that, the tales of teenagers poking about in telephone switches and wide-open databases is pretty boring.The real heart of the story of &quot;Masters&quot; isn't the technology, of course, but the sociology and the personalities of the teens involved. When this story first broke, the players were portrayed as young geniuses who had mastered an arcane technology and beaten the giant phone company at their own game. The truth is somewhat less impressive and less interesting. None of these kids were geniuses, although they were for the most part pretty bright. Most of their hacks involved diving in dumpsters for technical manuals or posing as AT&amp;T employees to gain access and information. What they were doing was as much con games as anything, and what they did with the information they gleaned wasn't terribly sophisticated or imaginative. Nor were they themselves particularly sophisticated in hiding their tracks- even after being charged with crimes they continued hacking away at other computer systems.In the end, there really isn't much to tell. A few teens and post teens get prison sentences. And no one seems to have learned very much."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Great book on an interesting hacker case.

My aunt bought me this book for Christmas, and I put it down only once over the course of two days. Masters of Deception brought to me, a teenager in the computer age, a wonderfully vivid description of what it was like to be a pioneer in the world of the Internet. With 100,000,000 people on the net or however many there are now, companies have become so security aware that adventures like the ones in the book require an amazing amount of expertise. Not to mention how much damage we can do now that the computing sector makes so much money. But the point is that through this book we're able to relive the experience, with all of the wonder and naive excitement that comes with exploring new territory, and we don't have to damage anything. The book was technically vivid, emotionally engaging, and just plain fascinating."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"I read this after reading Clifford Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg which is a much better book on the same subject matter. Stoll is just a smart and observant graduate student who simply tries to tell his story accurately. The 2 authors of Masters of Deception are apparently professional writers and they spend too much time trying to liven up what is essentially an account of high school and college kids playing on computers. You get the feeling they writing this with a screenplay in mind. The book is filled with cliches, bad metaphors, contrived rhetorical questions: \\"Destroy people's lives? Make them look like saints? Is this what hackers do?\\" There is very little interesting technical info and much of what there is is dumbed down and often wrong. The discussion of tymnet in chapter 13 is completely off. They obviously don't understand it. Cuckoo's Egg is much better and even the Littman books are better books on the same topic."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This book is essentially a slightly jumbled, chronologically organized log of all the events and occurences that lead to the hacking scandal of the early 1990's and the war between MOD and LOD, two rival hacker groups.The book begins with an introduction to all these hacker kids, and continues on through all their hacking exploits, life occurences, and various important events leading up to the cyberspace war, and computer law scandal.The book is cliched in some ways, and attempts to answer the question of what a hacker really is, and what a hacker really does. In the end the book ends up being a bit of a cautionary tale.None of the boys' deepest feelings or psyches are really explored, and it really seems that if they ever get below the surface to show what they're really thinking, it's very brief. In the end it seems a bit like reading a log of events.All in all the book is informative, and there are few, if any, technical mistakes (not that there is much technical dialogue to begin with).I urge you to buy this book, simply to be informed, and if you're up for some light reading on the subject, it's likely you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"I'm sorry. I don't know where that title came from. This is one of those books that really sheds some insight into the mind of the phone phreakers and the 'hacker' subculture. Kids, bored, learn everything there is to know about the phone system, social engineering, and various other things.Because they are young, they do cool sutff with their knowledge, and because the world doesn't have much of a sense of humor, they get into trouble.A very interesting read about the people who would be Internet Consultants and web designers today, but didn't have the material to work with at the time. Proto-web as it were. If you ever wondered about what the online world looked like before it was the web, read this book. It's great fun."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"What could have been a very boring and dry account of the daily affairs of teenager hackers was turned into an insightful and entertaining book with serious social value. The way the story was presented kept every character vital and kept the reader informed on what the overall picture was. The way in which it switched perspective every chapter or so also kept the plot line fresh. It stayed true to the ideals of all involved, although at times it slanted a bias towards the young pranksters, and &quot;Masters of Deception&quot; also succeeded in conveying what hacking is really all about. The summary at the end also provided one hell of a thought to chew on. Actually it gave you several, and that is quite possibly the most redeeming thing about this book. Not only is it a fun read, but it provokes you to think about the social questions surrounding what has become a major issue in the 90s."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"If you have ever walked into a computer store and you see a bunch of kids hanging around talking it's likely you have no idea what they are saying because they are using terminology that many don't know.

It also teaches you a lot more stuff about computers, but you have to read closely to pick up on it."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"If you have a passing interest in computers this book will solidify it.

Douglas BakerMASTERS OF DECEPTION: THE GANG THAT RULED CYBERSPACEBy Michelle Slatalla and Joshua QuittnerHarperCollins Publishers, IncorporatedNew York, New YorkCopyright 1995225 pages\\"They believe in the hacker ethic: Thou shalt not destroy.\\" With this oft repeated refrain, Slatalla and Quittner unfold the exploits of a hacker gang, the self styled Masters of Deception (MOD). Briefly, a group of intelligent kids in the early 1990's, with cheap computers and a lot of time on their hands break into sensitive computer systems all over the country. While most people were asleep, these teens were accessing and learning how a variety of high tech computers controlling telecommunications operate. MOD's most notable intrusions were the telephone company and TRW, the company that keeps data on everyone's credit. Of course, they were not supposed to be there and were technically committing a crime. Their motive was primarily a desire to learn and the bragging rights associated with \\"hacking\\" some company's computer system, then sharing its secrets with friends. They were only limited by their imaginations and their ability to find a receptive computer accessible via a modem. The morals of \\"cyberspace\\" is: if a computer is vulnerable to penetration, then it is fair game for the hacker. The hacker is actually doing the victim a favor by exposing their weakness (assuming he victim even realizes they have been penetrated). Once the phone company realized it was being \\"hacked\\" it did not take the intrusion lightly. After a lengthy investigation that included the phone company, the Secret Service, and the New York City District Attorney's office, among others, the ring leaders were caught. They eventually all pled guilty to their intrusions and even spent time in federal penitentiaries.Slatalla and Quittner tell a good story, focusing on the lives, thoughts, and motives of the kids in MOD. The authors frequently repeat the hacker ethic juxtaposed to some of MOD's deeds: a crashed computer system, phone and computer harassment of enemies, free long distance phone service, and finally a plan to sell confidential credit information gleaned illegally from TRW. Unfortunately, the authors fail to examine the significance of these actions. It is not the damage these kids did, which some have argued did not warrant the penalties they received, but the questions implicitly raised about the future of electronic crimes. Where do we as a society draw the line between harmless pranks by overzealous teenagers fascinated by sophisticated computer systems and serious computer crimes that do real financial damage or seriously breech the privacy of citizens? In an era where computer systems control more and more of our daily lives, this question becomes paramount. It is naive, at best, to believe that all hackers are out only to learn and to play harmless games of one-upmanship with large companies and other hackers. While the authors frequently allude to this important question they never even attempt to answer it."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This is a fun read, but as with the Hafner and Markoff book, reader beware. Erik Bloodaxe, one of the major characters in the book and my friend as well as a trusted security engineer, inscribed this book as follows: &quot;Robert, Hope you enjoy this classic example of 3rd rate speculative fiction. So much for journalistic integrity, eh? /s/. I also know Phiber Optic, and tried to keep him out of jail, even offered to house him and hire him on parole, but to no avail. This is a good story that crosses over frequently into speculative reporting, but it may be better for that, capturing some of the spirit of competition that exists between very talented hackers who by and large do no harm."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Actually this is a great book about the hacker sub-culture, indeed one of the bests I have ever read. This book describes very well the whole story and social aspects of New York City hackers but fails when dealing with technical aspects or lacks it. I can afirm it's a good book for people who are intersted to know how poor guys in Queens, NY, rised from nothing to create one of the most notorious hacker gang ever and to improve knowledge about the late 80's and early 90's american hacker scene."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This book does a very good job of stating most of the facts surrounding the two famous hacker groups MOD and LOD. It adds a hint of drama to try and keep the reader but is basically a description of events. I thought it was well written and knowing most of what went on back then could vouch for the books accuracy. In terms of how each of the characters involved thought, the writer threw in their own opinions, but the timeline of events was pretty much on the money. If you are interested to read a bit about how some of the more well known historic events about hacking, I suggest you read this book. I found it enjoyable throughout its entirety."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"The Masters of Deception is a novel that makes you realize how kids can get together and become unified for something 'unethical.' Each person in their group had their own 'illegal' specialties and they used them all to their full potential. They had a hacking army with an unlimited supply of artillery ready for war. The death of computer systems were the casualties that the world saw. Phiber Optik who was the leader put together a dynamic team from all over New York. When they reached their zenith, no one could touch them. The book was really infomative on the information collected about the group and they gave a lot of good and valuable information to me. This book was well written and the way that the material was put into the story displayed an inner feeling on the subject. MOD will give you the opportunity to see a very capable group of hackers do what they do best for a living."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"After reading Cuckoo's Egg, this book isn't even in the county let alone the ball park. Not only could I put it down, but I had to psych myself up to open it. It was a painfully boring read and glorifying of criminals. There were very bright individuals, but criminals nonetheless. This book did NOT convey that message."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"This is really not a bad book. One problem that it does have is that it gets you into a story for a few pages and then leaves you hanging for 10 more until it returns back for its finish. So what I'm saying is that the flow is not there! Overall I felt that it did a pretty good job of getting the story across. I would defiantely plunk down the cash for it as opposed to &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot; by Bruce Sterling which Royally Sucked! It babled on for the first 95 pages before getting to anything juicy."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"I have bought so many books over the years on hackers, hacking and everything else. I have to say, this is one of the few books that knows what they are talking about. I like the fact that they took the time to do their homework before writing some Hacker novel that comes nowhere close to the real ethics of hacking. Hell, I'm gonna read it again now....."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Not a bad book on the whole. The story is interesting enough, but the author seems to take juvenile spats and revenge way too seriously. A litany of 14 year teenagers conversations (Woah, no way, serious?, cool, etc, etc) is really not that exciting. A real light read."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"For those of you who logged into BBS networks back in the day, this book is for you. This was when hacking was noble, and you could actually learn UNIX via phone company switching computers. Now you can buy a copy of Linux at CompUSA and even view the source code!! Today malicious hacking is pretty stupid.."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"I read this book to see if authors really did understand the concept of &quot;hacker wars&quot;.

It comes highly recomended from my group,The UnderGround Elite."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Read this in high school and it was one of several books that sparked my interest in the world of computers and IT security. From social engineering to straight-up physical penetration the battles of MOD and LOD are legendary. A great book if you're interested in how hacking moved from the old technology of the 1980s and 90s (dialup) and where it was perceived to be heading. What I think makes this book especially appealing is the stories about the kids themselves. You get a good sense of who they are and how they fell into this world."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"A well written, entertaining, seemingly balanced account on the events surrounding some of the first major computer crime prosecutions. Some of the information may seem a little dated, as the book was written in 1995 when the internet was a novelty more than the omni-present utility it is now. This is one of the few books that seems to present a \\"fair and balanced\\" (to borrow a term from our friends at a certain cable-tv network) view of all the players involved (the \\"hackers\\"; the phone company techs, and the various prosecutors/agents of varied government agencies.)It is a quick read, and will keep your attention, no matter what your level of technical saavy. Give it a chance."},{"Title":"Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace","review":"Of course not all details would make a print. I just finished this book a half hour ago.

Where principals, teachers and students set their expectations for their small society has everything to do with successful education and having fun at school.If you are an educational professional, parent or student, this will give you lots of ideas to improve the culture of your school (or your own organizatons)."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"The book is about harnessing the power of school culture to create a climate and ethos of growth for our children, where every teacher can make a difference. From their broad repertoire of leadership skills and experience, Terrence E. Deal and Kent D. Peterson presents School culture as the strong predictor of educational success and reform. At the heart of a school's culture are its mission and purpose. Without ritual and ceremony, any culture will wither and die. &quot;Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.&quot; History not only shapes the present, but they also outlines the future. Hence, we need to celebrate history, and recount stories of success and growth as we cruise along. Culture is enshrined not only in persons, but also in architecture and artifacts. The author believes that by combining these and other elements of culture, we are creating a cohesive school identity.The book is replete with inspiring stories about people and events, with which one can easily identify on various occasions. That makes it a compelling work. The anecdotal responses to success and failure, positive and toxic culture in the schools makes this a very relevant book."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with the content of this book. It is well thought out and concises. There are lots of examples of the points being raised. Everyone should read this book in particular educators who are or desire to be administrators of schools. Parents who are actively involved with their child's education would benefit as well. Superb and well done. If only I could write as well."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"This book was used in a graduate class I was attending while pursuing a Master of School Administration degree. It is very easy to read and is a resource that every school administrator should have. Schools are a community and have a culture all their own. The authors provide a wealth of information that enables one to understand what &quot;school culture&quot; is and how to build a positive school culture. I highly recommend this book to anyone who works in a school or other organization that serves children and adolescents."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"In Shaping School Culture: the Heart of Leadership, Terrence Deal and Kent Peterson illustrate that nothing is more important in schools than culture. They believe that school culture is vital to the success of schools. The authors state that \\"the culture of an enterprise plays the dominant role in exemplary performance\\" (p. 1). At first, I was skeptical. I did not believe that culture was more important than structure, strategy, goals, or management. I believed that culture was something that played a role in atmosphere and changed from year to year with the staff. I quickly came to realize that culture is the heart of schools and is a stable element.The reason I was skeptical is because I did not believe that my school had much of a culture. I thought about a few traditions and pondered the high turnover among staff. This book opened my eyes to the fact that our school does have a relatively strong culture and that many of the changes that were made were based on our core norms.In the first part of the book Deal and Peterson examine the components of school culture including values, beliefs, assumptions, and norms (p. 26).The authors expand upon this and include rituals, ceremonies, stories, architecture, artifacts, and logos in school culture. The authors use examples to distinguishing positive cultures from toxic cultures. This was interesting to me because I could see that the last two principals at our school did a great job of building school culture. They had revised our school motto, mission statement, and value statement. They had established rituals and ceremonies. They had started programs that included year-long rituals and ceremonies. These were all positive steps towards a better school culture. I was also better able to understand the toxic cultures within our school and how these subcultures create negative school environments for the students and the staff.The second part of the book shows principals how to create a positive culture in their schools. The key components discussed are examining, reflecting, and reflection on events that have shaped culture in their schools. The final and most crucial component for establishing school culture is executing a plan of action. The last few chapters of the book are filled with advice on how to improve school culture such as developing student-centered mission and value statements, building upon established traditions and values, recruit staff that share values, and sustain core norms (p. 116).The authors forced me to think about the relationships between school rituals, artifacts, ceremonies, symbolism and our school culture. I realized that our school has a great foundation on which to base school culture. I enjoyed this book because it challenged my previously held beliefs about my school. I was also impressed with the author's strategy for changing school culture and the components they outlined for a positive school culture (p. 117).After reading this book I believe that nothing is more important about a school than its culture."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"I found this to be an excellent resource for any educational leader who is looking to create a positive school environment. The authors give many real life examples of leaders who changed the culture of their school and detail how they went about making this change. There are many practical ideas that any leader could begin incorporating right away.In addition, the book is well written. This is not &quot;heavy&quot; reading, but nonetheless I have found myself returning to it time and time again for ideas and inspiration.If you are wondering how one person could possibly make a difference in a school, this book will help show you the way."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"Deal &amp; Peterson recognize that school culture are those values, activities and habits that persist with in the day to day life of schools. They discuss the range of cultures from those that are toxic to the learning process to such self-improving cultures wherein even the most challanged learners thrive. Through the use of illustrative stories, the complexities of school culture and its power to contribute the national wellbeing are examined. Several themes emanate. They include respect for learning, learners, teachers, parents and the larger community.The essence of leadership is variously portrayed as themes of vision, committment and consistent action. The unstated thesis is 1. perceive, 2. behave, and 3. become. It is a clarion call to reestablish school culture as the central issue to school reform."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"Deal and Peterson provide an insightful look into the complex world of school cultures. The concepts of culture are presented in informative stories that cause the reader to be reflective of the cultures that they exist in and help to create.School leaders will find the information given both beneficial and valuable.

The authors offer perceptive thoughts to help leaders reach rewarding achievements within their schools."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"This book is a must read for any individual who wishes to create positive change within a school environment. It is written with clarity and wit, appropriate for any agent of change within the field of education. All who have experienced serving in an administrative capacity for a school district or educational service agency will quickly relate and definitely benefit from both the information and insight that is provided by Terrence E. Deal and Kent D. Peterson. In particular, principals will find this book to be an invaluable resource in understanding the potency of school culture and how it relates to leadership techniques, issues, and decisions. Deal and Peterson uncover the impact and consequence of school culture with lucid and powerful examples that support their perspective while entertaining the reader. They unravel the intangible mystery of why those that choose to lead seldom make any real progress toward credible and sustainable changes in our schools.The functions and impact of the values, belief-systems and norms within school buildings are discussed and explained in terms of their hierarchy in the creation of positive and negative school cultures. The authors provide a multitude of scenarios of actual school environments that lucidly illustrate the numerous \\"hidden\\" messages that provide the infrastructure and mindsets of school culture. Surprisingly, many of the determinants of school culture will provide the reader with instant (and many times humorous) personalized images drawn from their own experiences.Principals and administrators who read this book will inevitably view their own schools with a refined and newly directed perspective. In addition, they will view their role as a leader within the context of culture. The authors force a leader to consider the dynamics of culture through exploration of school rituals, artifacts, ceremonies and the implications of their symbolism. The authors map out a strategy for change using the regularly ignored mundane routines of the school as the underpinnings for reshaping school culture.This book will \\"change\\" and broaden the way any leader comprehends \\"change\\"."},{"Title":"Shaping School Culture: The Heart of Leadership (Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"I must say that when I saw the option to buy a use book I wasn't sure if that's an offer I was willing to take up but at the time I never had enough money and I needed the book so I decide to take the use one and to my surprised the book looked like it just came out of the store.

I am looking forward to reading more of your work."},{"Title":"Every Goodbye Ain't Gone","review":"Being in love is one thing, but being totally obsessed is another. We see this clearly in Brey's debut title, EVERY GOODBYE AIN'T GONE. Tori Maxwell, the main character, is in love with Spencer, yet she knows deep down he isn't respecting their relationship. She denies what she suspects, ignores his flaws, and convinces herself all is well. Unfortunately, she catches him with another woman and she has to wake up and let him go. After doing so, she meets Greyson who appears to be the opposite of Spencer. He loves and respects her, yet it's not quite enough for Tori and her thoughts lay with Spencer.Spencer has decided that enough is enough with Tori being \\"mad\\" over his mistakes and sets out to get her back, by any means necessary. He refuses to accept the fact that she doesn't want to be with him and falls back on his criminal past to get what he wants.EVERY GOODBYE AIN'T GONE focuses on obsessive love and the consequences that accompany it. The characters had their issues, and sadly, they knew what they were. They simply couldn't make the committed effort to do what they needed to do to fix them. Brey writes an interesting story, but I failed to connect with the characters, especially Tori. She was a little too dumb and flighty for my liking. At times, too much was going on and some editorial work could've been done to make things flow a bit smoother and even out the pace. Luckily, the message of obsessive love and the end results can not be missed. Brey also does a good job of closing the book out with a suspenseful bang.Reviewed by Tee C.

I found the book very delightful despite a few words that were misused but this was very minor. Also the title did not grab me but that goes to say read the synopsis before you make your decisions.

However, on weekends, the small town is hopping with tourists who want to leave the big city to visit nature. Jonathan Stoller bought a weekend place on the isolated Lily Lane. His only neighbors are former rock star Adam Quinn, Rachel Brydie, and her three daughters (Skye, Bliss, and Astrid). They dwell in the secluded estate isolated by the messianic Adam and her abusive mother.The seventeen years old Astrid and the decade older Jonathan begin a relationship. Adam dies and the three sisters tend to his corpse, expecting him to rise again. However, her mother is missing and their home is set on fire. Astrid, a true innocent, turns to her lover when she needs to know if Adam will remain dead. Adam immediately calls the police. Senior Detectives Tessa Vance and Steve Hayden investigate the death. They immediately find the atmosphere surrounding the Brydie home forbidding and evil. Though some people feel Adam killed himself, the law enforcement officials have some doubts. Their digging will lead to the discovery of SOMETHING WICKED on Lily Lane.Jennifer Rowe's narrative provides a Poe-like atmosphere that permeates the story line. The audience never knows who is victim and who is villain until the end. The mystery is an entertaining puzzler that comes together one piece at a time. The explosive finale is unexpected but plausible and will surprise those readers who pride themselves in solving a who-done-it. Though not for action-packed readers, the gothic-like SOMETHING WICKED will provide full pleasure to fans of a simmering well-written tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Something Wicked","review":"In recent years I've strayed some from the mystery genre, finding them all a bit to repetetive for my tastes. Believe me, my brief sojourn has ended with Tessa Vance. Jennifer Rowe puts you right inside her head, breaking up the writing with light dashes of stream of conciousness. (now don't start getting horrific visions of Faulkner, these books are perfectly coherent :) Tessa's partner Steve provides the perfect solid balance to her ferocious energy and amazingly lethal mind, sometimes you get the impression she could just spontaniously combust with all that focused intensity. I liked her immensley (sp?) and the mystery's that Ms. Rowe comes up with are astounding, with twists and turns that keep you not only running in mental circles but amazingly enough, figure eights! ;) My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that Jennifer Rowe is Australian and all the &quot;mates&quot; thrown in can get kind of annoying but soon your too caught up in the story to even care. In short, if you love a good mystery, facinating characters (major and minor) that stray from the norm, I highly recomend this book.

The key factor is all of this was a book review in \\"Esquire\\" by the legendary Dorothy Parker whose description of \\"Daniel White for the Greater God,\\" far and away the best story in this collection, deserves repeating: \\"It is without exception the best presentation I have ever seen of present racial conditions in the South and of those who try to alleviate them.\\" When I was teaching \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" I had my students read Ellison's story, to give them some idea of what things were like in the South before they were born. It is, simply put, a short story that makes the purchase of this entire volume well worth the money.For the record, or more specifically for those of you trying to find Ellison stories you have not read in other collections, here are the short stories you will find within these pages: \\"Final Shtick,\\" \\"Gentleman Junkie,\\" \\"May We Also Speak?\\", \\"Daniel White for the Greater Good,\\" Lady Bug, Lady Bug,\\" \\"Free With This Box!\\" (a personal favorite), \\"There's One on Every Campus,\\" \\"At the Mountains of Blindness,\\" \\"This is Jackie Spining,\\" \\"No Game for Children,\\" \\"The Late, Great Arnie Draper,\\" \\"High Dice,\\" \\"Enter the Fanatic, Stage Center,\\" \\"Someone is Hungrier,\\" \\"Memory of a Muted Trumpet,\\" \\"Turnpike,\\" \\"Sally in Our Alley,\\" \\"The Silence of Infidelity,\\" \\"Have Coolth,\\" \\"RFD #2,\\" \\"No Fourth Commandment,\\" and \\"The Night of Delicate Terrors.\\"Since we are talking Harlan Ellison there is really no reason to engage in any further advocacy. I am either preaching to the converted or spitting into the wind. There is no middle ground with Ellison. Consequently the point here is to be informative. \\"Gentleman Junkie\\" is a collection of dark stories dealing more with the real world than you usually find in Ellison's more famous works of speculative fiction. These are stories about racial prejudice, drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, anti-Semitism, alienation, violence and other fun topics. Consequently, these are tales best consumed one at a time, because to sit down and read this book cover to cover would be a bit much for most souls."},{"Title":"Gentleman Junkie and Other Stories of the Hung-Up Generation","review":"I haven't read this book in two years, maybe more, but it still stands out in my mind. First, it is the book that got Ellison reviewed in Esquire by Dorothy Parker, quite something for a paperback original at the time of its original release. And second, it contains the story &quot;Daniel White, For the Greater Good,&quot; which still stands out in my mind, after years, as one of Ellison's most powerful (and neglected, given its power) pieces of short fiction."},{"Title":"The Wild Kid","review":"I loved this book, Sammy, a mentally handicapped kid runs off to find the stealer of his bike which he forgot to lock up when he comes across - or rather falls across - Kevin or &quot;K-Man.&quot; At first Kevin is extremely nasty to Sammy, calling him dumb and treating him like rotten you-know-what but as the days go by, Kevin starts opening up and letting Sammy into his tight ring of friends consisting of himself. This is a great story about friendship, trust and understanding, a must read for anyone who wants to try something a little new."},{"Title":"The Wild Kid","review":"The Wild Kid was something of a strange story for me to read. For starters I was slightly hesitant to read a story centered on a slightly \\"retarded\\" boy named Sammy. I have nothing against them but I assumed the storyline would make a big deal out of it and overdramatize the tweenager with Down's syndrome. To my elegant surprise the storyline doesn't even go out of its way to mention he has this \\"problem\\" save for maybe three times in the entire span of the book, which is something I was very thankful for.That aside, I have to say I really enjoyed The Wild Kid; While the story itself is pretty straightforward -- almost to the point where it feels nothing really happens -- in what the side panel of the cover describes so adeptly. The way the author describes Sammy's escapades through the forest in search of his bike only to end up hostage of \\"feral\\" young man named Kevin is truly something that makes the wheels of the imagination turn.At first, you want Sammy to run away because you really don't trust Kevin (especially with the way he treats the boy at first). However, as the story progresses you find yourself growing used to the harshness of Kevin's character and his strange interaction with the overly trusting Sammy. The only problem I think I have with The Wild Kid is the paragraphs are constructed in a sort of elementary way, for a younger audience to be honest. But all in all, I enjoyed reading this.

Our youth need to better understand and respect special needs children, and this book helps that process. Sammy, the main character with Down's, portrays the struggles of his disability while also showing his strengths and sameness with other children his age. While I believe this novel has merit, I also have two complaints. One, the plot is not believable - - possibly probable, but not believable. For example, Sammy climbs a cliff only a professional rock climber could tackle. I realize authors may do this to create suspense, but Mazer carried it a little far in my opinion. Secondly, this novel also touches on the idea of abuse, a worthy topic for children. However, this conflict is not resolved. The abused boy, Kevin, had run away from home and he is still a runaway when the book ends. That is a serious issue to leave unresolved for children.

The writing is crisp and thought-provoking and the research is exhaustive.After reading Leebaert, it is a little easier to see how the &quot;sins of the fathers&quot; have laid the foundation for the world we are currently living in. The Osama bin Ladens of the world were spawned from the cold warriors and Quixotic missions that Leebaert so excellently profiles.The reading is sometimes difficult, and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure I understood where Leebaert was trying to go. Even so, it remains one of my top 20 favorite books."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"this book is full of facts that never saw the light of day in a class room. my mother in law got it and I read it and then bought it for my husband to read....we all enjoyed it and have had many conversations regarding it."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"The book, The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Shapes Our World, maintains a focus on the half-century's flow of events. Two recurrent themes are non-support of allies for US overseas efforts, and disparaging the CIA's inability to mold information into proper intelligence. The primary, often unstated theme is lost opportunities of paths not taken. From the Introduction, (pp. xi - xiv):\\"The price of victory...was levied during the most creative half century ever...in which countless opportunities fostered by...new awareness of scientific power were waiting to be pursued. ....\\"...the price of victory goes far beyond the dollars spent on warheads, foreign aid, soldiers, propaganda, and intelligence. It includes...time wasted, talent misdirected, secrecy imposed, and confidence impaired. ....\\"...the country was starting to speed into a future in which it could have used its resources...not deployed to fund a fleet here or an embezzled subsidy to some tropical gangster there, but to support the development of improved food strains, better means of teaching, a sleek national transport system, or an economic momentum that might have persisted after the 1960s boom. ....\\"....\\"Ultimately the cost of America's effort was felt as a waste of spirit.\\"Privileging effectiveness over morality shows author Derek Leebaert also suffering from the Cold War's ultimate cost:\\"...an entire chapel of influential voices in Europe tried to turn military weakness into a virtue, attempting to seize the moral high ground always available to the ineffectual,\\" (p. 473).Polished by wit and enhanced with metaphorical argument and illustrations from popular culture, the writing frequently requires re-reading to comprehend the divergent flows of ideas. By the end of the book the pattern of wittiness, with the aggression latent in all humor, has helped to reveal his biases.The book repeatedly details US collaboration with corrupt and inhumane governments, criticizing the CIA and the \\"abominable actions\\" of both it and those regimes. It is less well organized-and explicit-on these particulars than Blum's Killing Hope, but offers more comprehendible patterns-organized into historical periods rather than into Blums's country-based format. Leebaert offers greater depth though reliance on primary and knowledgeable sources; Blum's ferreting out sympathetic political understanding primarily from news reports is impressive.The tone changes between the treatment of events toward which the author can look back on as history, and the more subjective and ideological treatment of those in which he was involved as participant or observer. Overall, Leebaert gives a favorable image of vigorous post-war economic rectitude, diminished by the repeated errors of the many misguided public servants in governments of the day. He sees these as caused by rhetorical and theoretical thinking rather than direct perception of situations.One serious imbalance is his presentation of the cruel public treatment of parents of a slain Vietnam war veteran (p. 356), yet only a passing mention of war crimes by US Vietnam war participants. He states, \\"There is no evidence that the My Lai atrocity was repeated elsewhere, which is surprising in such a war,\\" (p. 410). A diligent historian could reconsider in light of the transcript, book, and film of the 1971 Winter Soldier Investigation; the October 2003 Toledo Blade newspaper documentation of atrocities in the central Vietnam highlands; Lifton on the psychology of Vietnam war veterans; and generally the information on Vietnam in Charny's Toward the Understanding and Prevention of Genocide.Regarding 9-11's use of hijacked airliners as weapons, Leebaert states that the President and Secretary of Defense, \\"...each told the nation that no one had imagined the prospect...,\\" (p. 617). Yet the topic was known to the US intelligence community since at least January 1995 when Al-Qaeda's plans for Project Bojinka to implement \\"the prospect\\" were discovered by Philippine police. Again in February of that year FBI agents were told of such a plot by the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and at the individual's 1997 bombing trial the strategy was discussed, as documented in Ahmed's The War on Freedom.Though repeatedly disparaging post WW-II theoretician George Kennan, Leebaert doesn't call for an end to his dictum to maintain preeminence over the world's resources through military force. Rather he diverts attention by voicing a belief in the American myth of itself as a justly-emulated city-on-a-hill, \\"...the American supremacy that arose during the second half of the twentieth century was not a cumulative darkening of the sun but the recognition...of the plain facts of international life,\\" (p. 640). He repeats, within the context of global terrorism, the lack of comprehension that economic exploitation and its enforcing militarism are unwelcome by the exploited and oppressed, claiming instead rejection of the US is motivated by unwholesome values: \\"...mass murder, surprise attack, and hatred borne by envy are inseparable from thousands of years of history,\\" (p. 640). That Kennan's economic dictum is hidden by neo-Jacobian enforcement of the universality of American values goes unremarked. Instead he writes, \\"The goal since 1947 of wiring together the world by general prosperity...distances the U.S. presence...from all previous centuries of imperial ambition,\\" (p. 642). The World Trade Organization, World Bank, and the \\"imperial ambition\\" of corporate globalization have missed Professor Leebaert's lesson that general prosperity, as opposed to US economic preeminence, has been the goal.Throughout there is a negative view of state ownership of enterprise at any stage of the enterprise's development, or of the state's development. The last paragraph of the book that equates privatization of government with U.S. Cold War victory is unsupported. Much of the Conclusion diminishes the author's accomplishment by layering his ideology onto informative content."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"Are there no longer editors of books? Reviewers of books abound, and several extol Derek Leebaert's recent work. As this review is limited to one thousand words, allow me to encaplulate pp. 32-33:\\"The emobdiment of the postwar danger felt by much of the American elite is George Kennan.... He is widely revered as 'indisputably an American sage\\".... [Was Kennan the embodiment of danger?]\\"Kennan's long career...has come to personify [Can a career personify?] many of the more taxing habits of America's international behavior.... The often misguided influence of this extraordinary diplomat and scholar on fifty years of U.S. foreign policy, as well as the authority he brings to our memory of how the Cold War began, has had more than a little to do with making the effort against the Soviet Union so arduous. It is, therefore, useful to meet Kennan and to trace his many appearances over these dacades.\\"One could expend five thousand words explaining the author's literary sins in this typical passage. My complaint is not the grammarian's anal-compusive fiat. The book is simply too sloppily written to be comprehended economically. Had Leebaert written a 200-page monograph, I would have suffered through his confused prose, pausing at the end of each fractured sentence to ferret out his meanings. But this is a 646-page text, and life is short.My predudice is that people who think well write well. My biased conclusion, therefore, is that this cannot be a reasoned contribution to an important subject. Leebaert, I believe, deserves better. He can research like a devil, think outside the envelope--but he cannot write his way out of a papaer bag.Where are the editors?!!"},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"More alternative history -- this time it's an \\"imaginary Berlin summit\\" in June, 1988, which didn't ever. The writer takes an event and plays around with it, warping times, places, people, even events to please his urge at the time. The actual summit in Moscow, where the U. S. President Ronald Reagan appealed to the Russian leader, \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' the Soviet evil was not apparent. Reagan will always be remembered for this one \\"request\\" -- you notice: he didn't say \\"please.\\"The Cold War forced America to live in the past, having started with the nuclear and missile ages, after the atomic bomb and Cuban missile crises. It ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union fifty-odd years later. This august government consultant describes it as the Fifty-year Wound (1939-1989). \\"Everything from 'Doctor Zhivago' to undersea exploration had a political dimension. More and more spheres of live were intruded on by politics -- from which Americans have historically sought their distance as a necessary condition of well-being.\\" It was more like a cancer growing.Along the way, we had the Korean War, Viet Nam War, Gulf Coast War, not Cold War. Jeff asked Senator Sasser about \\"star wars\\" and infrastructure back in the early '90s. Professor Leebaert divides his discussion of the causes into three parts, #1 was 1946-61, #2 was 1961-81, and #3 covered 1981-89, when Eastern Europe 'raced to freedom and democracy replaced dictatorship' and tyranny. The Berlin Wall crumbled in November, 1989. The failed coup in Russia took place in August, 1991, and he feels was the real end of the Cold War. Americans \\"gave as little attention to the end of the Soviet Union as they did that December to the fiftieth anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\\"The Soviets were burdened by $90 billion in debt at the end of 1991. He points fingers at past government officials and his alma mater's AID project where funds were \\"outsourced\\"-- Harvard, and the Pentagon for receiving big bucks over Russia's fall. I liked the way he used the word \\"unambiguous.\\"\\"Sometime after Appomattox, a Union major standing in a cemetery overlooking the ruins of Charleston was asked the way 'to Mr. Calhoun's grave.' \\"Madam,\\" he answered, \\"the whole South is the grave of Mr. Calhoun.\\" A hard commentary, but he spoke for the aroused power that had made it so.

It begins by emphasizing that the Cold War glorified certain types of institutions, personalities, and attitudes, and ends by pointing out that we paid a very heavy cost--much as General and President Eisenhower tried to warn us--in permitting our society to be bound by weaponry, ideology, and secrecy.Two quotes, one from the beginning, one from the end, capture all that lies in between, well-documented and I would add--contrary to some opinions--coherent and understandable.\\"For the United States, the price of victory goes far beyond the dollars spend on warheads, foreign aid, soldiers, propaganda, and intelligence. It includes, for instance, time wasted, talent misdirected, secrecy imposed, and confidence impaired. Particular costs were imposed on industry, science, and the universities. Trade was distorted and growth impeded.\\" (page xi)\\"CIA world-order men whose intrigues more often than not started at the incompetent and went down from there, White House claims of 'national security' to conceal deceit, and the creation of huge special interests in archaic spending all too easily occurred because most Americans were not preoccupied with the struggle.\\" (page 643)Although the author did not consult the most recent intelligence reform books (e.g. Berkowitz, Johnson, Treverton, inter alia), he is consistently detailed and scathing in his review of intelligence blunders and the costs of secrecy--in this he appears to very ably collaborate the findings of Daniel Ellsberg's more narrowly focused book on \\"SECRETS: A Memoire of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers.\\" He points out, among many many examples, that despite Andropov's having been head of the KGB for fifteen years, at the end of it CIA still did not know if Andropov has a wife or spoke English. He also has a lovely contrast between how little was learned using very expensive national technical means (secret satellites) and open sources: \\"So much failure could have been avoided if CIA has done more careful homework during the 1950s in the run-up to Sputnik; during the 1960s, when Sovieet marshals were openly publishing their thoughts on nuclear strategy; or during the 1970s and 1980s, when stagnation could be chronicled in the unclassified gray pages of Soviet print. Most expensively, the CIA hardly ever learned anything from its mistakes, largely because it would not admit them.\\" (pages 567-568).The author's biographic information does not include any reference to military service, but footnote 110 suggests that he was at least in Officer Candidate School with the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam era. The biography, limited to the inside back jacket flap, also avoids discussing the author's considerable experience with information technology. Given the importance of this critique of all that most Republicans and most 50-70 year olds hold very sacred, we need to more about the man goring the ox. Future editions should have a much expanded biography.Bottom line: America muddled through the Cold War, made many costly mistakes, and developed a policy-making process that is, to this day, largely uninformed due to a lack of a comprehensive global intelligence capability, or a sufficient means of consulting diverse experts (as opposed to the in-town intellectual harlots). If ever we needed a clean-sheet look at how we make policy and how we provide decision-support to that policy process, this is the time. The \\"fifty-year wound\\" is still open, and the author warns us it will not heal without a reappraisal of how we do the business of national security."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"Without understanding the hisory of the cold war you cannot make any sense out of the present state of the nation or of current events such as the disaster of Sept.11. This book attempts to give an overview of this enourmous subject from the end of WWII up until today. It is well referenced and informative and many non-historians would benefit from reading it. The main problem is that the writing is terrible. It reads like a first draft of a book that the author did not have the time or interest to craft into a real book. As such it is simultaneously interesting, informative and frustrating to read."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"Considering the author's weighted interest toward technology and business, it is surprising how well much of this book reads. It is nothing if not quotable, brimming with insight-packed sentences and entertaining character sketches. Leebaert definitely knows his stuff: this doorstop-worthy tome is loaded with information.Perhaps too much information. The main flaw of the book is its rather bogus thesis: The Cold War was filled with &quot;costs.&quot; Yes, I suppose any forty year endeavor would be filled with its share of expenditures, many mistaken, but this is hardly the most enlightening point to make about the superpower conflict. Unfortunately, it is Leebaert's point, and he desperately tries to tie every nugget of info he tosses at the reader into his great theme. Every chapter, no matter how diffuse the subjects covered, is rounded off with a monotonously pedestrian &quot;these mistakes could have been avoided&quot; conclusion a harried undergraduate would have been ashamed to employ.Many of Leebaert's mini-analyses of various arenas of the conflict are fascinating: his emphasis on the economic and technological subplots of the Cold War are particularly insightful. But the attempt to weave these analyses into an overarching narrative ultimately undo much of the coherence of the book. His appraisal of many of the power players in the struggle often come across as bitchy or unfair (as he spends little time examining the reasons for their actions, but nonetheless tallying their &quot;mistakes&quot; to play up his theme).Another problem is that many of his assessments come to contradict each other: while showing how the Soviets ground their economy into the ground preparing for a &quot;winnable&quot; nuclear pre-emptive strike, Leebaert condemns the US &quot;mandarinate&quot; for advocating the essentially common sense theory of mutual assured destruction, rather than dangerously aping the Soviets in constructing ABM defenses (which, Leebaert refrains from explaining, are built to fire nuclear weapons at incoming ICBMs in the atmosphere. In which case, a city will suffer double the number of thermonuclear airbursts it would without the defense. The ABM Treaty of 1972, which the author does not hide his disdain for, was set up with the understanding that MORE offensive nuclear weapons around cities does not constitute a &quot;defense,&quot; but rather, a furthering of an offensive arms race. Later in the book, it appears that Leebaert's ambiguous attraction to the SDI program has influenced his judgement). At various times, weapons build-ups are deemed wasteful, or necessary, depending on Leebaert's opinion of the administration calling for the build-up. JFK's triumphalism is derided as reckless, Ronald Reagan's is applauded as decicive---though the author considers the Soviet war scare of 1983, which Reagan's rhetoric precipitated, the most dangerous time of the Cold War. The ambiguities and inconsistencies in Leebaert's assessments need more development to explain them, but, given the scope of the work, the reader is usually left with a stream of brief anecdotes.These contradictions, along with a thesis so broad as to be practically meaningless, often make the reader pause and wonder if the author has not taken on more than he can handle. A reader looking for a clear, introductory narrative of the period is advised to look elsewhere (Martin Walker's book is quite good). But for Cold War nuts looking for an engaging new spin on familiar material, as well as a deeper appreciation of the less-reported aspects of this apocalyptic time, this is a good addition to the literature."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"Derek Leebaert's book, The Fifty-Year Wound is the finest work of historical analysis that I have ever read and studied. His work is complete and definitive. With his insight into the dynamics of world events he has transformed the mosaic of the complex events and personalities of the 50 years of Cold War into a seamless story. Many know the history of events, but few can reveal why they were what they were. His perspectives are priceless; his words dense with meaning. He has a unique ability to capture and interpret significant events in a single sentence. He reveals the good and the bad, and separates facts from fiction. Telling the truth took great courage. His style is fascinating. With the moment of the subject and his outstanding ability to write, this will be one of the outstanding books on national events and international relations of this decade. I give it an unqualified recommendation for all who wish to learn from history."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"More than ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the time has come for a thorough, dispassionate, non-ideological review of the Cold War and its consequences. In this book, Derek Leebaert, professor of government at Georgetown University, attempts such a review. It is a daunting task to explore fifty years of history in one volume but Leebaert largely succeeds in creating a cogent, analysis of American actions during this period and their consequences.This book is the first I have ever read about the Cold War that is not filtered through the author's ideology of either the right or the left. Radical leftists will blame the Cold War on American capitalist imperialism. Establishment liberals have tended to view this titanic struggle as between forces equally malevolent or at least equally compromised. The right, of course, has a tendency to forgive each and every American excess as a necessary component in a struggle against a force of pure evil. Leebaert subscribes to none of these views. As Leebaert demonstrates, the truth is much more nuanced.Leebaert begins by setting forth the danger posed by Stalin's Soviet Union during the late forties. He reveals the cold hand of Stalin behind North Korean aggression The first figure scorned by Leebaert is George Kennan, architect of the containment policy who, after the crowning achievement of his life, spent the next forty years undermining it. Leebaert has high regard for President Truman, George Marshall and, surprisingly, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin. He sees these men as helping stabilize the fluid post-war situation. I, myself am not high on Bevin, an old school anti-semite, who was virulently anti-zionist and reneged on his Labour party's pledge to support Jewish immigration to Palestine but that is a story for another book. Leebaert also notes the excesses of the McCarthyist persecutions which prevented a sober examination of the unusually extensive communist penetration of the American government. He views the Eisenhower years as the period when bad intelligence and hasty policy decisions started to undermine the ability of the U.S. to properly respond to Soviet challenges.Leebaert's discussion and criticism of the Kennedy and Johnson years focuses on both the tragic descent into the Vietnam morass and the growth of American \\"adventurism.\\" The Kennedy brothers and their \\"best and brightest\\" advisors are regarded as reckless in their failure to properly assess all options as well as the consequences of their actions. Kennedy era policy makers essentially turned U.S. policy away from direct confrontation with Moscow and towards covert adventurism. Particularly singled out for scorn are McGeorge Bundy, national security advisor and Robert McNamara, secretary of defense. Leebaert simply rejects out of hand the later arguments by Kennedy sycophants like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., that Kennedy, by the end of his life, had already decided to write off Vietnam. Leebaert finds no evidence in Kennedy's statements or character to suggest that he would have avoided the slippery slope that consumed Johnson.Conventional wisdom gives Nixon enormous credit for, not only ending Vietnam, but for the policy of \\"detente\\" and the opening of China. Leebeart is critical of all these actions. He regards Henry Kissinger as a particularly odious figure, a latter day Bismark, playing geo-political chess with millions of lives. Nixon's Vietnam strategy, while doomed to fail, succeeded in expanding the war to Cambodia and bringing on the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Nixon's policy of rapprochement with Moscow is regarded by Leembaert, not as lowering Cold War tensions but as tying the United States to assorted treaties which Moscow never considered itself bound to follow Indeed, Nixon's accommodation to the Soviets and alliance with the even more vile Red Chinese regime of Mao Tse Tung, is regarded by Leembaert as the beginning of the defeatist policy that held court throughout the seventies and continued to be the basic policy of the liberal establishment right through the fall of the Berlin Wall. According to Leembaert, Kissinger and Nixon had absolutely no regard for the morality or immorality of American actions or the actions of American allies. The cold war became viewed as simply a struggle between great powers no different than the 19th century struggles between France and Germany or the 18th century struggles between Britain and France. That the Western system was morally superior to the Communist was forgotten or perhaps no longer regarded as relevant.The next part of the book is devoted to the change of policy under Reagan from \\"accommodation\\" to confrontation. Reagan is given enormous credit for the policy that essentially spent the Soviet Union into the grave. The excesses and mistakes of this era are not ignored, however. The final chapter of the book examines the post-Soviet era of the last eleven years in the context of the Cold War's mistakes and consequences. Leembaert's ultimate conclusion is that the Cold War was a just cause that needed to be fought, needed to be won but was not always fought well or smartly. He is particularly critical of the CIA and the intelligence community in general. I agree with much in this meaty book including the author's basic premise. I don't necessarily agree with all his assessment's. I think he is overly harsh on Kennedy who was more cautious than many of his advisors. Although I agree that Gorbachev is given too much credit for the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Empire, I think he deserves some credit for his refusal to violently resist his nation's inevitable end. The peaceful transition of much of Eastern Europe from totalitarianism to freedom is one of the most remarkable things in modern history. The book could also use more editing. Nevertheless, this is quibbling. The book is timely and must reading for anyone interested in the Cold War and its effect on this country and the world."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"I bought the paperback version of this book because it had blurbs on it from both the Washington Times (conservative) and Washington Monthly (liberal). I thought a book on the Cold War appealing to both sides of the political spectrum might have something to offer.It does. This is a book well worth reading. It is also a bit of a mess.For the liberals, there's a sound thrashing of the CIA; a dim view of our involvement in Vietnam and other lesser countries hardly worthy of our notice; and a harsh assessment of talents, resources, and money wasted in frantic stop-and-start waves of over-reaction to dimly understood but sensationalized events like the Cuban missile crisis, for example.For the conservatives, there's the claim that massive amounts of defensive spending notwithstanding, we were never a militarist society; the trashing of wimpy and wistful detente policy; and, most of all, there's Ronald Reagan, striding manfully onto the scene like, yes, John Wayne, with a resolve and vision lacking in all his predecessors combined, it seems, driving the Soviet Union to ruin at long last.So how did Reagan do it? Well, he spent the Soviets into ruin. On Star Wars. Leebaert makes a good case for this. But massive spending on Star Wars - a still unproven defense strategy some 20 years later - is just the kind of military-university/academic-science/research-thinktank-policy wonk boondoggle he has such fun ridiculing for most of the book.In short, a work both exhilirating and exasperating."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"This is not an objective history of the Cold War. It is crammed with the author's beliefs, but those beliefs are deserving of attention, and many make a lot of sense. I was disturbed by the lack of footnotes for many startling statements, and even when there are footnotes they often are unenlightening in regard to the statements footnoted. Let me illustrate: on page 248 he has a discussion of Red China, and includes the statement that 20 to 43 million lives were lost in Red China between 1959 and 1961. There is no footnote in regard to the statement, and I for one would like a hint of the authority for this statement. I presume the author figures his word should be accepted, but a lot of lesser itmes are footnoted, and it would be helpful if statements such as this were too. On a pickier note, on page 165 Leebaert refers to \\"Colorado senator William Milliken\\" whereas those of us who observed the Senate in those days know his name was Eugene Millikin. And It would be nice if there were a footnote for the assertion (page 109) that when Senator Borah died in 1940 his safety-deposit box contained $200,000 in cash--which the author suggests may have come from the Soviets! Allen Weinstein in his book The Haunted Wood tells of Samuel Dickstein, who served in the House from 1923 to 1945, receiving the present-day equivalent of $200,000 from the Soviets, but $200,000 in 1940 would be well over a million dollars in today's money, so this is pretty sensational stuff, but Leebaert just throws this out and someone who wants to know more about it is given no help at all by so much as a footnote. Stuff like that. But the book is a fascinating read, nonetheless, and a lot of what he says may be right."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"Leebaert, who seems neither Left nor Right, but perhaps neoconservative sympathetic, has written a non-authoritative and revisionist account of the United States and its Cold War \\"glory\\". Though not an accomplished historian, what Leebaert does accomplish is to provide the reader with first-rate anecdotal storytelling combined with a fact-reinforced chronology spelling out just how far state worship went in bringing forth a disordered and warmongering society.In chronicling the Kennedy era, the most noteworthy of the Cold War years, there is an abundance of out-and-out blunders from which to choose. Most remarkable is John Kennedy's candid mission to fund a gigantic global crusade against imagined enemies in a more or less universal civil war. After all, Kennedy came into office extolling the virtues of Cold War expenditures while railing against his predecessor Eisenhower's lack of commitment to military might and Cold War spending. He championed his cause of \\"closing the missile gap\\" with the US's Soviet counterparts before he was even elected to office. Within months of inauguration, as Leebaert points out, Kennedy's assorted intimates authorized $808 million for military construction and $1 billion in special Lockeed monies to confer graciousness upon hometown elected representatives. Defense spending escalated as a percentage of GDP under Kennedy that had gone unequaled in Eisenhower's days.Leebaert is priceless in noting events such as Kennedy's first State of the Union address, which he refers to as \\"a wartime speech without a war.\\" He correctly acknowledges that perhaps there was no one better than John Kennedy \\"for exalting the glamour and authority of the State.\\" War or no war, hot or cold, John Kennedy was the epitome of a political generation that was entrenched within a global superpower mentality in which any and all crises could be contrived as a basis for the furtherance of the State and its assorted powers.The Kennedy years, in particular, created a great new global economic burden, and set the stage for the LBJ venture into the Vietnam graveyard. By the time of Kennedy's death, around one million US servicemen were stationed at more than two hundred foreign bases. The Cold War was by then so huge in its global range and its apparently even higher stakes that it operated more on dangerous generalizations and less in pursuit of specific objectives.As Leebaert puts it, \\"the country got a veneer of Theodore Roosevelt: vibrant, long-term possibility running down into a set of exhausting divisive crises. It was becoming a strenuous life indeed for Americans.\\" And Derek Leebaert does a penetrating job of telling the story of the Cold War and its sham crises."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"America has been waiting for this book since 1991. Leebaert has given us a rich and detailed account of what the Cold War cost the United States in resources, people, and money. No one is sacred; no one is exempt from Leebaert's cold scrutiny. The myths of Kennedy and Kissinger are shattered, and Reagan is finally put in perspective.Leebaert's writing is often complex; one can easily get lost in his grammar. But don't let that deter you from picking up this book; his research and analysis are top-notch.You should know that this book, although proceeding in a chronological way, is not a history of the Cold War. It is an analysis of what it cost the U.S. If you don't have a good understanding of the outline of the Cold War, watch CNN's documentary before you tackle this book."},{"Title":"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory","review":"As another Amazon reviewer well put it: \\"The book is simply too sloppily written to be comprehended economically.\\" I won't elaborate since that reviewer and others have made their case well.Instead I want to focus on the Leebaert's questionable judgment of character. I'd like to do this by focusing on the same part of the book discussed by the reviewer I mentioned above: the section of \\"The Fifty-Year Wound\\" that focuses on, and curtly dismisses, George Kennan.Leebaert describes Kennan as, among other things, \\"intensely emotional,\\" \\"reckless,\\" and \\"riddled with 'impulsiveness.\\" If you know much about Kennan at all, you know that many people have criticized or admired him for being exactly the opposite--as a calculating cold warrior devoted to a potentially amoral ideology of national interest and political realism. Perhaps Leebaert could make a better case than those who have an opposite view of Kennan, but he does not bother to do so. These attributes are simply placed on Kennan, to remain throughout the book, with few examples and no attempt at real argument.A couple of paragraphs later, the author states \\"...He [Kennan] reflected the nation's contradictions: pride in power, perfectionist expectations, readiness to despair, suspicion of leadership, and confident ignorance.\\" Granted, a case can be made, with which Kennan would likely agree, that he was too \\"ready to despair.\\" The rest of the sentence, however, is nonsense. George Kennan, confidently ignorant? An experienced diplomat, member of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study (along with Einstein, Godel, etc.), winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History, author of a multi-volume series on relations between Russia and the West, etc. etc. not just ignorant but confidently ignorant? Truly, I am stunned. Kennan, the man who has been repeatedly criticized as being too staunch an admirer of Bismark, suspicious of leadership? Kennan, whose writings are filled with an almost obsessive high-church protestant awareness of human frailty is being faulted for his \\"perfectionist expectations?\\" If there is any fundamental moral theme to Kennan's writings after he left the federal government, it is that a commonsense grasp of human shortcomings should severely temper our \\"pride in power.\\" Read \\"Around the Cragged Hill,\\" in which he summarizes his political and personal philosophies, and you will find that theme returned over and over again. In fact, the first chapter is titled \\"Man, the Cracked Vessel.\\" Perfectionist expectations?Of course, Kennan is not above criticism. Further, his significance in the Cold War may be overrated, as Leebaert asserts (and merely asserts). Nonetheless the author's dismissal of Kennan is glib at best, and is at times absurd. I should point out, though, that most of the historical figures portrayed in the book have their positive and negative attributes attached to them without even such a fleeting case being made.\\"The Fifty Year Wound\\" does contain many interesting vignettes, and a reader with greater endurance or more comfort with a seemingly stream-of-consciousness history might find it more rewarding than I did. However, if you like for your history to have a clear, coherent logic to the narrative--not to mention genuine insight into human character--you will need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Access 2000 Fast and Easy (Fast & Easy (Premier Press))","review":"If you swear by the &quot;......for Dummies&quot; genre of self-help books then Microsoft Access 2000: Fast &amp; Easy is it for you.

Never did I know that they owned large plantations. Of course, these large plantations were built by the Scots and Irish and English that came across the waters, but these men married Cherokee women and had children who were brought up rich.In this book, The Proud and the Free, the story is pre-Trail of Tears, where thousands upon thousands of Indians were driven out of the east toward Indian Territory (later known as Oklahoma). It is the story of a young half-breed Indian girl who is very rich, very powerful, and very stuck up.It is the story also of another young woman, a teacher from Pennsylvania who comes to teach the young girl and her siblings. This is a teacher who also winds up teaching the young slave children, even though the Indian girl and her siblings think they are so much better than the slave children. The slave children, especially the little boy, is extremely smart, and learns his alphabet quickly.The young Indian girl is in love with a neighbor Cherokee, who from Janet Dailey's description is simply gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, though not in those words.This is a different look at the Cherokee way of life before the Trail of Tears and the determination of the Georgians, a group of white men, who literally drove the Cherokees out of Georgia.I give this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Proud and the Free","review":"A must read, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Proud and the Free","review":"This book actually reached out and touched me.

Still, despite this barrier, the love of two people for each other has proven tobe superior."},{"Title":"The Proud and the Free","review":"This is a novel built around the \\"Trail of Tears\\" and the plight of the Indians in Georgia, but it also has deep love stories.

It held me captive as I read it in one day. I will save it for my genealgy files, too."},{"Title":"The Proud and the Free","review":"A Cherokee Adventure to Infamy and Back., June 15, 2006Reviewer: Betty Burks (Knoxville, TN)Recently, I went to Cherokee, North Carolina, to see the new \\"Trail of Tears.\\" The Indians decided not to give it that evening. Money wasted, motel and meals expense wasted, time wasted: 'nought said. In this book, we have a woman of valor wiht a man of honor. Fiction, right! There are no men of honor anymore. The proud is Temple, part Cherokee, living inGeorgia and forced to walk to Oklahoma along the trial of tears. For eight years, the Cherokee Nation presented one treaty after another, to stay where they were.The reservation on the Tennessee/North Carolina border and the detention camps are factual. Cherokees had their own constitution and laws, also anelected government headed by wise women. The Indians revered their older women. There is a bust of one in the Whittle Courtyard for all to see.But free, only Stuart the honorable was white and free. This is a rehash of the Pocohatus and John Smith story. Being part Cherokee myself, from my father's paternal side, I once wrote an article for a senior onlinenewsletter about my encounters with actual real Indians. A few months ago, there was a fierce one from out West who demanded a dollar from me as I was alone waiting for the city bus. He appeared so ferocious I felt it was in my best interest to give him a one dollar bill, though I told him where he could get a free meal -- that a dollar wouldn't buy much.This book traces the Cherokee nation from 1830 to the end of thejourney to Oklahoma in 1840. It might seem like a good romance to those not educated, or have no first-hand experience with the Cherokees. I had a temp job in a factory in Pulaski doing computer work with a group from Oklahoma; people there who did not know me thought I was one of them! Because of the way they were treated by one of the Tennessee Presidents (I like to blame Johnson, but it could have been Jackson -- both named Andrew), many of today's offspring are unbalanced and consider Tennessee as a war ground. The harassers from out West may be free for now, but they have nothing real to be proud about, of, or for. It does no good to let them know I'm part Cherokeee, as \\"part\\" doesn't count.I understand now why my sister absolutely refused to admit to even onetiny drop of Indian blood. Though, Eileen looked just like an Indian squaw, as did Teresa after she was married and fat. Some segments of today's society can be and are extremely cruel to minorities. Little do they realize that the so-called minorities will take over and call the shots, and they are not educated.They have nothing to be proud of as they've always had everything given to them, not have to work and succeed on their own. Temple decides to trust her man, honorable \\"traitor\\" Stuart, as she let her heart rule her emotions. A foolish decision. Women must be strong and stay strong."},{"Title":"Flying Geese Quilt in a Day","review":"The instructions are clear and easy and the patterns are also not difficult.

I first read this book when I was 11 years old, and enjoyed it then. I'm 26 now and still read it once a year or so.I'm not much a sci-fi fan, but this book has more to offer than dragons and knights. A very good story by Mr.Knaak"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The Legend of Huma centers on the adventures of the renowned knight Huma. The time is long ages before the events of the original Dragonlance series. Huma is a simple knight that understands the Oath and the Measure better than some of his more prestigious peers. It is this knowledge of compassion that compels him to save a lone minotaur, Kaz, from a band of goblins. The friendship that the two form cause a major transformation of Kaz who eventually embraces the knightly ideals. The main story of this great novel involves the incursion of the Dark Queen, Takhisis, into the planes of the living. Huma must rise above his simple upbringing and make a huge difference in the lives of all who dwell on Krynn. He is aided by Kaz all along the way, and the relationship between the two becomes a life changing event for the minotaur, who once served the forces of evil. Although the outcome of the story is inevitable, the way Knaak takes us there is superbly done. The characters are people you care about, and the history is consistent with the original series. The story provides much background information that readers of the Dragonlance Chronicles have always wondered about. The novel is a fast paced ride to an exciting and moving ending."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The first installment of the Heroes Trilogy, &quot;The Legend of Huma&quot; is one of the best fantasy novels set in the world of Krynn. It tells the tale of the legendary Solamnic Knight Huma, and his pivotal role in the discovery of the original dragonlance and defeat of the Dark Queen prior to the Cataclysm. It also tells the story of Magius the wizard, Kaz the Minotaur, and Gwyneth the silver dragon.This book is full of adventure, dragons, warfare, treachery, politics, and of course romance. It's a very worthy addition to the original series, and tells the tale of Krynn's most legendary hero."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I would reccomend this more to people who have no prior knowledge of Dragonlance simply because then you wont know how it ends(like history flunkies that didn't know how titanic was going to end). That however doesn't detract from the quality of the book because it is not the book's fault. The character were good and the plot was good but pretty much everything was good, not great. The love story was par and the adventure of Huma and his find was okay but I felt it lacked some depth. I would say this is still a fun read but there are better books out there."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I Love this book. It answered all my questions about Magius, he rules.Kaz is a great character that I want to know more about. I wish Richard Knaak would write more books.Him and James Ward are the best authors ever!! Thanks Richard,you make reading fun!!!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book is the best book I have read after Richard Knaak.My favorite character was Kaz. I was somtimes bored when I read about Huma feelings but otherwise it was great if you liked this one you should read &quot;Kaz the minotaur&quot; it's great too."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This was the first Dragonlance book I ever read. I never really understood much of how all the Dragonlance books fit together after I read this book. So, although this is GREAT book, I don't recommend making this book your firdt Dragonlance novel. It makes a great read after reading the 'Chronicles' trilogy, however.This book tells about Huma, one of the heroes of Krynnish lore. Almost every Drangonlance novel mentions Huma once in a while, and he is practically the most important figure for the Knights of Solamnia.I recommend this book to every Dragonlance fan. This book is what first got me interested in the series, and I have never gone back to anything else!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"A great epic tale with interesting characters and amazing conflicts too boot. IF you like Dragonlance buy this book."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"this was a very good book. the begining was slow, but it got better. but there were a few things wrong. i thought huma and his dragon died frozen. like when sturm took the dragonlance from huma's hand in the chronicles. and, where was the white stag. other than that it was great. but huma should have died by a white dragon, to match the chronicles."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"DRAGONLANCE is a genre that, loosely based on the universe of Dungeons & Dragons, manages to siphon ideas from just about everyone. The universe itself is borderline sci-fi as the action takes place on a different planet, known as Krynn. DL borrows heavily from JRR Tolkein, Greek mythology, motifs from the Arthurian legend, Halloween archetypes and some other stuff.Now, all of this is not to say DL is bad. Some of the best fantasy books out there are a part of the DL saga. As Leonard Bernstein once said, every musician steals from other musicians, at least some times. What differentiates the best composers is that they steal from the best. I think the same can be said for the fantasy genre of literature.The present book is one of the better novels in the DL series. It takes place in the \\"early days\\" of Krynn - long before the brothers Majere come along. Huma, the hero of the story, is a brave and noble knight. Like all knights who become legends, he is sent on a quest. He even does knightly things such as jousting. The catch is, he does it while riding a dragon instead of a horse - a nice twist.The book is certainly action-packed; there is no question on that. The presentation and development of the characters is also quite well done. The lone complaint I have is of the battle scenes. It's not that they're badly written, but rather that they're too brief. Knaak only dedicates a paragraph to battles that one expects to go on for pages & pages. This makes some parts of the story a bit anti-climactic.A friend of mine told me that since Knaak was under contract to TSR to write the book, it had to be a certain length. Hence the shortened battle scenes. If this be the case, it's a real shame. Writing a novel should NEVER be like writing a sonnet. Placing artificial constraints on authors is beyond absurd.That criticism aside, this book is well worth the read for fans of DL. Even if one isn't into DL, or has not yet read any DL, this is a good place to start. The story is self contained, so there is no need to read the other two books in the series (unless you want to), nor is there any pre-requisite reading in other DL series that have come before. So, even if you never read any other DL books, I would still recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is by far the best heroic tale ever told in a fiction-based story. Huma is the most idealic character ever and I just wish more people in today's society were as honorable as he. This was the first Dragonlance book I ever read and the only one I read more than once. There are so many different &quot;scenes&quot; (I say it that way because anyone with the slightest hint of imagination can easily invision the events taking place). Each chapter is very well placed and leaves you at a turning point in the story. Huma has so many adventures so vividly described that it is impossible not to get involved in the storyline. I may be slightly biased because of the fact that my favorite period of history was the 1200's and my all time &quot;real&quot; fiction character is King Arthur. I just want to believe that at some point in human history the belief in God and honor were paramount above all else. However, I do believe that any reader would have no choice but to honestly give this book a good rating simply because of the quality put into each page. I would give 6+ stars if I could 8=)"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I hate to point it out, but that poem that makes so many people dissappointed with this book is really not following the exact story of how Huma became the great hero who saved Krynn from Takhissis. It is a symbolic poem of what he went through. The book is actually supposed to be a written account of what Huma went through.It follows his adventure from being a normal knight to being the greatest hero I have ever read about him. If you like books that have characters to look up to, this is your book.Oh, and writers are allowed to change facts to suit the sellability of thier stories or plays or poems. William Shakespear did not follow history exactly with most of his historical plays. Therefore, the bard who wrote the huma poem might have changed the story to make it seem more heroic and supernatural. I know that the poem was written first, but its an explanation for the deviation"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The Legend of Huma, by Richard Knaak is one of the best dragonlance books that has ever graced the pages of a Dragonlance novel. This book is filled with so much action and emotion that it is almost too much to handle. What i like about this book, is that Huma is not portrayed as a godlike character, he is just an average knight that wants to stop the hideous army of the Darkqueen as they demolish everything in their path.Huma has a strong sense in faith and power as he builds his character throughout this story. Richard does a good job in portraying Huma's growth throughout the book. Not only does he have to face what seems like a never ending stream of enemies, he must also face his love for a mysterious woman, who is more than she seems. This book does an amazing job in painting in vivid detail the battles that the knights must go through, and the enemies they must face.But anyone who has read the Dragonlance chronicles, or any other book that has to do with the knighthood, know that Huma's battles were more than just with the minions of Takhisis. He must also face the racism that the people are building towards the knights, he must help his friends, who are outcasts from the begining. Huma has a strong sense of loyalty towards Magius and Kaz in this book. He is strong of heart, and even though Magius has changed from the man he knew growing up, he is still willing to go along with his childhood friend, searching for anything that can end the war.Kaz is also a character that is built well in this book. His interactions with Huma do a lot to build his character. Huma and him build a friendship that no one would have thought could be done between a Knight of the Crown, and a minotaur. But together, the face dangers worthy of godlike proportions.All in all, Richard did a very good job in the story of Huma. The characters were built well, and the story was more than interesting enough to hold you the entire way through. It is emotional though, as all wars are, but this one takes the cake. Many people and dragons die in this book. But the most heartfelt story in this book, which Richard portrays very well, is what Huma and Gweneth must go through in order to save the world, forsaking their love for the good of the world.If you are a fan of Dragonlance, this book is a must. Richard Knaak is one of the better Dragonlance writers out there, and this books puts another star to his name. Legend of Huma is action packed and emotional, a definate must."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"How can Knaak write so good on his first novel? He smokes a story with a similar plot in one of the Tales books!This is the book that got me hooked on Dragonlance. It's all about how the Solamnic Knight, Huma(Duh!). Not too much I can say about it without laying out a summary of the book.Here are a few things I liked about it:1)Includes politics, but only just barely. Mostly arguments about who gets to rule the Knighthood.2)Includes dragons to help develop the story line. That's a must for me to rate it as a good book:).3)Characters don't sit around for fifty pages at a time, talking like all the other characters are severly mentally retarded.4)Magic takes a place alongside chivalry, honor, and fighting.5)None of the main characters are stupid or racist.6)Even though he wrote this book after right after he dropped trying to be a chemist, Knaak doesn't drag science into this book. Me, and probably every other pure fantasy fan who has read this book appreciates that.If you only buy 7 or 8 Dragonlance books, make sure this book is one of them. I should know; I have just about every Dragonlance book ever written."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"As with Nicos32@hotmail.com, I read this book years ago. It was the first DL book I had encountered from my brother's shelf and as I delved into, I was astonished. While I was a bit confused as to who the heck Paladine was (stupid me for not reading 'Chronicles' first), even the mystery of a new fantasy realm was swept away. Knaak did such a splendid job with this novel that I really don't know how he found the insight in order to (excuse the poor sentence). From the opening mysterious setting, the story is rife with action, tragedy, love, and sacrifice. I found myself reading the last chapter over and over and over again because it was such a superb closure.I still remember when I finished it, I said to myself, &quot;That was one of the best books I've ever read.&quot; Now that I've indulged myself in other series (particularly Weis and Hickman's 'Chronicles' and 'Twins'), that statement still holds truth. I can recite nearly every plot twist, character, and development in the novel...a feat that is unique to the DL world for me.Buy it and be overwhelmed."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I remember reading this a long long time ago and intensely liking it in my youth. Recently dusted it off and read it again. surprisingly, I found out that I still loved it. At first I couldn't figure out why I liked it so much. there are certainly writers who offer more mature stories like jordan, tolkien and george rr martin.But it is precisely the innocence and humility of the main character, huma, that draws you. If you are the type who goes for the cocky and battle-hardened hero, this book is not for you. Richard a Knaak manages to pull a rabbit out of a hat with this story. It could have easily ended up sounding childish and trite (like a david eddings book) but it doesn't. so put down that ps2 joystick for one afternoon and read this book."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I've heard plenty of people give everyone besides W&H that writes DL novels bad reviews because they can't touch W&H quality. This is just not one of those books. The entire story is gripping, and is hard to put down! I flew through this book faster than almost all the other DL novels I've read. Knaak really brings the reader close to the characters. The way it is written really makes it seem like the legend as told among Krynn. A definite must read."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I've read a large number the other Dragonlance books regarding knights and found them all to be sick satires because for some reason people think that it is impossible for a knight to be a man of honor. (Which I was under the impression that they were supposed to represent) Huma is a knight who manifests virtues sadly lost by most people today, so likely many will react negatively to the portrail of such a man and use words like clique, one dimensional, unrealistic and so on.The book deptics a great man aspiring to manifest the edics of knighthood while attempting to aid his brother knights in a losing battle to the forces of darkness. In regards to that the story is very similar to most other epic type books. There is a collection of interesting other characters that put Huma in difficult moral dilema's, but Huma is what makes the book for me, and I applaud Knaak for not being affraid to make a character who is actually good for once. Why can't we have good guys anymore?"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I had read the original dragonlance sixpence during their first arrival nearly 1.5 decades ago. I also remember vividly seeing this book in the local bookstore upon publication; however, silly me, I skipped over it then. Needless to say, I had left the Dragonlance series behind for a long time until I played Baldur's Gate II this past year, and, amazingly, that rekindled my spirit. Armed with a freshened spirit, I purchased and (re)read the Annotated Chronicles. This time thru, however, Sturm's impact was perhaps bigger on me. I could wait not longer. As such, I bought this book.It was an excellent read. Being his first novel, I was reminded (at the risk of blasphemy) 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was also a first novel.Yes, there were discrepancies in total actuality between this story and the &quot;myth&quot; of Huma as relayed in the Chronicles. However, the author tried to dispel that in two ways (a) in the preface by Astinus and (b) in various junkets throughout the book by referencing how the-then-already-spreading legend wasn't entirely meshing with fact.Neither detracts from the story--or from the Chronicles themselves. Rather, Huma is seemingly a poignant, uber-Sturm. Very much human, but driven to a higher calling.Do I have qualms with the book? Sure. Are they worth relaying? No. Read the book. It's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I would give this book 10 stars if they would let me. It is truly the best fantasy book I have ever read. Of course,it would be better if you read the Chronicles trilogy first before you read this, to get a feeling about the characters. Richard Knaak did a wonderful job writing about love and how the feelings,and could be concidered a drama story,but there is gore,blood,and war enough to make it a &quot;boy's&quot; story. It is filled with fantasy creatures that will amaze any reader,young or old. I would pick this book up and start reading and would become so involved in it that I read it the whole day. I recommend this book to anyone who loves dragons,fantasy,or love story's."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The book is really good.

And while my favorite authors tend to include the commercially successful Tolkien, King, Koontz, McCammon, and Terry Brooks, I have to say that the Legend of Huma is as good as any book I have ever read in the fantasy genre. The characters are incredible (I have to compare my attachment to Huma as bordering on that which I feel for Luke Skywalker!) The plot kept moving and provided many surprises, and the book proved impossible to put down. ON MY HONOR, I swear that this book is a phenomenal investment."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I first read this book when I was 13. A friend from middle school introduced me to the Dragonlance Novels when I visited his house one day. He had all of them. I asked him which one I should read and he leant me this copy. Afterwards I read many other Dragonlance novels. At that age I LOVED the story and really did think it was the greatest book ever written in the fantasy genre, on par with The Foundation Trilogy, which I enjoyed but didn't like nearly as much, and even J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.Well, I picked up this book again, after many years, over two decades have past I think. What do I think of it now?I think it is still a good story, although I pick out a lot of stuff that I didn't used to. The story is still great, but it didn't get me as much as when I was a teenager.What it did right. Atmosphere and voice. The voice is strong, the atmosphere is wonderful. Dark and mysterious full of adventure and danger. A good protagonist that you can fall in love with because he is just, naive, honest, humble, righteous, and kind, yet he is also quick to act when he needs to, he is tough as nails and nothing can bring him down. He comes from lowly beginnings and doesn't think much of himself but becomes the greatest legend any knight could ever aspire to become, not because he wanted to, but because he was good-hearted and had faith. A person like that you can dig. The action is not too gory like many of the other action novels I read today, it is about teenage acceptable gore. And I DO NOT like reading a lot of gore, so unfortunately some of my other authors I enjoy reading, like David Baldacci who can write very gorey and graphic details into their fast-paced action books loose points to this one.Also the writing is someone weak. For example, the author uses the word \\"seems\\" and \\"somehow\\" so many times. He seemed to have disappeared. Somehow he ended up here or there. It seemed to him, over and over and over and over and over, and endless lines of \\"it seemed\\" and \\"somehow\\" with no explanations, when other more crisp sentences would have worked much better. Instead of \\"It seemed that Kaz disappeared\\" write, \\"Kaz had vanished\\" or \\"Kaz disappeared\\" or \\"Kaz was no where to be seen.\\" Instead of always \\"it seemed\\". Did it seem he did vanish from atop the dragon, or did he? He did, so just say it, he wasn't on the dragon anymore. When I was 13 I wouldn't not have noticed some of these almost juvinille writing. I am quite sure that if the author re-read this work today he would probably tend to agree with this assessment.Also the writer sometimes added things that never took the story anywhere and just left them. For example, one that pops into my mind. When Huma is in the maze to face the three challenges, he is walking down a corridor where the rock glows. And all of the sudden Huma gets an idea so he takes out his broadsword and hacks at the rock until a glowing chunk falls off and he tucks it away. So the reader is left thinking, ah, he's going to use this at some point further on in the story. And there were times you were thinking, ah, this is where he is going to take it out because it it pitch dark and now he has something to see with. But no, the medallion on his neck starts to glow. Or the lances start to glow. He never needs the chunk of glowing rock again in the story and it is never brought up again. I feel that this is amateurish writing and editing to leave something like this in the story. If it does not move the plot along, or have some purpose it shouldn't be there. It's like writing, and then Huma stopped and farted. What was the purpose of writing that? If it has no point to further the plot, there is no reason to include it in the narrative.I realize that this is nit-picking. And these are but a couple of examples where I think, that while, overall the voice is amazing, the writing good, it never became great, and the editing obviously lacked.Also, one more thing. I apologize to any who may be offended at this critique. Take it for what it is worth. This is a good read, just not great. But for a teenager that is not as nit-picky (as I used to be) most definitely awesome."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The Dragonlance Chronicles were so popular that they spawned dozens of prequels, sequels, and \\"histories\\" set in the world of Krynn. Unfortunately, most of those not written by Weis and Hickman were mediocre at best. This was one of the rare exceptions - almost as compelling as the original trilogy. Knaak has written other Dragonlance books, and I actually enjoyed them all, but this is his best. Mostly due to the rich subject. Huma was mentioned in the Chronicles as being the hero of Sturm. A legendary Knight of Solamnia, Huma sacrificed himself, and his beloved (a silver dragon) to save Krynn. Knaak gives us the legend, but also the man.Huma was a flawed human being who rose to great heights on courage and honor. He is a three-dimensional character who is engaging, annoying and riteous at times, and a worthy hero to the story. But, I have to admit, my favorite character here is Magius. Magius may be more well-known simply because Raistlin (my favorite of the original companions) carried \\"The Staff of Magius\\" throughout the Chronicles and Legends before it was inherited by Palin. In some ways Magius, as characterized by Knaak, is a rip-off of Raistlin. He's sly, self-centered, incredibly gifted but with a heart buried somewhere beneath the lies. Sound familiar? Yet, he works well for many of the same reasons Raistlin did. Every heroic crusade needs a cynic! His relationship with Huma, while bearing some superficial resemblance to Raistlin and Sturm, is far deeper. Magius truly is Huma's friend, and though he considers Huma a fool most of the time, he stands by Huma's side when it matters most. Magius is the perfect foil for Huma's blinding heroism. He reminds readers that courage and honor come with a high price that most ordinary people are unwilling or unable to pay. Their dialog and interaction provide great humor, as well as making the story flow. It also made the ending bittersweet as well as a bit surprising (despite knowing Huma would die). Another bonus of this novel is that more of the evolution of magic, in terms of the towers, heirarchy, etc, are explored.Overall, this was an exceptional entry to the Dragonlance Saga. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers and say that the book was well written. The problem was that I found two things to my disliking. One was, where was the romance between Huma and the silver dragon, it was not taken very far. Second was, me being a Raistlin fan and mage fan, I thought there was a dearth of scenes with Magius showing us why he was the greatest war mage. I keep waiting for Magius to do something to prove to me that he was the greatest war mage that all of Krynn knew, but it didn't happen and to my suprise he was killed while waiting for him to do something. And then his death and aftermath is like two or three pages. This book glorified Huma (which it should), but paid a disservice to Magius."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I dislike most of the lame novels that have hatched out of Krynn, but Knaak delivers with the story of the legendary Huma, Knight of Solamnia. The story stays true to the magnificent example set by Weis and Hickman, and tells the tragic tale of the star-crossed lovers, Huma and Gwyneth the Silver Dragon. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"1 word...AMAZINGI loved this book!I started to read it and i never put it down..Usually im one to play computers all day but when i picked up a Dragonlance book i would read 24/7..This is a must have for adults and children!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"all in all it was an ok book. i could understand that the bards didn't mention kaz in their stories because he was an minotaur, but i couldn't understand why the part with the white stag and the forestmaster wasn't mentioned. in the &quot;dragons of autumn twilight&quot; the forestmaster says herself that she met huma. why would she lie? i think this book was an 3+ almost 4 star book. knaak is a much better writer than jean rabe"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I loved this story, I only wish that the love story between Gwenyth and Huma was elaborated a little more. Also I wish that the tale of the white stag was added to the story. Other than that this book is amazing and I highly recommend.It reads best on it's own, It's not worth haggling over the details because in the very beginning of the book the historian says everything previous to this story is inaccurate anyways. I don't know why so many people skipped that or ignored that, so all their complaints about innacuracies are completely unfounded, they didn't even read the beginning of the book.Since Richard A. Knaak is a Rhetoric Major with a B.S. degree, I find it odd that there are some poorly written sentences in certain parts of the book. For the most part I just overlooked them and just absorbed the amazing story and the plot twists.This story made me cry in the end, and when a movie does that it usually wins an academy award. If there were sci-fi awards to be given, this book should be one of the nominees or even the winner."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Product took two weeks to get to me but that was fine.

Nowhere near the Weis &amp; Hickman series but sufficient for Dragonlance enthusiasts and Dragonlance gamers needing some direction. Buy it if you're an avid fan only."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Now, I would not have given this book only 3 stars. It doesn't quite deserve that. It's just that HELLO PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED TO &quot;and the white stag led him to an island, and there he met a woman...&quot; &quot;and he rode to the High Clerist's Tower...&quot; SEE!!!!!(regains composure) That didn't happen. Uh-uh. Did the Canticle say even one word about Kaz? Uh-uh. We have no idea whether he was supposed to exist originally or not. Trust me people, even if the other reviews (shoots a venomnous glance) say to buy this book, you might be better off just borrowing it. If you are really intent on buying this book no matter what, try to find it at a bargain price. It's still the same old plot about how good wins over evil with a sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is the first ever Dragonlance book that I have ever read and it got me hooked! This is one book that you can read every year. The suspense, action, adventure and the Dragonlance story is simply exhilirating!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"seven years have passed since i first read this book, and seven years since i've read another as good. i enjoyed the whole book, from cover art, through the interior art and the story itself. No other book captured the glory and romance that was envisioned for Dragonlance as this book by Knaak. This is definitely one for sword and sorcery fanatics (uh...those with severe allergy to knightly honor and comrade-ship may have to stay away however...). From characterization to conversation, nothing is out of place. From battle scenes to tender loving moments, nothing is contrived. This is truly the legend of Huma, one of Dragonlance's flagship characters."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book is a great way to keep interest in the world of krynn and to know why the Knights love the tales oh Huma."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I'm a spanish guy that have read a lot of Dragonlance books (about 20)and I have to say that this one is almost my favourite because it was the first book I read in this saga. The story submerge you in an incredible world full of fantasy, gods, heroes, dragons and wizards. When I finished this book I almost cry. The love story between Huma and Gwyneth and their final sacrifice it made me have feels that I think I would never have with a book.But the &quot;Legend of Huma&quot; it's also full of action with an incredible final battle against Takhisis. Finally I want to say that every Dragonlance reader must read this excellent novel, one of the best in this series."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The beauty of Huma is that a reader does not have to be a Dragonlance fanatic to read it. It's crisp, clean, well-written and plotted. Many of the peripheral Dragonlance titles are disappointing. This one is right up there. Its strength is that it does not require a reader to know the series - a perfectly good stand-alone book. The Twins saga is better, but Huma might come in that second tier with the Dragons of. . . series"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I've read many books.

If any of you hard-core Dragonlance people have not read this, DO. For anyone else just in the mood for a good book, you can't go wrong with this one. It is filled from cover to cover with suspensefull swordfights, battles between dragons, betrayal, and everything else that makes up a good fantasy book. Basically, a knight who is relatively new to his proffesion gets dragged into a worldwide confrontation between the greatest armies, spellcasters, and gods in the world; and because of his noble nature he sticks it out to the end"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"The Legend of Huma is truly awesome! Talk about major fantasy adventure! This book has non-stop action, adventure, and magic - it really lives up to the DragonLance reputation of perfect fantasy. Huma and Kaz were wonderful characters (Kaz was so good, Knaak wrote two other novels and a short story about him)! The only thing I can find wrong with Legend of Huma, is that it left out a lot of things Weis &amp; Hickman (the original creators of the series) mentioned in the Chronicles Trilogy. An example would be: Huma meeting the Forestmaster (never happened). There are many others. But other then that, it was great! I would recommend it to anyone! No true DragonLance fan can miss it (not to mention the cover art kicks butt! Way to go Jeff Easley)"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is a great book. I strongly reccomend reading it if you like more action, there is always something going on instead of stuff that has no point.

He saw the rider then, a knight bold and ready, the great lance poised to strike. The knight also clad in platinum, and the crest on his helmet has that of a majestic dragon. On his chest he wore a breastplate with the symbol of the Triumvirate: the Crown, the Sword, and the Rose. Within the visor that covered the face was light, brilliant and life-giving, and Huma knew that here was Paladine. The great charger suddenly leaped into the air, and massive wings sprouted from its sides. Its head elongated, and its neck twisted and grew, but it lost none of its majesty or beauty. From a platinum-clad steed it became a platium dragon, and together knight and companion drove the darkness beore them with the aid of the lance ... the Dragonlance. It shown with a life, a purpose of its own, and the darkness fell before it. Born of the world and heavens, it was the true power, the true good. The darkness destroyed, the dragon landed before Huma, who could only fall to his knees. The knight released the Dragonlance from its harness and held it toward the mortal figure below him. With some hesitation, Huma slowly rose and stepped forward. He reached out and took the lance by its shaft. Then the dragon and its rider were gone, leaving Huma alone with the wonderous gift. He held it high and cried out in joy.page 246"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book only falls short of the Dragonlance Legends Trilogy.

It is the first book I have read of the Dragonlance Saga, and I have been hooked ever since. It shows of the hero and Legend, Huma (hence the title). I have read it many times and every time I find new things that I missed before. I own every single DL book except for the Villains novels. This is the true story of Huma. And as they relate to him in other stories, it is just like a old tale passed thru the years, becomes hazy and different. But this book is very good!.....as to that other review..they did not mention Kaz in the other books, cause the knights value themselves as humans.

I read this about 5 years ago. The events of this book are still fresh in my memory today 5 years later. I really could not put it down once I started reading it. A very super fast paced novel. Loaded with plenty of action, imagination, and creativity. It also explains the backstory that leads up to The War of the Lance. My favorite part of the book was when Huma climbs the mountain and meets paladine himself, and Huma gets the original DragonLance. The hero that everyone in the DragonLance world looked up to actually started out as a unlikely reluctant solider that most people ignored and overlooked. He becomes a hero b/c of situations he had no control over and he was thrown into."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I read this book for the first time back in the early 90's and it has always been one of my favorites.

It is by far the best of them all. One of the comments was made how it was inaccurate..not so. The story of Huma was corrupted throughout the centuries after the cataclysm. As stated in the Chronicles by the authors. Huma was only remebered by the songs and childrens stories told by parents. So as far as I'm concerned the book is accurate. I read the book twice in a one week.

It remains a marvelous story, probably the best work Knaak has ever done. It has not lost its strength over the years. I would dare say, it would make a great animated mini-series, if they were faithful to the book. Love, war, tragedy, betrayal, hope, and despair.

When Huma gave his life to defeat Tahakasis...I was actually sad. I was touched. Richard Knaak is an incredible writer. I enjoyed the way he continued the story of Kaz the Minotaur(The coolest minotaur of all time). It's strange how he wrote some of the best books ever in a series that was not his own(i.e. Margret Wies and Tracy Hickman). This is the fantasy book that all other fantasy books strive to be.

I tried very hard to like this book but in the end I just could not enjoy it. Here's a few reasons why if you are interested at all.-No offence to fans, but the writting is really quite poor.-I learned more about Huma from the chronicles than this book.-IT MAKES NO SENSE!! Dragons appear out of thin air, Huma kills them, then more dragons come, he kills them too, etc, etc.-Too much fighting and not enough substance.-And finally, the plot is very vague, and seems to be there only to try and give reasons for more dragon fights.I have read books by Richard A.Knaak before, and this seems to be among his worst. -&gt;If you love dragons and fight scenes, this book is for you though&lt;-. If you are like me and prefer less fighting and more thinking, read the books by Margaret Weis and especially the legends trilogy."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book wasn't TOO bad.

(after all, they're the ones who started the whole thing!).@"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I feel that this book was not up to true Dragonlance standard. The author obviously didn't have time to even leaf through the Chronicles to find references to Huma. There are a large number of holes in it, leaving out stuff that was sorely needed to make this book even an interesting read. Huma and Magius are both hugely disappointing characters. I found it almost laughable that the so-called 'greatest war wizard' couldn't even pass the Test. In my opinion, Richard A. Knaak's book didn't rate highly when compared with some much better Dragonlance books by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, Douglas Niles, Jeff Crook, Mary Kirchoff etc. etc. etc.I would not recommend not bothering with this book, and proceeding straight onto Kaz the Minotaur, which I didn't yawn ALL the way through."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"A \`DragonLance' publication. I've never read one before, sort of grouping it in with series like \`Babysitters' Club'. And, sure, it's entirely genre driven - we start with the clich&eacute;s: dragons, knights, wizards - it's the opposite to someone having an idea and deciding to set it in a certain genre for some reason. Moreover, as a branch of TSR (the D &amp; D company), it's chock full of a menagerie of mythical beasts (think Pok&eacute;mon and trading cards), and unfolds like a D &amp; D campaign - you could imagine people counting up their hit points against a dreadwolf or a minataur.Characters are utterly two dimensional, but I suppose that's OK, because stereotype is deliberate (stone me if that young maidservant/princess/sorceress isn't gorgeous - and here's a sketch picture - I kid you not). The book is driven by action and novelty, and the desire to feed a certain market. And as such, I suppose it does pretty well; it's never trying to be a great book. There's nothing really awful to make you put the book down (though nothing to make you compulsively turn the pages either). Probably excellent for young teens."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I read the Legend of Huma hoping that it would follow the guide lines set by the original trilogy.

Knaak clearly deserves the position as the the author who wrote the legend of the greatest hero of Krynn. Of all the Dragonlance writers I have read the work of, Richard A. Knaak is my favorite. I anticipate the fourth book of this series, Kaz, the Minatour. It was also written by him."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I am not Mr. Sci Fi or even Mr. Dragonslance. I loved the original Chronicles Series and the Sequal about the Twins. However I must be honest, most of the offshoots that I have read I have not liked at all. Again, its only been a few but most of the non-Weiss and Hickman stuff I have found to be fluff. However, the Legend of Huma is different. This is a fantastic book. The author has done a great job of writing about Huma and the events that take place before the Chronicles series. Knaack is a great writer, and this book tells a great story. Again, I am not an expert on DL, but I think I know a good book and this is one. Read the first 6 books and this one!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is by far the best book ever written. It was the first DL book i have ever read. Since I read this book I have read over 70 other DL books. It is simply a masterpiece. For all those new to DL I recommend reading this book before the Chronicles Trilogy so you don't know the ending before you read the book. It would ruin it for you. Every time I read this book it makes me cry. The ending is just spectacular. I have never been effected so emotionally by a book like that before. This is a must read for all and any who read it I garantee they will find it one of the best books they have ever read. Please read this book."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Well... if I finish, it will be over... and that would be sad! I am new to the Dragonlance series. I haven't read SciFi books for a while and have read Fantasy even longer ago. These books are, to my surprize, truly engaging! I thought that reading the Lengend of Huma would be good because I'm trying to read these books in some kind of order. I was right! If you are new to the Dragonlance books, read this soon. The story has a number of twists, interesting characters, and a great deal of plot (it's really several adventures in one book) while still maintaining that ideal heroism thing that gives you the warm and fuzzies. I work in a stressful job... and for the last week have been looking forward to coming home, kicking up my feet, and escaping into this book. It's got me hooked to Dragonlance books!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Aside from the core books by Weis and Hickman, this is, in my opinion, the best Dragonlance book. It got me interested in the series. Great action, nice story. I look forward to reading more Knaak. Some of the dragonback fighting scenes were hard for me to visualize, but fun to try."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"the best dragon lance book ever written. read them all and you will agree."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I\`ve read this book more than twice, sometimes when i have nothing to do, i get this huma book and read some of my favorite parts. This is definitely a good book. Although it parallels the story line of the chronicles trilogy. It is still much different from the chronicles. Huma is a knight who acknowledges his true feelings. He shows fear, loves his life and also shows compassion. This is the way a human should be. so he is also the greatest knight on the world of krynn. Mr. Knaak showed his ability in writing about dragons (i\`ve also read some of his dragon books). but this book is definitely better than his other books i\`ve read.. I\`ll recommend it to all DL fans and new readers as well"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is great. I only read this because of the positive comments made by the other readers and I didn't know what to expect as this was the first time I read Knaak's work. But I was pleasantly surprised to find he did a super job with one of the most complex tales in Krynn history. I liked the way he characterised the three central figures; Huma, Magius and Kaz. I particularly enjoyed how Huma was very different to Sturm; in that he was far more open minded, had fewer prejudices and generally seemed to value his life a lot more. In many ways, Huma was more like Tanis. Knaak didn't waste any time (every chapter had a purpose), but neither did he rush the story to its end. He also gave new insights into the Knights of Solamnia. Despite our (DL followers!) pre-knowledge of the ending, there are several plot twists to make this a truly exciting, fast paced novel.My only criticism is that the author took certain liberties with Krynn's majestic dragons, who lets face it, make DL what it is. I despised the way dragons were being slayed so simply as if putting a hot knife through butter. But that's just one flaw in an otherwise perfect novel.In summary, if you are DL fan, this is a must read. If you've never read DL, you will appreciate this even more as you hopefully won't already know the outcome; in turn this will entice you to read more DL. As for me, I now can't wait to read Knaak's ensuing novel; Kaz, the Minotaur."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I read this book when I was a wee child, probably around 10 years of age. At the time, I thought Huma was the greatest person in any book, ever. After reading every Ravenloft, Dragonlance, and AD&amp;D book available, I still think that. He has every virtue that I want. He is the most honorable and honest person I've ever read about. When I read the end of the story, I cried. It was touching. I am ordering this book right now because my previous copy has been lost. I read this book at least once a year. I read it when I am troubled and don't know what to do. I just hink, what would Huma do? This book is second to none other than the Bible."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Glad to see this book around. I read it years ago as a kid after a really though year, and was mesmerized. The humble knight who seeks the good, and is chosen to represent the greatest Good has to offer.Ultimately, this book may seem cliche to older, more cynical readers, but the ultimate message of triumph through compassion is not only relevant but also just better than tired depressing mages, vampires or demons who seem to have gutted fantasy."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Here's why. The Legend of Huma doesn't exactly follow the parts of the legend told in the original DL books. Also, Knaak has Takhisis swear by the beyond and the highgod (presumably Chaos) that she's never going to try to come to Krynn again. So why does she show up in Chronicles? What, she's evil, so she can't keep her word? Considering how much trouble she should be in if she did break her word, I'd think that she'd be a little more circumspect than that. Also, since the Staff of Magius played such a role in later books, why is Magius himself such a weakling? He couldn't make it through the trials of the Test, yet his staff is a major magical artifact? Sorry, that's a hole large enought to drive a truck through."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"It can't be five stars for several reasons. The writing is quick, but somehow unnatural, especially at the start. Once Knaak gets into it, though, so do you. The story is absolutely awesome, though if you don't see the Silver Dragon twist coming . . . A little too many cliches . . . and many inaccuracies. The back of the novel itself says Huma went to the High Clerist Tower, but it never happened. The White Stag scene never happened, even though Knaak had a perfect oppurtunity when Huma was starving and following the river. However, you should look past any inaccuracies. The novel has the best sense of mood that I have ever read. The feel of mystery and destiny is unbelievable. It would make an awesome movie. This, more than any other DL novel, has the feel of fantasy and that anything could happen. Also, its sense of time and history adds immensely to the novel (if only Knaak left out Wyrmfather!). Read it, love it, read it again. There are many mistakes, but only a DL lover will care. Man!, I love the feel this novel has! The story itself does deserve 5 stars. Somebody turn this puppy into a movie!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I actually started reading &quot;The Legend Of Huma&quot; back in 1996 or 1997, but it was only now that I managed to find this review page. For a long time now I have always wanted everyone to know how I feel for this book. It was the first DragonLance book I have ever read, and until this day it is still the best of them all. I have read this book so many times that I could recall every little detail that Richard has produced in his book. I am actually reading the book again now and I cannot let go of it. &quot;The Legend Of Huma&quot; is by far the best of the best. I loved the storyline, the characters, the way Richard detailed each situation that occurred, and especially loved the situations that Huma seemed to be constantly in. His relationship with Gwyneth made me cry at the end, as she had stuck with Huma all the way, even until her own death. His relationship with Kaz and Magius was the best, for how many knights would partner themselves with such company. The friends and company that he met along the way was thrown into the story very well. Company such as Bouron and Lord Guy Avondale and the gray man who helped him overcome the cursed Sword Of Tears. The betrayl of Rennard shocked me a little but it was a suspense waiting to happen. And finally his fated show down with Galan Dracos and his Mistress of Darkness, Takhisis. I want to let Richard A. Knaak know that his efforts of creating &quot;The Legend Of Huma&quot; will always be in my heart, and that I owe him alot for producing such a magnificent book. I have loved reading &quot;The Legend Of Huma&quot; and will forever keep on reading it. Sometimes when I read the book, I myself feel as though I am in the story and as Huma. This is defiantely the best book I have ever read in my whole life."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Key to understanding the past of the series - excellent stand alone story."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is the first of the Dragonlance novels that I have read. I must say that I am rather impressed with this one. The world of Krynn is an amazing world with cool dragons and other awesome creatures. I think Richard Knaak did a very good job of telling the story through the characters, not just about them. Overall I gave it a rating of 4 stars simply because some of the twists, that were a main part of the story were a little to easy to figure out before being revealed through the course of the story. But still a very good story overall."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"Eager to get into the DL series I picked up this one because it was a best seller and I couldnt wait to order in the core's, and I did not regret it, Knaak does an amazing job in telling the story of the legendary Huma all the while captivating the reader with a fast paced plot and wondreful battle segments full of action, dragons etc that never dull and always propel the storys momentum further.This is one of my favourite books, I was saddened when it was over as it is such an amazing book, if you only read one DL book make it this one!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"I love stories that tell how the &quot;legend&quot; of a fantasy setting came to that status. This is no exception. Huma is, well, very human and real throughout the book, and his friends are certainly no paragons of perfection.Although the characters are believable, the writing gets a bit overdone in spots. But this is a minor flaw, and almost to be expected in a story of this type. Overall, this is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This has got to be the best fantasy novel I have ever read. The character of Huma isn't shown as the epitome of the knighthood, but instead he is just a simple knight who trys to do the right thing. The stories of Magius and Kaz show that people dont have to be good to do the right thing. I highly recommend this book to anyone, even if they aren't usually fans of the genre."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"it was an excellent book. it gives an excellent prespective as to exactly happened to the ledgandery huma. i recommend it highly"},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This was the first Dragonlance novel I bought, and it still remains not only my favorite book by Richard A. Knaak, but also my most favorite book I've ever read. I loved how the story flowed, especially when he had the several trials to overcome, and the dynamic characters. It was his first novel, and still remains his best. Each time I read through this book, I read it even faster than the time before. The worst thing about this book is that any book I've read after it seemed to be very pale in comparison to this story.As a younger reader, I wasn't too picky about the writing styles of many of the Dragonlance authors, but as I grew and began my own writings, I began to critique other author's writing more closely. Knaak is one of the very few authors who I can still read without cringing from the writing style.As other reviewers have noted, this story isn't dead on with the other books, but there have been many other DL books which were even more off-kilt with the stories (Lord Toede). But if you take the book in itself without worrying about the smaller details, it is a great book, and set up a great foundation for Richard A. Knaak's writing career (who is now writing novels for the Warcraft and Diablo series)."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This is the absolute best book that I have ever read in my life.

I think readers will enjoy this book and the story it has to tell."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book is the best dragonlance book in the saga.

The setting and sense of forboding in this book really help the reader realize how dark and desperete things have become for the knights and Krynn itself. Whenever there is a battle, Knaak doesn't ever shy away describing it as it happens - something that most of the other authors in the Dragonlance saga often do. He does a good job describing the events leading to a battle but will not leave you hanging when it finally takes place. He also does a great job of letting you get to know Huma himself. You really get a feel for the turmoil he must go through when every thing seems to be going against him. I think it is noteworthy how well Knaak uses the perspective of other characters to describe how good Huma is in battle. I wish that their more authors in Dragonlance that had the ability and the willingness to write about the Knights of Solamnia. Not just about meaningless things they do individually but more about the wars they have fought in. If they do then it should be done with a better description of how the knights fight as a an army and cavalry. No one ever wants to write about the good dragons either. Tell readers more about the gold, brass and copper dragons. Especially the golds. The evil side of Krynn in its warfare is getting boring so write more about how the knights and good dragons fight."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"When i first read \\"The Legend of Huma\\" i was about 13.

When i was younger i didn't have any good influences in my life; i took the beleifs of Huma and made them my own when i was 13. I still live by the same code.

He did a good job giving us a Huma who is just and brave, yet live and humane. I like the way he befriends and vouches for Kaz the minotaur and has trust in his childhood companion Magius.Before The Legend of Huma, minotaurs are just every other brutal monster in the fantasy world. Knaak, giving them honor, turns them into a race indeed. Even Weis and Hickman acknowledges Kaz a minotaur hero in Dragons of a Fallen Sun. Now that's the honor really deserved to Richard A Knaak."},{"Title":"The Legend of Huma: Heroes, Volume One","review":"This book in my opinion is right up there with the chronicles trilogy.

This book moves at a great pace from start to finish, you won't want to put it down.Along the way the author will take you through the hero's accidental meeting with the minotaur Kaz, his at times awkward relationship with his fellow knights, as well as his friendship with the legendary magius.

Of value to me was the accompanying diagram that shows foot placement and relative weight that is placed on each foot as well as text that tells how to properly breath for each movement.The latter part of the book describes the importance and history of each move that gives good background to the form.

Rubbing palms and hands2. Opposites - yin and Yang - of palms, front and back, top and bottom3. Shifting weight4. Imagine large ball between palms5.

I know a lot of gaming companies are doing this sort of thing now, but it still seems ridiculous that they expect us to be so dedicated we'll even buy blank paper bound in colourful covers. When I bought this book, it was in a hobby shop and I didn't realise what it was until I was shelving it with the rest of my acquisitions. I should have known better, as I had the option of looking for it before I bought it. In mail order, this sort of misunderstanding is even easier to happen into.

Adams is a bit of a rare breed. Unlike a lot of artists, Art did not struggle for years to get his break, rather he was in the right place at the right time which brought him the Longshot series when he was just 19 years old. He had sent samples of his work to all the Marvel editors and it was Carl Potts who first contacted Art and got him hooked up with writer Ann Nocenti to work on Longshot. Adams' detailed and unique style quickly made him a fan favorite and Adams soon found himself working on some of Marvel's top-selling books including The X-Men and New Mutants.Adams is the latest subject of the Modern Masters series from TwoMorrows publishing and he's certainly deserving of the honor. In this book-length interview which features hundreds of samples of his art, Adams talks about his twenty plus year career in comics. Among his influences were Frank Frazetta, Michael Golden, Walt Simonson, and Barry Smith...the latter two are certainly the most evident in his work. Art discussed the creation and look of Longshot which was Nocenti's creation but with a look designed by Art. The mullet was based on the lead singer of 80's one-hit wonder band Kajagoogoo. Besides his projects for Marvel, the interview covers his work for now-defunct Comico including Gumby, Monkey Man and O'Brien for Dark Horse and Tom Strong for DC's America's Best Comics imprint. Art humorously discusses how his legendary Wolverine poster has brought him tremendous royalties, even so many years later.Adams was certainly ahead of his time by at least a half-decade, putting out eye-popping artwork long before Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee, and the rest of the Image ilk would revolutionize the way fans looked at comic book art with their bold, in your face, splash page-happy styles. Adams was Image before it ever existed. Yet what really comes through in the interview is the humbleness and lack of ego that he has. He is fairly reserved and often even self-deprecating about his work. You can see how much of a regular guy he is as he takes readers through an average work day, admittedly often distracted by television. Art comes across as very engaging and somewhat surprised by his own success. It clearly has not gone to his head.The interview covers the first 88 pages of the book while the last 36 pages are dedicated to displaying his fantastic art work. This gallery contains some of his famous covers, design sketches and portfolio illustrations including some simply dazzling, full-page Moneky Man and O'Brien pieces. But the most intriguing are Art's re-imagining of some old, classic Marvel & DC covers. These include his versions of The Hulk #181 as Wolverine battles the Hulk, Marvel Feature #11 with another of those classic Thing Vs. Hulk covers, and Fantasic Four #82 which is a redo of a great Jack Kirby cover.Art Adams is a welcome edition to the Modern Masters series!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Modern Masters, Vol. 6: Arthur Adams","review":"I'm not a great fan of this series of books in general. I've found some of the earlier volumes to dwell over-much on the interview aspects without giving you anything really interesting by way of art. Thankfully, I have no real complaints with this volume devoted to Arthur Adams.Like the rest of the series, it is interview-oriented. And let's face it; not everybody is a great interview subject. I've read a number of interviews with Mr. Adams, however, and found him consistently engaging. The text of this book is no different.Best of all, there's a good selection of artwork here, including everything from thumbnail sketches to pencil drawings to fully-finished art. Everything is in black and white and/or halftone reproduction, but overall the production values are decent and everything is very legible.If you're a fan of Mr. Adams' art, I'd say you are in for a treat with this book. And if you consider that the average cover price for a single comic book is $2.99 these days, for the price this volume can't be beat."},{"Title":"Modern Masters, Vol. 6: Arthur Adams","review":"The book was intended as a present for a close friend and arrived in perfect condition and on time.

Modern Masters: Arthur Adams is a good buy, and well worth it for comics fans, both for its content and for the artwork contained within. You'll find some great insights into Adam's career and creativity form his own mouth, as well as a nice selection of black and white finished art, sketches, conceptual work, etc. interspersed throughout the book itself and in a special gallery section at the end.The only drawback to this book, and the reason that it doesn't get my full 5 stars, is the quality of the printing. This book doesn't have the best printing quality in terms of the ink/paper that is used - in some of the darker spots (espeically the places where there are great big blocks of black on a page) it's starting to rub off onto the facing page. However, if you treat it carefully, this probably won't be too much of an issue (I hope). All in all, a good buy - check it out."},{"Title":"Millennial women","review":"At long last science fiction stories devoted to women.

It concerns the intruiges between two brothers (Pierre et Jean) when Jean inherits a large sum of money from a &quot;familly friend&quot; whom Pierre secretly suspects of being the father of his brother Jean. A great book, and a very interesting look at French society in the mid 1880's."},{"Title":"Pierre and Jean","review":"Pierre and Jean was one of Maupassant's better-known works, but it was not one of his best. Pierre and Jean demonstrates qualities of an interesting novel in that there is a love triangle and a brotherly rivalry. Both men display something of an Oedipus complex, but are both strong and active characters. The father was created to be a flat and uninteresting personality, but the reader becomes very interested in his actions insofar as Maupassant makes a great game of mocking him and painting him as the typical bourgeois fool. Maupassant's strength is his characterization. In this, he mirrors Dickens. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pierre and Jean","review":"With excellent attention to deatil, Maupassant tells the story of a family on the brink of total collapse. While the storyline and events that took place in the novel were undeniably believable, it was at times somewhat boring to read, as would be many of our everyday lives should they be put on paper. However, everyone that reads this book will be able to relate to it in some way, and will undoubtedly learn something about themselves at the same time."},{"Title":"Pierre and Jean","review":"Pierre et Jean runs only 146 pages in my edition. Maupassant appended a 14 page commentary at the front on \\"Le Roman,\\" apparently to head off criticism that it was only a short story and not a novel. In this section he characterized the book as a \\"psychological story\\" rather than an adventure or a mystery. The book does a great job of contrasting the different personalities of the two brothers Pierre and Jean.Maupassant's plot devices are the powerful life events that work best for this purpose: deaths, engagements, affairs, births, jobs lost and jobs found. Though he promises not to use devious vocabulary to enhance his reputation as a writer of 'literature', I found ...well I wish I had found... a number of his words that were missing from my heretofore reliable dictionary. He also made good on his promise to choose words that made use of more than one sense of meaning to produce genuinely impressive descriptions. Maupassant deserves a lot of credit for making an essentially descriptive and 'literary' work grip the reader's attention.(General comment w/r/t various editions: Amazon seems to lump all the editions together. Mine was published in Paris by Flammarion, an eminently readable edition.)"},{"Title":"Pierre and Jean","review":"Title says it all.

There's these two brothers, right?--as the title indicates. One of them gets a really nice inheritance from a family friend. The other brother gets NOTHING. He's jealous of his brother for his good fortune, and gets suspicious about WHY his brother got the inheritance. He finds out that it's because their mother had an affair with the family friend and his brother was born illegitimately from the affair. He confronts his mother about it and she admits it. That's why his brother got the inheritance, because he was the family friend's true son, it was a shameful secret that the mother kept from her husband (their father). That's all there is to it. It's not a complex book and the story's pretty simple, but the underlying psychology is really interesting and the book is very well-written--very tight and engaging.

The author must put his work together in such a skillful, hidden and apparently artless way that it should be impossible to perceive his plan and intentions. He must demonstrate how people are modified through the influence of circumstances, how feelings and passions develop, how people struggle in all sorts of social environments, how interests clash. The psychology of the characters should be concealed behind the events of life.Pierre and JeanThis formidable short story is a perfect example of de Maupassant's theory of the novel.Its central subject is parental doubt, provoked by an unexpected event: an old friend leaves his entire fortune to a member of a family.The writing is ingeniously elliptic: the boat which enters the port at the beginning of the story leaves it at the end under totally different circumstances.The images are brilliant: \`a short, round man, round through having rolled over the seven seas, whose ideas seemed round like pebbles on the shore.' \`All those multicolored dresses, covering the sand like beds of flowers, these gaudy sunshades, the seductive art of gesture, voice and smile, the coquetry displayed on this beach, suddenly were revealed to him as an immense flowering of female perversity.'The endless stream of revelations, of emotionally charged personal confrontations and of the dramatic psychological shocks, ultimately uncovers the es(sense) of life, the passion of love, for an individual human being.This sublime text is a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Pierre and Jean","review":"In my A.P.

This book saved my life!A friend gave me this book because his chiropractor personally knew the one who developed this technology. I trusted him and read the book and I'm glad I did. It made a lot of sense. I had a root canal (a back left molar) bothering me and also had a constant headache on the back left side of my head. I was living from Tylenol to Tylenol and noticed when my root canal was re-done by an Endodontist that the headache went away for a few weeks. So I knew it was related to the root canal.Long story short, I ended up going to the clinic where the author did a full health screening on me (using FDA-approved, military thermal imaging technology) and it showed hot spots in the left side of my mouth where all 4 of my root canals reside. I also had a streak coming down from the left jaw, down the left side of my neck, and into the left breast! He tells in the book how breast cancer (and many other cancers and diseases) start in the teeth and jaw and then spread to the breast or body but always stay on the same side of the body as the problem in the mouth. He was right and this was a very visual picture of that happening!He has a dentist about an hour and 45 minute drive away that is the best in dealing with this technology and tough cases so I went to see him right after my clinic appointment (that particular dentist is booked up months in advance so I was very lucky to get in to see him after only calling a few weeks in advance). That dentist identified which root canal was the biggest problem and worked on that tooth and from that moment on I've had NO headaches!I'm a believer! I'm also scheduled to do a follow-up scan in 3 months to watch what is going on in the breast. If you or a friend / loved one has ANY health issues they should be your first choice of where to go for help! Start with this book - it's a requirement to read it before they will see you. Their contact info is in the book. I just took it from there and boy am I glad I did! The author was wonderful and gave me lots of tips and advice on what to do for my health - much of it is low or no cost and is working miracles in my life so far! The health screening itself is also very cost-effective and the follow-up scan is much less yet.

Most accounts of the stream engine rightfully credit Trevithick, Watt, Stevenson and Newcomen.

Of course this book was written in the early twentieth century when it was common for preachers to write in the same King James quoting English they used from the pulpits (take the title as an example).The only weak point in Dr. Ironside's argument is his defense of immersion as the only mode of baptism. He did not give an adequate defense of the Greek word \\"baptiso\\" which is where the crux of his arguement for the \\"plain meaning\\" of the text lies.However I will say that as I draw closer to a conclusion of my search to know the who and how of baptism this little book gave me a lot to think about.

What am I doing here, come to think of it, I don't even like Mad Magazine...Just kidding.I remember getting all those great 25 cents (cheap) magazines with 'What Me Worry' Alfred E. Newman on the cover. That boy was either in some kinda dressing up of a recent movie, one of the Beatles, or hanging out with his 'What Me Worry' presidential prototype Richard M. Nixon. We gotta kick out of any of the Don Martin lunacy--his characters were always from the Plastic Man school of slapstick in which bodies and limbs were smooshed and squooshed into shapes whose outcome depended on what the force of impact was. A fish slap made a man's face turn into a fish.There were the great Spy vs Spy series, Scenes We'd Like to See, and those movie and television parodies. All for 35 cents (cheap, and later adjusted for inflation).Then, somehow me and my brothers ran into the Signet paperback issues of old Mad that we'd missed when it was edited by Harvey Kurtzman at EC Comics--talk about a goldmine. In those days the artists--the great Will Elder, Jack Davis, Wally Wood and Kurtzman himself--had each panel chocked full of idiocy, lunacy and craziness. Nothing was spared of their rubbery wits. I recall a Popeye parody done by Will Elder in which Popeye had to kick a cigar smoking, razor stubbled Swee'Pea's a--. This wasn't what one was used to seeing in the comics. I kinda miss those days...sigh!Anyway, if you can get ahold of any of the Mad Magazine Signet paperbacks, --the earlier, the better--then, you will have found one great piece of Americana and the overall best in comic book humor."},{"Title":"Hagstrom Westchester County & Metro New York Large Scale: Covering a 75-Mile Radius from Midtown Manhattan (Hagstrom Westchester County Atlas Large Scale Edition)","review":"This map is very helpful, and easy to read.

I was stunned to learn of the many and varied connections between the two: much of what appears in Styron's books is based upon actual experiences he had and people he knew. West clearly has a deep respect for his subject, and the portrait we receive of Styron is one of a dedicated, sometimes angst-ridden literary genius, slowly and methodically creating his masterpieces. West occasionaly sidetracks into Styron's interesting relationships with other authors, including his controversial feud with Norman Mailer. The main quibble is that the final quarter of the book seems awfully hurried. One might expect &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;, Styron's most recent and well-known novel, to receive the most treatment, but West seems to give it the least. Those hoping for a more in-depth look at Styron's battle with depression than is found in his memoir &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; will probably be disappointed, as West adds little new to the saga, and in fact often seems to quote it directly (which seems rather lazy). Still, a mostly fascinating read, and one that any fan of Styron will find engrossing."},{"Title":"William Styron: A Life","review":"I've read all of Styron's fiction and all his published nonfiction, and was happy to find out that this biography explores in detail the mind of the writer who has created such beautiful, enduring prose. Author West has had unusual access to working papers, unpublished works, and early drafts of Styron's well-known books, and is able to illustrate how the changes Styron made during the editing process reveals his character. You couldn't ask for a more deeply felt biography. In contrast to the main review on this page, I also felt that this was one of the only biographies I've read in which the connection between the subject's childhood and writing was made clear. If the only book of Styron's you've read is the excellent Sophie's Choice, this biography may give you more information than you want. If you have more of an interest in Styron's other writing, this book is a fascinating adjunct.

I ate at the restaurant, and stood in the small, sad room where Van Gogh breathed his last after shooting himself in the chest - a room photographed and written about in this book.My thoughtful middle son gave me the book for Mothers Day several years ago - and I loved it from the moment I saw the beautiful cover photo of the restored Auberge Ravoux restaurant . I leafed through the color plates of the restaurant and inn, Van Gogh's paintings, the scrumptious almost edible photos of the meals in the recipe pages - replications of the food served in the nineteenth century - and even a handwritten Van Gogh letter. I read about the recent restoration of the inn to match its appearance at the time of Van Gogh's nineteenth century residency there, and the intimate details of much of the artist's life in articles and essays by professor Fred Leeman, the former chief curator of the Amsterdam Van Gogh Museum and food historian Alexandra Leaf. One article is about the cafes, restaurants and auberges that Van Gogh freqeuented and painted in his lifelong search for \\"a room of one's own\\", one about his friendships and acquainceships, and another about his attempts to ward off suicidal tendencies by following Dickens' suggested infusions of food and drink - and yet another, about his complex relationship with food, and one about his final days at the Auberge. Accompanying the articles are wonderful color photos and black and white engravings.I highly recommend the book - which I still go back to from time to time for reference. I also recommend that the reader then take the book with him or her and visit the Auberge and the town."},{"Title":"Van Gogh's Table at the Auberge Ravoux: Recipes From the Artist's Last Home and Paintings of Cafe Life","review":"Excellent condition Fast and efficient service.Not just a fanciful fairytale as some accounts of van Gogh have proven to be.Backed up with authentic letters and history of the time this is a very agreeable read and the recipes give it that added interest."},{"Title":"Van Gogh's Table at the Auberge Ravoux: Recipes From the Artist's Last Home and Paintings of Cafe Life","review":"Thank's, I went Auberge Ravooux in this september and take a runch same as table.This is my important memorry."},{"Title":"Van Gogh's Table at the Auberge Ravoux: Recipes From the Artist's Last Home and Paintings of Cafe Life","review":"This is one beautiful book.

Somewhat to my astonishment, the book captivated me. Wm Beebe (1877-1962) was not (as I heretofore had thought) merely a one-dimensioned, deep sea explorer. World traveler, naturalist, director of the NY Zoological Society -- he wrote books ranging from birding to jungle exploration. Beebe turns out to have been an early 20th century Loren Eiseley. This book records a 1923 trip undertaken by fourteen scientists from New York to the Galapagos in a steam power yacht, provided by a wealthy patron. They were later to learn that it was more suited to ladies &quot;sipping tea&quot; than oceanic cruising. They discovered to their astonishment that it was &quot;neither an inexhaustible reservoir of fresh water, nor a floating coal mine&quot;. They had to cut short their Galapagos collecting and beat an unplanned retreat to Panama for more provisions. Beebe is a very readable author, with many a well turned phrase sprinkled thru the book. He describes the ocean voyage as, &quot;... driving a momentary wedge thru sunshine, wind, and water...&quot; Later, in a small boat, going ashore in the Galapagos, he describes the gentle swell &quot;...which rose and fell as if the Pacific were breathing quietly and regularly.&quot; Accordingly, when it came time to jump, he appropriately waited for the ocean to &quot;exhale&quot;. He finds both comfort and wonder in contemplating the Darwinian explanation of all he sees. For Beebe, there is an &quot;honour of being one with all about me and in a small way to have at least an understanding...&quot; He marvels, for example, in picking up a crustacean's shell, that having parted ways uncountable millions of years previously, now, quite by accident, they cross again. Beebe deplores both the early sailing depredations of the tortises and the wholesale slaughter of animals by previous scientific expeditions (how many flightless cormorants do you need to get an accurate description?). This expedition restricts themselves to capturing various specimens, which they hauled back to the NYC Zoo. They also took back sacks full of lava rocks, sand, plants, etc with which to make scenic dioramas in the AM Museum of NH. On page 265 one comes across the single most arresting observation in this book. As usual, profundity lies hidden in the details. It seems that Beebe &quot;secured&quot; (his euphimism for collecting) several specimens of different Darwin finches on Daphne, and found to his astonishment that their crops all contained identical food items, despite their differing bill shapes. All, even the heavy beaked birds, for exaple had uncrushed seeds in their crops. He repeated this observations several times, always with the same results. So there is more to the oft repeated, now almost cannonical evolutionary explanation of the differing finch beaks. The various finches are all eating the same things! Natural selection provides what appears to be a reasonable hypothesis to explain the various beaks, but what is really going on? I can think of no less than four explanations, but that is another tale. If anybody reads this and is curious, I am at proode@pol.net."},{"Title":"Galapagos: World's End","review":"I found it terribly dry and difficult to wade through, despite the fact that I was on my way to the Galapagos. Even after I got back home, I simply couldn't get through it. I is scientific to a fault, in my opinion and although it reads like a novel, I thought it got bogged down in the minutia of specimen collections."},{"Title":"Galapagos: World's End","review":"\\"More than 100 splendid illustrations\\"Nope.

On poor paper.But wait, there's the color cover...I shall update this when finishing reading. I hope the text worth it."},{"Title":"Galapagos: World's End","review":"William Beebe's Galapagos: World's End was published in 1924, so it it is certainly not a substitute for more recent books such as Michael H. Jackson's Galapagos: A Natural History, Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch, Oxford and Watkins's Galapagos: Both Sides of the Coin, Jonathan Green's Galapagos: Ocean, Earth, Wind & Fire, or Tui de Roy's Spectacular Galapagos. However, Beebe's book contains a wealth of information about the history of the Galapagos, particularly that of the various pirates and privateers who used it as a base of operations, and of Porter's operations against the British whaling fleet during the War of 1812. Beebe's descriptions of what land exploration was like on the Galapagos back in those days(very, very rough) made me very appreciative of the excellent work Ecuador has done in making these fascinating islands readily accessible to elderly and creaky folks like me. I was quite interested to note the changes in our understanding of the biology and geology of these islands that have taken place between the time the book was written (1924) and the present; science, like life, evolves. The technologies of photography and photographic reproduction have also evolved, fortunately; some of the old black and white photographs reproduced in Beebe's book are almost unrecognizable.Beebe visited the Galapagos long before they became a 'must see' holy site for those of us interested in geology and evolutionary biology; at that time a visit to the Galapagos was a major expedition requiring lots of money, a steam yacht, and lots of planning--definitely not a jaunt for a casual tourist. So, while he describes in some detail the devastating environmental impacts of pirates and privateers, whalers, rats, goats, and other exotic invaders, he makes no mention of the environmental impacts one might expect from large-scale tourism on these fragile islands. As a recent visitor, I must compliment Ecuador on its efforts to protect and preserve these islands while simultaneously allowing those of us who find them fascinating to make our visits.If you are interested in the Galapagos or are actually planning a visit, Beebe's book definitely should be on your reading list, along with more current material."},{"Title":"Jerusalem","review":"Selma Lagerlof's Jerusalem is one of my favourite books of all time. Anyone who speaks more than one language knows that to read a book in a language other than your native tongue can be a tiresome challenge. As a native English speaker, I was a little wary of reading this book in Swedish. However, the characters were so engaging, Lagerlof's descriptions of life in 19th century rural Sweden so beautiful, that I forgot that I was reading in Swedish. Even if you can't read the original I would recommend the English language version. Tales of separation and conflict surrounding differing religious beliefs are universal and Lagerlof depicts them brilliantly."},{"Title":"Jerusalem","review":"This is really a message to the previous reviewer, Rowena Suryobroto. It seems that you have missed THE SECOND HALF of the novel! ( Jerusalem has often been published in two parts, and the second part begins with the group reaching Israel.) Start looking for the second part right away!! Judging from what you thought of Selma Lagerlof's other works, you'll absolutely love Jerusalem, it's every bit as good as The General's ring. With the same insights into people's minds and hearts, Jerusalem is a story of goodness, love and loyalty, and of people ( finally ) realising what's important to them personally and standing up for that, no matter what others may think. Without giving away too much I'd just like to say that the ending is everything you might wish for, it leaves you fulfilled and with a smile on your face and in your heart."},{"Title":"Jerusalem","review":"Selma Lagerlof is too little known in the English speaking world.

He dared everyone in the town by taking his wife who had just released from the prison to the town church, bearing everyone's look on them. But the story itself is not about him, but his children.The first Ingmar had 3 daughters and 1 son. His eldest daughter married a moneyspender man, so after his death, the family of Ingmarsson got bankrupt. His son, young Ingmar wanted to be a teacher and did not care to buy back the Ingmarsson properties that had been lost. On the same time, a new wave of Christianity came into the town. It's the wave that telling everybody to pack up and go to Jerusalem because that is the only place in the world that will survive a doomsday. So everybody in town started to pack up their things.But still, the story was nothing about Jerusalem. Ingmar's sisters and their families prepared to go, and also Young Ingmar's love. And the story was ended by farewell from the people that were left in town and those who were leaving. But the story itself does not seem to be connected one another. The heart of Big Ingmar, the dubious and kind-hearted Young Ingmar, Ingmar's sister life, and finally, the farewell. The story seemed to be cut down, and with faraway related ending.I love Selma Lagerlof, but I don't understand her Jerusalem. What was she thinking, what was the topic itself, what was the message, I don't understand."},{"Title":"500 World's Greatest Golf Holes","review":"I got this book as a gift for my dad.

The first part of the book has a several page spread on each of the top 18 holes. Of course, as is to be expected, Pebble Beach's 18th and St. Andrews' 17th are among the 18. However, there are some darkhorses that made it such as Bethpage Black's 5th hole. All the great course's have made this book such as Augusta, Cypress Point, Shinnecock Hills etc. The spread on each hole in the top 18 has several beautiful color pictures as well as accompanying text. The next group is the top 100. Each has a two page spread with a description of the hole on one page and a glossy color photograph on the facing page. Several holes are featured on each page for the top 500. Later. the book ranks the top holes by categories such as &quot;top penal hole, top strategic hole,&quot; etc. This beautiful oversize volume is not one that you will pick up off the coffee table and peruse for a few minutes. Rather, it can provide years of pleasure as you browse through it over and over. The book has plenty of substance both quanitiatively (it is a large volume) and qualitaively. All golf lovers will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"500 World's Greatest Golf Holes","review":"This book is one of the most complete looks at top golf holes around the world that most golfers can hope to have. Since most of us cannot be scratch golfers, play on the pro tour, or get access to the world's most exclusive clubs, one of the top joys of being a golfer is playing on any great hole. The next best thing is to imagine or to remember playing such a hole. For 100 of 500 top holes, this book will help provide this indirect enjoyment by putting you visually on either the tee and the green of many outstanding holes with a decent-sized color photograph. For 18 of 500 top holes, you are able to do both.If you live in the parts of the world where golf is not available all year around, this book can also keep the spark alive (when you are not watching the Golf Channel).The book contains four main sections. The first looks at 18 great holes (par 72). In this section, you see the view from the tee and from the green, plus enjoy a drawing of the hole's topography and layout. An excellent essay describes the hole to flesh out the photographs.The second section examines 100 holes (25 par 3s, 50 par 4s, and 25 par 5s). Each hole contains a one page photograph and a one page essay. I was disappointed that some of the holes did not have the best photographic angle available. I suspect that the editors relied on whatever photograph worked best in this layout, rather than the photograph that best represented the hole. I graded the book down one star for this weakness.The third section is like a catalog, for it contains four holes per page with a tiny picture and a brief paragraph. I'm not sure what else could have been done, but perhaps it would have been better to feature fewer holes and done more with each one.The fourth section was my favorite, because it had lots of &quot;bests&quot; lists. These included the most difficult, heroic, penal, longest, mountain, water, hard to putt, and scenic. I especially liked the ranking of best holes by designer, those holes that are easiest to play on for the average person, and the ones that are hardest to get on to play.The editors have a pretty reasonable view of what they have accomplished here.&quot;Is our World's Greatest list definitive? We doubt it.&quot;&quot;Is it controversial? We hope so.&quot;&quot;Is it defensible? You bet it is. Have a look.&quot;Anyone who sees the book will have quibbles. The jacket cover has the 7th hole at Pebble Beach on it. Now that is a very scenic hole (and is the signature of Pebble Beach). The hole is very tough in a high wind. But on a calm day, it is one of the easiest holes in the world. I certainly wouldn't have put it on the jacket cover. The 18th at Pebble Beach would have been a better choice if you wanted to do one hole from that course.The process used was pretty exhaustive, but hardly definitive. For the United States, readers of Golf Magazine and its web site could make nominations. Editors of top publications around the world proposed the other holes. In the end 40 countries and territories are represented. The U.S. does seem overrepresented though. A lot of the holes are in here just because they are long. That's not so defensible these days when long hitters can conquer almost any hole in 2 shots to the green. The final choices were made at Carnoustie in 1999 during the British Open by the Golf Magazine editors, the 11 non-U.S. publication editors who had made the nominations, plus a representative each from St. Andrews and the U.S.G.A. Naturally, you have St. Andrews overrepresented in the book.I found that the list seemed overweighted toward the well-known holes (such as the 7th at Pebble Beach and the 17th at the Old Course in St. Andrews), but that makes it more interesting to the people who want to know more about those holes. Although the book has some material about famous moments on the holes, it would have been improved by doing much more of this. When I have played any of the holes in the book, it is the stories about competitive experiences by great golfers that have enriched the pleasure for me the most.On the other hand, Cypress Point is a course I am unlikely to ever play and the book has several holes from that club. I was very happy to see them beautifully laid out and described. I had the same reaction to many non-U.S. courses that I did not know about before.If you have the chance to travel, I think the best use of this book is to help you organize some golf vacations where you can access the courses. I have had it in my mind to play Pinehurst #2 for many years, and seeing the great holes from that classic Donald Ross course reminded me to do something about that desire.However you decide to enjoy this book, I am sure that it will expand your joy in the game . . . even if only as a spectator on a televised tournament.I suggest that you make a promise to yourself to play at least one of the holes though. That will make your journey through its pages much more fun!Have a great experience with these great holes!

Despite modern IT-technique, which increases the availability of such publications, an appropriate book is still superior. Now there is such a book for those who are interested in risk from a psychological point of view. Its title is: &quot;The Perception of Risk&quot; and it contains 26 of the most important publications by Paul Slovic from the last 25 years. It starts with an introduction in which Paul summarizes and gives his perspectives on his papers.No one who has come across the term risk perception can have missed Paul Slovic's name. As one of the leading scientists in the field of risk perception, Paul has covered large areas and tackled various problems in order to show how we view, react to, and handle situations and problems related to what we in common language call risk.To call him one of the founders of the psychometric paradigm is too plain a characterization of the scientific contribution of Paul Slovic. The psychometric methodology is just the means he has used to study how human beings perceive, judge and make decisions about risk in various situations. He has introduced psychological aspects of risk into natural sciences, where risk earlier has been considered as a numerical and objectively assessable quantity. Now physicists, chemists, and even engineers realize that risk perception cannot be ignored and is influenced by many factors (e.g. voluntariness, familiarity, dread, equity) relating to risk and how risk is described. For those who want to make risk comparisons, inform people about risks or do anything else regarding risk, it is necessary to be familiar with risk perception.With his great openness, Paul has been able to collaborate with scientists from many different areas, both scientifically and geographically. In this way he has improved and enriched his work with practical aspects in many domains, particularly radioactivity and use of chemicals. Therefore it possible for most scientists to find in this book interesting reading related to their own problems. The book only contains about an eighth (but a representative sample) of Paul's total scientific production. As the papers are ordered chronologically, it is easy to follow the development in time of different ideas and conclusions and to see how later studies derive from earlier ones in a logical way. Thus, in the two last chapters of the book, the ideas and views on risk are further expanded and offer exciting vistas for the future. In the same way as many of Paul's earlier ideas have been accepted and continued by later researchers, his recent views about &quot;the affect heuristic&quot; most certainly will be the subject for many future scientific publications.t.malmfors@chello.se"},{"Title":"PERCEPTION OF RISK","review":"I think this book is very easy to read even for non-native people.I am satisfied with the quality of contents.The information of each article is very practical and useful.Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth: His Life, Times, Cars, and Art","review":"Most people see Ed as an icon, which he was/is, few knew the man.

I also own the book \\"Rat Fink, the art of Ed Roth ( fantastic book) and \\"Kustom Kulture\\", and \\"Hot rods By Roth\\" And the \\"The hot rod world of Robert Williams\\"-- Uber genius artist who was art director and ad artist for Roth in his heyday--- all great books on a creative genius, both mechanically and artistically... (A real Big Daddy fan should get them all!) SO... I hesitated to order this book for fear it would mostly a rehash---Boy, was I wrong... All the other books do a fine job of showing various facets of Roth, his life and life's work--- but THIS book puts it all together following a timeline showing and explaining in detail Roth's progress through his very interesting up and down career.The custom cars, trikes, the model business, T-shirt business, his contact with the outlaw bikers who ultimatley turned on him, his personal and professional downfall are all detailed completly and in chronological order. If you get only one book on the late, great Big Daddy, I suggest this one. One interesting thing-- the book debunks a myth that most Roth fans have long taken for truth--- that the reason that his whole T-shirt, decal,and iron on business, and the show cars that promoted them AND the Revell models collapsed was his assoiciation with the Hells Angels AND the beautifully rendered but borderline offensive ads for his products---neither The Revell executives or Ed himself believed that.. The models just stopped selling, the world of show cars and everything that went with them had become passe'--- Ed blamed it on the Beatles---kids moved on from Hot Rods to rock and roll and all that went with that... the core of his business was based on capitilizing on fads, and the world had simply moved on... Until later...

Will Write for Food provides direction for continued reading, as well as guidance for focused writing; something every writer needs--to read and write more."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"What is food writing? Before I read Jacob's book, I thought I might learn a few techniques for writing restaurant reviews. Wow -- I was wrong! This is a huge, magnificent field, of which I've merely sampled my first appetizer.The author's research in compiling this book is extensive. In presenting her ideas, she doesn't limit readers to her own personal experience; she interviewed hundreds of successful food writers and asked them how they got started, what a typical day is like, and what advice they have to give.Despite her years of industry experience, Jacob truly understands the heart of a beginner, and her voice is as far from snooty-hooty as one can be. Readers will feel encouraged and energized after reading chapters on the secrets of restaurant reviewing, cookbook compiling, recipe writing (yes, it is an art form!), memoir and nonfiction food writing, and food in fiction.Jacob's passion is so contagious, her words dance across the page. She seems especially interested in the trend of narrative food writing, and she gives you tips on how to make your writing full of jolt and flavor. What are the three laziest adjectives used to describe food? She says \\"nice,\\" \\"wonderful,\\" and \\"delicious.\\" She writes, \\"They are so vague that readers don't know what you mean other than something positive.\\" Instead, she offers an extensive list of adjectives in chapter 5 that make it well worth the price of the book.I'm only a simple home cook. My creativity usually involves whipping up kid-friendly favorites without having to dash off to the grocery store for exotic ingredients. Although I've written a few of my own recipes, I certainly didn't realize what an exciting art form food writing can be.While reading this book, we ate out at a new restaurant, and I imagined myself as one of those fancy New York Times reviewers in disguise (didn't know they may actually wear wigs!). I had our waiter answering a myriad of questions, and even dashing back to speak with the chef. I brought home a menu and scribbled all over it my impressions.I'm intrigued as to how to better describe tastes and food. And I never considered children's books to be a place where good food writing can exist. After reading WILL WRITE FOR FOOD, I am much more aware. I appreciate the recommendation from Writer's Digest and will certainly add this to my bookshelf of favorites.I love the way she describes what it takes to make a great reviewer: [They] have passion, knowledge, authority, a great writing style, and stamina...They give the reader a feel for the place, its rhythm, and overall vibe. And they keep up their energy level and enthusiasm. Passion is paramount.\\"She quotes experienced food critic Alan Richman who says he can't wait to see what a restaurant has in store for him. He shares, \\"I get a hop in my step.\\"A well done book, indeed.--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester"},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"This is a great book about food writing. It has advice on writing cookbooks, restaurant reviews, articles, memoirs and fiction. Although I have written several cookbooks and many food-related articles, the excellent advice in this book will make my future books and articles even better. I also got ideas for new markets for my writing.One other thing I loved about this book were the quotes from food writers and exerpts from books. I now have a huge list of books I want to read.\\"Will Write for Food\\" is a book I will definitely refer to again and again."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"Like many people who have picked this book up, I'd like to someday write something about food, whether it be reviews, essays, a memoir, or a cookbook. Ms Jacob's step-by-step advice has proven inspiring, eye-opening, and realistic. Besides giving the how-to of getting published, she gives great tips for getting the creative, ahem, juices flowing. She also reminds us how competitive the field is and reminds us to start small, to take little bites (sorry). Finally, the book is chock full of references to books, websites, and groups that cover writing in general, writing recipes, finding agents -- the whole enchilada (I just can't help myself).The only reason she got docked a star is that the book is full of typos, mistaken words (like not even usage errors, but those are there too), missing words, and at least one case of apostrophe abuse. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I think that if you write a book on writing, you'd really best make sure it's flawless. Still, it's a book I might actually add to my personal library at some point. I'd highly recommend it if you're at all interested in writing about food, or even just writing in general."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"I can't believe no one came out with a book like this sooner. Thank you Diane Jacob. Finally a book that deals with the actual writing about food. I have read many books on how to publish magazine articles etc... but none of them deal with the actual style in which you write. I even attended a food writing workshop and to my dissapointment we barely touched on improving our writing skills. We were told \\"it can't be taught\\"."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"\`Will Write for Food' by culinary journalist and writing teacher, Dianne Jacob is a must read for everyone who has any intention on entering the culinary writing field. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, Ms. Jacob makes it clear that like virtually every worthwhile endeavor, success with culinary writing is difficult. As I have occasionally given some thought to trying my hand at submitting culinary writing for publication, I have thought that there may be some \`easy' markets, if I were just clever enough to find them. Ms. Jacob has convinced me that there are no easy markets, at least none which actually pay real money for publication. Even the seemingly \`easy' outlets such as local newspapers, magazines, and niche magazines have so many sources of either free or relatively inexpensive material that even these markets may be tough to crack. The major national markets such as \`Gourmet', \`Saveur', and \`Food and Wine' are virtually unreachable by the newcomer.The second most important thing about Ms. Jacob's book is that it does not intend to teach you how to write. She does give a few pages of suggestions and hints, especially on word usage in culinary applications are spread here and there around the book. And, a few references to sources on training for writing are given, including my very favorite \`The Elements of Style' by Strunk and White.Thus, the book is more about the food writing market than it is about writing. This is a very good thing, as all your writing efforts are worthless if you don't have a clear notion of your audience, your medium, and your medium's picture of their audience. And, the quantity and quality of sources, especially web sites given in this book are truly astounding. There is not a single culinary web site of which I am familiar that is missed, although the name of the TV Food Network web site is a bit out of date. And there are many, many more which are new to me. I am also happy to see that Ms. Jacob includes a mention of a personal web site or blog as a means of getting your writing in front of an audience. This is the modern world's version of self-publishing with even less overhead than a paper and hard covered book. She even mentions \`printing on demand' where the vendor only prints the physical volume when they receive an order for the book. All this means is that this is a very up-to-date manual on all your outlet alternatives.So, Ms. Jacob's primary focus is identifying all the culinary writing markets, finding the one which best suits your interests and skills, and giving you suggestions on how to maximize your success in each market. Along the way, there are lots of interesting bits of information on, for example, why there are so few negative restaurant reviews. From the newspapers' point of view, there is simply no point to publishing a highly critical review of a local eatery, even if they don't advertise in the paper. People give much more interest to suggestions on where to go than where not to go. Unfortunately, Ms. Jacob's book was probably in galleys when Ruth Reichl's \`Garlic and Sapphires' book was published, so there is no reference to that book. So, if you are really interested in restaurant reviewing, Ms. Reichl's latest book is also a must read.Along the way, Ms. Jacob quotes a really impressive range of successful culinary writing professionals, starting with Judith Jones (VP at Alfred A. Knopf and original editor for Julia Child, Madhur Jaffrey, Lydia Bastianich, and Diana Kennedy) and including Julie Sahni, Deborah Madison, Tony Bourdain, James Villas and Ruth Reichl. With all these bases covered, I'm surprised she has no mention of Michael Ruhlman who is both a major culinary journalist and collaborator in cookbook writing with Thomas Keller.As Ms. Jacob does not cover cookbook reviewing (my favorite culinary writing hobby), I will comment on her extensive tips on writing recipes. In general, I believe her tips are very good for the amateur or newbie recipe writer. And, I wish most cookbook writers would follow her suggestions. But, I believe there is room for more than one paradigm of a good recipe. Ms. Jacob gives us what may be called the Julia Child paradigm, where the author assumes little general culinary knowledge on the part of the reader. So, as most people react to Ms. Child's recipes, you have the feeling of the author's standing at your side and walking you through each step. This method is especially good for teaching traditional recipes to amateurs.A second paradigm may be called the Elizabeth David model, as you find in her books on Mediterranean, French Provincial, and Italian recipes. Here, the object is less to give detailed instructions than to cover as broad a field as possible, spending a lot of time on comparing and contrasting recipes from different regions. The recipes are not so sparse that a trained cook could not reproduce them, but doing so may require a fair amount of specialized culinary expertise.A third paradigm may be called the Joel Robuchon model, which is what I expect to find in any cookbook written on a restaurant's \`haute cuisine'. This model allows both unusual ingredients and difficult techniques, as the object of this writing is not so much to teach the amateur a recipe, but to simply tell us how it is done at the chef's famous venue. The best practitioner of this style is probably Thomas Keller and literary collaborator, Michael Ruhlman.At one point, Jacob advises against using a rather long list of words for culinary techniques in recipes. This list includes \`blanch', \`braise', \`fold', \`poach' and twelve other technical terms. I cannot disagree more on this point. The only case in which I would avoid these words is in a community fundraising cookbook. Any book written to teach should not hide its flame under a skillet!"},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"For the last year or so, I've been trying my hand at writing restaurant reviews.

Throughout the course of the book, she uses the expert opinions of heavyweights like Alan Richman, Jeffrey Steingarten, Judith Jones, Molly o'Neill, Ruth Reichl and Tom Sietsema to name just a few. The broad range of style and experience of her interviewees helps to bring together a solid image of what Food Writing exactly is.\\"Will Write for Food\\" has helped me refine my existing skills and has given me plenty of other resources as to how to acquire more.

I plan to keep Will Write for Food on my bedside table to remind myself of what it takes to be a food writer."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"I bought this book for an assignment in a freelance writing class. I'm not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. Jacob begins by admonishing her readers that food writing isn't as glorious and romantic as it might seem; it's actually a lot of hard work. This set the tone for what is to follow: a manual for complete novices. This book isn't for people who have taken writing classes and actually are, or are ready to delve into, writing as a trade. A lot of the text is given over to Writing 121 level information: show, don't tell, avoid vague adjectives, use the active voice and so forth. Some of the information, such as a rundown of the most popular platforms for blogging, is ubiquitously available anywhere and doesn't require a reference manual. The \\"how they got their start\\" bios of the big names in food writing, are somewhat interesting to read, but not really that useful to new aspirants. Molly O'Neil got lessons directly from MFK Fisher, that's not likely to happen to you.The section on cookbook writing supposes that a reader may not know what type of cookbook they wish to write and advises that reader to \\"look through [their] recipe collection.\\" I may be a novitiate to this whole business, but I'm pretty sure that if you don't know what kind of cookbook you would write, you're nowhere near ready to write a cookbook. Ironically, culinary professionals, who would seemingly be the ones with something valuable to add to the annals of instructional cooking literature, are encouraged to \\"hire a professional\\" to write their recipes for them. The insinuation being that, while a perfect neophyte might be capable of turning out a good cookbook, professional chefs are largely too daft to the needs of home cooks produce anything of value. As evidence that this is most certainly not the case I would direct readers to the \\"Au Pied de Cochon\\" cookbook written entirely by the staff at the eponymous restaurant and written in a style that the home cook may find intimidating but whose recipes are in fact perfectly suitable to the home kitchen. In contrast, many of the cookbooks coming from iconic restaurants today, whose recipes were surely written by professional writers, are entirely inappropriate for home cooking despite clear and simple instructions.Jacob has, however, clearly done a lot of homework on this book (and she has access to some of the more illustrious names in food writing) and there are some good tips plucked from interviews, experience, and reading. These little gems of advice shine and kept this reader going, but they are too few and far between to recommend the book."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"Out of all the food writing resource guides to choose from, on a \\"hunch\\" I chose this one, not being familiar with Dianne Jacob.

I think this is because this book is written like the pop psychology books you can buy at the drugstore or at the airport. You have to read a lot of filler to get to the information like chapters such as \\"Characteristics of a Food Writer\\" (it seems obvious to me that it would be anyone interested in food and writing). There is also a lot of irrelevant anecdotes that fill up the book without giving much practical help.If you have the time to go looking for information among statements such as \\"Passion is paramount\\" then there is good information, but my students (I teach culinary arts) want to get published right away so I got a different book for them (if you are interested in this topic the book I recommend isHow to Write about Food: How to Become a Published Restaurant Critic, Food Journalist, Cookbook Author, and Food Bloggerbecause the book gets right to the point with solid information, because it was written this year so the contact information for the food magazines and cookbook publishers is up to date, and because the author is a food critic and cookbook author so knows what works in the real world)It may be a small issue but as a teacher it bothers me that the title is so wrong. Jacob is not writing FOR food (unless she is really paid in gravy and potatoes?), she is writing ABOUT food or for MONEY. Wouldn't a real writer know this?"},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"I am so happy I bought this book. It has answered a ton of questions I had."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"Not very insightful. Worthless to anyone wishing to write cookbooks."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"This is an updated edition of the book that was originally published in 2005; the important new material is about food blogging. There's plenty of information that strikes me as useful, and I've certainly picked up a few tips. Some of the information is about what makes good writing, and if you've taken writing classes, a lot of that will be familiar to you. If you haven't taken writing classes, you'll get a lot out of the suggestions for making your writing clear and inviting. Jacob has chapters about how to write a blog people will want to read, how to write a cookbook (or memoir, novel, or children's book with a food theme) that editors will want to publish, how to work with those editors, and how to break into restaurant reviewing. It's good stuff.One of Jacob's recurring points is that you must be very careful about making sure your writing is clean. On p. 81: \\"Check for typos, spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and other faux pas\\" because these alienate the reader and make you look unreliable. But on p. 23 we see, \\"Research doesn't necessarily mean spending hours in a dingy library pouring over dusty tomes\\" (that should be \\"poring,\\" of course). On p. 154 she writes, \\"Good reviews are honest, fair, exercise good judgment, and are authoritative and accurate.\\" It's hard to edit your own writing, but a good copyeditor would have fixed that list so it was parallel: \\"Good reviews are honest and fair, exercise good judgment, and are authoritative and accurate.\\" A few errors like these in a first edition are excusable. Errors like these in a self-published book are expected. There are quite a few errors, though; it's the second time around for this book; and it's a book about writing by a woman who went to journalism school and has made a career as a writer. I expect Jacob and the publisher to be more careful.I didn't buy this book. I got it from the library to see if I wanted to own it, but I can't justify buying it. Yes, there's some valuable information, but I refuse to encourage the author and publisher by giving them money for a book about writing that has so many avoidable glitches in the writing."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"If your passion is food and you're unemployed or seeking a change, you may want to consider the food writing profession as presented by seasoned writer Dianne Jacob in Will Write For Food: The Complete Guide To Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction And More.

I don't write food reviews or a food blog specifically, but the information this book contains is valuable for any blogger as the author talks about how to draw people in, how to make it stand out, using photography, etc. What makes a good food blog will work for any other theme.The author writes in a conversational style that made this book easy to read, and also includes the advice of successful food writers.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and wasn't solicited.

It is an excellent introduction into the world of food writing. As someone who has never had a professional writing career, but has taken college writing courses, I found this book provides an excellent overview and practical tips.Beyond introducing you to the variety of opportunities available she includes passages from professionals in the industry on how they got started, what their typical day is like, and what they love about the job. There are also writing exercises to help you practice your skills and become comfortable with food writing and suggestions for more great resources you can check out including books, websites, and grad programs. Because of all this, it makes a great one stop guide for those just getting started. I originally checked it out from the library but ended up buying it because I found it so helpful that I wanted to refer back to it.What I also appreciate about this book is that it balances being encouraging with being realistic. This makes it clear that food writing jobs, especially those that are full-time, can be challenging to find, but are not entirely out of reach if you pay your dues and work hard.The only part of this book that, in my opinion, could benefit on expansion is on food writing opportunities on the web. While the book does touch on it, it seems worthy of even more coverage given the current opportunities in web writing. The fact that blog authors like Heidi Swanson of 101 Cookbooks and Clotilde Dusoulier of Chocolate & Zucchini were able to go from success as bloggers to success as cookbook authors says a lot about the web as a launching point. Many bloggers are also now opting to publish e-books over printed cookbooks in order to share their recipes with lower production costs. My guess is that the reason we do not see this more is the fact that blogging and other online food writing activities have been increasingly popular since this book was published. (Although, for the sake of clarity, both 101 Cookbooks and Chocolate & Zucchini were started in 2003.) If another version is released I highly recommend the author expand this area.Overall though I found this to be a very approachable and informative read and could not recommend it more to someone interested in exploring the world of food writing."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"An inspiring food writing with a stack of gastronimic literature to read through over a long weekend, I had a goal of finishing at least two of three books that were sitting on my coffee table. The first one I chose was \\"Will Write for Food\\" by Dianne Jacob. A food writer who's been writing since 1978, Dianne also instructs and coaches individuals and groups on becoming successful food writers. As she mentions in her book, she used to tell students to go check out books at the library about food writing to gain perspective of the business outside of class. After students repeadedly came back to her stating there were no books out there on food writing, Dianne decided she'd be the one to write it. So I guess one could say this is the first book published on the nuts and bolts of becoming a successful, professional food writer. I found the book incredibly helpful, honest and no-nonsense. Dianne has a gift for mixing honesty (don't quite your day job right away) with pep talks (just keep writing, you'll get there). She delivers practical advice and covers topics from writing cookbooks to the art of restaurant reviewing, pitching food article ideas to magazine editors to writing memoirs, and getting ficiton and nonfiction pieces published. The book also features a number of exercises at the end of each chapter for readers to stretch their creative muscles, like brainstorming exercises that assist in developing magazine article topics, writing your own food recipe and researching food and book publishing markets. Finishing the book inspired me to march forward and capture all the ideas floating in my head onto paper to get them closer to being published pieces of work. This is a book I will refer back to regularly."},{"Title":"Will Write for Food: The Complete Guide to Writing Cookbooks, Restaurant Reviews, Articles, Memoir, Fiction and More","review":"I have been looking for a guide that would help fulfill my ambitions in food writing, and Will Write For Food did exactly what it promised.

The great thing about Jacob is that she doesn't let you get any airy- fairy ideas into your head. She punches the reader in the belly with the hard facts about the industry. She draws you to question your motives, and lays down all the steps and challenges that you will face on the way as meticulously as a waiter Le Gavroche lays the table. Then, (and this is what I like most about this book, and her style of writing) she backs it up. She's done her homework so you don't have to.

However, we ran into a number of places where a road indicated as an &quot;other state route or major connector&quot; either required 4WD to pass, or was blocked by a locked gate. In my book, state routes and major connectors can be used by the general public, and probably in a passenger car - even in Nevada.However, the topographical representations are nice, and it was a good reference to have.

With the Nevada Atlas, they have finally achieved a visual appeal to match the level of detail they have always provided. Traditional relief lines are enhanced by subtle, three-dimensional shading, so that one seems to be looking at an aerial view of the state. They have also refined rivers, lakes, roads, and other surface features to be more detailed and accurate. A welcome improvement!"},{"Title":"Nevada Atlas & Gazetteer","review":"I was disappointed with the Delorme Atlas. In trying to get from Las Vegas to Death Valley, I had to turn back twice when I encounted rough gravel roads. I finally gave up on Delorme and went back to my AAA map.

This ranks among the top 3 books in my collection. It is simply stunning in its construction and in the uniqueness. The photographs are not only visually impressive but they simply speak to your soul. It has become quickly one of my favorite items to view. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"It is rare to find a book that is so beautifully made, that it immediately strikes a strong positive aesthetic nerve, such as this Exhibition Catalogue of \\"Ashes and Snow\\" by Gregory Colbert. The design is \\"over-the-top\\" in originality, and no two books are the same in that they are hand made from raw materials, in a style reminiscent of early published titles. The images contained in this book capture the essence and beauty of the current Exhibition, and are terrifically reproduced for this book. If you have not seen the Exhibit, then the quality of the images will certainly provide an excellent sampling of Colbert's work; but, if you have seen the Exhibition with larger-than-life art, this work will bring back those beautiful images. This is an OUTSTANDING Exhibition Catalogue, which pushes the envelope on originality, created to be as beautiful as the works it contains. Kudos to Colbert and his design team! FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"This is one of the most moving books I have ever been blessed to put my eyeballs on. The images are haunting, poignant, irresistable, and inexpressibly beautiful. Their presentation in handmade italian paper, with the cover made from Nepalese paper, is breathtaking. I saw the exhibit in New York City, and would travel the six and a half hours (each way) by bus just to see this exhibit again. Absent my ability to do that, this beautiful little book will feed my heart and soul for years to come. Sure it is expensive. How often can you nourish your soul with beauty as compelling, as spiritual, as moving, as transcendant as this? It is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"The Nomadic Museum, a facility constructed onsite in various locales (now in Santa Monica, CA) out of boxcars, cartons, and pipes is in itself an artwork and the peripatetic museum houses some wispy photographs by Gregory Colbert of moments of world observation that in context are strangely moving. The object is to bring the spirit of mankind into a space outside the usual exhibition venues and in doing so it becomes an experience for the people.The catalogue that accompanies this show is equally impressive in its conception. No two books are alike in that they are created from handmade Italian paper and bound in a cover made from unique paper from Nepal. The photographs reproduced well in the catalogue languish from being reductions of the oversized images form the exhibition, but the flavor is there. Images of robed children and adults, animals both alone and in tandem with humans, bits and pieces of atmosphere form a journeyman's eye take on a significance that surpasses the original works.The catalogue for the exhibition is pricey due tot he one of a kind quality of presentation. But for those who want to forgo the expense, there is also a version of the images (paperback with 48 pages as opposed to the 232 pages of this volume) available through this site. If you are unable to experience the exhibition (for that is truly what the exhibition is about) then this art book form of the catalogue is a substantive memento of a unique artistic experience. Grady Harp, January 06"},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"I cannot highly enough recommend either the exhibit or any of the accompanying materials: books, poster, etc. We waited to see this for 2 years, until it went to CA.I bought the full exhibition catalogue, the DVD of the 60 minute film and two posters and are extremely happy with everything. Everyone we show them to is excited and fascinated by the pictures and the artist.I can't imagine being disappointed at all."},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"I recently attended the Ashes and Snow exhibition in New York. The show was good,if a bit reptative. Its location, The Noamadic Museum is an engineering marvel and seems more like a gothic cathedral than shipping containers (Frankly seeing the photos in the building is a truly awesome esperience). After the show I went to book store to pick up the catalog and found it was selling on site for $130. This is way way too much money for what you're getting. Like all of the materials for sale connected to the exhibit you're paying for the presentation rather than the pictures themselves, all of which are reproduced in a much too small size. What you're paying for is the binding and while the binding might, with some better interior material, be worth $130 or more, here its simply a major rip off. Gregory Colbert has those of us who like his work over a barrel and he's going to squeeze every last penny from us. While I do like the images, I can not recommend anyone buying the catalog, or any other material connected with the show, at the wildly inflated prices they are asking.Go see the show instead, its only twelve bucks and you get to see the glorious space they've built to house it."},{"Title":"Ashes and Snow: New York Exhibition Catalog","review":"She loved it"},{"Title":"Completing the Course: A Fairy Tale Set in the School of Life","review":"What a magnificient short book! What this author does in 126 pages most authors cannot do in three or four times the space. This is a story of coming of age, coming out, friendship, facing one's inner demons and so much more. The author had me hooked before I finished the first chapter. I've just finished the first chapter of his latest work, The Boy in the Book, and, once again, he has me hooked."},{"Title":"Pubis Angelical","review":"A novel which is critcal of the objectification of females and their subjugation at the hands of men but a novel which offers no alternative depiction. The women in the novel have little identity other than as objects and, for the most part, accept this role with token resistance. The most fleshed out (and yet singularly vapid character) in the novel lies helpless in hospital and is, even at death's door, subject to the will of the man/men in her life.Half-baked really.Re other reviews: yes, at the end of the day, the novel is really not worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"In my mind, a good book is one that's hard to forget, one that you think about long after you finish it. If you agree and enjoy fantasy, then this book is definitely one you will want to look into. I read the first three Dalemark books before this one, so by the time I got to it, I was almost in a frenzy to finish it. When I did, I had to sit around for a long time afterward, just thinking about what I'd read. I always say that any book that can be described as \\"heartbreaking\\" is not for me, but I really, really liked this book, though that description is still apt. (I cried when I read it, but hey, that's me.)Another thing I really enjoy about Diana Wynne Jones' books is that they are like giant puzzles, and they don't quite fit until the very end, and everything just locks into place. In this respect you can liken them to the Harry Potter novels, so if you have read them but are unfamiliar with Diana Wynne Jones you may want to try this.Though the size of the book is formidable, it is one that makes you want to read it more than once, and one that is just as impressive, just as heartbreaking, and just as wonderful every time. Read this quartet. And then read all her other books. You'll be doing yourself a favor."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"I thought The Crown of Dalemark was easily the best book in the Dalemark quartet. But dont get me wrong, they are all very good. This book has lots of adventure, and lots of wit. Mitt might be one of my favorite characters ever! If you are thinking about reading this book (which you should) you should definitely read the first three books in the quartet (Cart and Cwidder, Drowned Amment, The Spellcoats) to understand what is going on, but I think you can still understand it without reading the third. Try Diana's other books to, but this one, in my opinion, is the best!"},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"I read this book two months ago, and I am still rereading it over and over. It is the saddest, sweetest, funniest, adventurest book I have ever read. This was the first book that made me cry. I think that it has changed my life and that it will be one of my favorite books of all time and on my list, it's tied with Harry Potter. Please read these books, they will change the way you look at life- Claire Tuley age 12"},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"_The Crown of Dalemark_ is the concluding volume of the Dalemark Quartet. Oddly, this book didn't appear until 14 years after the last of the preceding three: in 1993. Yet it's not an afterthought -- the series clearly needed a closing volume -- I wonder why Ms. Jones waited so long. At any rate it's a solid conclusion, much longer than the first three books, a bit darker in tone (though really all four books have dark overtones), and a logical and different than expected resolution to the situation set up in the first books.There are two main characters in this book -- Mitt, also one of the heroes of book 2 (_Drowned Ammet_), and Maewen, and girl from the future of Dalemark -- a time very roughly corresponding to our own time in terms of technological development. Maewen, while visiting her father (her parents are separated), meets a couple of strange individuals. One, she soon learns, is Kankredin, the evil wizard from _The Spellcoats_, while the other is another of the Undying. This character maneuvers her back into the past, to take the place of Noreth, a girl from Mitt's time who looks just like Maewen. Noreth was a descendant of the rightful King of Dalemark, and she had planned to find the four objects that only the King can use (a cup, a ring, a sword, and a crown) and reclaim the Crown of Dalemark and reunite the sundered kingdom. But Noreth disappeared before she could accomplish this, and Maewen must walk the roads of Dalemark to find these objects in her place. The powers that be, naturally enough, oppose Noreth's quest, and she is stalked by assassins. One of these is Mitt, who is blackmailed by his Northern hosts into going after Noreth -- but after meeting her Mitt refuses, and soon he joins her tiny entourage, along with the hero of Book 1 (_Cart and Cwidder_): Moril the Singer, as well as another Singer, and the clever but perhaps not trustworthy southern nobleman who was also exiled to the North with Mitt, and the Undying who has sent Maewen here.Maewen, Mitt, and the others wander about the countryside, often in rather magical fashion, tracking down the four objects, but also trying to elude the assassins, and eventually armies, which are trying to stop. Maewen's only goal is to give the objects to the man she knows became king: Amil the Great, the man who more or less singlehandedly founded modern Dalemark. But who could he be? There is no sign of him. The resolution is surprising and rather effective. Jones makes excellent use of the rather unusual magic &quot;system&quot; (though it's not really systematic, and is perhaps more effective for that) that she has established, especially the Undying, who are like gods but not by any means omnipotent or even all-knowing. The four books represent a very solid work of YA fantasy."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"Well, I must say, the first three were okay. I don't know, I don't think I needed to have read them at all. In fact, I first read Drowned Ammet, then the Spellcoats, then this book, then Cart and the Cwidder...and I understood the Crown of Dalemark fine without reading the Cart and Cwidder. This though, was THE most awesome book! Looking at this I now remember what the cover of the book looks like; mine has long since been ripped off because of being shoved in and out of my locker and carrying it to classes. I will never get sick of this book, it is, without a sliver of a doubt, among the best books I have ever read. I think I say that for a lot of the books I read, but this one I mean it. The ending though...I'm not saying it was bad, it was excellent! But I hate endings like that...it's a matter of personal opinion, I think. So PLEASE let there, in the future, be a sequel to this book! I know it's a quartet, but I want to know what happens! Oh well, if you havn't read any of the series yet, I would suggest you read this book first. If you really enjoy it, go on to read the other three to get more detail on the characters. This book was THE BEST!"},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"Someone, the other day, asked me why I read fantasy, and the example of this book jumped instantly to my mind. Diana Wynne Jones' brilliant books are always at their apex of brilliance the second time one reads them, and I happen to have very recently read this one for the second time. Now, I myself did not love the previous books in the Dalemark quartet quite so much as I have other DWJ books, but this one is truly great. It has fantastic characters and a wonderful plot, as well as, I think, the single most intriguing conversation I've ever read (hint - it's with Alk and you can't understand its sheer brilliance until you get further on). Perhaps the reason why it becomes even better the second time is that one realizes upon reading it just how much of the shocking plot twists were presaged. One of them, I think, can be figured out completely before it's revealed, but is so unbelievable that no one will ever do it, IMHO. The book also has considerable depth, as well as fun. Try to figure out whether or not time travel to the past can alter the future - as well as what all the main characters believe. Intriguing! After closing this book for the second time, the two words that came first to my mind were &quot;inherently cool.&quot; And it is."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"i finished this book about a year ago and since then i have re-read it at least five times. in fact i have read just about every diana wynne jones book and she is one of my favorite authors because there are such great images and feelings that everyone can relate to, as opposed to most fantasy books. i just wish she would write one more book about what happens to maewen even though i love the way the book ends.=) peace out"},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"Diana Wynne Jones has the ability to draw you completely into her world, engage you absolutely with her characters, and carry you along on her story, so that, reaching the end, you return unwillingly to real life, realising that it is 4am, you have work, college or school tomorrow, and you want to read it all over again. Her books have always had this effect on me, since I first stumbled over &quot;the ogre downstairs&quot; at the age of 11. 23 years later and she's still doing it, and this is her best(yet). A tremendous story, that stands alone, but is the superb culmination to a quartet of real enchantment. I dare you try to put it down once open!"},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"This is, without question, a classic. Set in Dalemark, a fantasy country divided down the middle into North and South, Noreth, who claims to be the One's daughter, sets out to ride down the green roads to claim her crown in King Hern's city, Kernsburgh. Unfortunately, she disappears before she can begin.In her place is Mayelbridwen Singer, called Maewen, a girl from twentieth century Dalemark hijacked to take Noreth's place. On her journey she is accompanied by Mitt, Navis, Moril, Hestefan and Wend, all of whom we know from the three previous books. Mitt is from the South, now a refugee because of the plot to kill Navis' father, the tyrant Earl Hadd. However, Navis is also a refugee, here with his daughter and son, who are separated from him. Moril is a Singer with a magical cwidder, and he is with Hestefan, another Singer. Wend is one of the Undying, who are either gods or extremely rare people who simply never die. Together they set out.Maewen decides that she needs to get the Adon's gifts, a ring, cup and sword, to prove her claim as Noreth. Mitt is given the ring by his friend, Alk, and in Gardale, at the Lawschool, Navis steals the cup while visiting his daughter, Hildy, who is an aristocratic snob (a great disappointment from Drowned Ammet). They find the sword in the house of the witch, Cennoreth, but Maewen, who has been instructed by a disembodied voice that she assumed was the One to kill Mitt and Navis, then Moril, finds that Mitt and Moril think it is Kankredin, an ancient and extremely wicked sorcerer. They learn who she really is at that point, and continue to Kernsburgh, where they are confronted by Alk, who tells them that Maewen cannot be Noreth because Noreth's body was found with its throat cut. Maewen admits she is not Noreth.They all continue to Kernsburgh, where they know they will find an army, because originally Mitt was set out to kill Maewen by Earl Keril and Alk's wife, the Countess of Aberath. They are joined by Luthan, Noreth's rather sappy cousin, on the way. In Kernsburgh, they find an army--of Southern men, and the Northerners hold them off while Moril makes a special world with the cwidder and the children (who now include Mitt, Moril, Maewen, Kialan--Earl Keril's son, and Ynen, Navis's son) find themselves in King Hern's ancient armory, where King Hern himself greets them and surprisingly crowns Mitt king. There is a special aspect to this because Mitt and Maewen are seemingly in love (which is very plausible). Mitt reappears and is acknowledged as king, they defeat Kankredin and Maewen is sent back to her own time.There she realizes that Kankredin is gathering himself again, and gets ready to try and defeat him herself (she is also still grappling with the thought that all of her friends are dead). At the moment in question, Mitt suddenly reappears and vanquishes Kankredin. And it ends with Maewen realizing that Mitt is of the Undying. It seems to me that this book needs a follower, or at least an epilogue, but nevertheless, it is wonderful and everyone should read it (but read the first three first)."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"I absolutely adore this book. The series itself is kind of weak, but this as a concluding volume brings back all the characters from the previous three and introduces Maewen, a girl from modern-day Dalemark who is jerked back in time to fill the place of Noreth. OKay. Dalemark is divided down the middle--North and South. Mitt and Navis are from the South, but now they are refugees in the North (they're from Drowned Ammet, and Mitt is in deep trouble: he has to kill someone. She's Noreth, a girl who firmly believes that she's the daughter of the One, one of the Undying, which are Dalemark's gods, and she also firmly believes that she is born to unite Dalemark and become their queen. And so Mitt(who is fifteen) and Navis (who is grown up) join her party. Only: Noreth disappears just before the start and Maewen takes her place. So Maewen (not really having any choice) fills in for her. They are joined by Moril and Hestefan the Singers (Moril's twelve or so and he's from Cart and Cwidder and his cwidder--that's a kind of lute--can do magic). On their ride to Kernsburgh, the ancient destroyed capital city, Maewen learns a lot about her country's history, meets some of the Undying (some people in Dalemark aren't gods--they just never die), and learns that she must get the Adon's gifts (the Adon was a legendary hero), and gets them. Noreth claimed she talked to the One, and Maewen hears a voice guiding her. There are also several attempts on her life, and she falls in love. But by the time they reach Kernsburgh, everyone knows who she truly is, and as they search for the lost crown of the great King Hern, they realize who the real king is. This is a brilliant and moving story and I recommend it to everyone (but read the other three first)."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"This has to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time!

Tying off the Dalemark series years later, long after the original readers (this one included) had grown up, this book is a little weaker than the others. One reads it more out of loyalty to Jones than out of a desire to keep turning the pages. Things are not really tied together. You have to read it, of course, because it's a Diana Wynne Jones book, but don't get your hopes up too high. Buy the paperback."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"I thought that this book was an amazing conclusion to the Dalemark series, but the last chapter was rather disapointing. It gets you all hyped up about some huge battle with kankredin (the mage of mages) but he pretty much gets beaten in a second. Then you get all excited about Maewen and Mitt reuniting, but that never happens either (or does it?? it ends before you find out) It seems that there should be more to the end. Some questions are left unanswered such as:1)Does Mitt still love Maewen?2)Does Maewen even find Mitt again?3)Is Maewen one of the Undying too?4)Does Cennoreth help Maewen get back together with Mitt???I just wish that some of these things were answered, and maybe the book had a few more chapters -- or and epelogue would be nice."},{"Title":"The Crown of Dalemark : Book 4 of The Dalemark Quartet (Dalemark Quartet)","review":"I liked most of the book, but I wish the author had writen another one to tell us what happened to Maewen.

This book is filled with Biblical guidance (verses) and is not just a man's opinion. If you are born again and love Jesus, you no doubt want to raise your children \\"in the fear and admonition of the Lord\\". This book shows the error with many unbiblical approaches to salvation (God shaped hole, Jesus will make your life better, ect.) and explains exactly how to share your faith with your child in order that God can produce Godly sorrow, a humble heart, true repentance and faith in Jesus Christ in your child.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"The information covered in this book is so incredibly vital to your future, your children's future, and your nations future. You must read it or at least listen to the CD. I believed in God since I can remember, and I thought I was a Christian. It turns out I only had an intellectual belief which did not last through high school. Like 88% of children raised in an evangelical Christian home, I fell away from church, the Bible and God in high school. I was a false convert, and if I had died in my first 4 years of my military service, I would have gone to hell. No doubt about it. Please read this book or buy it for someone who has or will have children or who works with children. (a pastor, sunday school teacher, nursery worker, school teacher, nun, priest, etc.). There is nothing more important than being in a right relationship with our heavenly Father through Jesus Christ and knowing our eternal destination. Your children's souls are of infinite value. Take the time to read this and apply it."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"I've lurked around the web site Way of the Master a few times, watching videos about how Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron evangelize, and I found their personalities upbeat and engaging but was put off by the approach Comfort has used many times in their videos. It seemed as though he did the same thing time after time. At the same time, I have wanted to learn to tell people about how to come to Christ, and couldn't figure it out. So I put off getting this book, while wondering if it might help.Finally I took the plunge and ordered it. I'm only maybe a third of the way into it, and find it explaining what I want to know. Ray Comfort in writing about evangelism is much more complex than the Ray Comfort I saw in the videos. In fact, so far his is the best explanation of how to go about evangelism that I have read. At the same time, his writing is so simple and fun to read. He uses lots of humor and down-to-earth illustrations, and practical ideas from his experience as a parent.The subject I appreciate most so far is his explanations regarding false conversion vs. true conversion. Here's a tip I really appreciated: \\"To check your child's understanding of salvation, ask if he thinks he is a good person. He will almost certainly say that he is, if he has no knowledge of sin....\\" Comfort then explains how to use the Law to speak to the conscience of the person rather than addressing their intellect right off the bat, though both parts of us need \\"food\\". (I guess that this would be addressing a person's spirit rather than their mind.) Now I see more in what Comfort is doing in the videos I have watched at Way of the Master.I'm really looking forward to finishing the book and seeing whether I can try out some of these things. More and more I see what Jesus said, \\"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\\" My heart is full of happiness and gratefulness to God that Mr. Comfort has written this down."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"If you read between the lines, you should be able to pick up the message that's central to this book: Jesus loved all the children, except for the redheaded ones.Ray outlines a bulletproof plan that skewers the false converts. False converts are my most-hated kind of converts. They're all like, \\"Yes, we believe in Jesus, but NO we're not in it for the right reasons.\\"I just can't figure these phonies out. No one cares if you have expensive clothes in church and that you may be doing some strange things behind closed doors that Jesus would frown upon. It's about the FAITH, people. When are you gonna get that through that thick skull of yours?So make sure you do whatever Ray says, because he knows more about life than you because he is from a place called Australia, which is known for kangaroos and koalas and bengal tigers. God loves Ray and forgives his multitude of flaws. I do too."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"Ray Comfort has produced another volume on evangelism, and this time it strikes home more personally than any of his excellent books. He points out how the overwhelming majority of children from Christian families eagerly leave the church once they hit their 18th birthday--a tragic commentary on the ineffectiveness of American christianity today. Comfort cites from his own role as a father on how to lead your kids to a sound salvation in Christ. This man's ministry is an answer to prayer for the ever-darkening times we live in! Many thanks to this one-of-a-kind teacher/author."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"\\"We don't understand how our son John could be living such a wicked life! We raised him in church and did everything right!\\" Ever hear these words uttered by godly parents in your church? The sad fact is that they probably DID do most things right -- except lead little Johnny to genuine salvation. As Ray Comfort emphasizes in this small book, bringing your children to Christ (and keeping them there) involves far more than a \\"sinner's prayer\\" at age four.Those already familiar with Comfort's ministry will recognize his message here. Most of the book focuses on teaching your children about God's Law to bring conviction of sin so that they will recognize that they are guilty before God and need a Savior. As in most of his other works, Comfort uses the Ten Commandments to show that we are indeed individually guilty of sinning against God's holy Law. Only when we realize this can we repent and humbly accept the free gift of salvation through Christ.What's different in this book is that Comfort shows how to communicate these truths on a child's level, often suggesting helpful visual aids and object lessons. For example, how do you sensitively tell a young child what it means to commit adultery? Comfort also warns about the dangers of prematurely leading a child to \\"salvation\\", since children usually want to please Mommy & Daddy and can easily be manipulated into doing something they don't understand (producing the \\"false conversion\\" of the book's subtitle). His do's and don't's are very practical.The rest of the book deals with other fairly basic guidelines for raising godly kids, such as:**Making sure our lives back up what we say (since children are very sensitive to hypocrisy),**Guarding against worldly influences -- sinful entertainment, wrong friends, and the humanistic indoctrination of public schools (AMEN!),**Having daily family devotions,**Warning your kids about the dangers of alcohol, smoking, and immorality, and**Letting your kids observe your concern for the lost.There are other great books on Christian child rearing that go into much more detail, but this little classic is foundational. I firmly believe that God is powerfully using Ray Comfort to call the church back to true biblical evangelism. I highly recommend this book -- it would make a great gift for any believing parents-to-be!"},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"Are you concerned about your children's salvation? This is the book for you! Having children myself, I went searching for a book that would address whether their salvation was, in fact, true. Of course, while God only knows their hearts, I still felt that I would not be fulfilling my parental duty if I didn't do my homework.I found this book very easy-to-understand, profound and convicting! There is a chapter at the end of the book that addresses the outside influences we allow into our childrens' lives. This was painful to read as I realized how subtle the enemy is, and how easy it is to be conformed to the standards of the world.I believe this will change your whole way of witnessing to your own children. I've already begun using this book as a guideline on talking to my children about their salvation."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"I read this book and handed it out like candy to my friends. He explains that it's not a guarantee to keep your children, but adds that we need to balance the love of Christ and the Fear of God so that they know they will still be accountable to someone even when no body is looking-because God is. He stresses and gives practical examples on the 10 commandments to teach our children about them and how to remember them. Another book to read to children is The Way of the Master for Children. Good beginning for preschool and the rest of the book to give children a firm foundation why they believe in God. Both awesome books!"},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"First, for the theologians out there, Ray Comfort, addresses the subtitle of the book \\"and Keep Them There\\", (as in how to keep your children saved once they've been saved). He basically says that's not theologically possible for a parent to do, but the subtitle gets your attention and is a much better substitute for the paragraph-long biblically-correct alternative title, which he does share with you in the book. I appreciated that matter being dealt with first. This addresses an issue that few Americans realize exists: the fact that there is such a thing as false conversion. In my own experience that looks something like this: \\"Billy\\" was \\"saved\\" at a youth gathering when he was 9 years old. When he became a teen, he rebelled and lived like any unbelieving person might live. There was never any evidence of his salvation. Billy's parents say, \\"That boy is getting into trouble with the law, doing drugs, drinking, and watches porn online...thank goodness he was saved when he was 9.\\" Comfort teaches that this results because sin is not really taught much anymore, but rather a powerless, false, easy-believism-fire-insurance type salvation is taught. Comfort teaches you how to use the 10 Commandments (God's moral law) to teach about sin and one's need for forgiveness. While Comfort does not preach salvation by works, he clearly shows biblical proof that evidence of a righteous life is the result of true biblical salvation. The book is very practical for parents. He offers ways to impart biblical truth to your children in child-friendly ways, such as a fun, family bible time that leaves children wanting more. The message for parents is that faith that leads to salvation is straight from God, but parents can cultivate rich soil in their children by consistently investing time in the spiritual nurture of their children, realizing the difference between true and false conversion, and using God's moral law to help them grasp their need for the Savior, Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"Ray Comfort's message is consistently that true conversion is the result of the person understanding their need for a savior because they've trangressed God's law.

I highly recommend this book and any book written by Ray Comfort."},{"Title":"How to Bring Your Children to Christ..& Keep Them There: Avoiding the Tragedy of False Conversion","review":"If you are interested in learning how to give your child all of the gospel story, this is the book for you.

Ray takes his parenting experience and shows you how to discipline, instruct, and train your kids in a godly way. It's filled with practical help for parents who want their kids to love Jesus. He deals with issues like schooling decisions in a biblical, straight shooting way that I've never heard before. In a day when a lot of the \\"Christian\\" parenting books and magazines give secular and unbiblical advice, this book is a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"Adventuring on Cayman Brac","review":"When it comes to the Brac, I've been going there for well over a decade, and I picked up this book mostly just to have a complete set of references.And when it comes to guidebooks, I'm usually pretty hard to be impressed. But Skip's comprehensiveness and thoroughness across the full gambit completely knocked my socks off.The book is a quality piece all the way around: good photo's, excellent maps, and great references: I recognized citations from limited print Cayman Trust publications, including the &quot;Storm of '32&quot; and &quot;Duppies Is&quot;I'm not a climber, but I am aware that the Brac became a climber's destination in the '90s, although the info had been pretty hard to find...until now. Skip's well organized compilation looks to me to be &quot;The Bible&quot; for Brac-bound climbers.I am a diver, and his moored sites are covered well enough. The only significant suggestion I can make is that it would have been wonderful if Skip could have gotten permission to reprint the UW topology illustrations originally published in Shlomo Cohen's &quot;Cayman Diver's Guide&quot; (ISBN 965-362-0053), which was last printed in 1990, and not particularly easy to find.When it comes to shore diving, most diving guidebooks pretty much claim that there is none on the Brac. This is where Skip's book is a goldmine: my shore diving list just flat out doubled, and it looks like I only know of one spot that Skip didn't already have.Skip also has an excellent reference section, and does a great job in the photo's throughout the book in putting names to local faces.Overall, this is a great guidebook, a virtual &quot;must&quot; for any Brac traveller who's really interested in the island and who is going to spend time there. It knocked my socks off, but for trips to the Brac, that's a good thing, because its where we get barefoot for a week at a time :-)-hh"},{"Title":"Adventuring on Cayman Brac","review":"I live on the Brac and use this book as a reference.

Her journey takes her to the tribe settlement at the base of the Grand Canyon, where tribe members existed with little or no contact with the outside world. The story of this tribe, along with their culture and existence in the Grand Canyon is unknown to many. The book is filled with fascinating accounts of the people of the tribe and the struggles they have faced.

Their position puts current events into a perspective that helps the reader to appreciate the nuances and subleties included in articles about the Middle East presented in the media.

The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"If you are curious and seek some real knowledge on the subject, the book is a must read. The book goes well beyond what is commonly said and written about Antisemitism. The authors do an excellent job explaining the root cause of hatred against Jews in a way that both Jews and Non-jews can digest.Admittedly, the book can be &quot;trying&quot; at times as it describes atrocities and documents what, unfortunately, intelligent and influential people have said to spread hatred against Jews. It offers little about those who have condemned the hatred. Also, I wish the last chapter &quot;What is to be done?&quot; could be more definitive and uplifting. I'm not asking for a happy, feel-good ending, just some hope. The book left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth. The feeling is that the hatred continues in the wake of post-September 11th rhetoric against the West, Americans, and, big surprise, the Jews."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I read it because I wanted to know where antisemitism came from and this book mostly answers that question, or at least offers one viewpoint. Tries to boil it down to four key reasons and then elaborates on each of those reasons.I purchased and read this book before learning of the conservative view of Prager, and now I can see that in a lot of the comments (e.g. maligning the Jewish left). It comes out very much as having a bone to pick with certain targets and it was in those chapters/passages that I could see what they were up to and just breezed ahead to the next section that wasn't so biased.A decent background into the question but be advised of the bias within."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"This is a very interesting book, and anyone seeking to answer this question, should definitely read this. It makes one want to know more about Jewish history."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Prager is a bit on the outside from the very beginning on this one. And for a topic that goes over as much space and time as this one, I don't suspect that definite answer can ever be reached.A whole lot of questions come up:1. The authors divide the world into three places: a. Those that want to actively destroy Jews; b. Those that support countries/ civilizations that want to destroy them; c. The United States. But it is so interesting: There are many elements within the United States that are making a very slow, determined effort to destroy it from within (ACLU, academia). It seems like there are proportionally many more Jews in those places. With respect to things outside of the United States, the left wing gives a lot more moral support to Islamism (the red-black-green axis)-- or at least gives them a sympathetic hearing. More of people giving those sympathetic hearings are Jewish. And so the question asks itself: \\"If you find yourself on the opposite side of what's in your best interest, where IS the enemy? Is it out there or is it in the mirror?\\"2. No hatred has been as persistent as Anti-Semitism? Try walking a mile in the shoes of a black person. (Black Like Me).3. What is with these circular definitions. People don't hate Jews because of [insert specific Reason X]. They hate them because they are Jewish and only because they are Jewish. But then what is being Jewish? And is that definition exclusive? (Do all people who are defined in that way inspire such hate? And does such hate correspond to only those types of people?)4. There are some things on which the authors are flat-out wrong. There is a genetic component to being Jewish, and there is a such thing as Jewish race and an average Jewish IQ. For recent examples of this:Legacy:A Genetic History of the Jewish PeopleandThe 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution. They are also flatly wrong about conversions. I have been working to find an Orthodox Rabbinical Court somewhere on this Earth that will convert me. There appears to be none-- in spite of the fact that one Rabbi and two Orthdox Jewish men would be enough to make said court for said conversion.The authors essentially come up with four reasons that people hate Jews:1. They have their own God, which they consider to be the God of all mankind-- thereby implicitly lowering the value of local Gods.2. Their notion of Divine Election (the Chosen People).3. Attempts to make moral demands on others (even if the moral demands are not in the name of \\"religion\\")/ change the world.4. Envy of their superior status.But as I see it, then Chinese people could (without much stretching) also fit onto the definition of Jews.1. They have their own God/ founding myth (the Chinese state at some times and the mythical Yellow Emperor at others) and consider their civilization to be the foundation of/ prior to all others.2. They have something like a notion of Divine Election (because China is the Middle Kingdom and all other barbarian countries on the periphery learn from its example).3. Attempts to make moral demands on others/ change the world. China became a very large country over many centuries in the process of trying to foist Han culture off onto other places/ absorbing neighboring countries. (They have been mostly successful at that.)4. Overseas/ Diaspora Chinese in SE Asia have a shorter history than Diaspora Jews (it's been so long since the Second Temple was destroyed that that word does not even make sense), but they live better than their neighbors in Malaysia/ Indonesia/ Philippines. Those people also live in intact families and are better educated than their neighbors (at least in the Diaspora).Yet has the hatred of Chinese people been as severe/ persistent/ traumatic as it has of Jews? Not quite. And some authors (Thomas Sowell) have suggested that the Chinese domination of SE Asia is much greater than any comparable Jewish hegemony.The authors give another example of Amish people. (This is one example of MANY strained explanations.) These are a religious minority that have some very strange customs. And yet no one bothers them. So is it enough to have different religious customs? Or to segregate oneself from society at large? The explanation that the authors seem to point directly to (but won't conclude) is: You can be part of/ live in a society, and that's fine. (Think all the various ethnic groups that have come to America and become \\"White.\\") You can go away from that society and NOT be part of it (Amish. Indians on reservations.) And that's fine, too. But you cannot expect to get a warm reception living in a society *and* deliberately trying to destroy it (what authors suggest--at length in the \\"Non Jewish Jews\\" chapter-- that Jews consciously do). A bit of definitional tightening would have avoided this sloppy reasoning.There is no discussion of the difference between what *does* need explanation (i.e., is systematic) and what *does not* (i.e., is random/ idiosyncratic). So, the events of WWII are something that I would see as idiosyncratic. Germany was trying to rally a defeated nation and the Germans needed a rallying point. It just so happens that Anti-Semitism was familiar and so it could be used in that capacity. Had there been no Jews in Germany, then there just would have been someone else or some other reason would have presented itself. (Anti-Semitism started around the destruction of the Second Temple and has been a convenient rallying point for many peoples, but that does not mean that it is systematic.)Christianity started out as a offshoot of Judaism (the same way that Satmar are a subsect of Hasidism which are themselves an offshoot of normative Judaism). Can the authors say that if history was allowed to run its course again that Judaism would not become the religion of the Roman Empire and Christianity would not be relegated to the status of a religion fighting for survival for the next 2,000 years? And if they can't, then their thesis (i.e., that people hate Jews because they are Jewish) starts to crack-- badly. And so does their attempt at developing a systematic explanation as opposed to explaining a random event.The authors talk about Communism as being bad for Jews. But if Communism is properly understood as a religion (and it is), then anti-Semitism starts to look very much like old wine in new bottles: some clergy (cadres) waging a war against recalcitrant proselytes. If Anti-Semitism is religious in nature and Communism is a religion, then what needs explaining? Don't all religious people hate each other and try to convert each other (Sunni vs. Shia or Sunni vs. Ahmadis?)Re: Islam (another question that the authors didn't answer to my satisfaction). If Muslims started out hating Jews for religious reasons (and their treatment under Muslim subjects was relatively less bad than it was under Christians), and that hatred persisted for such a long time, then is it a surprise that the nature of the hatred can change from religious to political (the same way it did when the Bolsheviks came into power after taking over from the Tsar)?The authors write a very interesting chapter on \\"Non Jewish Jews.\\" They point out that most Jews are not radicals but that a great many radicals are Jews. (They estimate that 5% of Jews of radicals but that 50% of radicals are Jews.) This observation is probably correct, but it calls into question some part of their thesis (again: \\"What is a Jew?\\"). They point out the vicious hatred that many of these \\"Non-Jewish Jews\\" have for America (and did have for the Weimar Republic in Germany).In a nutshell.....1) I'm not convinced by their explanations; 2) More is necessary. Their definition needs to be formulated in such as way as to exclude other possibilities. They need to add some other qualifications/ refinement to their model of what creates hatred. Or perhaps their thesis is just not salvageable without a lot of straining.What the authors could have concluded (and seemed to allude to) was a different set of factors that made Jews unpopular:1. Being a middleman minority (that's an old story and has been told *many* times before-Parsis in India/ Igbos in Nigeria/ Chinese in SE Asia/ Indians in Africa).2. Being a prominent fifth column inside of a country/ society (another old story and one that will not make an ethnic group friends), and the authors go through a litany of examples of Jewish fifth columns in the chapter on \\"Non Jewish Jews.\\"3. Being a religious minority that's a target of a clergy that's in bed with the government (Shia as targets of the Sunni establishment in Iraq/ Muslims as targets of the Hindu establishment in India).These factors seem to have been different amounts of the hatred at different points in time.They do do a good job documenting the various abuses that Jews have suffered and their true status in Muslim lands (thereby debunking the \\"Jews were happy and well treated in Muslim lands\\" myth.)Verdict: Not worth the Kindle price. Worth the time to read, but only as a way to pick apart the arguments (which required a bit of work)."},{"Title":"Why the Jews?

They debunk other theories and proceed through well footnoted historical examples that provide support and illumination. At times I found the book depressing; the stark and compelling truths and historical recounts were rough on my emotions. However, at those times I skipped ahead and read (and reread) the last section that has suggestions to counter and reverse antisemitism.

The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"As (a non-jewish) expert on christian anti-Judaism (which was a necessary though not sufficient condition for the Endloesung of the Jewish Questions, as the Nazis put it), I have used the book often for college courses I teach. It is a popularization of a difficult topic, but fundamentally sound. If readers want something more substantial, try &quot;Christian Antisemitism&quot; by William Nicholls. The reader-critic from Dallas babbles about anti-gentilism and is on the verge of anti-Judaism himself. The reviewer who is worried about monocausal arguments and explanations might reflect upon the fact that a monocausal explanation for event x (such as Goldhagen brilliantly gave in his book) is not per se invalid for being monocausal; e.g. Christian/German ant-Judaism (as in Luther's writings of 1543) was a necessary condition for/cause of the Nazi genocidal, obsessive focus on Jews. Want proof? See the book mentioned above or see the official statement by the Lutheran churches of America condeming Luther's own anti-Judaism, which helped lay the groundwork for the 'holocaust'.

The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Prager and Telushkin compile a brief but illuminating history of antisemitism, address and dispense the common explanantions and then offer a unique persepctive.Antisemitism predated Christianity but accellerated in intensity throughout the early Christain church history, the Reformation (Hitler took many cues from Martin Luther), and more surprisingly the Renaissance, and the rise of socialism and communism. Hitler was so successful because of the universal accesptance of European antisemitsm attracting so many willing accessories in Poland and Russia.The authors examine economic scapegoating, jealousy, myths of wealth and world domination- but returns to specific beliefs in Judaism that make them suspect in the eyes of two millineums of rulers. The belief in one god, adhearence the their own laws (the Torah), the largely misunderstood concept of the \\"Chosen: and their unique tie to Israel. Their commitment left them isolated and unconquerable. This infuriated history's despots and continues to do so in the Middle East Today. Myths of the blood libel (drinking the blood of murdered Christian and Arab children)and world domination (Protocols of the Elders of Zion)were repeated and accepted, and continue to be spread as the truth in the Arab world today.The epilogue equates the current hatred of the Jews with the common hatred of the United States in the world community.

The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"(Having read this and &quot;The Nine Questions People Ask about Judaism&quot;, I say, read this, skip 9?'s.)A good book for beginning students of Jew-hatred. Though it reads as a somewhat less than academic survey of antisemitism throughout history, it is possible for a conscientious reader to appreciate the arguments presented. Teluskin explores pagan, Christian, Muslim, Fascist and Leftist antisemitism, giving the reader a nice balance between a pure history lesson and the author's thesis.Teluskin's thesis is that Judaism itself is responsible for Jew hatred throughout history. This contrasts with the various explanations that I have heard in the past...Jews were hated in medieval europe because they were money lenders...Hitler hated the Jews because he was crazy, and the Nazis used antisemitism to gain political advantage...etcTeluskin argues that each group/society that promoted and practiced Jew hatred was motivated by its own personal hatred of Judaism. Some examples:The Romans hated the Jews because allegiance to God and objective morality questioned the legitimacy of the secular government.Christian antisemitism was ineveitable, as Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism, and Judaism's continued existence cast a shadow of illegitimacy upon the new religion. By refusing to acknowledge Jesus Christ as The Messiah, Jews implicitly denied the validity of Christianity.Islamic antisemitism mirrors Christian antisemitism in cause, and to a lesser degree, in practice.Leftists placed the good of man above all, accordingly, Jews' insistance on the Supremacy of God's moral law above man threatened to deligitimize Leftist doctrine.Nationalist-Fascist antisemitism had its base in Christian antisemitism and was the familiar result of Jews allegiance to God, rather than to the state.As I noted earlier, this book is not very academic in tone or (in my opinion) in substance, but it still serves as an effective introduction to this subject."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"in my studying antisemitism from ancient times to the current day, i was always disturbed by a gap in the questioning. i know where, when, how, and by whom the jews have been mistreated, but none of the 8+ texts my class drew from asked the tough question of &quot;why?&quot;. this books goes into the why, and ut makes a good case. it is written with great clarity and enough history that one may read it without prior advanced study in the history of anti-semitism. wonderful for both the academic setting and interested laypersons."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I read the 2003 version of this book, which is similar to the 1983 original but has a new introduction, a number of minor changes and includes a useful new 16-page chapter called \\"Eight Lies about Israel.\\"According to the book, \\"the questions for those wishing to understand the roots of antisemitism are not whether some Jews helped execute a fellow Jew two thousand years ago, or how great a role Jews played in the German economy, or how many Arabs fled Israel in 1948.\\" The questions are why antisemites are hostile to Jews and invent reasons for their hostility. Prager and Telushkin come up with four answers. First, an inability to abide ethical monotheism in general and Judaism specifically. Second, an insistence on ascribing great significance to the concept of Jewish \\"chosenness.\\" Third, resentment of the high quality of Jewish life. And fourth, an eagerness to blame Jews in general for the policies of non-Jewish Jews, coupled with an eagerness to praise non-Jewish Jews for their attacks on Judaism.These conclusions are not at all obvious. For example, hostility to Jews might be caused primarily by Jews being different, easy to identify, and relatively weak. I think this book has tended to exaggerate the importance of Jews per se as targets and that a comparison might be in order with other minorities.Nevertheless, Prager and Telushkin have some evidence to support each of their assertions and to rebut those who disagree. For example, Jewish opposition to Fascism and to other tyrannies is a part of Jewish ethics and traditions. This has made opposition to Jews from tyrants anything but accidental. In any case, it is not mere semantics to say that antisemtism is primarily related to Judaism and Jewish life rather than being a specific case of a more general phenomenon that has little if anything to do with Jews at all. The arguments in the book are careful and well reasoned.Prager and Telushkin supply five types of remedies to the problem of antisemitism. One is assimilation, which might help some individual Jews but will not solve the problem for the antisemites or their remaining victims. A second is Zionism, which provides a refuge, a homeland, and self-respect for Jews but once again does not solve the problem for the antisemites or for their new target of Israel. A third is to seek plenty of converts, which, if successful, would indeed mollify the effects of antisemitism even if the many people remained antisemitic. A fourth is to deal with the problem symptomatically, using force to suppress attacks on Jews. Again, this could not be a long-term solution. The fifth approach is to educate people in ethical behavior. A population that values truth, justice, and human rights will be less susceptible to antisemitism. Prager and Telushkin say that this means improving moral values of people in general. It is an interesting and thought-provoking idea."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"One of my favourites!Like all that Prager has a hand in, this book cuts through all the emotions that may be attached to antisemitism and takes a good look at its roots, going all the way back to Biblical times.Most importantly, though, this book is *constructive*. Prager and Telushkin are not just looking for sympathy here; they leave the reader with the hope that there may be a solution."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"This book is quite provocative and thought provoking. I found numerous instances in which examples of anti-Jewish sentiment were cited. Many of the cases of violence against other humans was absolutely horrific! It was a good book for finding examples of antisemitic thought. It was generally quite well written. Weaknesses include the following - (1) same facts / statements were repeated on numerous instances - I tend to overlook this tendency in 500 + texts but I usually at least cite it in 200 page books. (2) there were numerous instances in which the facts seemed to suggest that other groups, such as Christians, fared even worse than the Jews - suggesting that perhaps what we are witnessing is a broader, more generalized hatred and fear than antisemitism alone. (3) from the beginning, semitism should have been defined and Jewry split from Islamism by another term. (4) several of the premises were false, leading to sometimes false conclusions. (5) as a psychologist, i would have liked to see discussion of hate and anti-Judaism from a sociological and intra and inter-psychological processes. overall, this is a fine book. it is well worth reading at its inexpensive price or when borrowed from the public library. i give it a B- for the reasons cited above."},{"Title":"Why the Jews?

The Jews' allegiance to Jewish laws, Jewish peoplehood, andthe belief that the Jews are God's chosen people.2. Ethical monothesism (believing that the Jews are the peopleto bring the world God and His moral law.3. Attempts to change the world, to challenge the gods,religious or secular, of the societies around them, and tomake moral demands upon others.4. As a result of the Jews'commitment to Judaism, they have leda higher-quality of life than their non-Jewish neighbors inalmost every society where they have lived.Of the 5 proposed remedies, only the first and the last one seemed like possible solutions:1. Assimilation (Finding similarities, while co-existing, goesa very long way).2. Zionism (this would mean leaving, again)3. Seek converts (this would mean that you have to invest moretime convincing others to believe what you believe, ratherthan just believing what you believe, and being an example)4. Use force to supress attacks against Jews (Anyone force intoan opinion will always maintain their opinion, and this willfuel endless fights, on many levels).5.

Whilst not a long read at 200 main text pages, it covers an awful lot of ground on the subject and is well written and easy to digest. The book is about Jews so it is bias to their arguments / views. Nevertheless, you have to start somewhere and I think this is a very reasonable starting point if you want to learn more about this subject. This book is very concise and to the point in the main. Whilst I couldn't see some of their solutions working (also see below) I did enjoy the read and the way it was constructed and presented - in a very professional and thoughtful way.After reading this book you could be forgiven for thinking the Jews are a \`pacifist' race who has been unjustly persecuted throughout their history? In some cases that's certainly true.The other side of the coin of course is what they have done and are doing to the Palestinians in the Gaza & West Bank which ironically is very close in many ways to what the Nazis did to them, without the \`final solution' element'.They are not as blameless as this book would lead you to believe. Far from it! The Jews have claws! Clearly, investigating the other side of the story needs to be considered if you want a more rounded picture of the Jews of today. May I suggest a DVD called \`Occupation 101' which is an award winning documentary from the Gaza / West Bank. This whole Anti-Semitism subject is huge and needs a lot of study. Even then I think it unlikely that the reader will get to the real truth as both sides (Arab & Jew) seem stuck in hatred, denial, claim and counter claim and deciphering the two is very problematical!On a personal note some of the theories / myths put forward are totally unconvincing - the killing of non-Jews and the use of their blood in Jewish food for their ceremonies etc. - Who could believe that in today's modern society?The Western's waning of religion and the falling support for the church puts a question mark against many other religious theories but I say that as a person who is not in the slightest way religious! Having said that, I live an hour or so plane flight from Northern Ireland and the hatred there shoots my own argument down in flames, so perhaps the book has a very valid point about \`devout' religion that for me is impossible to grasp?"},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I read a good portion of this book a few years back and I promised myself that I would put my two cents in. Well here goes.Anyone with any familiarity with the subject of Christian anti-Semitism would know that the Gospels in the New Testament is THE source of Jew hatred in Christendom. I am not going to insert any of the verses here, as this is just a note. I trust that the dedicated neophyte will understand that the verses have more impact when they are discovered by one's self. They are abundant and very easy to find on the internet. Or you can simply read the New Testament. The point is not to isolate any of these verses and claim that they are being \\"taken out of context\\" (if I had a dollar for every time I heard THAT), or to explain them away with \\"the cultural understanding of the time in which they were written\\" etc. The point is to look at them 'collectively' and to see the negative portrait it paints of Jews. Only Dennis Prager and Rabbi Joseph Telushkin can account for the reasons why they chose to ignore this reality. I find it very disingenuous, irresponsible, and corrupt that they chose this path. I would not recommend this book to anyone.If one is genuinely seeking to discover the origins of anti-Semitism, one would begin with Lillian Freudmann's Anti-Semitism In The New testament 1993. This book, while briefly describing the historical context during Jesus' time, is simple and concise. It juxtaposes the original Hebrew verses (in English of course) with the mutilated, plagiarized, and anti-Jewish verses from the NT.The fact that Jews are painted as demonic in the NT is as plain as the nose on your face. The verses that pertain to this demonizing process should be removed."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I read this book and still didn't come away with a clear understanding as to why some people are anti-semites. The authors put forth the theory that anti-semitism exists because Judaism (the religion itself) follows it's own set of peculiar customs and rules that are immutable; that is, no matter how hard one asks, cajoles, discriminates against, or tortures a Jew they will never truly conform to the edicts of any other religion besides Judaism.This theory is all well and good if you are an intellectual who understands that the Jews have been immovable in their customs and their belief that they are \\"God's chosen people\\" since the beginning of time. This theory does make sense as to why people could hate them. But this theory is lacking to me, in the sense that NON-intellectuals (i.e. anti-semite Joe Sixpack) doesn't know (mostly) jack about the Jews religion and could probably care less that religion is what makes a Jew a Jew.I have tried to understand why such hatred against Jews exists. From what I have gleaned on my own, the causes seem to be jealousy over the Jews uncanny knack to be prosperous, an unpleasant demeanor, oh, and a secret Jewish cabal intent on taking over the world. I have never had cause to feel anything towards Jews because I have never really been around them. But a lot of other non-intellectuals sure do seem to dislike Jews. I have a stereotype of Jews - does the anti-semitism that emanates from other people based on just the Jew stereotype, or do these people have a real reason to hate?"},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Rob-Did you even read the book? Or were you running on a tank of ethnocentric xenophobia? What your anti-semitic tract fails to mention is the role of classical Christianity. Your claims of insularity, financial manipulation, and general &quot;otherness&quot; can be laid exclusively at the feet of early Christain zealotry. Your &quot;sources&quot; hold zero scholarly merit, your assertions - based on no doubt many years of contact with Jews, lend absolutely no credibility to your thesis. As an anti-semite, you are merely a second rate revisionist begging for an audience. I was looking for a review of the book, you gave me an uninformed soapbox built of virulence and stupidity."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"AntiSemitism is without doubt one of the most abhorent aspects of the Twentieth Century. Any serious study of the subject must consider the implications of how the stance it takes may be considered. To approach the subject as simply an opposition to a theology, no matter how many caveats are provided, is simply wrong. Prager and Telushkin do so, claiming that the longevity and virulence of anti-Semitism stems from objections to Judaism rather than to Jews. Could it not be argued that anti-Semitism continued merely because it had always been there, it was a convient and readily understood, above all often useful, prejudice against a group readily identifiable and often vulnerable. Perhaps one needs a mono-causal argument to concentate the mind on the complexities of the issue."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I disagree with these Jewish authors' stated reasons for antisemitism. The five principal reasons I believe are 1) greed and overreach based on Judaism and Jewish culture, e.g., provisions of the Talmud make non-Jews inhuman and authorize theft and robbery of Gentiles. 2) The offensiveness (to others) of the idea that Jews view themselves as the chosen people of God, with all the rights and entitlements that would imply. 3) Jealousy and envy of Jews' superior intelligence, capabilities and also their wealth. 4)The notion that Jews caused Jesus to be killed, as far as Christians are concerned. 5)And Jews efforts to dominate the thinking and actions of others in many contexts where their interests are also involved. The matter is not difficult or complicated. The authors too much dance around the issues and the history of the Jews. The matter of antisemitism is relatively simple, in my view."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"As a gay man, I come to this book with a grudge against at least one of its authors. Mr Prager has written an essay in which he says that homosexuals have no right to claim victim status, and that \\"homophobia\\" is an imaginary concept invented by radical gays to discredit criticism. How would he like it if I turned his own argument against him by saying that anti-Semitism is a false construct invented by the Jews to stifle criticism? That would enrage him, but he expects me not to be enraged by his blather. It appears that the reader is expected to believe that the Bible is literally true, especially the part about God's promise to Abraham. This is the rock upon which Zionism rests. We are also informed that the Jews are hated because they supposedly invented something called morality. Darwin smashed the credibility of the Bible in 1859, and Nietzsche demolished morality a few decades later. But what is Biblical morality? Isn't there a passage in Leviticus about how it's OK for a man to kill his wife after forcing her to drink a cup of filthy water? Is this the morality over which the authors gloat? What about slavery? I find the chauvinism and self-righteousness of the authors to be absolutely breathtaking. In Blanche Barton's Secret Life of a Satanist, there is a passage (between pages 50 and 60, I think) where the son of the Israeli Defence Minister cheerfully declares ... Well, look it up yourself. If this is true, it completely demolishes everything said in this book. And then there is that nasty little bit in the Talmud that contains the phrase \\"no worse than a poke in the eye.\\" So much for the morality that has driven so many to hate so few."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Dennis Prager holds a special place in my life, as he was one of the first Men I put a lot of stock in after my coming out of the Evangelical Christian subculture. I am very sad to say that my opinion of him has followed a continuous downward trajectory.He has a certain affectation---> he seems to think that simply by his addressing almost any issue, that issue is made right. This book is mostly a manifestation of that erroneous, quirky notion. Funny, but half of this describes traits that aren't really anything to brag about.Any book like this is negligent if it doesn't not contain stories from non-Jews experiences with Jews. But it does not surprise me that Dennis, a Jew, would not truly care what a non-Jew would contribute; and besides that, he'd wind up with 1000 pages of bad press.He states the case for Jews having a better quality of life and excelling in academics and brainy professions; I know this to be true, but it's simply because they happen to have a religion that demands they study. ANYONE who has good study habits does well and grows intellectually, so it couldn't be farther from being uniquely Jewish.Dennis clearly has a blind spot the size of the moon when it comes to the issue of burdensome, ego-centric, warring, tribal religion versus true spirituality that nurtures the soul.The real reason for antisemitism is Jews being loud, proud and clueless about things they should be ashamed of, and never saying they're sorry for anything they ever say or do, and acting more-or-less like a religious mafia struggling very much on their own due to their God's miserably failing them for many centuries."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Hatred against Jews is incorrectly believed by Jews to be the world's oldest, and, they claim, the most brutal and unjust form of bigotry the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, many or most Jews hold attitudes of extreme ethnocentricity. A resonable, dispassionate observer sees that Jews are just another ethnic group. An ethnic group is primarily a resources-sharing clique. Ethnic groups are inherently hostile when it comes to competing for resources. \\"Resources\\" means food suplies, land, topographic vantage points, money, jobs, influence, social standing, access to training, availability of mates. Religion, often cited a the major cause of strife, is merely the bannerhead for hostile ethnicity. Belonging to an ethnic group does not guarantee one a free lunch, but one is at least eligible for what the group claims; an outsider is not. A minority ethnic group within a larger one, primarily because of the communicants' perceived need for mutual support, is often on the average more successful than members of the group-at-large. This can put the minority ethnic in a bad situation. Hence St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Protestants by Catholics, Armenian Genocide. Holocaust is NOT unprecedented. Old Patriaarch Jacob, on God's explicit orders, wss certainly a master of genocidal massacre.The authors of WHY THE JEWS? propound a really dumb and self-centered idea: Realization of the Jews' superior monotheistic-moralistic code and their firm adherence to its rigorous strictures has so dismayed all the \\"gentiles\\", because of their stupid, slothful and profligate inability to live by similar ideals, that they have universally envied and hated the Jews. Purest crap and arrogance in the bargain. (One hears Jews speak of Arab antisemitism.)"},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"This book bugged me. The basic thesis, in my view, aside from being unpersuasive, amounts to self-congratulation."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Part Two of Why the Jews? is supposed to &quot;document the thesis that Judaism, with its distinctiveness and moral challenge, is at the root of Jew-hatred.&quot; This thesis is silly.As Kevin MacDonald has explained, the basis for anti-Semitism is economic and/or reproductive competition between Jews and gentiles.This book is another attempt to obscure that simple fact. The book is poorly reasoned, as many of the authors' arguments work just as well (or just as poorly) to explain the enduring Jewish hostility toward gentiles -- which they sweep under the rug.In short, this is another piece of self-deceptive apologia, valuable only for the fact that it provides another confirmation of Jewish propaganda efforts through control of a large percentage of the communications media. Prager and Telushkin announce (p. 191) the following &quot;solution to anti-semitism&quot;: &quot;... if the goal is to put an end to antisemitism, then Jews must also attempt to influence the moral values of non-Jews so that no aspect of Judaism any longer threatens the non-Jews' values.&quot;Theodor Herzl said &quot;I find the anti-Semites are fully within their rights&quot; -- and, of course, they are, as anti-Semitism is nothing more complicated than the counterpart of anti-gentilism.

I think this book could be good to have, especially if your library is sprase, because it comntains a discussion of a lot of things. It is not necessarily the final word on everythimng it days. I think the authors fail to explain anti-semtism, but then I don't know idf too many people could. The book seems to proceed from the premise that there is a msytery - why does all this stuff happen - let's say it happens for whatever reason - with Jews. It does not really answer that question at all, I think, if I remember right. I think it is posisble to give a one word answer: plagiarism.In our modern atmosphere of copyright protection, people can lose sight of how much people writing things lreft to their devices would simply copy or apprpriate what other people have written. People who see advantage in spreading lies do not necessarily have all that much imagaination, so they steal lies other people have told many years before about Jews, and that isthe simple anxwer.

The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"In the last six years in particular, since Arafat launched a war of terror against Israel's people, I have often wondered what the reasons are for the intense hatred and violent rage, especially by Moslems and the Left, of Israel and her people.The country where I live, is periodically rocked by nationwide paroxysms of vicious rage and murderous hate of the tiny nation of Israel,encouraged by the ruling party and it's allies, civil society, universities and the media.This is the world's latest incantation of Jew-hatred, the world's longest and most intense hatred, as Dennis Prager explains in this fascinating and illuminating work.Prager begins by outlining some of the violent attacks on Jews and Israel in Europe and elsewhere, which has become the disease permeating the world as we begin the 21st century.Prager mentions the United Nations-sponsored World Conference on Racism, in Durban, South Africa in August 2001, which, while failing to mention human rights abuses and genocide in China, Rwanda or anyplace in the Arab world, turned into a violent fest of hate and rage against Israel.While anti-Semitism was traditionally associated with rightwing populists, vicious anti-Israelism is becoming the culture and raison d etre of 'progressive' intellectual communities.Prager illustrates that:* Thousands of academics around the world, have called for an end to support for Israeli researchers, though not an end to support for researchers from any other nation.* Israeli scholars in Spring 2003 were forced off the board of an international literary journal.* And many at universities across the world, including North America, have called for their universities to single out Israel among all nations as the lone country where it is inappropriate for any part of the university's endowment to be invested.Prager marvels how in a world filled with enormous evils-such as totalitarian states that make their countries into large prison camps (Iran and North Korea); that massacre and enslave millions of citizens (Sudan) , that wage deadly war against their own populations (Zimbabwe and Myanmar) that destroy entire cultures (As China is doing in Tibet), it would seem a puzzle as to why the Jewish State and America are the two most villified countries in the world.Prager points this out as being a violent rejection of the American and Jewish values of Judeo-Christian civilization, justice, freedom, democracy and humanity as a source of light to the world. He explains the reason why the USA supports Israel as being because of the USA's Judeo-Christian values and her realization that Israel is a tiny island of democracy and human rights in a sea of totalitarianism.It is against this background that Prager delves into the roots of Jew-hatred to attempt an explanation of this phenomenon.The basic source of ancient Jewish history, the Bible, depicts two attempts at anihilation of the Jewish people: that of Pharaoh and the Egyptians (Exodus 1:15-22) and that of Haman and the Persians.On three occasions in the last 350 years, anihilation campaigns have been waged against the Jews, the Chmelnitzky massacres in Eastern Europe in 1648-1649, the Nazi destruction of Europe's Jews between 1939 and 1945 , and the current decades long campaign to anihilate the Jewish State by it's enemies.Prager holds out four basic reasons for Jew hatred (and it's latest incantaion, Israel-hatred)* The hatred of Judaism and ethical monotheism* The chosen people idea as a cause of Jew-hatred* The moral challenge posed by the Jews for a better world.* The higher quality of Jewish life as a cause of Jew-hatredChapter 5 deals with the topic of Non-Jewish Jews and anti-Semitism. This is particularly interesting to me, because leftwing diaspora Jews who hate Israel, are a major source of anger and disgust for me.Prager is also vexed by the question of explaining Jews who devote their lives to hurting Jews. He points out that \\"Among no group in the world are there so many individuals who so single-mindedly attempt to damage the group into which they were born\\".He gives as examples the loathsome Noam Chomsky who has dedicated much of his life tro defending those who wish to destroy Israel, and to demonize Israel and her people, frequently comparing Israelis to the Nazis; and Norman Finkelstein who lectures throughout the world , calling Israel a Nazi State and demanding it's destruction.Indeed many Jewish ultra-Leftists lead the \\"burn Israel\\" movement, sponsoring pro-Palestinian hate rallies, leading campaigns for divestment from Israel, and demoinzing Israel and her people in the media and universities.The author expalins this phenomenon as being that Jewish radicals, like other radicals, lack roots, and hate Jews (such as the Jews of Israel) who do have roots and a national identity.\\"The Ubermensch, which is how they see themselves, rises above such parochial indentities.\\"Also they likely believe that if they side with those who hate Jews, they will not be hated by them.Prager refutes the Marxist view of anti-Semitism that it is caused by Capitalism, pointing out that in Communist societies anti-Semitism has often been at it's worst.He also easily refutes the myth that anti-Semitism is purely a rightwing phenomenon, pointing to Soviet persecution of Jewry , and the new anti-Semitism of today, which eminates mainly from the Left.Prager go's on to examine the historical evidence of anti-Semitism with histories of ancient anti-Semitism, Christian anti-Semitism, Islamic anti-Semitism, Secular Enlightenment anti-Semitism, Leftist anti-Semitism, Nazi anti-Semitism and anti-Zionist anti-Semitism.He continually draws parralels between historic anti-Semitism and today's new anti-Zionist version, for example discussing the mediaeval libel that Jews poisoned wells, and deliberately spread disease , to lies by the Palestinian Authority and Leftist NGO's that the Israelis have poisoned Palestinian water supplies and deliberately infected Palestinian children with the HIV virus.In the section on Islamic anti-Semitism, he outlines bloody pogroms carried out against Jews in Arab countries, in the 20th century. He also explains the real reason behind Arab hatred of Israel. The idea of Jews as free people in their own state cannot be tolerated, they can only be tolerated as subordinate or degraded. The basis of Arab hatred of Israel is the hatred of Jews refusing to accept an unequal, inferior status, that they lived under for centuries of Arab rule.He also deals with the Arab-Nazi connection of World War II, and beyond.In the chapter on Leftist anti-Semitism he observes how the further left one goes the greater the Jew-hatred. The propaganda peddled by far-left ideologues, academics and journalists today is a reproduction of the propaganda manufactured in the old Soviet Union, during the Cold War, when the USSR was persecuting Jews and working for the destruction of Israel.Letwing anti-Semitism revolves around the denial of Jewish nationhood, and therefore of Israel's right to exist, leading to a hatred of all Jews who affirm Jewish nationhood and particularly of all Jews who live in the Jewish homeland. It also involves a gross Orwellianism whereby Israel is accused of genocide, when the truth is that the Arabs and their allies are the ones pushing for the destruction of Israel and thereby a second holocaust against Jews.Because anti-Zionism's goal would lead to a second holocaust against five million Jews, it cannot be distinguished from anti-Semitism.Furthermore there is only one posible reason why people isolate Israel of all the countries of the world to deny it's right to existence. Because Israel is a Jewish State. Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.Finally Prager deals with the 8 most common lies about Israel, and the truth behind them, examines what the solutions are to Jew-hatred, and his epilogue ends with a warning that anti-Semitism/anti-Israelism is the problem not only of Jews, but of all decent human beings because what begins with the Jews seldom ends with the Jews. Jew-hatred and Israel-hatred is the moral litmus test of nations, regimes and individuals."},{"Title":"Why the Jews?

Rabbi Telishkin and Mr. Prager's book concisely, clearly and skillfully analyzes the root causes of antisemitism (ethical monotheism, moral law, peoplehood) and debunks all the easy or contrived answers. A great book, and a must read for all."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"This book seeks to examine the very roots of anti-Semitism, the term used to describe the hatred of the Jews. Many avenues are explored such as why the Jews have been the object of the most enduring and universal hatred directed towards any people group in history. Additionally, the book discusses why the Jewish state of Israel has now become the most despised country in the World today.The inherent hatred of the Jews within some elements of the Church and Islam are also studied, both from a historical perspective and also pertaining to the present day.Sections are also devoted to the anti-Semitism of the Nazi era and how it is also present today in relation to those who support or profess Zionism. A particularly interesting section discusses how much modern day anti-Semitism is hidden beneath a more respectable veneer bearing the anti-Zionist label.One such example given is that on page 172 which quotes from the statement by Shukairy, who was the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation before Yasser Arafat. Shukairy used to openly declare that \\"the Jews should be driven into the sea\\". The book proceeds to describe that when such a statement no longer became politically expedient or served the Arab cause, the statement was promptly changed to \\"the Zionists should be driven into the sea\\".Indeed many differing lines of thought are discussed and a variety of issues investigated. This book will certainly make the reader think and contemplate the real roots of this ongoing issue, which is described as being more prevalent now than at any time since the Nazi era.The book however does not address the spiritual aspect behind anti-Semitism which underlies the Christian Gospel message. Something which many may dispute, but which describes the real roots of this hatred as being demonic and which sets itself against the whole Jewish race, the coming & return of the Jewish/Christian Messiah together with the message of redemption to all mankind. A demonic hatred whose end is described in the book of Revelation within the Bible.In addition to this book I would respectfully recommend the books entitled \\"Jesus Was A Jew\\" by Arnold Fruchtenbaum & \\"The Anguish Of The Jews; Twenty Three Centuries Of Anti-Semitism\\" by Edward H. Flannery."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Prager and Telushkin offer a useful historical survey of anti-Semitism and skillfully refute the most common explanations for \\"the oldest hatred.\\" Where I disagree with them is in their own theory of anti-Semitism's orgins. Simply put, the authors assume that, regardless of historical period, geographic location, or ideology, the typical anti-Semitic individual or organization follows the same essential syllogism:1. Judaism originated the concept of ethical monotheism, that is, the belief in a supreme God who is just and good and demands the same from human beings.2. I/We are opposed to (or are unable/too lazy to live according to) ethical monotheism.3. Therefore, we must hate Jews, the original advocates of ethical monotheism.Very neat. However, as reviewer Ben notes below, it's doubtful that the average \\"Joe Sixpack\\" anti-Semite goes through anything remotely resembling that thought process. Nearly all Jew-haters hate Jews simply because they were taught to do so, by people who were in turn taught to hate Jews, and so forth.Furthermore, Judaism, with the minor exception of some Jews in the Hellenistic age, has never been a prosyletizing religion. True, there is the rabbinic concept of the universal \\"Noahide\\" moral laws binding upon all human beings. However, there is scant instance of Jews *actively* urging their non-Jewish neighbours to observe even these laws, let alone all of Judaism. So how would your average non-Jew even know what Judaism stood for?Furthermore, the authors' prescription for ending anti-Semitism, promoting Judaism's ethical monotheism even more strongly, is a praiseworthy goal but contradicts their own thesis. If ethical monotheism is the cause of anti-Semitism, isn't it possible that advocating it more assertively and publicly would produce even more hatred of Jews?I have come to the conclusion that anti-Semitism exists because it exists. It is a self-perpetuating meme which knows of no logical explanation. The fact that Jews are perhaps the oldest unified nationality still in existence may account for anti-Semitism's particular universality and persistence. Perhaps if the Sumerians were still around, we'd ask, \\"Why anti-Sumerianism?\\"Nevertheless, I give _Why the Jews?_ four stars for the authors' keen historical research and for the stimulating debate that the book has, and will undoubtedly continue to, stimulate."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"As I followed the Arab-Israel conflict I got more and more confused about how people that didn't know anything about the subject, of all walks of life, became more and more prejudiced against Israel in my country with the help, of course, of the media. Since I knew a little about Israel's history and how it had been the target of many neighboring countries since its very beginning, I decided to do a little research to understand what was happening. Part of the research is this book, which really opened my eyes to a very sad picture. Easy to read, the authors use very simple logic and examples (full of quotes) to disprove common myths about anti-Semitism. It shows how Jews have been killed because they were poor or rich, because they were communists or because they were capitalists. In the end, because they were Jews. It gave a me a first idea of what Judaism is. The book was written at the time of the Soviet Union and shows what was happening then. I intend to read more from the same authors because their style isn't aggressive and is coherent with what they preach, in my opinion. It is a warning to those who think that what happens in the Middle East is a Jew problem."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"Dennis Prager is emerging as one of the single most insightful and important conservative thinkers in the country. His analysis of Jew-hatred is by far and away the best organized, comprehensive, and compelling account I have ever seen. In an age in which religion-based radicalism seeks to kill the Jews all over again, Prager's book couldn't be more timely."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"In the introduction, the authors point out the rising tide of antisemitism in European society and media by citing specific examples, the warning of Lawrence Summers about the eruption of the plague on campus, the 2001 UN conference on racism in Durban where Israel was demonized, the hatred emanating from the Arab and Muslim worlds, from Muslims in Europe and from the political Left around the globe.The aim of this book is to confirm the age-old Jewish understanding of the condition, which the authors consider to be a response to Judaism. The intention is to refute attempts to deny the particularly Jewish reasons for the hatred and its contemporary manifestation of anti-Zionism.Part One: The Explanation, demonstrates the uniqueness of antisemitism as the hatred of Judaism and ethical monotheism, considers other theories like the Chosen People concept, the higher quality of Jewish life, plus other theories and the frightening phenomenon of the hatred of Judaism by non-Jewish Jews like Marx, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Abbie Hoffman, Norman Finkelstein andNoam Chomsky.The Historical Evidence is assessed in Part Two, from the Hellenic and Roman eras through the Christian, Islamic and Secular (Enlightenment) varieties, Leftist, Nazi and Anti-Zionist Antisemitism. ForChristianity, the evidence encompasses the hate-filled words of Church Fathers like John Chrysostom of Antioch and Ambrose of Milan, massacres during the crusades, medieval libels, the Catholic and Protestant versions and the abominable words of Martin Luther. For a full treatment of this, please consultOur Hands Are Stained with Bloodby Michael L Brown if you're not too sensitive to the description of atrocities.Islamic Antisemitism looks at the history of Muhammad and the Jews, the actions of Islamic leaders from the prophet's death up to the modern period, the modern era with reference to Egypt, Syria and Palestine, the 20th century and Muslim hatred of Israel. Further evidence is available in the bookPeace: The Arabian Caricature of Anti-Semitic Imageryby Arieh Stav.Secular Antisemitism: The Enlightenment, demonstrates how the shape-shifting phenomenon re-emerged through Voltaire, De Mirabaud and D'Holbach; virtually every major figure of the French Enlightenment was hostile to Judaism. In Germany there were people like Johann Fichte and Immanuel Kant, but mercifully England proved to be a partial exception where the milder manifestations never led to violence.Like all the aforementioned, socialism and Marxism were born with Jew-hatred. Marx's writing is full of it, but it was even more virulent amongst French intellectuals like Charles Fourier, Pierre Leroux, and Proudhon, with a few exceptions. Then followed Soviet antisemitism and that of the Western Left, including Leftist and Far Right churches and bodies like the World Council of Churches.Nazism was not an outgrowth of racial ideology which was fundamentally irrelevant to Nazi antisemitism. Equating it with racism is just an attempt to dejudaize the phenomenon. It was the other way around; in their war against the Jews the Nazis employed racist arguments. The authors provide plenty of facts to substantiate their case. Nearly every popular ideology in German history contributed to the ideological roots of Nazi antisemitism. Furthermore, Europe has always harbored a widespread and profound strain. This was revealed during the Second World War when the only continental governments that protected their Jewish citizens were Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Bulgaria.After the Holocaust, open anti-Semitism became taboo so a change of rhetoric took place following the rebirth of Israel in 1948. Anti-Zionism had its origin in the Soviet Union. The authors argue convincingly that Anti-Zionism is antisemitism in theory and practice. Examples are given from the writings of American Leftists, the Italian media, the UK author AN Wilson, the Arab media and the statements of Arab leaders.In chapter fourteen, eight common lies about Israel are refuted: the accusations that Israel refuses to compromise for peace; stole the land from the Palestinians; is morally obligated to absorb the 1948 refugees and their descendants, that Jerusalem is as holy to Muslims as it is to Jews, Anti-Zionists being distinct from antisemites, that Jews and Christians in the Holy Land were well-treated under Islamic rule, that Israel illegally occupies the West Bank and that Palestinians embraced violence out of desperation.Part Three considers ways of dealing with the problem, like assimilation, Zionism, making converts and combating specific outbreaks. The authors believe that Jews should resume their original mission of spreading ethical monotheism, helping to bring mankind to a universal God-based morality. In the tradition of the Hebrew Prophets, they ought to promote the concept of goodness tied to faith as God's major concern while also opposing secularists advocating political systems devoid of religious moral values. Antisemitism is a moral failing that can only be prevented by the moral values of non-Jews. It is significant that in the USA it currently issues overwhelmingly from theLeft- religious like Jimmy Carter and secular academics like Walt & Mearsheimer - whose deceptions are brilliantly exposed by Abraham Foxman inThe Deadliest Lies.In the Epilogue, the authors warn that antisemitism never remains just a Jewish problem; as it metastasizes it inevitably brings terrible suffering to all societies under its spell. In history, treatment of the Jewish people has always served as a reliable barometer of humanity's moral state. Nowadays those who hate the Jewish nation are most likely to be anti-American too. Authoritarian regimes resent American success and covet the country's power and wealth; this hatred is shared by some Western Leftists and particularly the parasites infesting transnational bodies like the United Nations and the EU bureaucracy. It should now be clear to thinking people that Arab antisemitism forms part of a deep-seated hatred of the West that fuels jihad in many forms.There are 23 pages of bibliographic notes, a 9 page bibliography of cited works and an index. I fear the hour is late; I urge all Christians who love our Jewish Redeemer to pray without ceasing and to consider supporting organizations like Christians United For Israel, Christian Friends Of Israel and the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"The doctor's four, the lawyer's seven.That joke, cracked by a Jewish buddy, goes some way towards explaining the 'traditional' dislike of Jews in general, which has sometimes tragically spilled over into outright persecution and genocide.One of the reasons I have always clicked with Jewish contacts, who later became friends, is that they are highly intelligent and goal driven.Yet this desire to be the best they can be, in business, in education, has often triggered jealousies in others, who resent the successes of the Jews, even though they have been honestly earned.I agree with Lucien, that the idea that Jew haters have somehow been driven by some theological wranglings regarding the nature of 'the Jews' God' and the requirements of worship, never enters the head of most knee-jerk Jew bashers.While some of Prager's ideas regarding the early development of anti-Semitism are worthy of attention, I think he perhaps underestimates how much of it has now and for centuries been literally the result of habit and 'passed down' hate mongering.Everybody knows everybody hates the Jews, so they still do.Also, the suggestion, however worded, that only anti-Semites see America as being Israel's big brother and protector, is very shaky, as historically alone, the US has always clearly and unequivocally supported Israel, the landmark act being the unprecedented airlift of weapons to bolster a flagging Israel, during the Yom Kippur War (Operation Nickel Grass).It's a good book, and Prager is a fine writer who does his homework; I'm just not sure that all of his conclusions are bang on.Shalom."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"After totally and unequivocally obliterating the age-old excuses for anti-semitism, Dennis Prager and Joseph Telushkin put forth what they see as the real cause behind hatred against the Jews --in the process reaching a conclusion that this reader found totally brilliant and completely unexpected.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who, deep down inside, never truly accepted worn-out excuses for anti-semitism (i.e. financial exploitation, Jewish Conspiracy, control of Media, etc.)--particularly when, as a Jew him/herself, never being able to benefit from any of these supposed &quot;Jewish traits&quot;: not to mention even knowing where to find them.Simply put: This book served as a real revelation to me and undoubtedly will to others."},{"Title":"Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism","review":"I have encountered Rabbi Telushkin's work before and in this (revised) text he agian brings tremendous clarity to his message. Never strident, never unkind that book is fair and balanced. The authors stand their theses on historical reactions to Jews aas a nation, as montheists, as successful, as a coheent social group. Many of the analyses are equally found in other texts but Praeger and Telushkin speak to the reader with exceptional simplicity and directness (by simplicty here, I mean unadorned jargon, not monosyllables). I have only two quibbles with the book. One is terminological and the other analytical. A fundamental thesis of the text is that anti-Zionism is a cloak for recompiled antisemitism. The authors use the term 'non-Jewish Jews' to refer to those Jews who are anti-Zionism. It is an awkward word cart and i hope the authros rethink its usage in subsequent additions. On the analytical front, the authors point out that while most Jews are not radicals, most radicals are Jews (ok, probablty stretching a statistic slightly, but only slightly). I would have liked to authors to have got 'stuck in' here and offer a detailed analysis as to why this occurs. There is some analysis along the traditional lines of Jews being somewhat on the outside and using their observer status, (which I find either suggests an exotic or even quixotic dimension to the Jewish character or else descends into just mythic waffle) It could have been plumbed more thoroughly connecting more with biblical exemplars possibly. Leaving those issues aside, the book is direct and thoughtfully free of propaganda."},{"Title":"RIDE WITH ME.","review":"\\"Ride With Me\\" by Thomas B. Costain is the thrilling epic of a young British journalist, one of the first \\"war correspondents\\" and his battle of words with Napoleon Bonaparte. War ravaged Europe is the backdrop of this tale, full of a cast of colorful characters. The hero must battle with his ideals and his love for the beautiful aristocratic lady who is an ardent Bonapartist. A very absorbing read for history and romance lovers alike. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"RIDE WITH ME.","review":"Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the book is centered around newspaperman Francis (Frank) Ellory. Francis chafes at the restrictions the crown puts to the press, and his outspokenness often gets him in trouble (actually, he ends up in jail for a stint because of it). The other two main characters in the book are exiled Frenchwoman Gabrielle de Salle (who Frank is head over heels in love with) and *Riding Bobby*, Sir Robert Wilson, a highly respected soldier despite his frequent tangles with his superiors. Frank signs on as a war correspondent and follow Sir Robert during the Peninsular wars, and again to Russia during Napoleon's Russian campaign and retreat - plus he's got his beloved Gabrielle to save.I've been putting off writing a full review on this one for about two weeks and I've realized it's not going to happen, I've got writer's block and this is one of those books that is too difficult to properly review (plus this is cutting into my reading time). I did enjoy this, although it was one of those books I could put down and pick it up again when the mood struck me, so it's not a page turner. I liked using Frank's career as a newsman to give the reader a different look at historical events, especially with the battles in the Peninsula campaign - hard to explain but it's a different way for the reader to observe the battles. If you are new to this period of history, I wouldn't recommend this book as the one to get you started, but worth while for those more familiar with Napoleon's Peninsula and Russian campaigns."},{"Title":"RIDE WITH ME.","review":"Thomas Costain is always a great read!

I've used this book since its first edition as my main reference on basic data modeling, and I have been happy to comment on its newer editions. This 4th edition improves on earlier ones by including the Unified Modeling Language (UML), my own first choice for a design language for data modeling. The chapter on the UML includes everything you need, but it keeps it as simple and straightforward as possible, making the material very accessible. The real contribution of the book is in the normalization chapter and in the excellent description and examples of n-ary relationships and the consequences of their multiplicities, a very-hard-to-understand corner of the data modeling world. The inclusion in this edition of material on OLAP and data warehousing is also welcome, though very limited in scope. Finally, moving the physical design material into a separate book makes this book much more cohesive and useful as a reference for data modeling."},{"Title":"Database Modeling and Design: Logical Design, Fourth Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"I am one of the reviewers for this book, but have no connection to the authors, other than being an impressed colleague.This is a well-written, solid book by knowledgeable authors. Based on my consulting experience, many applications fall flat because of missing or inferior database conceptualization and design -- the subject of this book. The authors clearly explain how to build a database in terms of Entity-Relationship modeling. So if you think you could benefit from some advice, I recommend that you consider Teorey et al's new book."},{"Title":"Database Modeling and Design: Logical Design, Fourth Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"This book can be considered as having been structured in four distinct parts.First part, the introductory one, is made of three chapters starting with the description of the Database Lifecycle, from Requirements Analysis to Physical Design. Then, follow the Entity-Relationship Modeling and the UML chapters in which the reader is presented ER constructs and basic UML notation used in the following chapters.Second part is about the core of the book: Data Modeling. Requirements Analysis and Conceptual Modeling are addressed in chapter 4.Next chapter is about transforming the Conceptual Data Model to SQL and contains a very useful set of figures that summarize how different relationship types, i.e. one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, are translated into sets of SQL table creation constructs, including primary and foreign key attributes. This chapter alone may be worth the price of this book.Chapter 6 addresses Normalization. Expectedly, First, Second, Third and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms are explained here, without resorting to too much theory. Things are different, however, for the Fourth and Fifth Normal Forms, as a good understanding of MVD - Multivalued Dependency - and of related rules and axioms are needed to grasp what 4NF and 5NF really mean. These are the most theoretical 10 pages or so of this book.In the last chapter of this part, there is \\"An example of Logical Database Design\\"; an insignificant chapter of a few pages long, based on a very simplistic implementation of the all-too-common \\"Retail Store\\" problem that barely translates into 8 SQL table creation construct sets.Third part, chapter 8, is about Business Intelligence. It covers Data Warehousing, OLAP and Data Mining. It is unclear to me why the authors chose to spend - should I say waste - 40 pages on a 200 plus page book addressing OLAP-specific data modeling, that is in many aspects in opposition with OLTP-specific data modeling principles - denormalized vs. normalized tables, star schema vs. ER diagrams - that the authors addressed, developed and promoted in the first 145 pages of the book.Fourth and last part addresses CASE Tools for Logical Database Design. Although useful and interesting, we have here 25 pages prone to quick obsolescence because somewhat product-specific.This book does not address the handling of business rules and of time-dependent data, although common in real-life databases.Overall, this is a nice to read introductory book, but certainly not your unique book if you expect to be able to perform serious database modeling. The statement on back cover \\"... get plenty to help you grow from a new database designer to an experienced designer developing industrial-sized systems\\" seems a bit presumptuous.My suggestion to the authors: Drop chapter 8 and write another book on OLAP-specific data modeling; rewrite chapter 7 by referring to a more realistic and consistent case example; address handling of business rules and time-dependent data."},{"Title":"Database Modeling and Design: Logical Design, Fourth Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"This book is now next to my desk as a reference text. It does a good job at explaining the basics of relational database models and how they fit into a modern business architecture. The authors obviously have a methodology that works for them and the chapters seem to be organized according to their methodology. They start with UML, analyze the model in UML for potential problems, then move into SQL, normalization at the SQL stage, and end with an example.

Earlier editions of this book may have been there first chronologically, I don't know. I really have problems with Chapter 6 on Normalization: I think the main example (figure 6.2) is very non-intuitive (report_no isn't a primary key for the Report table--it seems to be a one-to-one relationship with editor, dept_no, dept_name, and dept_addr based on the small sample data). Additionally, the example repeatedly states that there is only one candidate key in this table. The data sample doesn't seem to bear that out. I also think it would have been better if the author had given an example of how a table might NOT meet the First Normal Form, rather than just starting with an example of a table that is. I think the definition of 2NF is imprecise, although the example and solution are correct. I think the whole topic (of Normalization) is covered much more clearly and realistically by Clare Churcher in \\"Beginning Database Design\\"."},{"Title":"Database Modeling and Design: Logical Design, Fourth Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"Excellent introductory book .

Twain describes his adventures in Germany, Switzerland, the French Alps, and finally northern Italy. His account of Germany takes up half the book so the coverage is somewhat lopsided, but I think this was simply a result of realism setting in: It's an awful lot of work to write a daily journal in detail and I'm sure that Twain began to grow weary of having to take time out of every day to record events. Time spent writing could be better spent living and enjoying one's vacation. I know the feeling since I do keep a daily journal; I let it slip for days or weeks and then have to catch up, and that takes a lot of time.Ok, the main thing to note is that the account is absolutely HILARIOUS. A delightful way to pass an hour reading during lunchtime or on the beach during a vacation. I read this quite a few months ago so I've forgotten much of the content. The stories that I still remember pretty vividly:- The bloody fencing matches at the university in Heidelberg- The raft ride down the Neckar- A couple tragic accounts of past failed attempts at climbing certain mountains- The over-the-top story of Twain's expedition to climb the Riffelberg- The hilarious appendix on the German languageI sell most of my books after reading them but I have such fond memories of the stories in \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" that I'm hanging on to it."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad provides an insight into Europe, in all its guises. In many ways, this sparkling guide is as relevant today as it has always been. Many elements of Twain's &quot;character&quot; are portrayed in the book, including, at times, his innate childishness. His tendency to ramble, both in text and in journey, far from being irritating, quickly becomes indeering. The only thing that a reader has to fear from this book is either being late for work, or losing ribs. The most notable point about this book is the wonderful commentary Twain passes on his own artistic skills, and the way that the wholly imagined nature of the above serves perhaps as a metaphor for the whole of what he sees on his journey.

Both of us laughed out loud while reading. Aside from the humourous style of writing, the stories themselves were eerily similar to our own more mundane adventures. What makes the exagerations hilarious is that they contain some eliment of truth.His remarks on speaking foriegn languages while traveling were especially familiar. Time and again I found my mediocre Spanish popping up in my elementary Turkish. On one occasion I and another gentleman were negotiating for bus tickets, each mixing our pigeon Turkish with the clerk's pigeon English. At one point the gentleman said something that had a vaguely familiar accent. I asked (in Turkish) where he was from. Sonoma. California! I exclaimed in English that I was from near San Diego. Through the entire experience neither recognized a fellow expatriot.Or Twain's comment's on foreign food. After two months in rural Turkey, we had the same cravings for something American.His descriptions of fellow boorish tourists, his appendix on the German language, his diatribe on the hairy trunk painting: Any of these would justify reading this book, all by themselves.

I found the early chapters chronicling his visit to Heidelburg University; hilarious visits to opera houses and tale tales such as the Blue Jay yarn to be well done.The longest section of the book deals with Twain's alpine climbing adventures in Switzerland.

There's a lengthy (and highly annoying) \\"fantasy\\" sequence - I suppose he was trying for parody - as well. I found myself fast-forwarding through almost a full cassette of a gory description of two deuls (near the beginning); he delights in recounting grisly mountaineering stories later on during the novel. The storyline ended abruptly at the end of cassette 11 of 13; the last two were the appendix, which I skipped.I really liked \\"Innocents\\" and am planning on purchasing \\"Following the Equator\\" (I looked through it at a bookstore and it seemed pretty interesting), but I wish I'd skipped this one.

Journeysknown as Grand Tours led tourists to take ship to the Continent. They fanned out across thelandscape with the intent to &quot;know Europe.&quot; Their return home resulted in a flurry ofpublished accounts. Twain satirizes both the tourists and their writings with deliciouswit. Ever a man to play with words, his &quot;tramp&quot; refers to both himself and the walking tourof Europe he purports to have made. By the time you've reached the end of the account of the&quot;walking tour&quot; incorporating trains, carriages and barges, you realize that the longest &quot;walk&quot;Twain took occurred in dark hotel room while trying to find his bed. He claims to havecovered 47 miles wandering around the room.Twain was interested in everything, probing into both well-known and obscure topics. Hisjudgments are vividly conveyed in this book, standing in marked contrast to his morereserved approach in Innocents Abroad. A delightful overview of mid-19th Century Europe,Tramp is also interlaced with entertaining asides. Twain was deeply interested in people, andvarious &quot;types&quot; are drawn from his piercing gaze, rendered with acerbic wit. Some of theseare contemporary, while others are dredged from his memories of the California mines andother journeys. He also relished Nature's marvels, recounting his observations. A favouriteessay is &quot;What Stumped the Blue-jays.&quot; A nearly universal bird in North America, Twain'sdescription of the jay's curiosity and expressive ability stands unmatched. He observes suchhumble creatures as ants, Alpine chamois, and the American tourist. Few escape hisperception or his scathing wit. This book remains valuable for its timeless rendering ofcharacters and the universality of its view. It can be read repeatedly for education orentertainment."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"\\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is a humorous account of Mark Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. It is part travel guide, part commentary on European culture, and part tall tale. Like many of Twain's less-known works, \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is rather uneven -- the chapters in the book range from rather boring to laugh-out-loud funny. Yet on balance, the humorous moments make up for the dull moments, and the majority of the less humorous chapters are still interesting. Apart from a few slow chapters, it provides a good read from beginning to end.Some of the highlights of \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" are Twain's exaggerated account of his ascent of the Riffelberg (a mountain in the Swiss Alps), his comments on the peculiarities of the German language, and a hilarious episode in which Twain spends half an hour pretending to know a woman who remembers him though he doesn't remember her.I have read most of Twain's works, and in my opinion \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is not his best work, but it is definitely one of his most underrated books. It is not as good as his most popular works of fiction (i.e., Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn), nor is it as good as \\"Life on the Mississippi.\\" But I found it to be the most entertaining of his purely travel-oriented books (the other books in that category being \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and \\"Following the Equator\\"). The bottom line is that if you are a fan of Mark Twain's style, then you should find this book to be well worth reading.Finally, if you are going to read \\"A Tramp Abroad,\\" I highly recommend obtaining a version that contains all 328 of the original illustrations. While I normally would make this recommendation for any of Twain's works, it is especially important for this book since the text makes several references to the illustrations, and since some of the jokes in the text would not make sense without the illustrations. The only current edition I know of that definitely contains *all* of the original illustrations is the Oxford Mark Twain edition (ISBN 0195101375). Also, the Modern Library Classics edition (ISBN 0812970039) apparently has retained some of the original illustrations, since it contains a note stating that \\"... some illustrations have been omitted\\" (thus implying that some have not been omitted). I would assume that this edition has retained those illustrations which are essential to the humor, but I can't say for sure since I don't actually have it."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I have not read Twain since High School twenty five plus years ago but a friend on a newspapers book forums got me to read him again and A Tramp Abroad is the first book I picked.

This is done Twain style, of course, so anyone familiar with the author's travel writings will not be surprised that most of his \`walking tour' is actually accomplished by coach, train, or vicariously through an agent. As is usual for his travel writings, Twain's descriptions are vivid and detailed, and his accounts of certain sites are simply marvelous. In fact, in my opinion, the only thing not up to Twain's standards in this book is the humor.Don't get me wrong, this book is funny. His account of his mountaineering expedition, together with a staff of almost 150 people, is hilarious, as are many of his anecdotes (which, incidentally, are randomly inserted). Still, this book is not nearly as amusing as \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" or &quot;Roughing It&quot;--but that should not come as a surprise. Most of Twain's best work came early in his career, before his pessimism took over and before he was deprived of his entire family through death. This work fits somewhere in the middle of Twain's career, before he completely burned out but after he had already lost a bit of his incredible zest for life and capacity for humor.All in all, this is an excellent book by one of the greatest writers the North American continent has ever produced."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"First of all, this is a great book that has made me laugh countless times.

Though not his best piece of travel writing (see Innocents Abroad), I devoured this book in large chunks eager to see where Twain wandered next. When he arrives in the Alps, A Tramp Abroad vaults from an amusing piece of travel writing to a supremely satisfying form of entertainment.If there was any disappointment it occured with Twain's unexpected exit from the stage. A Tramp Abroad covers Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, but concludes quite suddenly with mere mention that the Netherlands are next on the docket. Yet, wishing a book to continue confers no blackmark on an author.

From offbeat illustrator Joel Stewart comes this utterly charming picture book adaptation of the celebrated nonsense rhyme \\"Jabberwocky\\" from Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" In muted, sepia tones sparked with lime green, lemon yellow and apple red, Stewart paints the mysterious Jabberwocky as a creature part English dandy, part Beetlejuice and part hedge. \\"And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame&#65533;\\" and -- according to Stewart's whimsical drawings -- teeth of checker boards, guts of a robot, and elongated claws of regular manicure appointments. A supporting cast of characters appear and disappear without explanation (though, of course, none is needed) as do the odd cameo appearances of different postage stamps on every spread. None of this lovely nonsense should be surprising, as we've seen Stewart's quirky style before, in the picture book \\"The Adventures of a Nose,\\" the strange story of a nose's quest for belonging.

There isn't all that much about the mermen world as I had hoped. Most of it took place on land. When we are finally taken down to the mermen world, it's for a bizarre sex ritual and then - we're back on land again? What the heck?I hate to say it, but there was a TON of sex in the book - so much so that it became tedious. I'm not sure I've ever felt that way before reading an erotic novel. I like the characters of Jane and Josh but the ending - the rush to the mermen world - seemed poorly handled on Josh's part. He knew what he was asking of her and that the time was coming; he should have let her at least say goodbye.And it wasn't even touched on that mermen are coming to land to impregnate human women, leaving them alone and without support. Then the child grows up and seeks out his father? So the kid disappears from his mother? That seems like a huge HUGE deal.It's an inexpensive read so I'm thankful for that, but it left me feeling unsatisfied, much like her Wanton series did. I had hopes for this book, but there was far too little about mermaids/mermen and their world, and too much that wasn't relevant. It read like a straight erotic book with an all too thin plot. Length was decent, but it's because of the drawn out sex scenes.Were the sex scenes hot? The first one yes. The subsequent ones that were very simliar? Not so much. I'd rather have one superbly well written hot scene than a half dozen lukewarm ones.

The author has assembled a very amusing collection of personalities in the Wolfpack Squadron, and has given them an excellent backdrop against which to live and work and fight... and to generally amuse and entertain the reader.From the fatally efficient Commander Voight, a man with a mysterious, of not entirely above-board past, to the ever-jovial Lieutenant Jarvis, with his insatiable explorer's curiosity and an annoying ability to seemingly 'pop into existance' right behind you at the most opportune moment... the Wolfpack command staff provide an excellent core around which the story unfolds. Stationed at remote Carbaron Base, a military installation originally designed as an amusement park by a wealthy but quite mad Scottish Engineer, the squadron has ample opportunity for adventure, both in space and on the ground.Volume I introduces the characters well, and gives the reader a chance to grow to like them (or to hate them, in some cases). It does, however, leave me looking forward to seeing a Volume II."},{"Title":"Wolfpack stories","review":"Eric Gilmartin's debut book, WOLFPACK STORIES: VOLUME 1, is a thrilling piece of work. The various tales of a future war in space between human space pilots and a mysterious alien race called the Caprons are engrossing and involving. What I like about the stories is that they work on several levels. As pure action-adventure, they kept me entertained, with well-described battles and suspensful action sequences. But what really makes the stories work are the well-described characters who appear throughout the book. Each of the characters are vivid, believable, and complex and they mesh well in all sorts of interesting ways. Story by story, I get more of an emotional investment in them. I also enjoyed the futuristic milieu Mr. Gilmartin has created for this book and the literate style of his writing. His literary and historical references are artfully blended into the stories. All in all, this is a hugely impressive work and I'm looking forward to further volumes in the series."},{"Title":"Wolfpack stories","review":"It's not often that I read Sci Fi.

I have oft been a sounding board for Mr. Gilmartin's ideas because I CAN be objective and am willing to tell him what I think, this has caused some strained relations over the years. Eric inspired some of my most creative moments in my life by giving me the initiative to go out and do what I believed in, when her told our band of friends that a story was in the future we nodded and waited; some with hope, some with speculation, and others with doubt that he would produce this wonderful book.It's been 24 years in the making, a lifetime of struggle within a dream of success. His success is now apparent.

For example, they go to Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and that doesn't quite fit, although the information can be helpful. Some women go to cognitive therapy for years and worked on child abuse issues, while it might have resolved a lot, it still may be found lacking. She claims that the term complex PTSD more closely approaches the panoply of problems displayed by trauma survivors yet more needs to be included.She labels the problem as Trauma Reenactment Syndrome or TRS whose central characteristics include:1. A sense of being at war with one's body2. Extreme secrecy as a central organizing principle of life3. Inability to self-protect, often evident in a specific kind of fragmentation of the self4. Relationships in which the struggle for control overshadows all elseMiller uses a triadic relationship model between the abuser-victim-non-protecting-presence to explain the dynamics that occur when people continue to hurt themselves even when they know it is wrong.At one point the abuser and non-protecting presence were external. Later, the roles become internalized in order to maintain relationships. At various times, the self-injurer flips through all three roles. There is no room for a protective presence and therefore one grows up to have difficulty in keeping herself safe.There are case studies throughout the book that provide clear examples ranging from child torture to an over-tending grandparent. Some of these are rather graphic, but to understand the problem, it is necessary to see its depth and the reasons for the resilience to therapy.The second part of the text discusses therapeutic solutions. It is not written as convincingly as the first part. It gives the impression that the author may be still trying to determine the best therapeutic method.What Miller comes up with is a method based on an outer ring, middle ring and center ring. Each ring represents the level of knowledge gathering and revelation that takes place between the therapist and the client, with the center being the most intense.What is understood is that the therapist is doomed to failure if they push for information too quickly. There must be a deepening trust along with an understanding off rules and procedures between the therapist and the client before dealing with the core issues. If a client were to enter therapy to primarily deal with sexual abuse issues, the therapist should slow the process until a necessary rapport and trust relationship has been developed.I would recommend this book highly to women who have been in recovery for some time and are still wondering why it isn't working. I think all therapists should read this book to get a more in depth understanding of Trauma Reenactment Syndrome."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book Of Hope And Understanding","review":"At last...there is hope of recovery. After reading many other books on the subject of self-harm, a lot of them containing helpful information, I still despaired of getting well. When I came across Dusty Miller's book, I was amazed at the depth of insight into self-injurious behavior it contained. I feel like shouting to the world that SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS. The book addresses a problem shrouded in mystery even to the woman herself, but I believe that the author has found the key. It is not my custom to write reviews even though I devour books of all subjects; however, I had to encourage other women to get this book. It is a roadmap of hope and understanding leading to recovery."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book Of Hope And Understanding","review":"This books speaks so clearly to me, I wish I had read it sooner. I have been through inpatient and outpatient treatment for bulimia and drinking and have not been able to stop hurting myself. The relief, pleasure, pain, release, comfort, numbness, and odd excitement I feel from hurting myself has never been explained so impressively as in Ms. Miller's book. If you think that you might be a woman who in whatever way keeps reverting to abusing herself for release, relief, comfort, or just to keep your sanity, I highly recommend this book. It will not cure you, but it gives great insight and has helped me feel less out of control in many ways. I can now see why I act in certain ways (i.e. try so hard to be close to someone them continuosly push them away, and more). There is more out there than the 12 steps, part of which is really understanding yourself, not just blindly adhereing to societies rules."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book Of Hope And Understanding","review":"THIS BOOK HAS HELPED ME UNDERSTAND MY BEST FRIEND A WHOLE LOT BETTER, I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL DOCTORS AND CHURCH MINISTERS AND CHURCH PASTORS AS AN EXCELENT HELP IN UNDERSTANDING WOMEN WHO SUFFER IN THESE AREAS ONCE I STARTED TO READ THIS BOOK I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.EASY TO READ EASY TO UNDERSTAND, SIMPLY THE BEST I HAVE READ IN THIS FIELD."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book Of Hope And Understanding","review":"Well, I could read about lost souls of stangers before it finaly came to me.

My \\"Triadic Self\\" was revealed in every single line before I realised the shickness of many friends. It's a shocking fact for many of us living our lives as we like to think we all know something about everything. When we do not understand everything, either the facts or events behind them. This book is a surprise for people who think they know why \\"Howard\\" was so bad to them. And for those who are not sure. It's with short true stories intertwined with hope and understanding. It's like a bare cold fact waiting to enter the souls of people in mental warfare. Who are lost and found in twisted hearts, sometimes. As a way of salvation somehow, but shocking in the same time. It's big as it's small and beyond."},{"Title":"SPECIAL GIFTS","review":"Ordinarily I'm not particularly fond of books about psychics but this book is unbelievably suspenseful, tense and romantic. It's hard to believe that it was released as a category romance because it could easily have been marketed as a suspense novel. Elizabeth Hardy has psychic powers that she uses to assist the police. It is when she receives images relating to the disappearance of a high profile socialite that her life becomes endangered. Enter Colonel Sam Oliver - grim, cynical and infinitely sexy. Kudos to Anne Stuart who manages to make you tense and wonder whether things will work out even though deep down you konw it's a harlequin and the good guys must surely triumph ...."},{"Title":"SPECIAL GIFTS","review":"She is a psychic that uses her gifts to aid the police. When she begins getting impressions about a missing socialite that could be connected to the disappearance of another woman, she and her powers come into contact with Col. Sam Oliver. The missing woman is the daughter of a high political office and he is trying to keep the lid on it while searching out a terrorist group connected to the missing women. It is steaming, taut, dark and with the alpha/gamma rogue that Stuart is famous for creating.This so though several years old, it not dated in anyway. An absolute must for Stuart fans."},{"Title":"SPECIAL GIFTS","review":"Interesting book. Even though I've read the basic plot a thousand times (in fact, comparisons to Linda Howard's Dream Man are pretty much inevitable), Stuart took her story in a direction that felt fresh.Elizabeth Hardy is psychic. She periodically helps the police with cases, especially those relating to missing persons. One day, while in a trance, trying to find a missing woman, Mary Nelson, she sees a truck with the words \\"Spandau Corporation\\" painted over but still visible. When she mentions it to the detective in charge, a former Army guy, the man's shocked, because the Spandau Corporation is a shadowy terrorist organization Elizabeth would never have heard of, and this mention turns this supposedly \\"normal\\" case into something much more worrying.The detective calls a former colleague in Army Intelligence, and this colleague, Colonel Sam Oliver, immediately catches a plane to see what's going on. The daughter of a highly placed government official has been kidnapped, and Sam suspects Mary Nelson's disappearance might be related to this. And as Sam and Elizabeth work together to find her, the case becomes more and more complicated.Well, this was a category book which felt much longer than its 251 pages. Not that it was boring or slow-moving, not at all, but it felt more complex than the regular category. I especially liked the romance. At first you think this is going to be a typical psychic / skeptic relationship, but it turns out Sam isn't really such a traditional skeptic, which adds an interesting edge. He's also a bit more ruthless than the average hero (not that I'm surprised by this, given who the author is), and I enjoyed that surprisingly, Elizabeth was more than a match for him in this way.Where this didn't work so well was in the aspect that was more traditional, which is Elizabeth's extreme sexual innocence. This is one of those dead-beneath-the-waist virgins, and though being afraid of being psychically overwhelmed by such an intimate act IS a valid reason for her virginity, I didn't like the fact that the woman was so incredibly naive. Oh, well, it doesn't slow her down much when they get to it!While the romance was interesting, the suspense aspect was a bit more half-baked and had a few \\"give me a break!\\" moments. The enemy was annoyingly amorphous. They are \\"terrorists\\", but we never get a sense of what they stand for, of what their objective is, other than to generate chaos. Plus, what kind of terrorist organization paints its name on the side of its trucks? And within the US, too? Just imagine Al Qaeda terrorists driving around in cars clearly marked with an Al Qaeda logo.The ending was mostly good. I enjoyed the interesting visit to a seedy, dangerous version of Venice, but I just wish Elizabeth hadn't shown some TSTL tendencies. Other than that, great book!"},{"Title":"SPECIAL GIFTS","review":"I think this was my first Anne Stuart book. It was love at first sight. I really gravitated towards this story about a reclusive woman who is tormented by her psychic ability to see dark events, and the mysterious, clearly dangerous, and very ruggedly-attractive man who comes to her hiding place from the world to get her help solving a kidnapping that may have national security implications. I don't really enjoy romance books where the characters are tracking a serial killer, unless they're really good. And this one was. For me they are too gritty, and the blood and death really overwhelms the book, and drowns out the romance. Not this one. Ms Stuart does a great job of weaving this story, making the focus is on the growing love between Elizabeth and Sam, but carrying the plot along so that you're invested in solving the murders taking place.Elizabeth is reserved and quiet on the surface, but inwardly haunted by those terrible visions. Sam is a strong, enigmatic military man who's all about the mission. His vitality intimidates her, but also seduces her back to life again. Sam isn't too happy he has to work with such a quiet little mouse to get his mission accomplished. But he ends up falling for this mild-mannered and plain spinster woman when it's really at cross-purposes for his mission. He is not prepared for how much she comes to mean to him, especially when he has to put her life at risk to catch the killer he is after. Although Sam isn't as in your face dangerous as Ms. Stuart's later heroes (particularly in the Ice series), he is definitely a lethal man who will not hesitate to kill without mercy to protect Elizabeth and to achieve his mission.It was great to read this story and watch Elizabeth come out of her shell, and see the strong, intense attraction between this unlikely couple unfold. Early on, Elizabeth has a vision about her and Sam, and a certain red dress that is pretty spicy, and you know that things are going to heat up. And Ms. Stuart really delivers on the romantic relationship in this book. That's what kept me reading despite the dark subject matter. It is really interesting how passionate the love scenes in these oldies can be without being explicit like the newer books. You feel all the emotions and the intensity even though a lot is left to the imagination.I was hooked on Anne Stuart when I read this Silhouette Intimate Moments I checked out from the library so many moons ago (I used to read every single Silhouette Intimate Moment I could find at the library, and enjoyed almost all of them. Those were the days). It started a twenty-plus year relationship with my favorite author. She has brought so many hours of joy into my life. Nobody does romance as well as Anne Stuart in my book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Fire blazes through a Manhattan office building, killing the 50 people inside.

I loved the gutsy, tough, yet warm and caring character Georgia Skeehan. I'd like to see her in future stories. The book has a great plot that takes so many twists and turns you're never quite sure &quot;who did it&quot; or what's going to happen next. I couldn't put it down, and I didn't want it to end. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"This book is definitely what they say - a red hot debut. It read it in a couple of days because it was so readable - the story is jam-packed with twists and turns which make it an enjoyable and unpredictable read. At first I was annoyed with what seemed to me like telegraphing - you know - where the author lets you see into the mind of everyone around so you know what is going to happen next. However the story is a lot more clever than that and it kept me interested almost to the last page.This is the debut novel so we need to be introduced to rookie fire Marshall Georgia Skeehan. While not her first day on the job she is still learning her way and making mistakes with it. Of course before we meet her we get introduced to the first fire in the most graphic and dramatic way. I didn't much like that - a bit too much detail for me. Anyway this first investigation turns out to be the work of a serial arsonist - or so Georgia thinks. Through some political wangling she is appointed to the taskforce - nicknamed the FART squad - something to do with Fire and Arson Research Tactical Squad (or something like that.) So we get the since that it is not highly respected by the Firefighters of New York themselves. Also in the squad is Mac Marenko who is leading the team - and if it is possible to say about a story to do with Fire fighters - sparks fly between them immediately.The team has trouble from the start - Mac is in conflict with Georgia about her theories on the arson and this flares up when she is politically appointed to lead the squad. As the investigation advances Georgia comes to realise that this arsonist is getting personal and not only that - there is a deadline before something terrible so going to happen. As the story progresses we have a greater dimension of all the characters revealed - Georgia, Mac, included - all are hiding dark secrets or clues to why this is happening and corruption is not far below the surface of it all.Through it all are the themes of a womans place in the fire service and this is revisited quite often - subtely which is nice. In fact it forms a backbone for Georgia's relationships in the fire service and the FART squad and also for the story in general.While the story hummed along there were things in it that I just didn't like - for instance I am not a person that likes gore much and while there wasn't that much of it the graphic descriptions of people dying in fires really turned my stomach. Also I found some of the writing just a bit clunky for me. It might just be me but I really noticed that she was always referring to things by their colours - and sometimes repeating them -for instance there was an Eggplant coloured dress, and later in another chapter another eggplant coloured something or other. Sloane Michaels eyes (at a critical moment) she notices are root-beer coloured.I also thought that the ending was a just a bit convenient. A suicide to try to cleanse away the guilt or something. But it was preceded by a long explanation with the clock ticking on a very large fire bomb - with four minutes to spare there is all this angsting going on. Conveniently for the story not only Georgia's mother, but her son are in the building about to blow up and in the thousands of people who pore out when it is evacuated Georgia finds her mother - but her son is trapped inside still - having somehow separated from his grandmother. I know it is possible but it is just one of those convenient plot devices that didn't seem necessary to me given the how great the rest of the story was. Why plant the son in there when she had every reason to go in there anyway?It is really on for these reasons that I have given this story less than 5. I am definitely interested in getting Chazin's next book and trying it out. Her heroine is very much more in the mold of Kay Scarpetta or Kinsey Millhone."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"New York City Fire Marshal Georgia Skeeham examines suspicious looking fires.

Suzanne Chazin shows she has researched firefighting as she cleverly incorporates firefighting techniques into her plot so that the reader feels ready to fight a fire. Thus, the novel needs a warning label: &quot;leave firefighting to the trained professionals.&quot; The story line is fast-paced and filled with action and is a chilling thriller that is so frightening because Ms. Chazin makes it seem so real.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Just finished this book, it was great.... Took me by surprise all the different twists, and great accuracy on her story line"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"I have a strong interest in the FDNY, and am very much in favor of the idea of female firefighters, so I really wanted to like this book--but I didn't. The book was extremely well-researched; the author is married to a high-ranking member of the FDNY and clearly had access to information unavailable to most civilians. So, most of the fire-fighting aspects of the novel rang completely true. Unfortunately, as a novel, the book was very problematic for me. It is a standard thriller, at best, with the typical &quot;Super Clever&quot; psychotic villain, workmanlike prose, and so forth. The main character was so tentative and unsure of herself that one suspects that she might not even last a week as an actual member of the FDNY. All things being equal, I like an escapist thriller as much as anyone else, but I'm afraid this book uses its detailed research to substitute for entertainment and narrative voice. I kept waiting for a dash of humor, or a genuine spark of energy, but neither ever appeared. I bought the book purely because of the subject matter, but now I really wish I'd waited for a paperback edition, or--better yet--gotten it at the library."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"I violated a basic rule of reading fiction - don't read a book about your profession written by an outsider.While the story was interesting, many of the facts were dead wrong. Starting with the description of a fire giving off carbon monoxide when it first ignites (it doesn't), the &quot;flashpoint&quot; of the radiator (flashpoint is only applicable to flammable and combustible materials), the concern over being electrocuted in the burned out building (if the fire doesn't kill the power to the building, the firefighters certaily will), to the scene where one character dies and the EMT's just cover him with a sheet (EMT's would certainly be doing CPR), and ending with the desription of the power supply to the arc welder (arc welders produce 250 amps, they do not require 250 amps!)The lesson is that if you are going to write a book which requires technical accuracy, have it read by someone who knows the subject well before publishing.This book might be a good read for someone who doesn't know the firefighting and investigation business, despite the rather melodramatic ending."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Suzanne Chazin's new suspense novel &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; is the best page turner I've read in quite a while. As a busy mom, I usually reserve reading for evenings after the kids are tucked in. But I toted &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; around with me for the three days it took me to finish it, sneaking in a few pages every chance I had.The best part of the novel for me, is the endless twists and turns of the plot. Just when I thought I 'd &quot;figured it out,&quot; another surprise popped up. The scientific and technological detail woven into the book makes the journey all the more riveting and real. For those of us not connected to the world of fires and firefighters, it is a revealing and frightening peak into a dangerous world.In addition to the great fire adventure are some terrific characters. Georgia Skeehan, fire marshal, is not an instantly loveable heroine, but rather a person that grows on you as you get to know her. Her relationships with the rest of her department are not static, but develop in interesting, unpredictable ways. The flames in a budding romance are almost as hot as the fires she investigates.Chazin's characters, her knowledge of the job and her New York City settings all make for a brilliant and thrilling climax to a novel that is bound to satisfy!I highly reccommend this book and look forward to the next in what deserves to be a long series of suspense novels."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Here's one I'm glad I didn't miss.

She's an underdog in every sense of the word: a rookie, a woman in a macho job where men hold all the power, a single mother, and a former firefighter plagued by self-doubt. Danger lurks around every corner: Are the fires the work of a serial arsonist? And if so, why is her own department undermining her at every turn? Great forensic detail and intelligent twists make the story a page-turner, the supporting cast is rich, and Georgia makes such a dynamic and empathetic heroine, you want to savor every scene.I couldn't put this book down, and I didn't want to finish it.

Rookie fire marshall, Georgia Skeehan, is put on the task force to solve an inferno that leveled a New York City skyscraper in minutes, killing fifty-four people. With unprecedented temperatures of almost 3000 degrees, nobody had a chance to escape and those caught in the building practically melted to death. Because she's a rookie and a woman, the task force basically ignores her, giving Georgia grunt work to keep her out of their way. But when she stumbles over clues that link this fire with several others and letters that prove this may be the work of a serial arsonist, the task force begins to take her more seriously and show her some respect. As evidence and bizarre details mount and point to unlikely suspects, the task force is unsure who to trust and Georgia and her team race against the clock to find the answers before the promised final catastrophe..... Suzanne Chazin has written a spectacular debut mystery/thriller that has it all...a tight, suspenseful plot, smart, tense writing, vivid scenes that come alive on the page and memorable, well-drawn characters.

She brings an insiders look to the world of firefighting and arson investigation. There is a good dose of realism in her story. She has created some finely drawn characters and has handled a couple of potential cliched situations with aplomb. She makes a lot of references to the inner workings of FDNY and they all ring true. I would have liked a little more procedural detail on the arson investigations, but maybe she will develop that with future works. This story incorporates investigation techniques, fire fighting, financial chicanery, a budding romance, single parenthood, interdepartmental rivalries and blends them all together in a story that works.

The hero or heroine must suffer from some flaw which makes his or her ultimate triumph more human and less like the inevitable victory of &quot;truth, justice and the American Way&quot; to put it in superhero terms.Meet rookie Fire Marshall Georgia Skeehan of the FDNY. No ladies rooms in the firehouses; no respect from the brass either. Improbably the Department is triumphant over the NYPD to assume control of a serial arson case that resulted in dozens of lost lives. More improbably, Skeehan the rookie is assigned to lead the team.Skeehan doubts herself since she is so inexperienced and because she failed to rescue a buddy in a dangerous fire while a firefighter. Hence her tragic flaw is revealed, and once revealed will surely be used to torment her.Well Georgia does succeed (you knew that already) and earns the respect of her fire brothers. It is not clear if this earned respect translates into bathroom construction at firehouses.Suzanne Chazin is a talented writer. This protagonist has a lot of potential and a lot of original material to work from both in terms of the characteristics of fire but in the characters in the FDNY. Chazin has woven a complex story and a complex subject neatly and with considerable dexterity.If there are some obvious formulas being applied in this work, it will soon pass. Chazin knows her stuff, has a great imagination, and the determination to leave her own mark on this genre."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"I just recently got this book used and noticed that it was written and published before 9/11. Georgia Skeehan is an FDNY fire marshal who investigates fires. She was a firefighter first as was her dad before her. She is a single mom who lives with her mom and her 9 year old son. She has an experience partner, Randy Carter, and is learning the ropes. The book opens describing a fire that is happening in a commercial building where there is a party going on in the business. The fire spreads so quickly that the 54 people are trapped and die. In fighting the fire, an FDNY firefighter named Quinn also dies leaving his family of wife and kids.Georgia and her partner are called to investigate and soon realize that this is a special type of fire using a very fast acting accelerant so that the temperature is over 2500 degrees Fahrenheit! As Georgia and her partner are made part of a task force under Mac Marenko the conflict begins and Georgia, made aware by their lab guy Walter Frankel, knows there have been 3 other high accelerant fires and thus wants to relate them and everybody from Mac to the commander is against her.The reader is treated to insight from different characters' points of view including the arsonist.

I thought I bascially knew all I needed to know about how firefighters think and live but I had not read this novel yet! In addition, I do not think there are many suspense writers out there who can write about an actual fire the way Ms. Chazin has in this book. It might appear &quot;easy&quot; to write about a building in flames but the fire scenes in this novel are realistic and harrowing. Best of all, Ms. Chazin knows how to write about people and put them in an exciting story. I think any serious readers of tough female suspense fiction should take notice!

But I have to say I am so glad I took the chance because The Fourth Angel is a stunning debut novel by Suzanne Chazin. It is loaded with chilling scenes and plot twisters that keep you guessing who is behind some of the worst fires to ever hit New York City.Georgia Skehan is a rookie fire marshal. She is struggling to carve out her niche in a male orient field. Added to her struggle is old baggage following her around on whether she was responsible for the death of a fellow firefighter. Georgia is called to the scene of a deliberate fire that was so intense and severe that no one survived or even had a chance of making it out alive. An old friend in the department tips her off that this fire wasn't the first of its kind in recent months. In fact, there having been letters sent by someone calling himself the Fourth Angel sprouting Bible verses from Revelations justifying his actions. Protecting her friend's identity, she tries to tell the chief fire marshal her theories. However, the \\"good old boys' club\\" isn't interested in what a woman thinks and tries to ridicule her to the point she will drop the matter. But thanks to the top man, the fire commissioner, overhearing the conversation Georgia is assigned to the investigating team headed by Mac Marenko. Marenko tries to dissuade Georgia by assigning her the dirty jobs. Georgia still manages to uncover some impressive leads and soon Marenko begins to believe Georgia just might be on to something.This book opens with one of the most frightening scenes I've ever read. You know what is coming, yet you keeping hoping you're wrong. There is no way you can read this book without developing a liking for the characters. Each in their own way, whether right or wrong, is trying to do what they think is for the good of the department. In Georgia, we get a strong single mom who comes from a family of firefighters. She is trying to do the job she loves while fighting discrimination from men who think women have no place fighting fires. Mac Marenko starts out as a complete jerk until we see the human side of him develop. There is sexual tension between the two that makes you hope both characters will be around in the next book. The villain, what can I say about the villain? He is pure evil and I hope I don't have nightmares about him tonight.Ms. Chazin's next novel featuring Georgia Skehan is supposed to be out in 2002. Man, I hate having to wait that long after discovering this author. I am definitely hooked!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Harrowing, great fiction, page-turner...Looking over these reviews, I must have read a different book. The characterization was sloppy, to say the least. The guy who said \\"youse\\" so you knew he was a louse (and he said it every stinking time he opened his mouth), cardboard characters aplenty, characters who changed their perceptions of each other just long enough to have sex, firefighting facts dropped with the subtlty of lead balloons...This was the first book I'd read by Suzanne Chazin. Even though I bought the second book at the same time and actually have it in my possession, I can't bring myself to read it. I paid $2 for both books and I feel like I got ripped off.I suggest Earl Emerson's novels for truly well-written firefighter novels. Emerson is a firefighter and, unlike Chazin, manages to create a believeable and taut thriller."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Hey this book is awesome, I absolutley loved it. I could harldly put the book down. The book made me feel as if i was part of teh firehouse and was a charcter in the book. It is a must read"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"As a career and volunteer firefighter I thought I wouldn't like fiction, but this particular author changed my mind. She adds enough realism that her writings can be considered 'real to life'. If you like HAZMAT stuff, you'll like this book. If you like looking at the 'life' of the firefighter, particularly the woman firefighter, this book is for you. If you are a fire or arson investigator, this book reveals a real pattern of fire investigation. I agree that the second half of this book was difficult to put down - finished it in a long weekend."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Suzanne Chazin has delivered a fresh and exciting debut with THE FOURTH ANGEL.Georgia Skeehan knows all about pressure---she's a single mom, and a rookie marshal in what is still a man's world---the New York City Fire Department. Asked to head up an investigation of a serial arsonist who quotes from the Book of Revelation, Georgia is facing the biggest challenge of her life.With her inside knowledge of the NYC Fire Department, Chazin lends authenticity to her impressive debut novel. I'm looking forward to the next installment of what promises to be a wonderful series."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"This book swept me along as if I were riding on a fire truck. The excitement never waned, and the details about fire equipment and fire fighting were intelligently explained to this layman. I look forward to the next Georgia Skeehan book. Mac sounds like a really promising romantic interest; I hope he appears in the next book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"_The Fourth Angel_ features Georgia Skeehan, rookie fire marshall for the NYFD. After a deadly and destructive fire which killed over 50 civilians and one firefighter, Georgia discovers that this fire is only the latest in a series of fires set by an arsonist called the Fourth Angel. Problems surface in Georgia's investigation, and she is hampered by the politics of the fire department and guilt over the death of her partner two years ago. The fires escalate until the Fourth Angel warns her of an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; fire that she must race to stop. _The Fourth Angel_ has mystery, suspense, and a touch of romance."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Georgia Skeehan, rookie fire marshal and former NYC firefighter, spearheads an investigation into a series of high-temperature accelerant (HTA) fires that have hit the Big Apple in the past few months. Despite the existence of letters from an ominous, scripture-quoting &quot;fourth angel,&quot; as well as the many similarities between the recent fires, very few in the New York City Fire Department are interested in hearing Skeehan's theory that the fires may be related. Everywhere she digs, however, she finds something that arouses her suspicions and fills her with dread at the truth she might uncover.Georgia Skeehan is a very enjoyable character and will make an excellent protagonist for an ongoing series. She has the warmth and vulnerability to be a likeable heroine, yet also has the grit and tenacity needed not only to survive but to excel in the male-dominated fire department. Reminiscent of Patricia Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Skeehan is a thinking investigator who is nevertheless unafraid to get down and dirty in the heart of her pursuit.&quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; is a very promising debut and is highly recommended.Reviewed by Mystery Ink"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"When my husband asked if I wanted to watch a movie with Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts and I said I'd rather read, I knew Suzanne Chazin had hooked me with her compelling drama. One of the first rules given a writer is &quot;Write what you know.&quot; Chazin, a member of the International Association of Arson Investigators and wife of a veteran New York City firefighter, proves the wisdom of this advice. Her knowledge of both firefighters and fire provide a solid base for a tale that is filled with surprises. Just when you think you're headed in one direction, you're not; just when you decide someone is a good guy, he's not. Or is he? Chazin keeps her reader guessing, and reading. I hope we'll see more of her main character, fire marshall Georgia Skeehan. I might have discovered my grown-up Nancy Drew."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"The storyline in 'The Fourth Angel' seems simple enough: An arsonist sets fires, kills people. Fire Marshal Georgia Skeehan solves cases and catches bad guy. But could it really be that simple? NO.Suzanne Chazin has written a hugely entertaining, suspenseful and original thriller. And it was her debut novel to boot.Chazin has created a real, sympathetic heroine in Georgia Skeehan. I look forward to reading the next Skeehan book.I could not help but feel while I was reading this book that it was written by Jeffery Deaver. Chazin's prose is very similar to Deaver's, and she even personalizes the bad guy by giving him a nickname until we discover his identity. This is something that Deaver does often, and very effectively. In addition, the level of suspense, and the feeling that there is a suprise waiting around every page also reminds me of Deaver.If you have ever read a Deaver book, or if you like page-turning suspense with an original story and, a new, original heroine, read this book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Ms. Chazin has successfully composed a first rate novel which illustrates a clear understanding of the work performed by NYC Fire Marshals, both in front of and behind the scenes. She has accurately depicted the gritty underside of Fire Investigation in the BIG APPLE - at times rotten to the core. Initially, I was skeptical, after all how could this outsider portray New Yorks BRAVEST conducting some of their best investigative work. As a retired New York City Fire Marshal and the participant in over a thousand investigations I was especially cynical of an outsiders ability to tell such a story. I took the opportunity to read &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; on a recent lengthy flight and would put the book down reluctantly. Her knowledge of forensics and fire science is quite clear. I was suprised by her appreciation of the legitimate fear of electrocution at a fire scene. Building occupants, both legal and illegal are notorious for diverting electrical service from unauthorized sources bereft of any over current protection. Shutting power at the main breaker or a disconnect at the service entrance is no sure bet that &quot;the power is off&quot;. Ms. Chazin's work although fiction is full of true NY characters, very much like it's firehouses and fire investigation base operations. I read &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; in two sittings, I enjoyed it and encourage readers, inside and ouside the field of fire investigation to read this book. I look forward to the sequel and re-visiting &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; in theaters."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"It has been a while since I have picked up a book that was so completely engaging. The characters, the plot, the dialog all hung together and made a very fun, satisfying read. The technical details were interesting and the twists and turns served up made this a can't-put-it-down read. There is something for everyone in this one and I cannot wait to see what this new series produces next. If I could give this one more than 5 stars I would.....you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"The novel, The Fourth Angel, by Suzanne Chazin is a realpage-turner.Rookie fire marshal, Georgia Skeehan, has not gotten any high priority cases because she is a woman in a man's world, the FDNY. Without warning she suddenly finds herself in charge of one of the most important arson cases in New York City. She is investigating a series of HTA (High Temperature Accelerant) fires. All the clues point to a serial arsonist who calls himself the Fourth Angel. He sends messages to Marshal Skeehan and the FDNY quoting scripture. The fires start off small, but gradually become bigger as the death toll from the fires increase. One of the last messages sent to Marshal Skeehan is one promising a fire of biblical proportions. One like New York has never seen before. Can Skeehan discover who the \\"Fourth Angel\\" really is, and stop his greatest fire yet before more innocent people meet a fiery death.Suzanne Chazin is able to grip readers with her suspenseful and thrilling novel. The book is full of surprises and has many twists to it. It is impossible to guess the outcome before it is revealed and that is what makes the book so great.This book is one that many different kinds of people will enjoy. The reader does not have to be familiar with the fire service to enjoy and understand Chazin's mastery of pyrotechnics. It is a great book for anyone who likes criminal fiction or just a good thriller with a lot of action."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"A delight from beginning to end. Funny, scary, informative, thrilling. I can see a blockbuster movie being made of this novel, starring Julia Roberts as the gutsy and quick-thinking arson investigator. I'm simmering to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"A gripping, fast paced story on par with any of today's best loved mystery writers. This exciting page turner is filled with fascinating insights into the intriguing and little understood brotherhood of firefighters and arson investigators. A cut above garden variety who-done-its? as the author successfully layers the story with complex character development and moral dilemmas. The heroine, Georgia Skeehan, must reconcile the reality of imperfect people striving to do their best in an often ambiguous world. All this amidst a story line chock full of twists and turns that leaves one guessing right through the final pages. Can't wait to see where Georgia takes us next...."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"I think Suzanne Chazin will go very far as a suspense writer. She has a great character in Georgia and very impressive knowledge of the FDNY (New York's Fire Department). She writes about the world of firefighters in a fresh and convincing way. I thought I bascially knew all I needed to know about how firefighters think and live but I had not read this novel yet! In addition, I do not think there are many suspense writers out there who can write about an actual fire the way Ms. Chazin has in this book. It might appear &quot;easy&quot; to write about a building in flames but the fire scenes in this novel are realistic and harrowing. Best of all, Ms. Chazin knows how to write about people and put them in an exciting story. I think any serious readers of tough female suspense fiction should take notice! She' s woth it."},{"Title":"The Fourth Angel","review":"Suzanne Chazin's debut novel, \\"The Fourth Angel\\", follows inexperienced New York City fire marshall Georgia Skeehan as she investigates a string of hellish serial arsons and confronts both chauvinsim and corruption within the department.I'll leave the description at that, because, despite an author with a decent command of pacing and language, you've definitely read this book before. It is a truly staggering assemblage of cliches, stock characters, hackneyed plot devices and well-worn tropes.Single mom with resentful son? Check. Scrappy female firefighter/cop/soldier who must earn the trust of her bigoted superiors? Check. Love/hate relationship with co-worker? Check. Protagonist haunted by the memory of father killed in line of duty? Check. Superiors focused on covering their own backsides to the exclusion of all else? Check. Villain who gets his comeuppance at the hands of his weapon of choice? Check. Rich guy with something to hide? Check? Family member/friend entangled in plot? Check. Suspicions raised by a borrowed matchbook from a location key to the investigation? Check.What's worse, though, is that on top of what appears to be a plot pulled from some sort of how-to-write-a-thriller-by-the-numbers beginning author's course, Ms. Chazin didn't seem to know when to stop; it is ludicrously overstuffed with attempted plot twists. Further, the characters are two-dimensional, wildly inconsistent, largely unlikable and often just plain stupid. The villain fancies himself some sort of malevolent genius, but that may be because his pursuers are, essentially, nitwits, drunks and morons.Everywhere I've looked at reviews for \\"The Fourth Angel\\", I have seen positive commentary. Frankly, I am at complete loss as to how this can be, because it is cookie-cutter to the point where I felt like the author was laughing at me for having purchased it. I've been an avid reader for decades, and in all that time, there have been only two books I have either abandoned because I actively disliked them or not bothered to finish out of boredom. This is the third.PS. The dust jacket photo for the hardcover edition of \\"The Fourth Angel\\" features a female fire fighter. Except not really. Rather, it is a truly amateurish Photoshopping of an attractive woman's eyes over a firefighter's oxygen mask. Funny enough, upon closer examination, but also kind of sad, since it serves as an effective analog for the book's contents."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations because my Accelerated English teacher made us. I do not think the novel was very well thought out and was much too indecisive in many parts. Dickens did not seem to know really what he wanted to do with the plot. He even made two endings!!! He was much too descriptive and that made the story even more boring than its story line made it in the first place. I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have.

I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books.

Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had to do this for school.

I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it.

His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops.

In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I found most of the book a good read.

I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels.

Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act.

Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"...this book and I are!

Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life.

I read the book with the aid of books on tape while in the back of my parent's Toyota riding through Holland.

The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic.

Just about anything and everything goes wrongfor Pip and just about everyone in the story dies. It wasa good book, don't get me wrong, just a bit of a downer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I cannot fathom how this novel only has a rating of 3 stars. It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch.

As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years.

I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book.

Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring!

I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is Charles Dickens classic novels that portrays the story of Pip, born into a destitute and poor family, with little hope for a bright future. We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time.

So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Certainly one of the most famous of Dickens's novels (right up there withOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)), Great Expectations follows a familiar coming-of-age narrative as young Phillip Pirrip - better known as \\"Pip\\" - negotiates the rocky road to adulthood in early 19th century London. One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now. A recommended story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I have now listened to three of the five available Dickens' readings from Martin Jarvis and, whilst there are other fine readers out there (e.g. Robert Whitfield for Blackstone Audio Books and Patrick Tull for Recorded Books), I truly don't think there is a finer performer in this particular market.As Great Expectations unfolds through a vast range of character voices, Mr Jarvis' obvious empathy with the text makes this an effortless yet utterly engaging way for the listener to experience the genius of Dickens, whilst Amazon's price makes this item an absolute bargin.I cannot recommend Great Expectations read by Martin Jarvis highly enough..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Over the last few years, every other book I've read has been Dickens. This is, so far, my favorite. It is an absolutely brilliantly woven tale. Dickens was remarkably talented at creating characters that captured the essence of what makes us human to the point that he was able to create characters who are completely real, and might be found walking amung us today. If you are new to Dickens, this would be a great place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is a classic story of unrequited love and growth. It teaches something to everyone who reads it. There is so much beauty and depth in this novel, it cannot be put into words. My advice for anyone and everyone who will read this in the future is to treasure every moment you spend reading this book. Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it!

Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life.

This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again.

Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book.

Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students.

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"My grandad recommended I read this.

However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story. Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid.

I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person.

As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

I decided to try Great Expectations as my first introduction to the great English author, on the recommendation of a friend of mine. And I was not disappointed!That said, I had a bit of a difficult time at first getting used to Dickens's use of language, and I found the first part of the book a little hard to get into, but I didn't have to struggle too much or for too long: after a short while the characters came alive for me and the story became so absorbing, that I could not put the book down. The novel has a fantastic, very tight plot, and the characters are memorable. This always works for me as a reader!Great Expectations was my first Dickens read, but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

To me, it is not dissimilar to David Copperfield in its themes; however, David Copperfield moves me to tears every time I read it.I came across an original review of Great Expectations at The Atlantic Monthly's website. The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine.

Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer. If you like to read about romance, deception, horror and drama then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup, that falls madly in love with a young lady name Estrella. He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this. If you like a dramatic sope-opera filled with love, suspense, and action than you will find this book astounding. I can tell you I loved this bok, and I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I hated a Tale of Two Cities but I loved this novel. This typical Dickens, great characters, several plot twists, and a lot of description. For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review.

But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dudes.

The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction.

I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.)

It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"my 14 year old daughter needed to read this book for one of her classes. she didn't think she would like it, but she ended up loving it. my 17 year old son is also reading it now and he also really likes it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I love listening to it.

I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality.

This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters.

The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes. These reviews on here only describe parts of dickens story so if you do have to read this for 9th grade read it don't take the short cut because the teachers will know and when you have a test on the book you will FAIL!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's. This illogical story has some exciting and entertaining parts to it,as well as old fashioned humor, but as a whole it is slow and tedious. Read it if you have patience, otherwise, you are in for a long one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on.

There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today.

Great Expectations by Charles Dickens fulfilled this. It is a compelling story about a young man who through a series of circumstances meets a beautiful yet cold hearted girl named Estella. The book follows him through his adolence an adult years. To me this book still hold very true today. It tells about love and how time may not heal all wounds. And also about how some people are manipulated, as Estalla was, into living out others lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectaitons by Charles Dickens is a good book.

This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot.
