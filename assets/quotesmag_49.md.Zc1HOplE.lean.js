I first read it as a young teenager and knew even then that it was an important, near-perfect book. I understand that we all have different tastes, but I'm amazed that some few reviewers actually found the book boring. I can't help but doubt that it was really read and digested by them. If you haven't read it, do so. It's an absolutely wonderful book--a classic to be treasured. Thank heaven Harper Lee wrote it!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I figured out something when I finished re reading this book after I read new biography on Harper Lee titled \\"Mockingbird\\" Why adult revewers who love this book can not write or spell good? There are chunk of generation who are Mockingbird-free who is now about 50 to 60years old, well educated, well read, good speller but missed timing to read this book as young adult because it was not around or school didn't assigned it on them. These people grow up and know once how to appriciate good books, it is kinda hard to go back to pick up this book in first time in their lives. So naturally, if you are not an English major--means you can't write-- and an adult and read this book and able to appriciate it, chances are you are kinda person who won't read more complicated books anyway or your kid had to read it so you just did (my case) or watched movie first and got interested in or, you are an immigrant (my case) ---so we can't spell.It have been four years since I read it first time and back then, I was reading only chicklits and books my kid was reading because that's about I could have understood. Now I can see through how much struggle for the author to make this book publishable with help from editor and agent. How come Atticus, that perfect dad, let kids go alone in the dark to Halloween pagent and aunt Alexandra, the gossip, would not wanted to accompany them knowing whole town is at the school? because otherwise Bob could not have chance to attack kids so whole climax won't come about. Scout does pre- show for the family and go so far to explain once she got to the show, that ladies too tired from decorating were not there, to justify her aunt's absence. I hate myself even thinking about all these while I was re-reading but could not help it. It moved me to my guts the first time I read it when I did not know any better (or worse)It is sad as many kids love this book in this review pages, some kids just plain hate it. You have to be young and flexisible to hit by the chord but you have to be mature enough to understand the deeper message. I guess, that's why 6th to 9th grade are the best match for the first time Mockingbird experience. You can come back to it again and still moves you but, it still doesn't make you a good writer or speller."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's book To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic piece of literature read by students everywhere. However, I was not one of those students. It was not on my reading list, much to my regret now. I just finished reading the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. I love Scout's charming point of view and her descriptions of childhood summers make me wish for times past. Justice, or lack of it, is made so real when looked at from the perspective of Scout and her brother Jem. And the dynamic between the kids and the mysterious Boo Radley is just plain cool in the book.The movie is great too. A classic. The way some of the scenes are portrayed is dead on. I also love how Scout's narration in the book is carried into the movie. It's great to hear Harper Lee's narrative spoken. The charm of Scout's childhood is effectively portrayed visually in the film. I do like the book better for the simple reason that it portrays so much more than the movie ever could. The \\"relationship\\" between the kids and Boo Radley is included in the movie but more fully developed in the book. Because the movie just can't handle it fully, it ends up as a sidestory to the trial instead of a developed storyline all its own as in the book. The movie also couldn't include some of the additional charm of the book - like the storyline with Mrs. Dubose; how the kids feel about Atticus and the Finch family; visiting Calpurnia's church; or how Aunt Alexandra, surprisingly enough, began to have an effect on the lady Scout would become.Don't get me wrong though, I really did enjoy the movie. The character portrayals were great - especially Scout and Atticus. But I must say (at the risk of sounding like the girl that I am) that the best part about the movie to me was that it brought the book to life so effectively that in parts I was somewhat emotional. It is a powerful story of childhood and race and justice (or injustice) that cannot be ignored. It speaks to so many in book or film form. Awesome! Enjoy both!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I consider this the best book I have ever read concerning the racial tensions in the South during the time period in which it takes place.

We are told the story by Scout, a six-year-old tomboy struggling to understand \`grown-up' attitudes, while staying true to her overalls and troublesome streak.Her father, Atticus, is my personal favourite character. Atticus Finch is a widowed lawyer who decides to take on the case of Tom Robinson-A black man charged with the rape of a white girl, Mayella Ewell. The story, of course, is set during the time of segregation in America so Atticus' decision cause uproar in the extremely racist and prejudiced town.Scout's 10-year-old brother Jem, is also a main character in the book. We learn of his aspirations to be a lawyer like his Dad. We view through his sister's eyes how he matures and grows during the time of the trial.Some more memorable characters are Calpurnia, the Finch Family's black housemaid, who is really more like a member of the family. Aunt Alexandra, Atticus' sister, who comes to stay to \`fix' the family with her prude ideas and change Scout into a young woman. Dill, the nephew of the Finch's neighbour, Miss. Rachel, who comes to stay during the summer. Mrs. Dubose, a dying old woman addicted to morphine determined to die clean. She backs up the strong theme of courage that runs throughout the book.Also Boo Radley. Boo is always on the children's minds, whether it is because something out of the ordinary has happened or they're just trying to catch a glimpse of him as he hasn't left his house in 15 years. Boo has a big impact on the plot of the book.This book is suitable for anyone who is capable of being completely captivated by an amazingly compelling read.I would completely recommend this book. This is because of everything I have mentioned. Its characters, the story, the lessons that can be learned from it, everything!Whether it's just to see what you're missing out on, for school or just to find out what all the fuss is about, read To Kill a Mockingbird. I promise that you will not be disappointed!Definitely 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Through the unbaised eyes of a young child in a racial southern town, Lee explores the deepest relations and choices that truely shape not only the heros of the past, but a powerful classic novel.Today children are taught in school about the horrors of prejudice, racism, amd hatred. We are also taught about the enduring heros that confronted these issues. Yet often these lessons hardly sink in. The narrator of the novel, young Scout, learns about racism through her town's hatred and prosecution of black people. She realizes that her own father is one of the many people who is brave enough to stand up for what is right what it is so much easier to hide behind everyone else. As Scout ls taught about these issues through experience, the reader also gains a deeper understanding of the true effects of racism.The book is not only an insight on human nature, but also has a fabulous plot and deeply explored characters. it can be a light read or a profound analysis can be done. All ways of reading the book are enjoyable and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Big Drive","review":"The book is a very enjoyable fictionalized tale of West Texas in the Post Civil War era.

It is a tale of people surviving a dark time."},{"Title":"Brahma Sutras and Their Principal Commentaries","review":"Many monographs and articles discuss the Brahmasutras, the ancient aphorisms of Badarayana that are held to be canonical in defining Vedanta. There however is no agreement on what they say, and all possible opinions exist. The living individual may be held to be completely different from the Supreme Being, or to be identical to Him, or to be identical but with specialty, or to be identical-AND-non-identical. The schools of thought that hold these views are respectively called Dvaita, Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaitadvaita (or Bhedabheda). The chief exponents of the first three, most prominent schools, are Madhva, Sankara, and Ramanuja. The theory of difference-and-identity is logically fallacious in several ways, and has not produced a commentator of sufficient stature to rank with these three.To the extent that Sankara and Ramanuja are the best known extant commentators on the Brahmasutras, it is but natural that much literature exists that discusses their contributions and work. However, most scholars of present date are but ill-informed of Madhva's commentaries (for instance, most do not know that he wrote TWO major, full-length commentaries, the study of both being essential to grasp the finer points of his system). Their treatment of his work is thus often factually inaccurate, and often takes recourse to special pleadings and non-sequiturs to justify preconceptions arrived at from considering rival views as completely canonical. What has been lacking is a clear and detailed analysis of the three major commentators' works to compare their interpretations of the Sutras side-by-side, as it were.The present work of B.N.K. Sharma, the distinguished historian and litterateur, thus fills a gap much in need of filling, and is sure to be warmly received by scholars for much time to come.Although some may be inclined to argue that Dr. Sharma's agendas of vigorous defense of Madhva, and of equally vigorous criticisms of others, in particular Sankara, make him a biased narrator, from a strictly neutral perspective it is but fair to observe that the opposite bias is all too prevalent elsewhere, so this is not an accusation totally unique to Dr. Sharma. Our author also presents his evidence in sufficient detail that a competent observer may well draw his own conclusions based upon them. If, after careful examination, these conclusions happen to differ from those of Dr. Sharma, the value of the work as a source of information is undiminished. It is however the considered opinion of this reviewer that few, if any, will care to cross swords with Dr. Sharma in his treatment of the material, and of those who do, none will emerge, even in his own mind, as the victor."},{"Title":"Lunchtime Enlightenment: Modern Meditations to Free the Mind and Unleash the Spirit - at Work, at Home, at Play","review":"From the title and cover image, this book looks like it might contain useful and enlightening tips on making room for meditation during an active work day. And it does--for about four pages in the middle of the book. Otherwise, it's chock-full of esoteric practices like the laughing meditation (Sit on the floor and force yourself to laugh for an hour--who has time for that?). Dove's introduction is more telling than she realizes. As a freelance consultant, she has plenty of time to roll on the floor in forced hysterics.

Often, books languish in the \\"to read\\" stacks that decorate my office. Sometimes one calls to me.So it was with Pragito Dove's welcome book, Lunchtime Enlightenment. And once I had started the Introduction, I was hooked.In clear, conversational tones, Dove tells exactly why meditation is not only practical but possible without denaturing it or reducing it to a mechanical recipe for climbing another step on the ladder of serial self improvement. (I don't know about you, but I get tired of that damn ladder!)One caution. dove begins her introduction by describing a day in which she spends more than two hours in various meditative practices. My first reaction was, \\"Right. I'll be doing that in my next lifetime.\\" Fortunately, I kept reading and learned that this was by no means the rule in her life nor was it the message in her book. Like most of us, there are many days on which she uses practices of just a few minutes duration. Her message is emphatically not that you need to give up your life in order to meditate, but rather that you can use mediation as a living resource - one that can take different forms for different functions and in different circumstances, informing your life rather than replacing it.I look forward to reading the rest of the book and learning many of the techniques in it.

But \\"Mountolive\\" comes to life with a vengeance! It may have something to do with his opportunity, in this version of the story, to draw with a very sharp pencil some of the products of the English society that he scorned - yet there is a strong sense of sympathy for the diplomat David Mountolive, trapped in a world of illusion and deceit.This is the volume where some of the hidden currents swirling under the surface of the other two are exposed. Many surprises: many motives revealed: and above all, many wonderful set-pieces. There's the desert festival of Sitna Damiana, with the amazing transfiguration of Narouz. The bitter meeting between Mountolive and his former love, the then-beautiful younger Leila, where now after many years and the ravages of smallpox, \\"He saw a plump and square-faced Egyptian lady of uncertain years, with a severely pock-marked face and eyes drawn grotesquely out of true by the antimony-pencil.\\" And the unforgettable discreet transaction between Nessim and Memlik Pasha: Nessim's \\"offering\\" is almost too elegant to be called a bribe: it is an addition to Memlik's prized collection of Korans, this one an \\"exquisite little Koran wrapped in soft tissue paper: he had carefully larded the pages with bank drafts negotiable in Switzerland.\\"But above all, the final apocalyptic revelation, the full, dark blossom of total treachery and death makes an unforgettable climax. This is the one that deserves to be called a \\"page-turner.\\"Now I have two small caveats or alerts to record. One is a little piece of trickery that Durrell uses all the time, which is effective until you notice it, then you say \\"Oh, not again!\\" I almost hesitate to mention it - should I lessen others' pleasure? but heck, this is a review! It's simply this: the excessive use of the word \\"great.\\"See, it adds a sense of importance to whatever it describes. How many times does \\"the great car\\" bear them silently along the Corniche?\\" What a different impression it makes to have someone draw up the \\"great iron gates\\" instead of just \\"wide\\" or even \\"black\\" or \\"imposing\\" iron gates? It's not an annual duck-shoot on Lake Mareotis, it's \\"the great annual duck-shoot.\\" And on and on...Mountolive sits at the \\"great desk,\\" in Mountolive's English family home his mother spends her time in front of \\"the great fireplace...\\" Oh well. We can forgive him this considering the wonderful work as a whole.The other alert is that today's reader may be startled to see the n-word used in several places, with all its accustomed freight of stereotyping. In this respect Durrell was a product of his society and generation, unfortunately.But five stars anyway for an extraordinary reading experience."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"Lawrence Durrell has a beautiful mind. He's fun, very intelligent and witty. His biography is fascinating and he is uniquely qualified to write these novels, The Alexandria Quartet, set in the Mediterranian. The strengths of the novels are their evocation of the place and time, the characters and their lovely, loving interractions. Some of the observations on art and love are a bit of a stretch, however. Durrell himself is composite of the characters Darley, Balthazar and Arnauti. He's Irish by nationality but he grew up around the Mediterranian.The Alexandria Quartet is one of the great works of the 20th century, especially if you wish you had lived in a simpler time and more interesting place, and had some interesting loves. Almost up to Ulysses, maybe not quite so pretentious."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"Poor Mountolive. This is a tale of his rise to success and his parallel loss of being able to respond humanely, and his ultimate debasement. In addtion, Durrell continues to remove layers of the Alexandrian social web: Justine's motivations are different again. I worry that they will change again in the last of the series. Motivations for love continue to be explored. I wish I had started a list when I started reading these books of all the different nuances of love and various motivations. It really has made me think.If you read the first two of the quartet, you cannot afford to miss this installment. It really helps you understand the mysteries. Of course, Durrell continues in his mastery of the language. Descriptions continue to be lush."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"I read this book before reading the other 3 in the quartet, and I absolutely loved it. It made reading the others irresistible, and yet I believe this third edition is the best. The love stories are incredibly deep and diverse, and Durrell's writing is both beautiful and inspiring.Mountolive is an Englishman working with the Foreign Service who comes to know his Dionysian self in the humidity and turmoil of early 20th century Egypt. He falls in love with his married hostess, and this relationship leaves him capable of loving only one woman and one place. The other notable couples portray a stunning array of what drives people toward love. A desire for power drives Justine and Nessim together as it does much more subtlely in the vignette about Amaril and Semira. This book stands out on its own but leaves you dying to find out more about these rich characters."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"I am amazed by how different the first three novels of Durrell's ALEXANDRIA QUARTET are from one another.JUSTINE, the first, is a highly subjective account, by a writer drunk on words and sensations, of sexual intrigues among a small coterie in Alexandria in the later 1930s.BALTHAZAR, the second, adds other points of view and offer longer vistas to show the same entanglements in a rather different light. The third,MOUNTOLIVE, embraces many of the same characters over the same period of time, but its texture is entirely different, reading much more like a normal novel. Although Darley, the original narrator, makes occasional appearances, this book abandons first-person narrative entirely. In a further move towards objectivity, it focuses on a professional diplomat, Sir David Mountolive, who is appointed British Ambassador to Egypt at about the time the overlapping action begins. But the book begins several decades earlier, building up Mountolive's personality, showing the man of feeling behind the professional neutrality of his facade. As a much younger attach&eacute; at the start of the novel, he became the lover of Leila Hosnani, the mother of powerful brothers Nessim and Narouz, who are as important to this book as they were to BALTHAZAR. Leila's friendship, continued through the years by correspondence, is a powerful force drawing Mountolive back to Egypt, but ultimately a liability when he has to act in an official capacity towards the end.Seen in its own terms (and it almost does stand on its own), MOUNTOLIVE is a political or historical novel rather than a romantic one. But it requires some knowledge of the European presence in the Middle East. By the end of the First World War, Britain essentially administered both Egypt and Palestine. By the time of these novels, Egypt has been granted independence, although Britain still wields great influence in its affairs, but the British mandate in neighboring Palestine will remain in force until 1947. And even within Egypt, Alexandria is a special case, where European influence is almost more important than Arabic. The leading figures in the novel, as in Alexandrian society, are not primarily Moslems, but Coptic Christians together with some Jews and numerous expatriates. The potential tensions between these various groups, only lightly hinted at in BALTHAZAR, become the mainspring of the plot of MOUNTOLIVE, which takes on elements of a spy story. Once more, this new perspective casts a new light on everything that we had seen before, giving an added real-world dimension to its characters.The greater time-span of this novel means that we can see events through to at least a provisional conclusion. The first two-thirds of the book are brighter, more inspiring, than anything in the tetralogy so far. The major characters ride waves of passion, inspiration, ambition, determination. But almost all these bright starts come up against limitations, if not outright failure. The miracle is that this trajectory does not make MOUNTOLIVE depressing. Durrell's writing is a fine as ever, but now it is active rather than static; he seems less concerned with philosophy and description, more with character and action. In particular, the book is structured around a number of two-person encounters, each distinctly different from the others, exquisitely well observed in terms of the interplay of character, and often taking surprising turns. Not even the desert ride in BALTHAZAR, for instance, can match the drama of Nessim's final confrontation with Narouz. None of the sexual activity in JUSTINE can touch the sad bedroom encounter between Pursewarden and Melissa, whose very failure proves so pivotal to the plot. And at the very end of the book, as the characters find themselves trapped in situations of their own making, Durrell returns to his earlier virtuoso style with a vengeance, creating an atmosphere of nightmare that propels the action towards a climactic tour-de-force, even while sounding the knell of earlier hopes.But there remains the promise of the last book,CLEA, to move the action forward and provide a true ending. The painter Clea has appeared in all three books so far as a touchstone of balance and grace. If any of her qualities infuse the book that bears her name, Durrell must surely achieve his own kind of benediction."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"This series so far - - \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\" - - has been one of the most interesting and wonderful things I have ever read. Memorable in every way. To be savored and remembered. Just simply a dazzling accomplishment by Durrell. \\"Mountolive\\" is written in 3rd person, unlike the first two, and it explores more of the motives and facts of the same people in the same time period - yet another layer - than of emotions and longings. And now we finally get to the bottom of Nessim, Justine, Narouz, and Pursewarden. And we learn of the conspiracy behind the first two novels, and we learn of Mountolive's life. All these people are so alive in my mind, Mountolive being such a sad, pathetic man. Yet once again Egypt and Alexandria take center stage. What a writer this man was!"},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"Mountolive is a welcome new point of view on the events, after Justine and Balthazar. It helped me put things together before I read Clea. I can even say that I found it 'refreshing'. Next time I read The Quartet (and I surely will), I might begin with this book."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"In this, the third volume of Durrell's \\"The Alexandria Quartet,\\" the narrative shift focuses, this time to Mountolive, a character who has perhaps more in common with the real-life Durrell than even Darley, who narrated both volume I (\\"Justine\\") and will narrate volume IV (\\"Clea\\"). Both Durrell and Mountolive were born in India and later joined the Foreign Service abroad.In this \\"sibling companion\\" to the other volumes, we find both more growing political intrigue and romantic machination. Just as \\"Balthazar\\" reconstituted and reframed the story of \\"Justine,\\" the entry of Mountolive as a major figure does much the same. He begins at the Hosnani estate of where Nessim, Narouz, their mother Leila, and ailing father all reside, and we quickly learn of Mountolive and Leila's love affair. The jumps in time make it somewhat difficult to discern when this occurred (most likely well before the action of volumes I and II), but their relationship is handled every bit as well as the myriad other relationships, romantic and Plutonic, that have arisen. Mountolive takes a job as a British foreign service and hires Pursewarden, a more minor character from the previous two volumes, as one of his advisers. We also learn of a gun cartel that seems to be affiliated in some way with Narouz, whose political influence and rhetoric is becoming too strong for his own good. Mountolive's knowledge of the gunrunning plot, along with the corruption the Pasha both accepts and participates in, let him leave Egypt, but not before becoming thoroughly disillusioned.It will come as no surprise to anyone who read my reviews of the first two novels that I have utterly enjoyed \\"Mountolive,\\" too. And since I know longer know how to gush about Durrell's gorgeous, fantastic writing in an original way, I will do what I did in those reviews and leave you with a snippet from the opening chapter detailing Mountolive's entry into the British Foreign Service and his involvement with Egypt:\\"As a junior of exceptional promise, he had been sent to Egypt for a year in order to improve his Arabic and found himself attached to the High Commission as a sort of scribe to await his first diplomatic posting; but he was already conducting himself as a young secretary of legation, fully aware of the responsibilities of future office.

The bitter meeting between Mountolive and his former love, the then-beautiful younger Leila, where now after many years and the ravages of smallpox, \\"He saw a plump and square-faced Egyptian lady of uncertain years, with a severely pock-marked face and eyes drawn grotesquely out of true by the antimony-pencil.\\" And the unforgettable discreet transaction between Nessim and Memlik Pasha: Nessim's \\"offering\\" is almost too elegant to be called a bribe: it is an addition to Memlik's prized collection of Korans, this one an \\"exquisite little Koran wrapped in soft tissue paper: he had carefully larded the pages with bank drafts negotiable in Switzerland.\\"But above all, the final apocalyptic revelation, the full, dark blossom of total treachery and death makes an unforgettable climax. This is the one that deserves to be called a \\"page-turner.\\"Now I have two small caveats or alerts to record. One is a little piece of trickery that Durrell uses all the time, which is effective until you notice it, then you say \\"Oh, not again!\\" I almost hesitate to mention it - should I lessen others' pleasure? but heck, this is a review! It's simply this: the excessive use of the word \\"great.\\"See, it adds a sense of importance to whatever it describes. How many times does \\"the great car\\" bear them silently along the Corniche?\\" What a different impression it makes to have someone draw up the \\"great iron gates\\" instead of just \\"wide\\" or even \\"black\\" or \\"imposing\\" iron gates? It's not an annual duck-shoot on Lake Mareotis, it's \\"the great annual duck-shoot.\\" And on and on...Mountolive sits at the \\"great desk,\\" in Mountolive's English family home his mother spends her time in front of \\"the great fireplace...\\" Oh well. We can forgive him this considering the wonderful work as a whole.The other alert is that today's reader may be startled to see the n-word used in several places, with all its accustomed freight of stereotyping. In this respect Durrell was a product of his society and generation, unfortunately.But five stars anyway for an extraordinary reading experience."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"This third installment discourses the tangled and illusioned affair b/w Mountolive, the ambitious British diplomat, and Leila, the sophisticated mother of Nessim and Narous, and intimates both the attraction and gulf between the fading Empire and its exotic former colony, while Justine, Nessim, Narous and Pursewarden loom large in the background. Durrell continue to add melody and cadenza to this sweeping symphony of love and desire."},{"Title":"Mountolive,: A novel","review":"Lawrence Durrell's third novel in his Alexander Quartet is larger and more political in scope than its predecessors. This time the narrative is focused on a British diplomat named Mountolive who has been stationed in Egypt. He has an affair with the mother of Nessim and Narouz, and the action takes us back to the original collection of characters from Justine after several years of build-up. Mountolive is a work that grounds Durrell's foot firmly into the cultural and historical framework of his environment; Alexandria is no longer a phantasm of his mind, he successfully fills it with depth and time, thus expanding the quartet in scale and feeling."},{"Title":"Liturgy the life of the church (Popular liturgical library)","review":"This book on liturgy makes clear the central purpose of that sublime meeting of heaven and earth in which the Christian religion worships God.

Black Professor of History at Johns Hopkins University, presents his readers with what he feels is the definitive edition of Hernan Cortes letters. Pagden states in his introduction that although his translation was not the first in English, the previous were, &quot;more or less unsatisfactory&quot; (page lxxix). Pagden sticks to the verisimilitude of the letters as much as possible, presenting Cortes' original spellings and place names. The main liberty Pagden admits to have taken, dividing the text into further paragraphs, does not distract the reader or destroy the intent of the work. By using the earliest available manuscripts, the original translations, and numerous primary sources as evidenced by an extensive bibliography, Pagden allows the reader to enter another world, and delve into the mind of the most talked about of all conquerors, Hernan (Hernando, Fernando) Cortes. Five letters are presented for synaptic digestion. However, the first letter presented is actually not written by Cortes. The unknown author speaks highly of Cortes, though. The other letters, penned by Cortes, describes the exact minutiae of what he paints as a perilous journey. What makes these letters so readable and enjoyable is the reader gains an intimate knowledge of the pageantry of the 16th century, and a first-hand account of what must have been clash of Spanish and New World cultures. The letters written by Cortes are revelatory. He must have had either a tremendous memory (the shortest letter is fifty-six pages long whereas the longest is 122 pages) or a fervent imagination. It is not inconceivable, then, and Cortes' prose intimates this, that he was an educated man. The letters also show that Cortes was very deferential - as he addresses his head of state, every few pages Cortes begins a new thought with phrases such as, &quot;Most Powerful and Invincible Lord&quot;, &quot;Your Majesty&quot;, and &quot;Most Catholic Lord.&quot; For the contemporary reader this can be distracting. From the triumph of Conquest, the reader finds Cortes ends as a broken man, literally begging King Charles for monies to pay his increasing debts. Certainly these are not all the letters Cortes wrote to his monarch. What letters presented represent a unique opportunity. Herein lays the thinking of the man who led a handful conquerors and New World allies to bring down an empire. In this respect, the work succeeds brilliantly, for the mind of Cortes leaps out in his letters.I might have read a different edition than the one advertised, so the page numbers might not match up."},{"Title":"Letters from Mexico (An Orion Press book)","review":"The story begins with the planting of A Orange Tree and ends with the the conquest of Mexico. Cortes is a man driven by adventure and the lure of wealth in the new lands. It is however sad that he ends up in love with the place and culture that he finally destroys. The book gives a blow by blow description of the political intrigue of the church, the crown and of course Cortes men. At one point in the book the fighting is so brutal that Cortes is literally hacking the Aztec warroirs to death as steel meets wood in a no contest.Montezouma is perhaps the most tagic figure given that he is a child not a leader. The insights that Cortes rrecordrds give a fascinating account in a true historical sense. It is a book that destroys the idea that conquistidores like Cortes are bigger than life.The book reaffirms a tragic tale with its detail descriptions. A great read for enthusiasts of Mexican history Leigh Collins"},{"Title":"Letters from Mexico (An Orion Press book)","review":"This book is an excellent new translation of five letters to Charles V, the HRE, four written by Cortes. The first letter, not written by Cortes, seems to have been written with Cortes leaning over the writer's shoulder, for it fits in perfectly with the four Cortes letters, both in sequence and in theme.The running theme of all five letters seems to be this: Cortes is a great man who works to bring wealth and glory to Charles V, while overcoming amazing obsticles presented by both Indian and Spanish sources.What can be learned from these letters? Not much that can be trusted, other than Cortes is good at &quot;selling&quot; Cortes to the royal court.The letters are full of obvious exagerations and vast silences."},{"Title":"Letters from Mexico (An Orion Press book)","review":"With the Yale Nota Bene edition one is looking directly into the mind and machinations of one of history's gargantuan actors.

Remember it is from Cortes to the king so there is some obvious bias which are covered mostly in the footnotes."},{"Title":"Letters from Mexico (An Orion Press book)","review":"Late in his life, somewhat neglected but still mightily feared in his restless, Castilian retirement, Hernan Cortes managed to get a fleeting audience with the man to whom he had devoted his life and stunning achievements of conquest. That man was the Spanish King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; that man had been the exclusive recipient of the five detailed letters written by Cortes from Mexico. What Cortes said to his emperor during the rapid and frustrating audience of his later years is, I think, one of history's most pithy and accurate summaries: \\" I gave you more provinces than your ancestors gave you cities.\\"The cleverly written, informative and entertaining letters from Mexico are, in effect, political right-of-way documents, whereby Cortes directly sought (and finally got) ever-increasing power from an emperor who was above both him and his immediate superior and essential antagonist in New Spain (Diego Velasquez). It can easily be said, in fact, that Velasquez was a much more essential and necessary enemy to Cortes and his men than poor Moctezuma ever was. So while the letters have the vivid content of victorious battles and conquests over a truly foreign and exotic foe, they never really stray from their political reason for existence. They are, in sum, masterpieces of how to gain leverage, power and treasure from one's often hesitant superior.This edition of the translated letters comes with introductions by Padgen and Elliott, the former an American historian/translator and the latter a British historian. Both of these academics have written summaries of Cortes and his life and his writings that can be eagerly read by general audiences. This book is, in the final analysis, an account of men and power first, and events and saga second."},{"Title":"Letters from Mexico (An Orion Press book)","review":"Not really something that I would buy for general reading.

If half the essays are interesting, you are doing pretty well. And there's always at least one that is a total waste of time.This is the exception we hope for. There is not a page of the book that doesn't either illuminate an exciting idea, provide a useful fact, or suggest a promising course of action. Every sort of thing is here from the course-defining DNC speech of Barack Obama to a list of topics you could hook Letters to the Editor on for various holidays. (Mother's Day? Social Security, Medicare, Parenting.)The book is divided into three sections and ten topics. The first section analyzes what has happened. It asks some hard questions, like what it might cost us to adopt Conservative means to our Liberal ends (\\"Fighting Dirty\\"). There is a handful of tough essays in here, like Michael Lerner's on Liberal contempt for the electorate (which is significantly different from, though no bigger than, Conservative contempt for the electorate). But the overall message is one of hope and optimism. The last section emphasizes organizing and suggests ways to do it.This book and George Lakoff's Don't Think of an Elephant (also from Chelsea Green) will pay for themselves in a few hours. We got angry; now it's time to get active. Start Making Sense will provide some direction."},{"Title":"Start Making Sense: Turning the Lessons of Election 2004 into Winning Progressive Politics","review":"This book is full of good ideas written by people who know!

I've read this book three times already."},{"Title":"Start Making Sense: Turning the Lessons of Election 2004 into Winning Progressive Politics","review":"You don't really know what happened until the books come out. And this is the first book I've seen on what happened in the last election from the point of view of the Democrats. It is fascinating to see what they are thinking happened. This book is not written by the main powers within the Democratic party, but of people from numerous organizations that participate within the framework of the party.While getting their viewpoint is fascinating, unfortunately I don't believe that they have \\"Started Making Sense\\" just yet.For instance one of the sections is on the Iraq war. The consensus is that we should pull out immediately. The comment is then made, \\"if they choose civil war, it will be their civil war.\\"Let's see what could happen. The Shiite's have most of the population, they start a genocide of the Sunni's. The Sunni's call on Syria (predominately Sunni) who responds by sending an army to kill Shiite's. The Shiite's call on Iran (predominately Shiite) who sends another army. This expands all over the Middle East, oil flow stops and gasoline goes to $100 a gallon. Not a good plan Democrats!Further, it seems that the main complaint is that some 1,600 American soldiers have been killed. Tragic, true, but. That's about ten days of what we kill on American highways. Where is the demand for safer cars, lower speed limits, etc. It seems that these people segregate deaths into OK (car accidents) or evil (military).There's a section in the book on environmentalism, and their mantra is the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gasses and global warming. Out here in the west where mining is king, people are very happy with the Kyoto protocol. Uranium, you see, has gone from $6 to $21 and the mines are going full boom. Nuclear reactors don't give off any greenhouse gasses. It appears that somewhere between 100 and 200 new nuc's are going to be built in the next few years. Is this really what the environmentalists had in mind?Like I said, it is fascinating to see what these people are thinking and well worth reading the book. But as for making sense, not yet."},{"Title":"1066","review":"The author does an amazing job in this book of 170 pages. He takes 4 historical characters who are each unbelievably interesting (Harold Godwinsson, Tostig Godwinsson, Harald Hardrada, and William of Normandy) along with 3 major battles (York, Stamford Bridge and Hastings) and folds it all together with the other important events and characters at the time and comes out with a winner of a book!!!Even if you know little about the year 1066 (which the author correctly points out is sorely neglected in history education), this will help you to TRULY understand it and will leave you hungry for more about the story. I've read no fewer than 10 books about the year and the characters involved and still this book put it all into perspective for me. The diagrams and photos of the actual sites (overlayed with which armies were where) was a fantastic visual reference that I had been missing until now. He also talks about the Bayeux Tapistry in amazing detail. You leave this book able to picture how they dressed, how they were armed, where things took place and how the \\"historians\\" of the time captured the tale (along with notes of probable bias). There was no right or wrong discussed - just what likely happened and why it likely happened. This is one of the true \\"what if's\\" of history. At any moment one simple change of fate - the weather, a word, where someone stood in battle - so much of English history would be dramatically different. I'm a lover of all things about Harold Godwinsson. There's something moving about him - even all of these years later. But despite that bias on my part - I think the book was as acurate as possible, as thorough as possible and yet enjoyably short and organized and to the point. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys a true story that's really better than any fiction out there."},{"Title":"1066","review":"Peter Marren contributes to the 1066 body of literature by giving us this nice concise book. This book can be used as a deeper introduction to people vaguely familiar with the events or to those who wish to have a more pictorial view of the sites. He publishes some (currently) new insight on the Battle of Hastings, showing Harold may not have been the passive commander most writers of that battle have accused him of being. Interesting material to anyone who's read the more well known books. My feeling is that Tetlow's \\"Enigma of Hastings\\" has probably the best but this is a great companion, especially to those who are planning a visit.He gives the reader more insight to the Battle of York (aka Battle of Fulford Gate) that affects the Battle of Stamford Bridge much the same way Stamford Bridge affected the Battle of Hastings. He gives insight to the weaponry used and tries to give insight to the personalities involved. I also like that he publishes the names of all those who are documented to have fought in the Battle of Hastings.I visited the battlefields in the past year and Mr. Marren includes some great, accurate diagrams and photos of the sites. I wish I'd had this book with me. They represent the areas very well and this book would be an enormous help to those planning a visit. He includes photo's of battles re-enactors whose physical appearance... well, you can tell they're not professional soldiers. In fairness they're included to show the probable battledress.Marren doesn't bog the story down with too many details and while that's a strength it's probably the biggest weakness too. You want to know more. But, unfortunately there just isn't much source material and that which is available does not have the Anglo-Saxon point of view. Marren also doesn't delve too much in the political aftermath of Hastings but that's fine in this context.Marren also states that had Harold won Hastings, England would have had serious problems due to the enormous loss of life in the three battles. Excellent point that leaves the reader believing another invading force would have had it easy. This is a good book."},{"Title":"1066","review":"This book gives a good picture of the logistics involved in these campaigns down to figures on tons of animal fesces produced.Lots of stats on type of armaments,equipment,boats used,type of horses(which were considerably smaller than alot of todays),a real nuts and bolts book but easy to read.What interested me was the breakdown of the fighting units in the armies.It seemed the \\"housecarls\\" were the retained hardcore weapons people whereas the \\"fyrd\\" was poorly equipped and probably of questionable loyalty to either side.After all,this was centuries before the nation/state where soldiers had a direct stake in winning or losing.At Hastings probably the levied(drafted/forced) saw a victory by either side as a mild change in benefits or oppression. The Norman army definitely was better prepared and had some new warfare techniques learned and proved true on the continent like a new use for cavalry and archers.The guys running around with little to no defensive equipment on in the Bayouex tapestry make sense now.They're probably depicted that way because they had no equipment,and no stake in the outcome : No wonder they're running like the dickens,not cowards-just smart!"},{"Title":"1066","review":"Peter Marren has done an excellent job of research and explaining the background of the conflict culminating in the Battle of Hastings. Clearly he knows his history and extensively researched the \\"Chronicles\\" written within 200 years of the battles he describes. He does point out that the chronicles must be taken with a grain of salt since the majority were written from the Norman perspective. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Marren is very fair towards King Harold and Anglo-Saxon England.This book is a must read for anyone wanting to know more about these milestone battles in the history of England. Further, it should prove extremely helpful for anyone traveling to the sites of the battles. The book provides numerous maps and diagrams of the battles and tactics as well as photos of the terrain as it looks now at the battle sites. There is enough detail in the book for the military history buff but it's not so overwhelming that those who are novices in this area would be put off.The ONLY fault I find with this book is an error regarding archery which I see repeatedly from many authors. When speaking of archery, Mr. Marren repeatedly speaks of \\"firing\\" arrows (or in the past tense uses the term \\"fired\\")! This is a technical error that should not occur! Archery is one of my lifelong hobbies. And those of us who're archers KNOW that an arrow may be \\"released\\", \\"loosed\\", \\"launched\\" or \\"shot\\". But unlike a firearm or artillery piece, there is no explosive propellant involved in archery. A gun, howitzer, or cannon may be \\"fired\\". An arrow absolutely cannot! Mr. Marren and other authors of history (or historical fiction) should know this. I speak so strongly of this error because otherwise everything in this book (down to the logistics of the armies) is spot on. I do recommend this book highly to anyone wanting to know more about these three battles which were crucial to the history of England."},{"Title":"1066","review":"I enjoyed this, but the David Howarth book 1066 The Year of the Conquest is so much better that I am sorry I read the Marren book."},{"Title":"Great Narrative Essays","review":"One of the struggles of students in the writing classes at my community college is that they are required to write essays in the English composition classes, but have no clear idea of what an essay is. In truth, essays are flexible; ever since their 'invention' by Michel de Montaigne, essays have been a rather flexible kind of writing. However, there are some standards, and perhaps the best way to come to understand these parameters is by reading essays. This collection of essays, edited by Joseph Mersand, is a good one.Mersand states his purpose as several in the introduction - to provide essays for high school and college students (as well as the general public), to demonstrate the development of the essay in English over the course of the past three hundred years, to show in particular narrative essays that tell a story without itself being a short story or work of fiction, to provide biographical information on some key literary figures, and to provide a pleasant collection for those who love reading.Mersand provides a one- to two-page biographical piece prior to each essay, setting the historical and cultural context of the writing. There are some big names here - Izaak Walton, Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Dickens, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, Helen Keller, James Thurber, E.B. White, and E.M. Forster, as well as dozens of other authors who were lesser known, but still great writers. As the above list demonstrates, not all of the writers contained herein are noted primarily for their writing - Franklin and Churchill, for example, are more noted for being political figures. However, the writing of essays is not the province of professional writers exclusively. Such is part of the strength of essay writing.'The essay is well suited to convey almost any subject, point of view, or personal style,' according to Mersand. The richness of this form is easily seen from this great collection.

He is the consummate New Yorker loving the theater, opera, and movies. He was an NBC page and guide in the RCA Building, and I can remember taking a backstage tour of the NBC studios viewing a Fred Waring show on the morning the show was interrupted to announce the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. Jack was a conscientious objector, a conchie, during World War II serving as a swamp clearer in Maryland and a mental hospital orderly in Connecticut. That is where he developed his lifelong interest in mental health education. He did considerable writing in that field including this series of radio plays.From an early age he was theater struck (he collects toy theaters), and the short book (97 pages) is replete with the names of stars and their achievements. He is particularly fond of \\"Pal Joey.\\" His chapter on a rocky sea voyage to deliver a thousand burros to Crete right after WWII is extremely entertaining.

The characters are well drawn, and the writing style brings the Colorado setting to life.This is one of Trent's better books, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rawhider","review":"High Country Showdown\\"I know all about you. I seen your kind before. You're a bunch of ... thieves.\\"\\" ... but I know the breed. Seen 'em in Texas. You watch. His herd'll grow while mine shrinks. It happens ever' time them ... rawhiders come around.\\" Old Man Jenkins page 22.Do you remember the Zebra Books westerns published from the mid-1980s for a period of 10 years or so? Kensington Publishing Corp. continues to publish Pinnacle Books and some Pinnacle westerns, yet the Zebra line has since faded away. Zebra westerns were known for their original western stories, generally in print for the first time, and most of their books carried colorful, wrap-around cover art. The paper was of good quality, remaining so to this day, and the print was easy to read. For the price of less than $3.00 they were a bargain in their day and remain so down to this day.This Zebra western was released midpoint in the Zebra heyday, August, 1989. Though I enjoyed several of Doyle Trent's Zebra westerns, never got around to reading this one until recently. As a western it is formulaic in the sense that most westerns are but with Doyle's smooth writing style it is a book that can keep the reader reading.The first portion of the book is a straight out western concerning cattle, small ranchers, and government land given to people who will \\"prove up\\" to settle and improve the land. John Wesley Budeen has roots as a 'rawhider' and though he is both likeable and trustworthy the label of rawhider clings to him. He has made a mistake earlier of robbing a bank, a mistake he paid for with jail time. Yet by the time we meet up with him is trying to go 'straight' and prove up a small homestead in Colorado.Just when the reader is settling in believing this to be a book only of homesteading and cattle, the novel turns to another course of becoming a mystery. Things no longer make sense to John Wesley as his best friend has been killed from ambush, a mysterious woman appears with perplexing information, and John Wesley is targeted for death with his small ranch burned to the ground. It only gets more confusing and dangerous from this point in the novel through the finish.Doyle Trent seems to write books that amble along slowly while all the while developing an interesting but predictable plot. So I was somewhat pleasantly surprised with the elements of danger and suspense in this book. I settled on a 3-star rating because I have read better books by the same author, yet this older western could be considered somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star effort.If you are an admirer of the ole \\"Zebra\\" westerns from years back as I am, you will enjoy this book. If you just enjoy westerns in general you will enjoy it too. If you are a fan of writer Doyle Trent then you have the best of two worlds: a western and a Zebra western written by Doyle Trent.Recommended, book-a-roos.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"The Ministry of Healing","review":"This book is a terrific insight into what the spiritually hungry were thinking shortly before the modern pentecostal revival.

Nelson thought that Fries had done what no other philosopher had done: retained and extended the spirit and system of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, the greatest modern philosopher. Tragically, Nelson died young in 1927.

Only to be destroyed in the Bikini Island Atomic Bomb Test as so many other captured ships from that conflict were. Shame when you consider that these ships could have been GREAT show pieces of living history had they not been so carelesly abused. The only set back I find with this volume. Is that Mr. Gephard writes a great deal about the specifics of the ship. weight, speed, design, what not. And a little about her History. So this particular volume of the many he wrote. Is more like a statisical look at the ship. And not so much as a story line. Altho packed with a wealth of information? It beccomes bogged down in tech Jargon. When so much more coukld have written about her battle history. Of course this book is not just about the Admiral Hipper. But rather an over view of all the ships in her class. I hope mr. Gephard will write another book based more along the lines of his other books like The Bismark and the Tirpitz. he is an outstanding writer and is very knowledgable. But the statistics? cloud the picture and get in the way of the Life of this Warship.Thank You"},{"Title":"Imitation Of Christ Nelson's Royal Classics","review":"Thomas a Kempis was medival monk and priest (1380-1471) who served as chronicler of the monastery at Mt. St. Agnes. During his long life of scholarship, he wrote several biographies of church fathers and a number of devotional works. The &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; remains his most famous work and the one that has best stood the test of time. Indeed, one of the wonderful things about this work is that it reminds us that the life of the mind is not a creature of the Enlightenment. Even during the so-called Dark Ages there were brilliant scholars with a wide knowledge of both scripture and philosophy. Reflecting its vibrant insight into the human condition, the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; remains influential on both sides of the Reformation divide. It reportedly was, for example, one of John Wesley's favorite devotionals.The &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; is divided into 4 books, each undertaking a basic theme for development. They are, respectively, the Spiritual Life, the Inner Life, Inward Consolation, and the Blessed Sacrament (i.e., the Eucharist). In turn, each book is sub-divided into numerous chapters, each a page or two long. All of which makes the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; a useful book for daily devotionals. One can skip around freely within the book, dipping in as the mood strikes. Yet, I think one is well-served by reading it through at least once. Only then does one see Thomas' thought in its fully-developed form. Do be sure to get a good translation. I am fond of the one by Leo Sherley-Price."},{"Title":"Imitation Of Christ Nelson's Royal Classics","review":"This is the most powerful religious work I've ever read. Written by Thomas a' Kempis in the mid 15th century, this book is very much akin to one written in the last century by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, \\"The Cost of Dicipleship\\". Both books preach the stern message that the path to everlasting life comes through sacrifice and suffering here on earth. Thomas a'Kempis writes; \\"Take up your cross, therefore, and follow Jesus, and you shall enter eternal life. He Himself opened the way before you in carrying His cross. He died for you, that you too, might take up your cross and long to die upon it. If you die with Him, you shall also live with Him, and if you share His suffering, you shall also share his glory\\".Apart from the content.....I particularly like the layout of this book. It's divided into 4 smaller books each containing a numerous string of mini-chapters. These mini-chapters run approximately one to two pages in length and cover a diverse collection of religious thought focusing on love, humility, meditation, truth, etc. Each one poignantly written .....each one serving as a guideline for all. If your reading interests lie with the religious classics, your library will not be complete without adding this inspirational masterpiece to it. God Bless."},{"Title":"Imitation Of Christ Nelson's Royal Classics","review":"This book was truly an inspiration and packed to the core with what it means to be truly Christ-like.

Humility and becoming a servant are two of the ways Kempis applies this to our everyday lives. In this seemingly small book there are so many practical ways to apply the Gospel to our thoughts, actions, and habits that can draw us away from God.

As one may be able to correctly imply from my bio, I have little agreement with any official doctrine of the Catholic church. Yet here is another one of those few books produced by a Catholic from days gone by which transcends the differences and focuses on what really counts. Jesus and Paul spoke of the centrality of Christ as our single focus in such passages as Luke 11:34; Philippians 3:7 - 15; and Romans 8:28, 29. A'Kempis pushes aside virtually all the differences and brings us back to that single focus-the Lord Jesus Christ. One would almost think that A'Kempis used the above-stated verses as his foundation for writing.This volume does have an occasional expression of thought which definitely betrays a strictly Catholic idea, usually in the last book of the volume. In this section, the inferences toward the belief of transubstantiation are there, but the statements are so general that a Protestant can easily read the statements from a non-transubstantiation view, and read them rather from the standpoint of the spiritual eating of Christ (John 6) rather than the physical eating as is found in the doctrine of transubstantiation.One of the beauties of this book is its contemplative aspect. It is not for the lazy thinker or non-thinker; but it doesn't require a great education either. It just requires a pursuit of Christ as our all in all (again, see Philippians 3). One of the things which the Protestant church rejected of Catholicism is the contemplative mind and life. I agree that the superstitious aspect sometimes found in the contemplative life and prayer is to be rejected, with its extra-biblical revelations and the like. But the Scriptures are clear that meditation/ rumination/ contemplation is a necessary part of every true believer's life, and that contemplation is founded in a search for God, in Christ Jesus, as revealed to us by God in the Bible. Contemplation and meditation is not a Protestant vs. Catholic issue. It is a biblical mandate for all who profess faith in Jesus Christ.A'Kempis has given us such a focus that transcends the differences and says, &quot;I count the all things as dung that I may gain Christ and be found in Him.&quot;"},{"Title":"Handbook Of Magazine Article Writing -","review":"Jean Fredette wrote in the \\"Handbook of Magazine Article Writing\\" that the best style is clean, no frills and bare-bones. His basic tenet is \\"Show me, don't tell me.\\" Having writing talent is a potential it does not mean you are a great writer. His writing recommendations include: Use of the five W's (who, what , where, when and why), the inverted triangle. (Put the most interesting information first or you'll loose the reader.) Draw your readers in with interesting, fresh, effective titles. Write in an active voice.For example compare these statements: \\"The passive voice is avoided by good writers\\" versus \\"Good writers avoid the passive voice.\\" The second is more vigorous and concise. A passive voice makes for passive readers.Get help when you need it. Nobody can tell you what your words mean to you. But others can tell you what your words mean to them. Be sure you're ready for feedback. Don't ask if you only want praise. Never be a name dropper. Instead of just naming the places, animals, people and plants cultivate the essence of the place so you can interpret it for others. Although a writer looks for the specific and the universal. Choose the specific where possible.For example compare the sentences: \\"You can take a ferry between European Turkey and Asiatic Turkey\\" versus \\"The ferry zigzagged between European Turkey and Asiatic Turkey letting off and taking on passengers and cargo at dozens of docks.\\" The passive voice (universal/general) the active voice is more detailed and specific. When describing places include the location, time of day (dawn, noon twilight), the season (summer, spring, fall or winter), history, people, animals, plant life, smells, sounds and food.Fredette's book has sound and sensible advice.

No indication of order or series or whether any are collections, or anything like that.Very poor on the part of the publisher, some obvious advertising to be done there, and a waste of space and opportunity.That said, the book is an amusing black humoured mostly planet bound space opera of sorts.The planet in question has a bizarre ecology, where a leech born virus makes everything long lived and hard to kill, which leaves a particularly ultradeadly poison that is also native to the planet highly sought after, and also an important part of the ecosystem.It isn't just animals this affects, but people - some of whom are thousands of years old.The Sable Keech is a ship named after someone who appears to have been an important character in the previous book.An alien in a sunken ship with a secret, a flying weird form golem with a secret, another golem with a secret, a passenger on one of the privateer ships with a secret, a revivified charter passenger with a nasty secret.In fact, secrets everywhere, along with voracious wildlife, a couple of smart, and smartarse drones and an AI all finally come to a violent head.This is Neal Asher after all, who is definitely of the plain-speaking and blow stuff up school of SF in general, but with weird monsters added.I liked this one more than Brass Man, certainly made me chuckle in places.A one line throwaway could be 'pirate adventure with monsters, robots and spaceships'.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Sable Keech (Spatterjay, Book 2)","review":"I am a confirmed Neal Asher book junkie, an easy enough fate to fall into since his novels are more addictive than crack cocaine.

But hagiography must some day end for all. Marks' book argues that American diplomacy during the Roosevelt administrations was characterized by inconsistency, naivete, and ineffectuality.Marks' book is a fine balance to popular views of FDR. Some might write of biased, selective presentation of facts. However, Marks makes available 113 pages of notes and sources for 288 pages of text. His sources includes minutes from meetings at Yalta and Tehran, presidential correspondence, etc. They make for fascinating reading into FDR's mindset and that of Churchill and others. One can read, for example, the notes from meeting with Stalin and Churchill wherein FDR explicitly states that his only interest in the \\"Polish question\\" is how it affects the US electorate for the 1944 elections. Based? Out of context? Don't we wish.Marks covers seven major topics: the \\"first hundred days\\", dealings with Japan, managing the war and diplomacy with his allies, ties with Latin America, an FDR's status as a world leader. Very illuminating, well-researched, and quite persuasive. Anyone wishing to argue positively about FDR's accomplishments in diplomacy will have an arduous task.One critic has spoken of Mark's non-inclusion of Bretton Woods as a failing in this book, since it thereby disincludes one element of wartime planning which most regard as successful. It is true that he does not cover it. However, Marks' focus is diplomacy, not economics. And since economics was clearly not FDR's signal strength, this is perhaps to Roosevelt's advantage.I give this four stars, not five only because I too would have liked to see subjects such as Bretton Woods included. But what is here is stongly researched and illuminating: much to learn about FDR, 1930s US media and culture, and the strange alliances which develop in war."},{"Title":"Wind over Sand: The Diplomacy of Franklin Roosevelt","review":"This book is one of the most extensive critiques of Roosevelt's foreign policy ever penned. It criticizes him for appeasing Germany, while taking an unfairly harsh line towards Italy and Japan. Marks criticizes Roosevelt for insularity, ignorance and dogmatism. His officials are unreliable, while FDR mistakingly believes you can buy respect and supports misguided pacifism when a strong show of force is required. He seeks to sabatoge Chiang Kai-Shek and is far too indulgent towards Stalin. His first months in office encourage isolationism and his attitude towards Latin America only encourages the contempt that continent feels towards a weak master. Footnotes makes up a quarter of a book, the bibliography is long and extensive, and Marks has engaged in multi archival research from Taiwan to Canada, as well as from Britain and France. Were Marks' view accepted it would lead to a major decrease in Franklin Roosevelt's reputation.As it happens, Marks' revisionism will not succeed because despite the effort involved, it is seriously flawed. Marks shows a strong, unrelenting prejudice against FDR at every turn (his books on Teddy Roosevelt and John Foster Dulles show the opposite problem). There are two major flaws to this work. First, there is the biased selection of evidence. In order to make Italy and Japan look more reasonable Marks cities Italian and Japanese propoganda on the Ethiopian war and the Manchurian crisis respectively. There is no mention of the Rape of Nanking. Admiral Horthy, ruler of Axis Hungary, says FDR was insufficiently anti-communist, a view that is seconded by Franco's pro-Axis foreign minister. Hitler's slippery dishonest finance minister Schacht is quoted as saying that FDR thought that Hitler was good for Germany. Hitler's disreputable vice-chancellor, von Papen is quoted to contrast Winston Churchill's supposed mercy in comparison to FDR's bloodthirstiness on the Nuremberg trials. (Actually it was American officials who took the lead on the matter.) Whether they are pro-Japanese appeasers, propagandists for the China lobby, or sentimental frenchmen who unfairly blame Roosevelt for the demise of the French colonial empire, Marks blandly praises their genius while ignoring compelling counter-evidence.Likewise, there is a lack of balance in the book. More space is given on the 1937 Brussells conference on Asian problems than on the Breton Woods Conference that set up the post-war economic order. One suspects this has much to do with the fact that France and England blamed FDR for its failure. Much of the archival evidence from Britain and France consists in complaints from the less than brilliant Halifax and Bonnett. Much is made of the gaucheries and mistakes of Roosevelt's diplomats, while statesman like General Marshall and Henry Stimson are almost ignored. So, for that matter, is much of the conduct of the war. Chaing's regime is blatantly whitewashed while the opposing case is never countered or, as in the case of Lloyd Eastman's Seeds of Destruction, read. Flaws that apply equally to Dulles and TR, such as bigotry and ignorance, are applied to FDR alone. There is something tendentious and questionable on every page. On no account should anyone consider anything mentioned here as definitive."},{"Title":"Pilgrim at Sea","review":"Wonderful bit of writing and story telling here.

Would be obvious that all books dealing with the same subject should present top quality on editorial design, but in many cases it's not true. This book, instead, cares a lot about its graphic presentation. The 2nd edition shows even better layout and more useful photos and drawings than those already great found on the previous edition.

As time progresses slave-taking and cannibalism are described. The advent of Chrisitian missionaries and the French at the beginning of the twentieth century give rise to other stresses and strains. There is religion in the region already in black Jewish figures and in Muslims. It is an uneasy brew. Violence and eroticism are intertwined. Next to arrive in this French colonial territory are German anthropologists and art dealers. As the twentieth century takes hold, this novel comes to focus more intently on individual characters enabling the reader to follow the story more easily. The four years of World War I bring some of the fighting into the area. Under the Treaty of Paris of 1919 eastern Nakem is ceded to England.In 1924 a boy from the village, Raymond, received permission to study in France. He was supposed to be part of the first generation of native administrators. France fascinated Raymond Kassoumi. He lost his appetite for study for a time when he learned that in his absence family members had become dead or enslved. He led an obscure and unglamorous life while pursuing his gradute studies. He 1933 he married a French woman. Kassoumi from Nakem-Ziuko fought in World War II. He fought on the Rhine, at Cassino, and then in Provence. In October 1945 he made his way to Paris where his wife found him. In 1947 there is a return to Nakem and the prospect of involvement in the leadership of a free country. This is a strange and interesting work. This reader was confused in trying to follow it, but was moved by the intense and artful recounting of different sorts of experiences."},{"Title":"Applied Process Design for Chemical and Petrochemical Plants, Volume 3, 3rd Edition","review":"I have about two hundred of book on chemical process design.

This volume offers detailed design information necessary for selecting technology for compressors and heating and cooling. It is well beyond what is available from classroom textbooks so be prepared for the initial shock. This is not a quick-reference book! You will have to spend some time to extract the information from Ludwig's series, i.e., volumes 1-3. I find Coulson and Richardson an easier text to use everyday. If you want details on refrigeration cycles, this is the place to look after you've had a go at Coulson or Hicks (Standard Handbook of Engineering Calculations).Although some of the information may be available on-line. You would need to spend days and weeks collecting it. Then, there are the worked out examples of calculations, just like Hicks (missing from Coulson), that are invaluable. The photos of equipment, the tables and charts are invaluable.

I read this book when I was nine and aching for a horse of my own. The story has stayed with me all my life, even after I got that horse! The heroine was me, and every girl who has ever given her heart to a horse: frustrated because nobody understands, tormented by the fact that the animal she loves is being ill -treated and neglected, desperate to have this one particular horse and no other. The adults in her life are sympathetic and loving, even when they don't get the passion that is harrowing up Laurie's soul. Her savior is the farmer Ben, who has some problems of his own, but recognizes the girl's horse-love and takes it and her seriously. He admires her 'guts.' Ben teaches Laurie to ride and to control her runaway emotions. In return Laurie's mom and dad reach out to Ben and his family in their time of trouble. This is a moving and lively story on many levels, and all the emotional upheavals are as fresh and true as if they had been written yesterday. Kids will love it, and adults will wipe away their tears as Laurie finally proves she is steady enough, patient enough, and gutsy enough, to make her horse dreams come true."},{"Title":"The Gospel in Dostoyevsky: Selected from His Works","review":"The Soviet Union burned Bibles and banned their importation. Yet, possibly out of national pride, they never censored the work of this great Russian novelist. Luther once said that if the entire Bible were lost, except the Book of Romans, that it alone would be enough for salvation. Dostoyevesky takes us a step further: in a land where one could be born, grow up, and die at normal life expectancy, all under the aegeis of Communism, without ever seeing a Bible, could the message of the Gospel still be found? Of course, the author died decades before the Revolution of 1917, but his work answeres the question we pose in the affirmative. His works, excerpted for this book, contain what can only be described as lengthy homilies, clothed as literature. From the famous &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; from &quot;The Brothers Karamatzov,&quot; to lesser-known passages from &quot;The Idiot&quot; and other works, each selection expounds on Christian doctrine. Strongly influenced by the Gospel of St. John, Dostoyevesky uses the resurrection of Lazarus, for example, as the basis of a conversation between a murderer and a prostitute in &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; The eleventh chapter of John is included in near entirety, as one sufferer reads it to the other. Nearly all of the imagery here is Johnnine; perhaps Dostoyevesky was a visionary: Spengeler wrote that the next millenium of Russian histoty would belong to St. John. Al all events, this is a bedside companion that will provoke deep reflection in those who read it, and perhaps make them wonder, as I do, if Dostoyevesky's works weren't intended by a higher power to be a light in the darkest days of the Evil Empire. -Lloyd A.

Troubleshooting is the same way: when the broken bit is found and fixed, the circuit starts working properly.Design, on the other hand, is an art; there's always more than one way to do it, and the individuality of the designer has a strong influence on the way the design turns out: hence &quot;Art, Science, and Personalities&quot;.This isn't to say that a good designer does unusual things without a good reason, or adds expensive bells and whistles because he happens to like them. What it means is that for designs that are not routine, the designer's personality has a lot to do with how it comes out.To become an expert designer, you need a well-developed technical taste. Once you have a design that works at some level, it's that sour feeling in the back of your mouth that will tell you that it isn't right yet, that it can be simpler, cheaper, or more reliable. There aren't a lot of other sources of that information.Arts are taught by apprenticeship. But where are you going to go to get taught this stuff nowadays? EE departments are going more and more to software, as shown by the vast number of graduate EEs who don't know which end of a soldering iron to hold. Jim Williams can't be everybody's mentor, but in this informal (and sometimes whimsical) book, he and his friends show us how the best analogue designers in the business go about things. You know what? One of the most important elements in the art of design is *play*.Maybe listening in on these guys playing at being analogue designers isn't quite the same as sitting elbow-to-elbow with them, but it's as close as most of us are going to get, and it's terrifically valuable. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a better analogue designer, and who is not easily put off by whimsy in technical writing. (I find it refreshing and fun, myself.) I've owned this book for 6 or 7 years, and it's about ready to fall apart from rereading."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"For people who are not already into analog design, this book only mystifies the subject further. It presents analog design with an aura of eccentricity and a feeling of more artistry than engineering. This is an eclectic collection of articles, but among them there are a few gems. Paul Brokaw's description of linear IC design is by far the best exposition I've seen. Jim Williams' Zoo Circuit makes interesting reading into the mind of the designer."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"There is a lot of good information contained within this book from the many contributing authors. You can learn a lot of little &quot;tricks&quot; to help you in circuit design. However, many of the contributors get a little carried away with their own personal histories and design biases. I would like to have seen a few more of the design methods and ideas, that the authors have learned over the years, included in the book. Most of the authors are straigth forward in their design philosophies and explanations. However, some of the authors spend pages talking about how, &quot;...they don't even own a computer, much less use it for design...,&quot; type of philosophies. This is just plain arrogance on the part of the author and does not help the reader. If the author had used the same page to talk more about how he optimizes a circuit's design, the book would have received a much higher mark from me. Overall, it's not a bad book despite these small shortcomings."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"you into Analog ? You got to have this book. Its a tribute to the LEGENDS. Legends that ever were, that ever will be. My boyhood favourite of almost 10 years. Dont miss it on the analog shelf. I would deem it blasphemy."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"The chapters of this book, written by different authors, don't constitute so much a \\"how YOU can become a legendary analog designer\\" as they do \\"how I became a legendary analog designer\\". And that's a good thing. A cookbook that can make every reader a guru in any subject, analog circuit design in this case, just isn't going to happen. Seeing what worked for other people, and being able to ferret out the common threads with how their own brain works, will help the potential analog designer spot approaches that resonate with his or her own skills, and perhaps figure out their own personal path to expert level. Not everyone will, or can, reach the level these authors reached; they are all exceptional. But if just a little bit of understanding of what they they've done and how they did it rubs off, then this book will have served the reader well. But if you expect that reading it will make you a guru, you'll likely be disappointed.I especially enjoyed Chapter 17, Richard Burwyn's \\"How to Design Analog Circuits without a Computer or a Lot of Paper\\" because it smacks of practicality and parsimony. It describes practical methods and a relatively small number of things to memorize that'll save you loads of time later. But there are many good chapters -- for example, I got a much better understanding of how several common IC circuits *really* work (e.g., the Gilbert cell) after reading the chapters written by their inventors. Most people will like a few chapters a lot, and others not so much -- but it'll be different chapters for different people.I first encountered this book at my company's library several years ago, then after I left there, bought a copy for myself and recently, a copy for a friend. It's not a perfect book, but I think most people will find at least a few things in it that will make reading it worth their time."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"This is a great book to help you understand Analog engineers - I recruit them for an IC design company and am impressed how smart they are - this book gives you an idea of their depth..."},{"Title":"Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science and Personalities (EDN Series for Design Engineers)","review":"... was the asking price for Philbrick's P2 amplifier module.

Henry Prize Stories 2006: The Best Stories of the Year","review":"As in her two previous volumes (2003, 2005 - there was no O. Henry Prize volume dated 2004, forever throwing a kink into the collection on my bookshelf), series editor Laura Furman has gravitated toward subject matter that can only be described as dark and depressing. Yet the stories are so well written that the net effect is one of being moved by the power of the written word to experience aspects of the human condition well beyond the everyday. This is what good literature is supposed to do, and I would rank this year's volume as Furman's best so far.To get an idea of the subject matter covered in this volume, one only has to take a careful look at some of the titles: \\"Mule Killers\\", \\"The Broad Estates of Death\\", \\"Disquisition on Tears\\", \\"The Plague of Doves\\", and \\"Famine\\". Other titles sound benign, however the subject matter is anything but (e.g. the last two stories, \\"Letters in the Snow\\" and \\"Window\\" are both about domestic abuse). But in all the stories, the subject matter isn't anywhere near the most important element. These stories expose the thought, logic and emotions that the characters caught in these situations experience, and hence take the reader into interesting places that are best experienced vicariously.Each reader will no doubt have his/her own list of favorite stories. Mine were:-- \\"Window\\", by Deborah Eisenberg: I agree wholeheartedly with guest editor Francine Prose's assessment that the language, wording and pacing of Eisenberg's story are excellent, and that this story is the best of the best. There is even some humor sprinkled in at appropriate moments.-- \\"Wolves\\", by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer: this is a portrait of the final stage of a long marriage, in which creations of the mind take on a reality of their own (perhaps). Along with Xu Xi's \\"Famine\\" and Stephanie Reents' \\"Disquisition on Tears\\", which I also enjoyed, Schaeffer's \\"Wolves\\" utilizes the fictional form to its full advantage.-- \\"The Dressmaker's Child\\", by William Trevor: this story, more than any other, contains an O. Henry-like plot twist at the end, which turns the story into a masterful tale of entrapment.-- \\"Girls I Know\\", by Douglas Trevor: a contemporary story of class differences and how ambition (or lack thereof) can drastically affect outcomes in life.My least favorite story, and the only one that I would have preferred not to have been included, was Terese Svodoba's \\"'80's Lilies\\", a story about what I have always known to be a futile quest: the attempt to seek out a sheltered, idyllic Garden of Eden to escape all the world's problems. The world just doesn't work that way, as these characters also discover (and they were supposed to be smart, educated folk).I keep hoping that, one of these years, Furman will include some well-written stories that explore more positive aspects of human experience. But if you are willing to take a walk on the dark side, you will be amply rewarded. On the other hand, if you are looking for stories with more popular appeal, then the Best American Stories series is for you. I happen to enjoy both."},{"Title":"The O. Henry Prize Stories 2006: The Best Stories of the Year","review":"This is a fabulous collection. It's worth it alone for the story by the rising star author, Stephanie Reents, called \\"Disquistion on Tears,\\" which is not only a poignant, moving story, but also wonderfully strange and funny. Reents creates a hybrid of sorts. It's a literary short story first and foremost, but it also seems to contain elements of horror, magical realism, and other genres. The Alice Munroe stuff is great, too."},{"Title":"The O. Henry Prize Stories 2006: The Best Stories of the Year","review":"I agree with the first reviewer that the stories in this collection are dark and depressing. I like the way the collection is selected. While Laura Furman is the editor, there are three additional jurors - - Kenin Brockmeier, Francine Prose and Colm Toibin.Of the 20 stories in this collection, there were only two that knocked my socks off. The others were nothing spectacular and I doubt I'll remember them one month from now. The two I really liked were 'Passion' by Alice Munro and 'Wolves' by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer.'Passion' is a strange story about a woman returning to the home of her ex-fiance, the place where her engagement and life unraveled all in a fit of unbridled passion over the course of one weekend.'Wolves' is a spectacular story of loneliness, the power of the mind, aging, and the difficulty of sorting our reality from imagination. In this story, a couple who have been together for 40 years are growing both more dependent on one another yet more distant. The wife has some animosity towards her husband which she takes out in a passive aggressive manner. They have a word game that they have played over the years. One says a word and then the other adds to it, plays with it, and then passes it pack to their partner. On once occasion, the husband says the word 'wolf'. The wife keeps the word, plays with it in her head, imagines a real wolf that comes to her and helps her abide with her loneliness. The wolf is also dangerous because it is wild and unknown. It can be treacherous and unpredictable. Tragedy can and does occur.For me, it was worth reading this collection for these two stories. I know that 'Passion' is in a collection of stories by Alice Munro but I have never seen 'Wolf' before. I am a fan of both these authors and recommend these stories highly. If you can get this book cheaply it is worth it. You might like some stories that I didn't. I'm giving the collection a '4' because these two stories are so formidably dark and wonderful,"},{"Title":"Tibetan Furniture","review":"I'm an artist with a particular interest in the decorative arts - and, while I can't say much about the text (I haven't read much of it), the artwork shown in this book is exquisite. I purchased this book for the eye candy - and there's quite a bit here to be had.The book focuses on hand-painted Tibetan furniture, and it's the highly stylized, decorative, and \\"folky\\" painting which I find so appealing in the work presented. The book is richly illustrated with many examples, the examples are well photographed, and the printing is high-quality.If you're an artist, it's a great reference book - there are many decorative motifs and design ideas from which you can \\"steal\\", \\"borrow\\", \\"adapt\\", or otherwise use as inspiration in your own work."},{"Title":"Tibetan Furniture","review":"This is an early book--one of only two at the present time--focusing on Tibetan furniture from the perspective of the antiques field. Tibetan furniture is an area that will surely find a wider, recognized place given the growing role of some Asian countries, especially China and India, in global political and economic affairs. Already one sees a growing interest in Chinese antiquities and art. As Buckley notes, the time when a survey of ancient and older Tibetan furniture including many photographs such as found in this book is possible is likely passing because many of the finer pieces of Tibetan furniture are already scattered in private homes and museums throughout the world and there is already considerable interest in this field among Hong Kong and other regional dealers. Although the author admits he is \\"biased toward chests,\\" these serve sufficiently for instruction and examples on the construction, materials, dates, and carvings, illustrations, and other decorative and symbolic features of all Tibetan furniture. \\"The echoes of contacts with peoples all over Asia can be traced in the designs found on Tibetan furniture.\\" Yet the furniture and its designs are not a simple imitation or composite of forms, designs, etc., of other cultures, but shown the stamp of the \\"unique identity\\" of the Tibetan people and culture so that Tibetan furniture is unmistakable. The illustrations and symbols of Tibetan furniture are usually related to the Tantric Buddhism of Tibet. Buckley's book is not only a guide to identification of the desirable antique Tibetan furniture, but it also relates the historical and cultural context of the furniture. The author is a recognized expert on antiques and collecting currently living in Beijing."},{"Title":"Tibetan Furniture","review":"This beautiful book offers much more than a generous selection of wonderful photographs!

Brain weight tends to vary with 2/3rd power of body weight, with vertical displacements for mammals and again for primates. Living reptiles show similar brain weights as archaic ones. There is a four-fold increase in brain size from archaic reptile to archaic mammal, and then mammalian encephalization holds steady for another 100 million years. In the last 50 million years there is another four-fold increase in brain size from archaic mammals to living mammals. The emergence of improved hearing and smell is postulated as the reason for an enlarged brain in early mammals over their reptile ancestors."},{"Title":"Quiche and Tell: Advice and Recipes for Singles","review":"This book has not only food recipes that are very tasty, but the stories and anecdotes were amusing.

Definately worth a read!"},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"There are comics that have more depth and some that have more subtlety than The Goon, but few that exhibit such sheer joy of the comics medium and \\"low-brow\\" art. It's obvious that Eric Powell knows not only the value of good B-Movies and pulp tales, but of all other pop-culture discards as well. His stories, freeway collisions among gansters, monsters, Frank Capra and drive-in \\"sci-fi\\", are pure, simple, direct, and often outright funny. They invoke everything from Ed Wood to Norman Rockwell. Although Powell adopts a beautiful cartoony style in drawing Goon (with suggestions of Jack Kirby, Will Eisner and other comics greats), what makes it work is the talent of an accomplished artist capable of far more complex renderings. The Goon is a wonder and well worth your attention."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"This was a wonderful read. I do not normally laugh out loud when reading comics, but this one keeps me rolling. Despite the fact that the characters are much the antihero, you just can't help rooting for them.After reading this I am determined to buy and read this title as long as he is publishing it. The Goon is my favorite comic out today, and I would definitely pick this product up."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"OK, \\"high concept review\\": What if you took the old E.C. horror comics, and mixed it up with old E.C. MAD comics -- tossing a few old E.C. \\"Two-Fisted Tales\\" in with the mix? Well, that's THE GOON -- both in its sensibilities, its subject matter, and its lush style of artwork.I picked this up after many recommendations from many people (both friends and critics). And while it took me a few pages to get into it -- and to realize that what was going to draw me in was the humor. Any comic that can get me to laugh convulsively more than 10 times throughout its length has my vote, and my filthy lucre.If you like your horror straight up, I doubt this will do it for you; but if your looking for comedy tinged with gore -- you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"I am not a huge graphic novel fanatic, not that I do not appreciate great artwork and the compelling stories that come out of a variety of fantastic stories, it is just that it has never been something I have latched onto as much as many of my friends have.My fascination has been with zombies and that has led me to different graphic novels where zombies play a part in them. From The Walking Dead Series to Xombie to Reces Pieces, I have found plenty to entertain me with along with the strictly written word in zombie books.I picked up a couple of Goon titles, thinking that My Murderous Childhood and Nothin' But Misery would be the first two in the series. I was mistaken but after reading these two, I will be hitting up Rough Stuff and moving forward with the rest of the series.I love the almost schitzophrenic way that Eric Powell's brain works with this series, how he brings in totally lunatic elements with both a dark and malevolent sense of humor that had me cracking up through this entire book. The advertisements are hilarious, the different tales both big and small are intriguing, and overall I thought it was a fantastic read.Zombies play a part in the Goon series, which is what drew me to it, but it is far more than just that. I honestly cannot wait to read the rest of the various tales of the Goon, because the art is great, the stories are rolicking, and the bottom line for me is that this was fun to read."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"The art is great, feels almost animated (and i hope someone will animate it). There is humor, but it's mostly in the art rather than in the text and ideas.However, i felt a little dissapointed for two reasons:1. Even if this is the first volume, you should read volume 0 (Rough Stuff) first since this one makes some important references to the origins of Goon and its enemy, the Zombie Priest2. It's too similar to Hellboy. Not VERY similar, but enough to notice it easily. Even the looks and one-liners of the Goon remind me of Hellboy. Also his absurd supernatural enemies and friends are from the same pool of ideas (zombie gangsters instead of nazis, talking fish and sea monsters, hot chicks with a noir shade of character)The Goon volumes make for a great looking and entertaining collection and should be appreciated by Hellboy fans. But this being the first volume that i read, i expected something fresher and more genuine."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"This is my first foray into The Goon. I loved it. I usually read superhero books but lately I've weanted to get into something different. First it was Hellboy and now it's The Goon. This is Hilarious but it's not just jokes there are real stories here too. These other reviewers mention these great horror writers and what-not, I have not read their stuff (but I probably should), but this is a great read for anybody.And The Atomic Rage is hilarious."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"Been reading the Goon since it came out and finally had decided to buy the volumes. Highly recommend to anyone who likes comics and/or hilarious reading. Hopefully that movie ends up coming out one of these days."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"Combine the wild horror of Hellboy, the Depression-era atmosphere of the Rocketeer, and the wacky, outrageous humor of Sam and Max, and you get Eric Powell's Goon.Who is the Goon? A mighty, scarred, granite-jawed, two-fisted mountain of a man who, with his sidekick, Frankie, runs all of the crime rackets in the dead-end slums of a no-name city while, at the same time, keeping it safe from the marauding undead armies resurrected by the Nameless Zombie Priest. Weird? Sure. Wacky? You bet. Fun? Absolutely.The Good: Powell knows his audience. He blends obscure pop culture references with some out-of-left-field humor, as well as a healthy dose of zombie-kicking fun, and makes what you might call a nifty companion comic to Mike Mignola's Hellboy. It's drawn in a cartoony fashion, but that actually adds to, rather than detracts from, the antics. Powell is also able to bring out a surprising amount of pathos in his characters. There really isn't an ongoing storyline in this volume, just interconnected short tales, and that seems to work just fine.The Bad: Really, I didn't have much to complain about. If I had to complain about something, it would be the one-note plots (Joke, then zombie shows up, joke while beating up zombie, then joke finale), though even that isn't bothersome.If you're a fan of zombies, Hellboy, or a good, funny comic, give The Goon a try!"},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"a really cool comic series. i am commenting on the entire series here. kinda makes you want'a go to the gym and throw some weights around or maybe pull a transmission out of a car or somethin'...:)"},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"I didn't know exactly what to expect of this specific book, as it was a first volume of a long-running series. I have to say this was one of those incredibly pleasant surprises! The dark humor is spot on, as is the nihilism and total lack of any moral or decency (at least apparently...) that we've come to love and cherish on any good zombie film/book/comic.The main character is a brute and he should be, the zombies are irrelevant and totally discardable, as they should be. Spot on."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"\\"The Nameless Man, the Zombie Priest, had come to town to build a gang of the undead. But even the undead fear...The Goon!\\" This little quote from the back of the book sums up The Goon nicely - it's an action packed adventure pitting our titular hero The Goon (a huge muscular gorilla of a man) against the undead legions of the evil Zombie Priest (a diminutive scheming madman with sorcerous powers and a penchant for necromancy). However, the Goon is so much more than just sraightforward Zombie-bashing. It's a true comics classic, and Eric Powell has ensured himself a place in the comic book hall of fame by creating such a legendary character. The Goon has hints of Kirby, Wally Wood, Will Eisner and even bits of Mignola's Hellboy, but it stands out as a truly original piece of work. In this first volume we see the Goon and his sidekick Franky take on deadly fish men and the haunted inbred ghosts from The Decaster Mansion, as well as a Bog Lurk ensorcelled by the Zombie Priest to take down The Goon in hand-to-hand combat - no easy feat. Buy this first volume and soak up the comic book magic of The Goon. You'll soon be as addicted as I am."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"..is to buy the first one.Buy it.Buy it Now."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"Eric Powell sure is one deranged em-effer, but in a good way, and THE GOON is one weird, subversive, crazy wonderful comic book. THE GOON isn't that easy to pin down in terms of genre. It's definitely horror, and there's even a Lovecraftian whiff at times, but it's also pulp adventure and crime noir and slapstick and parody. As Eric Powell's mentioned in The Daily Cross Hatch website, \\"It's a dark comedy about a street thug, in a world of monsters.\\" But, really, it's basically whatever notion Eric Powell reels in, on any given day.We seem to overlook the fact that the Goon himself is a shady character, because he battles and murderizes zombies and monster squids and other wicked supernatural whatnot. The brawny, face scarred, blind in one eye Goon passes himself off as mere muscle for the Labrazio crime family, but constant readers will know that the Goon had a while ago killed Labrazio and had taken over his criminal operations, but that he's kept the hostile takeover on the hush hush. So dude's not a good guy. Except that, in a world crawling with nightmarish otherworldly creatures, well, he's actually perceived as a hero.You won't break your brain trying to keep up with the Goon's exploits. The story arcs basically boil down to: Hey, a monster! And then the Goon clobbers the monster with a pipe wrench or with something else equally handy. So Eric Powell keeps the narrative pretty easy to follow. This particular trade, THE GOON Vol. 1: NOTHIN' BUT MISERY, has the Goon and his cartoony-rendered sidekick Franky polishing off some more of the Zombie Priest's undead minions (these cats just keep wandering off Lonely Street). The Buzzard makes his debut, that tortured ex-sheriff cursed into a dark creature and who survives by devouring the undead (which is all kinds of ironic). The Buzzard has come to town harboring a long-held mad-on against the Zombie Priest, and off he goes to Lonely Street, with the Goon's blessing.Then, intended as a nod to Christmas (but it feels more like a stab in the eye), Powell introduces a semi-sadistic Santa Claus whose little helpers had been consuming people during the holidays. There's also a hillbilly werewolf, and we learn why Franky had never ever received presents from Santa. Next, the Goon goes up against a magician and his harpies. And, finally, the Goon saves the world from alien invasion, and he does this in only three pages.THE GOON Vol. 1: NOTHIN' BUT MISERY collects Powell's self-published issues #1-4 of THE GOON and THE GOON COLOR SPECIAL, as well as THE GOON short story featured in the final issue of DARK HORSE PRESENTS. You'd think, just because this is volume one, that it holds the Goon's earliest published issues. But, no, sir. For the Goon's earliest published stuff, you'd have to get THE GOON Vol. 0: ROUGH STUFF, which collects the first three Goon issues originally published by Avatar Press back in 1999. Good luck with that; Volume 0 costs a lot of bones.To keep things even more interesting Eric Powell occasionally interrupts the story by injecting offbeat, dark humored advertisements, and I'm now really, really jonesing for that Billy Lobotomy Kit (with its totally convincing guarantee: \\"All heads taken from convicts and soulless heathens!\\"). The Depression-era backdrop adds to that pulp adventure feel and somehow lends itself well to a protagonist who's no-nonsense and less than loquacious. The very cool thing is that you never know exactly where Eric Powell is taking you. There are out-of-left-field twists, and the creepy crawly elements are offset with moments of sheer absurdity. The Goon and Franky are who they are, intractably, and the monsters are friggin' monsters, and what I mean by this is that you can pretty much forget about steady growth and development in their character arcs. But it's okay, I'd rather not have the Goon suddenly quoting Jane Austen or Baudelaire or Aesop.Eric Powell can draw, did you know? Guy incorporates the signature touches of several comic book legends into his own wicked style: Jack Kirby's blocky dynamism; a whiff of Steve Rude's simple yet evocative lines; the old school magic and grit of Will Eisner; the twitchy weirdness of Richard Corben. Taking these influences and continuing to evolve, Eric Powell has established himself as an artist to be seriously reckoned. His painted covers are awesome stuff, and I wish there was a blow up of that one iconic panel featuring the Goon driving his red gas guzzler while firing slugs into a monster squid.Actually, if one short sentence could encapsulate this comic book's in-your-face attitude, it may be Franky's no frills declaration as he and the Goon confront several fishy mobsters on the dock. To quote the ever feisty Franky: \\"All I can say is... knife to the eye!\\"(By the way, I'm still waiting for new word on the supposedly upcoming CG-animated film about THE GOON. What's up with that?)"},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"I really cant say anymore than I love this book. It has a macabre sense of humor, great art, and the stories (though they don't always run together) are very entertaining. If you like zombies and cannibalism mixed with witty repartee and some zany gags this is the book for you.Highest recommended BUY."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"I absolutely love this book and all things Goon. Powell is one heck of an artist...no ifs ands or buts about it. The guy rocks.Buy this book and have a blast!"},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"This is funny, funny stuff. In fact, go back and insert at least one more funny for me while I explain the genius of Eric Powell.The Goon is a ne'er do well who oft does well who, with his pal Franky, run the local mob while fighting off the local zombie horde. There's the plot, but certainly not the draw for \\"The Goon.\\" This stuff is hilarious and yet, there are moments, like when Goon meets Buzzard, that it becomes clear funny and meaningful are not mutually exclusive.I don't care what you're buying here, make sure and add The Goon to the list. Read it yourself, give it to a friend, make sure you're spending over $25 and getting the free shipping -- whatever. But don't cheat yourself out of a laugh-out-loud treat by leaving The Goon behind."},{"Title":"The Goon Volume 1: Nothin' But Misery (Goon (Numbered))","review":"Eric Powell's \\"The Goon\\" didn't appeal to me at first. Yet again, we had another monstrous hero who fights monsters, and it was made worse by the fact that his appearance was VERY similar to Eddie Campbell's Bacchus. At the recommendation of several fanatical comic shop owners, I checked it out. They claimed that, if I liked Hellboy, I'd like this.Well, the story is certainly not as fleshed-out or detailed as Hellboy, but I can say that I enjoyed it. It's full of humor, both overt and subtle (and the random advertisements are superb). Powell provides enough background info on the Goon so that he's not just another pointless hero. Even though this is a collection of individual stories, there is a thread running through them, and hopefully Powell will expand more on this in the future. The Goon is just getting into the swing of things, so I can give him some slack.The artwork is definitely entertaining and very well-executed - Powell's superb technical skills are highlighted in a section featuring the origin of a supporting character, the Buzzard, who will hopefully play a larger role in future stories. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a Buzzard solo comic. In conclusion, I'm looking forward to more of the Goon, just to see what Eric Powell can do."},{"Title":"Discovery","review":"What a feast of imagination! My daughter (7) really enjoyed that book.

Emilie Loring reads like a cross between Nancy Drew and Mary Higgins Clark. Her skill with natural dialogue and colorful description moves the story along well.Penny marries wealthy Don Garth for the wrong reasons and on their wedding day he discovers that she loves another. They proceed with a strained relationship, presenting a normal facade for family and friends. Their luxurious estate and lavish lifestyle are the setting for high drama and international intrigue. There are attempts to steal the top secret plans for the new military plane that the Garth Works is constructing.Penny's feelings towards her husband change as she tries to protect him from danger. Everyone, from the butler, the valet, a Washington merry widow, Don's best friend, and Penny's former love, fall under suspician. Bits of conversation and furtive actions keep the reader guessing on who are the bad guys and who are the good guys.I was glad I gave this a re-read. I remember it being sooo romantic when I read it years ago."},{"Title":"There are No Spies","review":"Another installment of the November Man series, Bill Granger really holds his own in the spy genre. Borrowing from such literary styles as Trevanian, John Le Carre and William Goldman, Granger is able to entertain the reader with solid prose and visual description. This story begins in Switzerland as American agent Devereoux (code name November) has been retired from the spy game, only to be brought back by the game itself...(I think this is how most spy books begin, the main character is retired and forced into returning). The story carries an interesting government conspiracy and elements of suspense. And my favorite, a plot twist at the end that you won't see coming. An entertaining read, I strongly recommend this book just for the fun of it all."},{"Title":"There are No Spies","review":"Bill Granger's November Man series in the 80's was the pinnacle of espionage fiction at that time. Having read all 7 of his books featuring R Section agent Deveroux, code name November, this one was the best yet. A tightly woven plot focusing on the forced institutionalization of Section Operations head Hanley draws November back into The Game which he thought he had successfully disappeared from in the last novel, \\"Hemingway's Notebook\\". Hanley's knowledge of NUTCRACKER, a spy exchange program has made him expendable to those in power. With a cryptic phone call to Deveroux, Hanley's strange message that \\"there are no spies\\" causes Deveroux's new life to unravel, forcing him to seek out old ally/nemesis, Denisov in order to find out what is going on. With beautiful Russian assassins and Traitors in his own government, November must rescue Hanley and put the pieces together in this puzzle of international intrigue. Once again Granger's concise characterizations carry the day as thia fast moving story reaches it's exciting conclusion. Also, there is a surprising twist at the very end involving one of Deveroux's most hated enemies. Spy fiction at it's best by the underappreciated but always dependable Bill Granger. His best."},{"Title":"There are No Spies","review":"Two decades ago, Granger was hailed by no less than Ed McBain as \\"America's best spy novelist.\\" A pity he is not better known nowadays. Perhaps such \\"spy\\" tales now seem dated, but this and other books in the Granger's \\"November Man\\" series are all very entertaining reads. There Are No Spies is also part of \\"November Man\\" series, and it's another cracker. With its many double-crossing characters and nefarious espionage activity, it reminds me a bit of those great Ross Thomas novels. Really, I think Granger is that good a writer."},{"Title":"There are No Spies","review":"The plot of There Are No Spies by Bill Granger takes the form of a complex puzzle. The reader knows that something disconcerting is happening. But the who, what, why and how of it remain a complete mystery to the reader until the very end.The novel's protagonist, Devereaux, a retired American spy (code named November), suddenly finds himself the center of unwanted attention as his former intelligence agency, the highly secretive R Section, is about to implode. As Devereaux is pursued by trained assassins from either side of the Iron Curtain, R Section's Director of Operations is involuntarily committed to a sinister psychiatric hospital hidden in the far reaches of Western Maryland.Using strong, forceful writing, Granger succeeds in imbuing There Are No Spies with a pervasive feel of impending disaster. A feel made all the more effective because the source, substance and purpose of the threat are kept hidden from the reader. Highly recommended to fans of the genre."},{"Title":"There are No Spies","review":"THERE ARE NO SPIES by Bill Granger is my first by this author and I must go back and acquire the others in the November series. Fast paced with just enough foul-ups to be believable as bureaucrats on both sides fight for power and survival.Devereaux (November), Hanley (Spy-master), Alexa (amoral killer for KGB) and Denisov (retired KGB) join forces for a price to stop the Nutcracker. Betrayals of country and honor makes this a terrific read in the spy/espionage/thriller category. If you haven't met Bill Granger's characters they are well worth the read.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"Managing Health Services Organizations and Systems","review":"I bought the book for a class.

Jane (Navy Seal Drama).I recommend instead researching on the internet and finding service specific literature: For instance the books by Robert S. Rush for those interesting in the US Army. Also the downloaded game from the U.S. Army website is also a great resource."},{"Title":"Barron's Guide to Military Careers","review":"Barron's normally puts out a decent guide to about anything they approach; however, this book is currently over 7 years old, and is not organized as well as one should expect from Barron's. I woul d recommend you skip on this book and go online to research opportunbities at each branch's website. Don't forget that the Coast Guard, Merchant Marines, and National Oceanographic and Atmospeheric Agency are also uniformed services.If you are interested in becoming a military officer, you may want to check out \\"How to Become a Commissioned Officer in the U.S. Military,\\" by Ron Taylor."},{"Title":"Barron's Guide to Military Careers","review":"Great book. Oh and Coast Guard is part of the Department of Transportation in peace, and the Department of the Navy in war.But anyway its a great book."},{"Title":"Barron's Guide to Military Careers","review":"I Ratmouse hereby endorse this book to anyone considering joining the military. Donald B. Hutton does an excellent job in outlining the various paths available to the prospective conscript (including the US Coast Guard- which otherwise is difficult to find detailed information about). He explains the options available for those considering the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines (and Coast Guard), the ROTC program, and outlines specific careers and skills to be attained in the United States Armed Services. The nuggets of information found in this easy-to-read, well-diagramed book can make all the difference in one's specialized future as a proud member of the world's most powerful security branch and peacekeeping body- the Unites States Armed Forces.While some Americans may scoff at the notion of joining the military, and will even criticize the efforts of young men and women who daily risk their lives to serve their country- do not let the sheltered and small-minded ignoramuses deter your will. When joining the Armed Services, you are first and foremost protecting the United States Constitution and our democratic way of life. Sadly, there will always be people who take our liberties for granted, and take for granted the courage and sacrifices our soldiers have made, and continue to make, for the greater good of our country. You are not fighting solely for ivory tower liberals who do not care about you. You are fighting for the higher principles of democracy, civility, national security, and freedom. This book will get you started on that just and noble path."},{"Title":"Barron's Guide to Military Careers","review":"Great book.

The rich imagery and descriptions were a delight. Once hooked, I didn't put up much of a fight and followed Elizabeth's journey from adolescence through motherhood surviving challenges and memories. I devoured this novel and will definitely put Ms. Corey on my list of authors to watch."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"The metaphors in this novel are truly uncountable - but every one is aptly drawn. Combine that with a cast of characters that are so compelling and real, involved in a story with which any reader should be able to relate, and there are plenty of reasons why this novel should be widely read and lauded. The quote on the book from Elizabeth Hardwick, characterizing THE SKATING POND as \`a love story' might lead some potential readers to write it off as romantic fluff - to do so would be to do this novel a great injustice. This is simply incredible writing.Corey's main character, Elizabeth, is thrust into adulthood at an early age through a double tragedy - the death of her mother and subsequent abandonment by her father. Over the course of twelve years, we see Elizabeth go through the emotional ups and downs that would easily fill most people's lifetimes. Through it all - through her yearnings for more than a life in a remote Maine coastal village can offer her - she remains questioning. She questions the life led by those around her, and she questions herself - what does she really want out of life; what can she expect from it; what does she know of love, and what does she want from it? These are things that each of us must work out for ourselves, in our own way - and Corey's lovely writing allows us inside Elizabeth's mind and heart as she walks (and sometimes stumbles, as do we all) through life.Corey has a way of revealing the humanity and goodness that resides (I believe) in all people - even the characters in her story that are somewhat less than likable come across sympathetically, at least in some ways. The life-lessons that her central character absorbs here are never presented as set-in-stone or rigid - as another reviewed astutely pointed out, it's all about the choices we make. Those are the ones we have to live with.I wonder if Corey set out to write such an ambitious novel, or if it \`just happened' to turn out that way. Whatever her original intentions, she has written an absorbing, rewarding and entertaining novel - highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"THE SKATING POND by Deborah Joy Corey is a story written to the emotions and soul of the reader. It works its way into your mind, and haunts you with its meanings and consequences. By writing this story in first person, Ms Corey allows the reader to fully experience the happenings and people in the life of the main character, Elizabeth. These things are felt and viewed by Elizabeth in the presentation of the story, but the judgments about these things are left up to the reader. After looking for love in all the 'right' places, Elizabeth finds only pain, disquiet, and abandonment - she then turns to a place where she receives great passion and greater pain. Eventually, Elizabeth makes choices, grapples with her emptiness and past, and finds a love that gives her the option of a life of sweetness and joy----if she has not waited too late for this to become her life long reality.Skating, and memories of her mother, take Elizabeth on a journey of great intensity for the reader. Deborah Joy Corey writes with such a fluidity of function and style that even the most mundane story line could become a masterpiece. Though in reality, it's the greatness of what Ms Corey has chosen to write about that completes the superiority of this book. Somewhere in the middle of this book, one of the characters makes a profound statement concerning tragedy and choices: saying that the person has a CHOICE to make when tragedy happens--be destroyed, or be glued together. So many books of dysfunction and disillusionment seem to leave each person to some unknown &quot;fate&quot;. Ms. Corey gives the reader an opportunity to experience personal responsibility and choices within a fictional world in this beautifully written story that can be enjoyed again and again."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"In Portland, Maine, last week with 4 friends from college days who wanted 'to shop,' I ducked into the nearest bookstore, bought this book, settled into a worn old leather chair, and nearly finished the book by the time my friends returned to find me. Thank god for the salvation of a good book!It's difficult for authors to write about sex. Most of the time, they come off sounding either like a Victorian maiden or a sly pornographer. But Deborah Joy Corey has written a book with a goodly amount of sexual interaction - and not a single line comes across as crass, voyeuristic, prurient, or sophomoric. It's absolutely beautiful writing.The central story is Elizabeth's, a girl with parents both frustrated by their own demons. Tragedy is something they can't cope with, and soon Elizabeth find herself living alone and going rapidly downhill in a small town on the coast of Maine. She falls into the arms or clutches (depends on your viewpoint) of a much older man, an architect from New York. He's running from his own demons and finds a kind of warped salvation in his relationship with Elizabeth - but he, too leaves her.I won't say more - but there's redemption, temptation, salvation - and a quiet love overriding everything in this lovely book."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"I don't know where this little gem of a book was hiding, but I certainly am glad that I found it. I was immediately drawn to the main character, Elizabeth and found myself rooting for her in her desire for a family life and then later on through her trials with love and loss. To me this book is about the choices we make and how everything that happens to us leaves it's mark on us somehow."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"The book is about a girl who lives in a town in a remote area of Maine. During the winter her pond freezes and her mother enjoys skating on it. One winter during a \\"Freak\\" accident her mother is hurt and the author ( in first person) writes how all of this affects her and her family.After alot of misfortune, she does find love from two very unlikely sources. One at first almost makes you feel sickened, then the other a more normal relationship.After so many years and the author trying to get her life together, the first \\"love\\" comes back and the second love has to rescue him.I enjoyed this book, but sometimes it became alittle confusing because the author remembers things and memories, but not always in sequence to what is happening in the story."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"We were already on our way to an impromptu wknd @ the beach and I had to stop @ the library for a few novels.. I don't know why I chose this one. The book jacket synopsis really drew me in I guess.This is a very awesome novel, loved the characters and remained unabashedly concerned with what would happen to them! The author's descriptive narrative of the New England coastline was mesmerising as was the story itself.I am definitely going to read it again."},{"Title":"The Skating Pond","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot once I got into it. I found the beginning a little slow and seemed not to be going anywhere, but I stuck with it and slowly a love story of kind developed. It was a strange love story between a teenage girl and a man certainly old enough to be her father.

The answer: horribly disappointing. The only thing decent about it is the included book. The tea bowl is wrong, the incense is wrong, the whisk is quite wrong, and the fukusa is hideously, hideously wrong. The kit seems to be targeted toward clueless hippies.The tea bowl was the item on which I was least clear what was wrong. It was too heavy for one thing, and it also didn't have glaze on the bottom.The tines of the chasen, as you may be able to see from the product picture, are waaaaay too thick. The incense is in a stick form, which isn't right. (We haven't yet learned anything about incense or its role in chado, so I didn't know that.)My instructor didn't even recognize the included piece of cloth as a fukusa. It was a white satin type of material, single thickness, with frayed edges. It wasn't folded right. This piece of cloth was the low point, the rock bottom, the pi&egrave;ce de crapitance, of the set.You could arguably criticize the set for lacking a chashaku and natsume and matcha itself (IIRC); it can't claim to have everything you'd need for a tea ceremony. Now that I think about it, tea people could probably debate exactly what elements would constitute \\"everything you'd need for a tea ceremony,\\" but I can't imagine those wouldn't include a chashaku and natsume.The $18.90 price should probably be a giveaway. Not that \\"more expensive\\" = \\"higher quality\\", but it would just be impossible to provide any authenticity in a set that costs that little."},{"Title":"The Tea Ceremony : Explore the Ancient Art of Tea","review":"While I gave a more detailed critique of the 1 star review in reply to a comment, I would add here that this is, indeed, a very good introductory set for beginners. It is, of course, commercial, but well worth the $30 or less that it costs.One point that deserves to be emphasized, though, is that the vast majority of chawan are unglazed on the foot, and I have never seen a temmoku bowl (the type in the set) which had a glazed foot. Any review that criticizes a bowl on this account reveals a lack of knowledge on the part of the reviewer.If you're just becoming interested in cha-no-yu, this set can be a reasonable tool in your education."},{"Title":"The Tea Ceremony : Explore the Ancient Art of Tea","review":"I am very disappointed in this product. It was shown and discussed as an entire kit. I only received the book and would not have ordered it without the supplies for the actual tea ceremony.

This is the first time I have felt so frustrated and disappointed with the service."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fit : How To Start an Image Consulting Business","review":"This book came along for me at the perfect time! Having just joined the Association of Image Consultants International (AICI) I needed to get materials on how to go beyond just makeup and skin care (which I already have expertise with).This book takes a potential new Image Consultant through the wide world of the profession without getting you lost. You're treated to explanations of what the different concentration areas are / could be, an extensive questionnaire that gives you a great starting point for developing your own strengths and identifying areas for focus, and literally takes you by the hand.I would not be as far along in my own Image Consulting business without this book. It is a resource that I refer to on at least a weekly, sometimes a daily basis.I've used the book to develop proposals for corporate work (the outline is there in the book); determine what I should charge for my work (guidelines are there in the book for various area, but it doesn't dictate pricing); and an extensive resource list for magazines, organizations and individuals who can further expand your knowledge base.If you are considering Image Consulting as a career or just want to get more information, Lynne Henderson Marks and Dominique Isbecque have created the Perfect Guide.Image Consultants have a powerful ability to help individuals become more 'themselves'.

Both Stout and Baring-Gould were noted Baker Street Irregulars; Baring-Gould gave the world his excellent Annotated Sherlock Holmes, while Stout authored the infamous \\"Watson Was a Woman\\" theory.It's a pity that Baring-Gould couldn't give Wolfe the full annotation treatment that he gave Holmes; apart from the problem of copyrights, Wolfe has a far larger canon than Holmes did. Part Two of this volume devotes chapters 12 - 26 to Wolfe's cases in chronological order, up to _Death of a Doxy_. Each case's salient points are briefly outlined without giving too much away; those which weren't explicitly dated are analyzed to place them in time. I personally found this of less interest than the rest of the book; some extra material giving the flavour of the time in which the stories were set would have seasoned it more to my taste.The rest of the book, though, gives Baring-Gould more scope. Chapter 1, \\"The Private Detective\\", lovingly analyzes the quirks that make Wolfe fun to watch (e.g. \\"Contact is not a verb under this roof\\"; as you may recall, a client once paid an extra $1000, though he never knew it, for using it that way in the office). This is followed, of course, by \\"The Man of Action\\" (analyzing Archie), \\"An Old Brownstone House\\" (hey, it's practically a character itself, and a floorplan is provided at the end of the book), and \\"The Major Domo\\" (Fritz, of course; we also get \\"Wining and Dining with Nero Wolfe\\" later on).Theodore never got enough time on stage to provide enough material for a chapter of his own, but we do get \\"A Wolfean Guide to the Orchidaceae\\" (I wish the publisher had sprung for colour illustrations). Zeck, however, does get a chapter, as do the homicide squad and the irregulars (Saul, Fred, Orrie, et al.)Chapters 9 - 11 - Baring-Gould's theories about how Wolfe might be a blood relative of Holmes, Wolfe and Marko might be brothers, and Archie might be Wolfe's nephew - can be best appreciated if you think about them as poetic justice for that \\"Watson Was a Woman\\" business Stout pestered the Baker Street Irregulars with; I don't take them seriously, myself.All in all, good stuff, as any serious treatment of Wolfe should be. The final case-by-case chronology (starting with Wolfe's probable birthdate, and including cases mentioned by Archie but never published) is *very* nice."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street: The life and times of America's largest private detective","review":"Baring-Gould has written the essential reference book for any and all fans of Rex Stout's wonderful creation. Not only does he provide a superb career summary of Wolfe's adventures, he gives a plan of the first floor of the famous Brownstone on West 35th Street, a summary of each of the mysteries and a chronological sequence for the mysteries. This book tells you everything you want to know about the great detective, his assistant (and gadfly) Archie Goodwin, and all of Stout's wonderful cast of characters."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street: The life and times of America's largest private detective","review":"I read this book shortly after it first came out and loved it. Baring-Gould, the man who deconstructed Sherlock Holmes so well and creatively, takes on Sherlock's \\"illegitimate son\\" here.The speculations (like the above) are extravagant but great fun. The characterizations are better, though. As much loved as Archie is throughout the series, he is even livlier here.Despite \\"proportional inaccuracies\\" about the brownstone's floorplan, Baring-Gould really makes us feel like we've walked through the front door.In order to tell the Wolfe story well, you just have to have a hyphenated last name!"},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street: The life and times of America's largest private detective","review":"Excellent &quot;bed-side&quot; companion to anyone interested in Nero Wolfe &quot;history.&quot; This &quot;biography&quot; is told in three parts: the characters, the stories, and a short, final part, with the philosophy &amp; library of Nero Wolfe and other random thoughts &quot;from the files of Archie Goodwin.&quot; I especially like the map of the ground floor of Wolfe's house and the chronology time-line at the end."},{"Title":"Nero Wolfe of West Thirty-fifth Street: The life and times of America's largest private detective","review":"This is, of course, the seminal book on everybody's favorite fatty. Even 35 years ago, however, when scholarly studies of Nero Wolfe were in their infancy, I was stuck by how badly proportioned the page-192 first-floor plan of the brownstone house was. It had all the correct rooms, true, but the scale was clearly grotesque -- for instance, the dining room was apparently 3 times the size of the office. Compare it to the infinitely more exact (and realistic) plan on page 100 of Ken Darby's book \\"The Brownstone House of Nero Wolfe.\\" Perhaps Baring-Gould merely had a bad draftsman; if not, he clearly had no understanding of the elements of architecture -- or of what was fairly clearly spelled out by Stout in the Canon...."},{"Title":"Bluebirds in My House: Bonnie and Ben","review":"This is really two books: it's an extremely informative look at bluebirds, and it's also an endearing animal story. Arnette Heidcamp- an extraordinary woman who seems to be a more than competent gardener and at least an amateur ornithologist- uses the engaging and entertaining story of these two baby eastern bluebirds, which she rescued from a nearby nesting facility, as the framework for a concise but comprehensive look at bluebirds in North America. In the first part of the book, Heidcamp examines the three types of bluebirds (eastern, western, and mountain), describing their eating, breeding, and migrating habits, and the challenges they've faced as their population declined at one point to near-extinction. She also details the rescue efforts that have met with considerable success since the 1950s, identifying some of those responsible for this laudable effort. The charming story of Bonnie and Ben follows, and this will provide the main enjoyment for most readers. The two baby birds had been abandoned before their lucky meeting with the devoted and kind-hearted author of &quot;Hummingbird In My House&quot; (another excellent story, well worth your time), and their interlude as guests in the famous sunroom provide us with another valuable reading experience.An appendix offers helpful information to those interested in attracting bluebirds and maintaining bluebird houses.I anxiously await her forthcoming book &quot;Andy Rooney In My House&quot;, in which she nurtures the famous televison commentator and returns him to the wild."},{"Title":"A Home for Nathan","review":"i thought a home for nathan was a great story for kids about the reality of homeless animals.

All Paws Up!"},{"Title":"A Home for Nathan","review":"I think its nice what many shelters do for their animals, but there are many animal shelters that are abusive and cruel. Animals in shelters are getting sick and the majority of animals going to shelters are going to die and those deaths are painful and in some cases horrific! What is even more alarming, and this is directly related to this book, people are turning their pets in to shelters at a rate higher than ever before. People think that if they turn their animal over to a shelter its going to go off to a happy little home and that simply is not true, even more so for cats. They also come to a shelter, get a dog and return the animal days later for a trivial infraction, that is normal behavior for a dog and could be fixed simply with training. That return to the shelter is an automatic death sentence for that dog as is any owner surrender! People need a SERIOUS reality check on what life in shelters is like, and understanding that when you get a dog you have to be responsible! Like having a child, it will need training and communication and of course love!People have forgotten how to live with an animal who has been our partner since we existed on this planet. They don't see the horrible depression these rejected dogs and cats suffer after having the families they love abandon them. We have stopped teaching our children how to act around dogs, which in itself is responsible for many of the attacks on children and adults, since requiring people to hide their dogs behind high fences and four walls. We teach people what to do if they encounter a bear, and certainly don't collect them placing in shelters, but we have allowed unrealistic expectations for dogs and now cats to grow and grow with every generation, leading to horrible premature deaths of wonderful, gentle dogs. Groups like HSUS, ASPCA have allowed the media myths about certain breeds to become a fact, instead of fighting those myths with the millions raised on the backs of those animals. This I believe, contributes greatly to the abuse of breeds like Pit Bulls. I think people assume that its okay to abuse a dog, so wrongly unpopular in our present culture. That the abuse of this dog will be seen as justified or ignored.Its time to hit people with the truth of their cruel actions and neglect. Stop taking away the life and rights of our domestic animals because people are uneducated about how to live side by side with them, as our ancestors have done for millions of years. We need governments to fund the laws they keep creating. These laws keep sending more and more animals to shelters and then they cut funding of those shelters creating a holocaust of deaths. Children and adults need to be taught how to act around and treat animals even if they don't own one. We need people to stop thinking of shelters as government funded pet shops where they can abandon their family member, and learn that when they purchase or adopt a pet, they are expected to be responsible for that animal no matter what! Most of all, we need severe laws for abusers of these animals, not slaps on the wrist. Every action we take as a society leads to a lesson learned by those members of our society! The policies created in the last 50 years toward our animals is creating intolerance and violence, that extends to anything or anyone deemed weaker by those allowed to get away with the cruelty, neglect and irresponsibility! Animals teach and give us a humanity that we can't get from a video game or the TV. We better reverse this wrong or beware the monsters we are creating!"},{"Title":"Hannold Combat Robots Complete Bundle (Combat Robots Complete, Combat Robot Weapons)","review":"I have to admit not having actually bought the bundle. However, a quick search inidcates that Chris Hannold has been competing since 1999--which means he got a fairly early start in the scene. He's competed in Robot Wars, Robotica, *and* Battlebots (well, the Las Vegas Street Fights, which were like &quot;Battlebots 0.5&quot;), as well as the Dragoncon and Farm Fight competitions, meaning he's competed in nearly every major robot combat competition in the world.

The Routledge dictionary has separate entries on Keynes, Marx, Solow, Galbraith, Malthus, Marshall, Mill, Say, Smith, Pigou, Schumpeter, Hicks, Modigliani, and Ricardo, but no entries on Friedman, Stigler, Fisher, Mises or Hayek. The latter two deserve special mention because they were the principal economists to predict globalization and the collapse of Soviet central planning! The book doesn't even have an entry on Paul A.

Her husband, also a master, can't hold on to their bond and ultimately will lose her to madness.I can tell you something: never in the last 10 years did I stay awake all night afraid of shadows, as happened when I finished this book...

Much of the conversational style comes through, as does the feeling of rapid change sweeping through the world as the City comes out to play. But unfortunately I just didn't \\"get into\\" it in the same way I did Masters.I think the real problem is that the story simply isn't as compelling. The authors \\"invent\\" a problem out of the blue that's not entirely convincing, nor as troubling as it should be -- this is no world-killing plague. Then they foist the problem off on what is to become one of the main characters of the book, someone with little depth or backstory from the first. Meanwhile Singer and Gerrick, the centers of the original book, are nowhere to be seen.Admittedly I did find the climax exciting, and it simply illustrates how much I enjoy their style of writing.

Following the Hegelian lines of his main early theoretical work, &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot;, in &quot;Lenin&quot; he portrayed the Russian leader as a &quot;philosopher of praxis&quot;. By this he meant that Lenin represented a dialectical unity of theory and practice; he took Marxist theory and applied it to actual circumstances, to guide the Revolution. Luk&aacute;cs discusses, for example, the role of the Party in the Revolution; he argues that the party must be in dialectical interaction with the proletariat, both being created by them, and helping to create their consciousness. Lenin is therefore seen as the epitome of Marxist-Hegelian philosophy.Equally, however, &quot;Lenin&quot; is a very personal response to Lenin the man and the revolutionary leader. In the light of his earlier aesthetic works, particularly &quot;Theory of the Novel&quot;, it seems that Luk&aacute;cs saw Lenin as a Tolstoyan or Dostoevskyan hero; Lenin was the individual agent able to bring out the essence of totality for the good of society.&quot;Lenin&quot; is a rich and rewarding book; moreover, being far simpler than much of Luk&aacute;cs's work, it serves as an excellent introduction to the main themes of his thought. It offers a fascinating philosophical interpretation of Lenin, as an example for Marxist revolutionaries to follow. At the same time, however, it provides a deep insight into Luk&aacute;cs, helping to understand why this sensitive aesthetic theorist managed to convince himself to accept the excesses of the Russian Revolution. In that sense, it helps even those unsympathetic to Marxism understand what attracts people to this revolutionary theory."},{"Title":"Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought (Verso Classics)","review":"Sir:I did purchase the same day this book by Lukacs together with the book by David Romer Advanced Macroeconomics.

By turns Fisher is admiring of the Mormons' courage and bemused by their folly, especially on Smith's part. The book is most painfully sympathetic in its unflinching account of the cruel persecution of the Mormons in Missouri in the 1830s. The novel is vivid and obviously well-researched, though Fisher's conclusions may be controversial."},{"Title":"Children of God: An American epic","review":"As a person who was raised in the Mormon faith and who still maintains close ties to my cultural heritage, I found this book to be a vivid and gripping retelling of what I see as the quintessential American epic. Fisher draws on his own experience growing up among the Mormons of Eastern Idaho as well as extensive research to paint portraits of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young in the early days of Mormonism. Fisher's gift for description never fails him, and his dialogue rings true (I love the phrase \\"Hit the grit!\\" that recurs throughout the novel).Fisher comes to the same conclusion that I have reached regarding the early church: that Joseph and Brigham and the others truly believed their own story. He balances sympathy with skepticism in his fictionalized narrative of some of the most remarkable events of the 19th century. How an obscure sect came to become a major religion is truly an epic-worthy tale, and Fisher tells it with skill and the commitment to craft that characterizes all of his writing. He is oddly prescient in his predictions about the transformation that the church will undergo as it strives to become increasingly mainstream and to distance itself from its controversial, polygamous, henotheistic roots.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Mormons or the West, or in the nature of religious faith and the actions it can inspire. The story of a people persecuted for their beliefs who turn tragedy into triumph and make a desert blossom like the rose is truly an American epic."},{"Title":"Children of God: An American epic","review":"Vardis Fisher has long been a favorite of mine - a writing style uncompromised by time, although I somehow feel he would have had more fun writing in the liberation of today. Having read most of his novels long ago, I finally got around to \\"The Children of God\\". His historical novel, written somewhat in the same method Homer used in commingling fact with the literary license to turn history into a novel, is based on the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. (Mormon) Fisher himself was from a Mormon background, thus close to his own roots in choosing this particular subject matter and it is always more than good to have first hand knowledge to draw on when delving into something like this. However, as the individualist he seemed to be, he preferred to do his own thinking, distancing himself from the Church, and this breaking away allowed his talent to perform freely and with out strict adherence to \\"faith\\". From what I can tell with my limited, yet fairly well-read knowledge of Mormonism , it is very well researched; Fisher was known for that kind of work. (i.e. - \\"Suicide or Murder?\\" - regarding the death of Merriwether Lewis) This particular work of literary art is yet another production of that talent.It starts just like it is widely known to begin - with the \\"revelation and vision\\" to Joseph Smith by God and Jesus, bidding him do the work of Prophet in establishing a new, \\"true Faith and Church\\". (Fisher let's it be firmly known that Joseph did not actually see the Golden Plates, but when asked if he did by the inquiring minds, he felt he must say that he had, because he knew that was the underlying power that would launch the religion; to say he had not seen anything would have not served his purpose as the New Prophet. This is the idea that Fisher intimates, and seems not to care if anyone should take issue with it.Fisher subtly lets the story and the personalities that develop delineate the vast personal differences between Joseph Smith, the dreamy, removed from reality self-proclaimed Prophet of the Saints and the robust, pragmatic Brigham Young, a convert who became Smith's most loyal supporter. It was apparent to me at least, that were it not for Brigham, there would be no Mormon Church today; that it was through his unbending strength and practicality regarding all things human that kept it going forward through the Missouri tribulations that threatened to fragment and derail the entire thing; but even more importantly, as the \\"Atlas\\" that brought the migration of thousands across the plains to Utah under unimaginable, perilous circumstances. The Missouri conflict is dealt with in such a way as to very effectively cast shame to those who would deny the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and common courtesy to others of a controversial religion while accepting the violence of mob rule as an acceptable, even \\"normal\\" way of crushing it. It is impossible to understand for most of us, but bringing it to readers is such a way is part of the importance of this work. (I can imagine the reactions this must have caused when it was first published in 1939). Joseph Smith managed to survive the persecution of those earlier years, landing on his feet through jailings, mob violence, at the hands of those that were termed \\"gentiles.\\" But of course, that abeyance would not last for him.But the road to Sainthood was far from being paved with gold; it was fraught with peril at every turn, angst, power struggles, revelations from the Lord to persuade upon the followers (not all of them popular at first); a steady, mounting crescendo moving under more and more layers of Faith and Instruction to be distributed and translated; and before you know it, the reader is inside the mind of a working Prophet.It's an amazing work, worthy of all the positive accolades afforded it at the time of its printing. If you are sympathetic to the LDS religion, or even if you are not, \\"Children of God\\" must be considered an excellent historical accounting - worth reading because it provides a completely different and powerful American Experience. Fisher makes no judgments; he simply spins the history of the Mormons from its roots outwards, according to the known background, breathing it life and blood through the magic of his pen."},{"Title":"Children of God: An American epic","review":"I think this is a must for all Utahns, Mormon and \\"gentile\\".

In fact, the author, may Allah have mercy on him, uses science to prove the existence of God. Essentially, he puts forth that because there is creation, then a Creator, one separate from creation, must exist, and that science simply proves this concept. Its an essential read for the Muslim as it should broaden one's mind and make one aware even more of how science is not separate from religion but really a means to achieving a greater understanding of Allah and our own existence in this world inshallah. I also think its beneficial for the non Muslim to read because it allows them to understand how religion is and should not be separate from daily life or scientific advancement. For many non-Muslims, worship and science dont go hand in hand and I think at the very least, this book will help them to see and inshallah accept the view that the two are fully related and actually support each other.

(Over 10 reprints since 1985.) The author is a very good researcher and writer. And his translator writes in English very capably. The author is a devout Muslim. The author discusses and acknowledges the \`soundness' of today's modern sciences: such as gravitational forces in earth always cause objects to fall \`downward' rather than rising upwards -- something that occurs naturally without God determining whether or not an object falls or rises. So far, so good. Except when science can't \`explain' WHY something happens - then the author believes Allah might have a hand in causing that situation to occur. The author wrote: \\"If science is to replace religion, it shall have to discover the ultimate and absolute explanation\\" (p. 23) as to WHY something has occurred - such as the creation of the universe. The author tries to explain how the Muslim's holy book, the Koran/Quran, explains some \`mysteries' that the scientific community cannot explain. The author cites Quran 23:14 to explain the creation of the human embryo (p.208). Essentially, the author acknowledges many scientific facts, and therefore tries to argue that: \\"See, I really do understand and accept many scientific explanations, so I am an educated Muslim. And because of my refined education, I am qualified to assert that Allah is/may be the cause of situations that scientists cannot explain.\\" The author presents some commonly accepted \`science', but presents mostly unsubstantiated theological \`causes' of \`actions.' However, this is one of the better Islamic attempts in discussing the topic: \\"Is there an Allah that has any influence on man?\\" over some 260 pages - but the author doesn't offer any scientific evidence that Allah exists. You either \`believe' or you don't (or maybe waiver and \`take a pass' on this topic as an agnostic)."},{"Title":"Hyperconscious: Explorations in Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Adventure, 7th Level)","review":"With the Expanded Psionic Handbook comes new rules and slightly different version of D&D psionics.

I was a bit shocked at the seemingly sloppy attention to detail at times; for instance, Delsohn comments that Walter Alston took over a 1954 Dodger team from Chuck Dresson that had won the previous three straight NL pennants (anyone ever hear of a guy named Bobby Thomsom in 1951?) In another section, he remarks that Duke Snider was sold to a Mets team that lost 102 games in their inaugural year (acutally it was 120, perhaps a typo). I found a couple of other statistical goofs also, but all in all , a terrific read, and I liked having the people involved tell their stories.

The interviews focus on the behind the scenes controversies as well as the on the field exploits of Dodger teams of the 50's through the 2000 season. For a Dodger fan much of the material is familiar but the book provides a chance to hear the players and front office guys tell their versions in their own words.The Yankees may be the Bronx Zoo and the all-time leaders in colorful characters but the Dodgers certainly are not far behind in that category.I highly recommend this to baseball lovers and particularly to Dodger fans. I learned some new things about the team and I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about Dodger history."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"A little while ago, I gave 5 stars to a book called &quot;The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told.&quot; While I stand by that rating, that book still pales in comparison to this one.The Dodgers have a rich history and with the exception of the Yankees, are probably the most successful and stories baseball franchise. This oral history gives a behind the scenes look at the incidents that shaped L.A. Dodger history.Every big event from 1958-2000 is covered, from the move to Los Angeles to Koufax's retirement to the Big Blue Wrecking Crew to Kirk Gibson's famous home run to the selling of the team to Fox. Delsohn does a good job at allowing both sides to speak about controversial issues and allows the reader to use his or her own judgment as to where the truth lies.For any fan of baseball, I recommend this book. For any fan of the Dodgers, I would say this is a must-read."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"I am a transplanted Cub fan living in LA and am forced to endure the antics of the Dodgers. With the exception of Vin Scully. the preeminent baseball announcer, I can truly say I loathe the Dodgers, yet I really enjoyed this book.It really plays out like a soap opera and I really like how the personalities involved get to tell their side of the story. I found it interesting to read about the early days of the LA Dodgers when Leo Durocher was undermining Walter Alston, the holdout of Drysdale and Koufax, the events leading up to Maury Wills being traded. I also enjoyed reading about the team of the 70's and how the players really felt about Steve Garvey. Some pretty juicy stuff is revealed throughout this book and the reader is privvy to all of it.

I've hated them since they left Brooklyn when I was 8 years old. It was like they ripped my favorite toy right out of my 8-year-old hand!

Quotes from Dodger players, opponents, coaches, managers, announcers, and reporters linked together to paint the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Its masterfully done. The quotes are range from informative to controversial to even incredibly comical. Its the good, the bad, and the incredibly ugly of the Dodgers. Its a fun read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"I have been a Dodger fan since 1955. While I lived in Southern California, I attended most home games. What surprised me was how little this book added to my knowledge about the team. Most sections just repeated in less detail what had been written in the Los Angeles Times, said in the television coverage at the time, or reported by Vin Scully on the radio.The book's main eye-opener is that Walter Alston, who seemed so quiet and gentlemanly in public, had such a terrific temper in private. He was fully capable of challenging players to a fight, and knocking down doors to make a point. I thought that those sections were the main reason to read the book for long-time fans.The key weakness of the book was that it emphasized the front office, managerial, and player squabbles. Every team has these, and they don't add very much to my enjoyment of baseball.On the important things, you simply don't get enough. Specialized books on Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, for example, provide much more and more interesting information than you will find here about the key events in their careers.What makes the Dodgers special are those moments when they rise to greatness as scrappers, and the book takes on many of those happy memories: Kirk Gibson's home run in the 1988 World Series, Maury Wills stealing every base that wasn't nailed down, Sandy Koufax pitching on two days rest to win the 1965 World Series, and Mike Marshall's iron arm in 1974. I would have liked longer sections on these parts of Dodger history.I was glad that the book looked at the moments when the fabled franchise faltered, such as with the Al Campanis interview on Nightline, the purchase by Fox and subsequent managerial merry-go-round, and the 1962 collapse. Recovery from such lows is an important part of a franchise's greatness.Having read this book, I'm still proud to be a Dodger fan, even though I'm not proud of everything the Dodgers have ever done. On the other hand, I will look forward to reading a better oral history of the team when someone writes it.For young fans of the Dodgers or people who don't know the team, this book will be a four or five star effort because more of this material will be new.After you read this book, I suggest that you think about what first attracted your interest to a baseball team. How did the team hold your interest after that? What does that tell you about yourself?Conduct yourself with grace and courage!"},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"This is a very enjoyable, very engaging book that is well-organized, well-written, and just plain fun.

It contains interview snipets with most of the big names in Los Angeles Dodgers history, but lacks the depth and insight a more sophisticated fan would require. From a sociological perspective, Delsohn missed one of the most important aspects of Dodger baseball from the 1970s- the presence of Glenn Burke, inventor of the &quot;High Five,&quot; who became baseball's first acknowledged homosexual, and the Rick Monday American flag rescuing incident. In addition, other Dodger stars are basically ignored if they were not in the middle of some major event."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"In 1958, I was ten-years-old and living in Los Angeles when the Dodgers hit town, and I've been a life-long fan ever since. So it was with great anticipation that I dove into \\"True Blue,\\" by Steve Delsohn, as it is sub-titled \\"The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It,\\" and I thought to myself, what could be better than hearing the inside scoop from the horse's mouth, so to speak? It was a question that was soon answered, and I also realized that as interesting as this book was, it simply wasn't the book I wanted it to be.Delsohn tells the story through the comments of those who were either a part of the organization at one time or another, or close to it in some regard, like the sportswriters who have covered the team since their move to L.A. Delsohn conducted 124 interviews in all, from which he gleaned the insights provided here. And while it's interesting to hear in their own words the reflections of such luminaries as Duke Snider, Maury Wills, Mike Marshall, Bill Buckner, Steve Garvey, Eric Karros and Tommy Lasorda, the bulk of the comments seem to come from the writers, like Dodger Historian Tot Holmes, ESPN correspondent Chris Mortensen, L.A. Times columnist Ross Newhan, Tim Kurkjian of ESPN's magazine, Mark Heisler of the \\"Times,\\" Richard Hoffer of Sports Illustrated and author Roger Kahn among others.All of which, again, makes for an interesting read, but what the book lacks is depth. Beginning with a brief background of Walter O'Malley's origins with the Brooklyn Dodgers and some insight into how and why the team ended up in Los Angeles, Delsohn then moves from 1958 on through the 2000 season, decade by decade. And it's a quick read that leaves you wanting for more. He touches upon the highlights of each era, especially the historic moments on the field and off, like the rise of Sandy Koufax into one of the premier pitchers in the game, to the unprecedented joint hold-out (the first in baseball history) by Koufax and Don Drysdale at the beginning of the 1966 season. He also chronicles the \`70s infield of Garvey, Lopes, Russell and Cey, who would stay together for eight seasons, keeping an existing infield intact longer than any other in history. Then there was the phenomenal Fernando Valenzuela and \\"Fernando mania\\" in 1981. The infamous Al Campanis affair, which erupted after the longtime General Manager of the Dodgers appeared on a segment of \\"Nightline\\" is covered as well. All the championships, the near misses and seasons that misfired altogether, the careers of managers Walt Alston and Tommy Lasorda and all the ups and downs of the team, including the tumultuous exit of Mike Piazza in 1998 are covered.Other elements, however, that are such a part of the Dodgers illustrious history are neglected, like the story of Hideo Nomo, who is mentioned only in passing. And while the interviews that make up this book do give a sense of intimacy to the story, it nevertheless leaves you with the feeling that there is so much more that hasn't been brought to light. So, as a historical document, \\"True Blue\\" comes up short, and in the final analysis it comes across as more of a coffee-table book; interesting enough to browse through from time to time, but ultimately unsatisfying."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"Because the saga of the Brooklyn Dodgers has long captivated authors, there's been a general reluctance to address the history of the team after Walter O'Malley broke the spirit of a city forever when he moved the team to Los Angeles. Books like Roger Kahn's &quot;The Boys Of Summer&quot; and Peter Golenbock's &quot;Bums&quot; convey the feeling that the story of the Dodgers ended so unhappily with the move to LA that why would you want to read about what happened next.Steve Delsohn's &quot;True Blue&quot; rectifies the absence of significant books about the history of the LA Dodgers by using the oral history approach Golenbock used for &quot;Bums.&quot; The end result is a generally fascinating overview of the team's history from a wide variety of players, coaches, writers etc. Delsohn only uses those he actually interviewed, avoiding the technique used by Golenbock of borrowing older quotes from those who are now dead to fill in other gaps of the story.The book succeeds in conveying the general story of the team since it came to LA, especially in detailing the behind-the-scenes struggles of the team (the uneasiness caused by Leo Durocher's presence as a coach during the early 60s, the question of whether Walter Alston was forced out after 1976, the more turbulent problems since the sale to Fox). If you want to know the behind-the-scenes history of the team, you will be impressed. If you want some indepth attention given to the significant games that took place in LA Dodger history, then that's where you're going to be in for a letdown, because there is almost little or no discussion of the major games of the historic seasons and the postseason games except in the most cursory fashion. This is what keeps the book from five stars to me."},{"Title":"True Blue: The Dramatic History of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"I love the Dodgers, and have been a fan all my life.

They're both exceptionally handsome, of course, but Billy is young and adventuresome, while Hal is older and more conservative. Their divergent natures lead to a breakup, as they explore relationships with others. The novel starts off with some promise, and there are occasional flashes of good writing, but there is much evidence of haste too. Things wrap up too quickly and too neatly. And the lead characters are, despite their beauty, a couple of dullards. It's the lovesick bartender Frank who is far more interesting, and Larkin, in a infuriating move, has Hal dump him rather unceremoniously. I was about ready to toss the book down at that point.Still, one must appreciate Alyson's efforts in those days to provide positive pop fiction for gay men. For collectors of gay pulp, this, like most of the Alyson titles from that period, is worth looking for."},{"Title":"Portrait of the Soviet Union","review":"Most interesting are Maclean's observations from trips in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Georgia. Supporting his perceptions is an overall history of Russia and the Soviet Union plus brief regional histories. Very valuable are Maclean's personal notes on the changes during his 50 years traveling in the country. The book's concluding chapter delves into the USSR of 1987; how people actually live, differences in society, and the economic system smoothly moving towards western capitalism. Unfortunately, many run-on and flowery sentences in the early chapters do detract from the content."},{"Title":"Portrait of the Soviet Union","review":"Before i had read this account of the evolution of Russian culture i was only midly interested in this country. But now i am totally captivated and i feel this book has opened my eyes to a culture that i never dreamed existed. a must reed for any history buff, past or future traveller, or any person event mildly interested in the subject.

While I like the array of articles, I believe the reader is really outdated. Many of the articles are circa 90s and I don't always care for the essays' position towards men (which occasionally borders on man-hating). As a student and educator, I understand the need to explore the patriarchal system (as well as the possible implications and consequences of such a structure), but a collection of essays that continually depicts men in a negative light disenfranchises men from the issue of gender. So, I've chosen to supplement this book (for my course) with some essays that are more to date, as well as essays that explore the effects of rigid gender roles on *both* females and males. However, I think the introduction to this reader is excellent, the reader has essays that deal with international gender issues (which is great), the readings are short and easy to comprehend (good for students), and the list of contributors (with a few exceptions) first-class. I gave it three stars because it can't stand on its own (too outdated), but if you're willing to supplement it, it could be a good classroom asset."},{"Title":"Issues of Gender (A Longman Topics Reader)","review":"This was used in a Gender Studies course I took. Most of it goes back to the 1990s, and some of the issues in it are not as relevant now, or have changed somehow. However, it does discuss a lot broad issues that are relevant in any era."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Along with Shamus Culhane's &quot;Talking Animals and Other People,&quot; the best book on the history of the HOLLYWOOD CARTOON (OK, ok--Fleischer was in New York--and Miami--but you get the idea). The book returns to Disney again and again as the standard (not the axis) of how these films were made and marketed. One of the best things about this book is something a lot of books seem to talk about, but few show as clearly: Disney's genius was the idea that CHARACTER and PERSONALITY go a lot further than slapstick, no matter how good. It's almost taken for granted nowadays--but the very idea was revolutionary at the time. Someone else may have eventually figured this out (and silence those who call this book &quot;Disney-centric&quot;), but Disney's was THE place to be in the early days of cartoon animation. I wish Mike Barrier would provide a companion book with illustrations cross referenced with this current book. And who's to say it's not in the works... (btw, stay away from Stephen Kanter's &quot;Serious Business,&quot; another book on animation. Riddled with historic and contemporary innaccuracies, it's quite silly altogether...)"},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Books on the history of animation, especially the early ones, tend to fall into the trap of Disney-worshipping, which Barrier thankfully avoids. However, in his zeal to prove he is not Disney's lap dog, he unfairly bashes some of the studio's features (including one I consider on a par with the best of them, &quot;Lady and the Tramp.&quot;) He gives the same slash-and-burn treatment to the Warner Bros. studio--Clampett, in his view, was apparently nothing more than a second-rate hack, when Clampett in fact hit a period of sheer brilliance in the early to mid forties. &quot;Book Revue&quot;, &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot;, &quot;The Old Grey Hare&quot; and &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot; were all Clampett creations, and occupy many of the top slots in Jerry Beck's book &quot;The Fifty Greatest Cartoons Ever.&quot; Barrier dismisses them all, as well as Clampett's abilities as a draftsman. I would say he is partial to Jones in his longtime feud with Clampett, but Jones falls victim as well. Still, it is worth reading if you like behind-the-scenes stories of the animation industry."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"This book is about as good as the other reviews above indicate, including the comment about the prosaic prose.However it is by no means a complete or definitive coverage. The book is mainly about drawing and only covers business aspects, industry politics, and personalities related to drawing.Barrier has little to say about music, specifically the extraordinary work of Carl Stallings, or about characterization, voice, or plotting. Indeed he appears to be more or less uninterested in content.At least 70% of the book is on Disney and an astonishingly small space is given to the great WB years. Both are disproportionate.Although Barrier discusses the technicalities of drawing at great length, he barely scratches the surface of aesthetics. In particular he never once considers the most disfiguring aspect of Disney's work. The basis of the entire Disney project was simulated emotion, i.e. kitsch. Barrier never comes anywhere near discussing this issue properly."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"This book is very interesting, but very heavy in Disney information. The author describes a selection of cartoons from various studios and the relevance of each. I got the book for an overall history, but it is really Disney-centric. It does mention other studios of the time, but not is such detail. If you want Disney history and descriptions of their cartoons, this is a great book. If you want overall animation history, I would go somewhere else."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"I made a comment once, on some forum ages ago, that Mike Barrier's HOLLYWOOD CARTOONS is a book best appreciated once you've grown up. A lot of animation's most ardent admirers don't fit that criteria, unfortunately, and it's given this book a bit of a stigma. \\"Stuffed shirt\\", \\"fun-sucking leech\\", \\"hates everything\\", \\"hair-brained\\", etc. al. There's a slight degree of truth to that: a lot of stuff is panned, fairly mercilessly. The problem is though, these arguments, as are Barrier's, are completely subjective. There is no \\"right\\" answer.Make no mistake - this is probably the best written book on the subject out there.A lot of people have misinterpreted this as a general history of the Golden Age of animation. It is not. It's a history of CHARACTER animation. That is, the kind of work that goes beyond mere drawings in motion and takes on a life of itself, through compelling direction and acting. By this criteria, the heaviest focus of this book (Disney, Warner Bros., Tex Avery-era MGM, early UPA) is appropriate. While I would one day love to read or write proper tomes on the histories of Walter Lantz, Paul Terry, Famous Studios, and Screen Gems/Columbia, let's be honest: not a lot of character animation happened there.If it seems like he hates a great deal of cartoons, it's because he's more people-focused than individual film-focused like Leonard Maltin is. The films he likes and praises best are the ones that serve to build up the individuals he's writing about. If he were to lavish praise on all the films, it would be at the expense of the very best of Walt Disney (SNOW WHITE, WHO KILLED COCK ROBIN?, DUMBO), Chuck Jones (FRESH AIREDALE, LONG-HAIRED HARE, FAST AND FURRY-OUS, DUCK AMUCK), Tex Avery (NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE, SLAPHAPPY LION, KING-SIZE CANARY, LITTLE RURAL RIDING HOOD, or Bob Clampett (GREAT PIGGY BANK ROBBERY, BOOK REVUE, COAL BLACK) .The giant flaw with this book, though, is when Barrier's taste gets in the way of giving proper coverage. He is a guy who doesn't care for \\"quirks\\", or the tendency of a filmmaker to use imperfections as advantages to a style, and therefore some seriously brilliant films get the shaft. To his credit, there are only two I can see plainly.The biggest offense was his coverage of the Fleischer Studio, compressing its own Golden Age (the dawn of sound to the late 1930s Popeye cartoons) into a mere twelve pages, mostly complaining about how accidentally brilliant the Talkartoos and Betty Boops are and how even timing ruined Popeye as a character. Barrier once told me he hadn't seen many Fleischer cartoons at all even by the late 1970s, when he and co-author Milt Gray were deep into their interviewing of animation veterans. That's a little puzzling, given many less esteemed people saw those cartoons on a daily basis in the same era, and I would have to say there is a definite prejudice against the NY animation studios in Barrier's writing. There are numerous flaws in a great many of the Fleischer cartoons, absolutely, but surely anyone open-minded enough would walk away with more positive things to say about them than this. I guess that's to be expected with a book entitled HOLLYWOOD CARTOONS.He doesn't have much to say about Frank Tashlin, one of the most individualistic of all film directors, either. In spite of him stating that Tashlin was the first to utilize a compelling Daffy Duck and that Tashlin's are alone equal to Bob Clampett's among the early 40s Warner shorts , he doesn't have much to write about him - only in relation to Clampett. (God only knows why he praises Clampett in spite of _his _quirks.)That's a lot to gripe about, so why did I rate this book five stars? It's because it's an absolutely great book in spite of my very active, pronounced reservations. It actually made me think about these cartoons in new ways I hadn't before. His writing reaffirmed my own thoughts, and caused me to reassess my own opinions when mine differed from his. There's more information in his endnotes than there are in all of these fly-by-nite history books put together.If you want to know about the filmmakers beyond the laughs, this a must-have. Buy it if you haven't, now. And grow up."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"I bought this book on a whim and regretted it as I walked out of the shop, after all it was 25 and I'd already got the excellent &quot;Of Mice &amp; Magic&quot; by Leonard Maltin. However once I started reading I found that this was a corker of a book. Mr Barrier has researched it very carefully and it is full of stories and vignettes that paint a remarkably colourful picture of life in the 1920s to 1950s when these cartoons were made. It's strongest feature over the Maltin book is that it deals with the story in a roughly chronological way so you get the feel of people moving around the industry in waves and often circles too. The odd thing is that at 600 pages it's too short! I get the feeling that there is a lot more interesting stuff to be told that there just wasn't room for but what is there is an excellent read. This deserves a place on any book shelf that supports good animation books."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Beautiful, complete, if Disney-centric (but then again, that's the reality, isn't it?) epic of the much-maligned and still underappreciated Hollywood animated cartoon. Barrier leaves no stone unturned in this definitive scholarly thesis on his subject, as well he shouldn't: this thing has been in the works--on and off--for almost two decades. (Only one minor quibble: not enough stuff on the Jones-Clampett feud and other non-Disney political issues.) Animation scholars rejoice!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Michael Barrier's \\"Hollywood Cartoons\\" is impeccably researched and intellectually sophisticated; a milestone in its way, it also poses a few problems, one being the inescapable conclusion that the golden age of Hollywood scarcely existed at all. Mr. Barrier casts a baleful eye on some of animation's finest: Chuck Jones' \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" is 'an empty triumph'; \\"Fantasia\\", hopelessly puerile and retrograde; \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", recently chosen for preservation by the Library of Congress, 'a total flop'. Even \\"Pinocchio\\" inspires more vitriol than praise (too much airbrush, poor planning and characterizations - Disney 'took the guts out of it', etc...) Can't these guys do anything right? Terrytoons are characterized by 'pervasive squalor', and he assures us UPA, once the shining avatar of cutting-edge animation, could be as dull, insipid and uninspired as any other studio. That's good to know. It should come as no surprise that Mr. Barrier feels a special affinity for Disney's Grumpy (Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs) though this he attributes to Bill Tytla's masterful character animation. Hubley's \\"Rooty Toot Toot\\" also receives the Barrier seal of approval. But, in general, there are few pearls to be found among the prevailing dross. There's no question Barrier takes his subject seriously...perhaps, too seriously. Lighten up...they're just cartoons!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"The book arrived in a very good condition and the price was very good but the delivery time was too long. If you live in USA this must be a very good seller, but for international purchase (like mine), only choose this seller if you not in a hurry to get the book."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Covering much of the same ground as Leonard Maltin's Of Mice and Magic, Hollywood Cartoons is packed with interesting insights and comments from both the author and those that participated in the creation of an American art form. Michael Barrier's exhaustively researched book covers the Golden Age of Hollywood animation and the movers and shakers that had an impact on the art form.At nearly 650 pages Barrier's book takes a fair balanced look at Disney, Warner Bros., Fleischer and other contributors to this dying art form. It's actually a perfect companion piece to the newely released boxed set of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes classics. Barrier avoids the Disney worship that marred other books of this type and, like Maltin's marvelous but less indepth book, he manages to point out the key contributions of the most important animation directors/producers of the era.While it does overlook or give only a cursory overview of some important figures in the industry, Barrier's scholarly aproach manages to recognize the merits and flaws of each studio, their system and directors. Although not as well illustrated as Maltin's book, the pictures do provide a glimpse of many of the essential classics that impacted the art of animation. Since much of the documentation for the creation of some of the early Warner classics are long gone, Barrier has to rely on many of the same sources and pictures as other authors. The book could have been improved if he had gone more to private collectors for rare animation cels, production photos, model drawings and notes. I also would have liked many of these illustrations to be reproduced in color. Seeing them in dark black and white illustrations does little justice to the artistry of these pioneers.Maltin's book was clearly the work of an informed fan; his approach focused on the creation of many of the important classics but didn't lose track of the fun in the finished product. Barrier's scholarly approach is a bit drier and doesn't quite communicate the excited of Maltin's less authoriative book on the same subject. It's still an important look at the pioneers of animation's Golden Age and, as such, should be read by those who love the shorts from the various eras examined here."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"This book is a marvelous achievement but I'm not sure its title is appropriate. Barrier is concerned with charting the development of excellence, and as such his perspective appears to be &quot;hats off to Disney, kudos to Warner Brothers and Tex Avery, and polite nods to everybody else&quot;. The ranking is unexceptionable, and the coverage of Disney and Warners' is rich and incisive. But surely a survey of &quot;Hollywood Cartoons&quot; would ideally have more than a few pages each on Terrytoons, Walter Lantz, Popeye and Betty Boop. Especially the latter three, while obviously not pinnacles of the art, have more than their share of moments worth examination, which a book honing so closely to linear development must leave aside. Obviously a book giving more equal coverage to the well-loved also-rans would be an intimidating doorstop, but one almost wishes Barrier had written one book on Disney and another on the other cartoons. However, Barrier is a sterling scholar and analyst; I repeatedly found myself first shaken by his criticisms of cartoons I have long held sacrosanct, only to usually agree with him in the end."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"As an animator with more than a mild interest in the subject, I found the book to go beyond the history. It's the first book about animation to really delve into the ART of the medium. We see how the inventors of the medium are overtaken by the artists who are overtaken by the financiers. It's a magnificent book with absolute precision in its source material backed up by more than the usual number of interviews. It's not another promotional book for ANY studio. The coverage of Disney is greater because the focus is on the period when Disney built the medium. Anyone interested in the medium should read this."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"This was a very good book, with a few caveats.The first chapter, on silent cartoons, is hard going. Not until Walt Disney shows up does that chapter start flowing.BUT from that point on, until the chapter on UPA, I had a hard time putting &quot;Hollywood Cartoons&quot; down. Barrier doesn't take the usual perspective on cartoons. He doesn't care how they appeal to the casual viewer but how they look to the pro. I didn't agree with all his judgments, but I respect his judgments.I have read several histories of cartoons, and Barrier still managed to surprise me or say something new. He had the best discussion of the origins of Bugs Bunny I've ever read. His description of the working of MGM's cartoon studio was fascinating, and his views on Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones showed real insight.Barrier states his opinions strongly. He doesn't like Fleischer or UPA cartoons, and he doesn't think Friz Freleng is worth a lot of discussion. (I would disagree about Friz, but agree on the other stuff.)In all, this was a fine book on this subject, and I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"As some of the previous reviews have stated, Barrier obviously feels that Disney was the most important thing to ever happen to animation. While that may be true, I would have liked to have seen a bit more coverage of the other studios. That being said, this is a great work which seems to present an objective view of all the big names in animation's golden age. Despite his focus on Disney, the author in no way glosses over his mistakes and personality faults. The one serious problem I have though, is the lack of pictures. There are many references to character design, layout, etc. which certainly call for an illustration. The absence of visual aids in a book about animation sticks out like a sore thumb. The one other complaint I have is the lack of a glossary. While someone knowledgeable in animation may have understood the more technical terms, there were several things talked about throughout the book which I didn't really have a good grasp on. I may have just missed the definitions in the text, but a glossary would certainly have been helpful. The inclusion of these two missing peices would have made this a five star book. As it is, I'll never be able to watch cartoons again without thinking a bit about the technical aspect."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Barrier's book meticulously traces the rise and fall of the medium sarting in its infancy and taking us up to the present... there are many gaps along the way; he obviously had access to practically everything in the Disney archives and has a fondness for the Warner Brothers' shorts, but the lesser-known studios whose remains have all but disapperared over the years aren't dealt with with the same indepth. The book is more like a series of individul essays and is not the definitive history, which still has yet to be written, but this is an ambitious attempt by a very knowledgeable writer. If you are REALLY into cartoons, then this is a must-read.-John Hayes"},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"I read somewhere recently that Michael Barrier worked on this book for almost thirty years, and I believe it. It is an awesomely complete, well documented, reader-friendly history, and Barrier clearly understands what makes animation works for audiences. He even references the writings of acting master theorist Constantin Stanlisvski! If you're interested in animation history, or even American history, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Barrier gets about as close to the subject matter as possible. I enjoyed his FunnyWorld publication in the 1970's and he still does a fascinating job of getting to the details of the great animators in an easy to read style."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Although published a decade and a half after Leonard Maltin's \\"Of Mice And Magic\\", Barrier began researching his book a full decade or so before, resulting in a very different take on the Hollywood animation industry. While Maltin focuses on the cartoons themselves first and the makers second, Barrier digs deep into the studio histories, providing detailed information on the 1937 Fleischer and '41 Disney strikes, the petty competitions between animators, the frequent layoffs that occurred when the studio moguls kept changing their minds about short film production, the troubles of adapting to television production and how an artist like Rod Scribner could expand his talent for emotional, rubbery animation with the encouragement of a flamboyant Robert Clampett and be suppressed by a more conservative, detail-oriented Robert McKimson. Although Barrier's view of each artist is unbiased, it is clear that personality clashes had an effect on what ended up on screen.Ignoring George Pal and Ray Harryhausen in order to focus exclusively on cel-animation and emphasizing Hollywood studios over the New York ones (though Fleischer, Terry and Van Beuran get some coverage), Barrier presents a darker, more intense, portrait of Disney, Warner and UPA than Maltin would dare to. He is quite brutal in analyzing such cherished works like \\"What's Opera Doc\\" (which has made a few animation buffs angry), but provides one of the best essays on \\"Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs\\" available to date. The opinions are quite strong here, but the observations are quite provocative. He's especially observant on how the films represent the confidence level of their makers. I now understand why some of Art Davis' late '40s cartoons for WB are very funny and others flops; a lot depended on writers like Bill Scott and Lloyd Turner, who (like Davis himself) were constantly at the mercy of studio lay-offs.Although he gives a very breezy summary of the post-Walt Disney years, the primary story ends with Walt's death in 1966 and his pre-occupation with theme parks during his later years. Hanna-Barbera and De Patie-Freleng don't fare well here, as in Maltin's book. There is a certain disgust with the declining theatrical cartoons of the later fifties and sixties; but he does find space to examine Terrytoons' Sidney Elephant and some clever work by Jim Tyer.I would suggest those new to animation history to read Maltin's book first. His style is more easy-going and much more descriptive of individual cartoons. Barrier's book is written for those who want to know what it was like to work at the cartoon factories prior to the television age. Some readers may find him a bit too wordy and passionate in his criticisms for their tastes."},{"Title":"Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age","review":"Beautiful, complete, if Disney-centric (but then again, that's the reality, isn't it?) epic of the much-maligned and still underappreciated Hollywood animated cartoon.

A few months later, he looked about in consternation, and remarked that he thought casual day had gone too far (I have my own opinions on this, considering most people had not in fact become very casual at all, and charity requires me to refrain from commenting upon what I think was really at issue). Shortly after this exchange, one of my book clubs offered 'Casual Day Has Gone Too Far', a collection of Dilbert cartoons, which had become the object of break-room bulletin boards and interoffice memo attachments around the country.The book has a brief introduction (Scott Adams recounts in it that he felt cheated once upon buying a buying guide which had no introduction, hence, he felt required to include one), which includes email instructions for subscribing to the online Dilbert newsletter, which is published 'whenever I feel like it', according to Adams.Then, of course, we jump immediately into 'the good stuff', the columns.The sociology, psychology, and even the sex appeal of Dilbert -- all of these have been variously explained and lauded or decried in other places, so I shall not go into detail here, save to say that there is something very true about the representations found in this small column that resonates with anyone in any way familiar with corporate America. Of one political satire in Britain, a columnist once commented that with regard to its reflection of reality, that 'reality is twice as true but half as funny' -- this dictum can likewise be applied to Dilbert.The first column starts out with Dogbert explaining leadership.(Fair warning -- how does one adequately describe a cartoon column in words, without pictures? Forgive me if this analysis becomes something less than the actual columns.)Dogbert explains that leaders start their careers as morons, drawn to meetings like moths to porchlights, with a high bladder-to-brain ratio (which makes enduring meetings easier on both counts), and they succeed because, being untempted by logic or coffee, they continue along the path of promotion until the reach their true skill level (often, that of recognising others, underlings all, with true ability) -- and Dogbert's conclusion is that leadership is the way of removing morons from the productive flow.Adams' wit is scathing, unmerciful, and has no 'sacred cows'. He parodies all levels of the production chain, from the lowest to the highest, often showing the inverse relation of skill to responsibility, authority to intelligence, productivity to reward. He demonstrates the imperviousness of all levels of the corporation to logic. He likes to invent corporate-based 'lingo' which, if it appeared in an actual memo (and some of this actually does appear in the real world) it would most likely be taken seriously.With regard to casual days, this has been seen as the evil plot of HR Director Catbert. Alice determines that 'it's just another sadistic human resources plot to make people quit.' Others decided that they loved casual Friday, because 'it combines unattractive with unprofessional while diminishing neither.'Finally, Dilbert shows the golden road to visibility in the large anonymous corporate structure.Dilbert: I significantly increased my visibility at work today, Dogbert. Yesterday I was invisible to my management. But today I am known by all.Dogbert: You screwed up, huh?Dilbert: Ooh yeah. Big time.And so it goes. Perhaps it is not only casual day that has gone too far."},{"Title":"Casual Day Has Gone Too Far","review":"In this book, Catbert makes his first appearance as HR director of Dilbert's company. His casual day policy is insane, and so, casual day will always be a strange day. Dilbert knows the feeling of going to work on a casual day, and wondering &quot;Has it gone too far?&quot; Besides the histerical Catbert jokes, there's jokes on company takeovers, futile projects, team building excersises, and much more! So join corporate America's truly relatable office crew in these insane misadventures of white collar workplace life."},{"Title":"Casual Day Has Gone Too Far","review":"How would Dogbert review &quot;Casual Day Has Gone Too Far&quot;, the ninth Dilbert collection?

And Scott Adams should pay *me* for writing this review.&quot;Casual Day Has Gone Too Far&quot; starts out with Dogbert's explanation of Leadership (immunity to logic and coffee). His handy reference guide to types of bosses follows a few pages later. This book also introduces a new character - Tina the brittle technical writer. It includes one of my personal favorites - the public apology for selling a keyboard missing the letter 'Q'.

Pretzels Litzenberg, the star pitcher of the Chicks comes up with a dead arm and the team begins to sink. In desperation, Chicks manager Popoff Pendergast sends Pretzels on a scouting trip to the rural areas in search of talent. Pretzels encounters Dave King a 17-year-old boy who never misses a pitch when he swings. Unfortunately, he is unable to hit the ball fair so when he makes it to the major leagues he fouls off all strikes and walks every time. He is so good at what he does that he walks hundreds of times in succession.The opposition is so desperate that eventually they place all of their defensive players on the sidelines and they dash into foul territory when the ball is pitched. Eventually, Dave manages to hit a home run to win a crucial game and he finally believes that he is a true hitter. Throw in a pet rooster, silly poetry spouted by Pretzels, a love interest in Dave's sister Luella, a miracle home remedy liniment and a great deal of humorous prose and this book is one of the most amusing sports fiction books ever written. While the story is as corny as possible, the relentless humor keeps you smiling from the first to the last page."},{"Title":"The Kid Who Batted 1.000","review":"I was talking with my son who is now the same age as I was when I read this (35 years ago). He just read a book called the kid who only hit homers and we got to discussing this (I don't think there's any connection other than similar titles) and how much I loved this.

Homes, Appendix A: An Elaboration on the Novel The End of Alice (Artspace, 1996)What an odd little book this is. The End of Alice is Homes' magnum opus, a tale of Hannibal Lecter as written by Franz Kafka, Jack the Ripper addressed by John Dryden. Appendix A consists of a confession, a number of photographic pieces of evidence, and copies of a few of the letters referenced in the book but never shown. Having it is not a necessity for enjoying The End of Alice, but it does without doubt add some atmosphere to the hijinks therein. From the other side of the coin, though, it's quite doubtful that anyone who hasn't read The End of Alice is going to get anything out of this at all. Thus, start there; while, or just after, hunt down a copy of this. ****"},{"Title":"A.M. Homes: Appendix A","review":"Well... I LOVED the End of Alice and I thought that ordering this would be some further establishment of the book's criminal genius. I'm sorry to say that I was slightly wrong.It seems more like Homes wrote this outrageously provacative story and then tried to retract it like she's Chaucer or somebody. It actually took some of the magic out off the original story for me.As a student of psychology, I tend to enjoy sick things, especially when there is no sound explaination to their origin. For me, Poe said it best: \\"Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence -- whether much that is glorious -- whether all that is profound -- does not spring from disease of thought -- from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.\\"Anyway, I wouldn't buy this for $12 twice or if I realized how tiny it was going to be (61 relevant pages put together like a child's book of bedtime stories even though I do get the irony). Maybe if the price were cut in half and maybe if it further expounded on Homes' original sick genius instead of trying to make up for it.And I'm also not saying that this isn't something worth buying... I just like having the physical images and the rest of the story left up to my imagination."},{"Title":"Across the plains,: With other memories and essays, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"What a collection of little gems. Robert Louis Stevenson is justly remembered for novels like Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but he was also a master of the essay. These dozen short works are a delight. Whether taking us on a transcontinental railroad journey, introducing us to the artists' colony of Fontainebleau (\\"The art of words and not a desire to publish new discoveries, the love of form and not a novel reading of historical events, mark the vocation of the writer and the painter.\\"), or meditating on man's place in the universe, Stevenson combines lyrical, descriptive prose with a keen eye for detail. He can rhapsodize about nature, and then skewer man's cruelty or hypocrisy. It makes for writing you'll want to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The Film Editing Room Handbook, Third Edition: How to Manage the Near Chaos of the Cutting Room","review":"This is a very comprehensive overview of all the details that a prospective assistant editor should be aware of.But the field of digital editing has changed tremendously since the book was last updated in 1999, and I found the sections on digital editing dated to the point of being useless.Hopefully the author will update the book soon to include current processes for telecine and handling digital film and audio sources."},{"Title":"The Film Editing Room Handbook, Third Edition: How to Manage the Near Chaos of the Cutting Room","review":"If you want a book that takes you through EVERY procedural aspect of assisting (film or NLE) then this is probably the book for you.One drawback is that it might not be as specific as you may like, as it caters for Film, AVID, Lightworks... and it won't tell you which buttons to press.

A sharp mind with a taste for danger, she needs work and action. Knowing her for twenty-four years and seeing her so eager to get back to work, Brom brings her into the case. Ted Yewbanks, now widowed and living alone, needs a housekeeper, and what better person than Hannah to take the job?Then in the mid of her investigations Brom dies for no apparent reasons. Stunned, Hannah realizes his death resembles that of Jania's. Something strange and evil is working its way into this small community. During the last few months there have been other unexplained, naturally caused deaths and this fact hasn't escaped Hannah's sharp eyes. Are they all murders? Soon a pattern begins to emerge, and an innocuous-looking gift advertising ad in a woman's magazine seems to be at the heart of these demises.The characterization in this mystery really stands out. The minor characters are as complex, interesting, and carefully drawn as the main ones. With an excellent understanding of human behavior and motivations, this author has succeeded in creating a deftly crafted, classic suspenseful mystery that will keep you submerged from beginning to end. The climax made my heart race. Hannah is certainly a character with her no-nonsense, practical, tough yet sensitive and compassionate approach to life and I look forward to reading more of her future adventures in the second book for these series."},{"Title":"Death on Delivery","review":"This book had me grabbed by the second page! I love all the characters but especially Hannah!The mystery plot was original and fun and the story has plenty of twists and turns.I hope this turns into a series because I would like to get to know these people better."},{"Title":"Death on Delivery","review":"Hannah Claire, a grannie-from-hell detective, is at the heart of Anne K. Edwards' terrific mystery, Death on Delivery, and if you don't love Hannah, you don't have a heart. First, a disclaimer. As a fellow mystery author (Death Game) who likes a little sex, some violence and 300-mph-action, I don't like modern \\"cozies.\\" I find them unbearably unrealistic and so sweet they set my teeth on edge.But Death on Delivery isn't really a cozy. Instead, it hearkens back to the good old days when Agatha Christie's freakish imagination and gentle wryness were lighting up the British book scene. Edwards' story is not saccharine; it is black, psychologically astute comedy. Death on Delivery is the type of book you don't read so much because you believe what is happening, but because of the author's dead-on understanding of human nature.The story begins when greedy Jania Yewbanks gets her death \\"ordered up and delivered,\\" by her disgustingly self-righteous husband. Rid of a nasty woman whose death is \\"delivered\\" in a way that lets him off the hook, the husband figures he's now on easy street.But Hannah is on the case--and it's pretty clear from the start that Hannah always gets her man. No spoilers in this review, you'll have to read the book for yourself. But a number of entertaining sub-plots intertwine which keeps the surprises coming. The story finishes strong--with Hannah Claire proving she sleuth with the best out there in detectivedom.Like Agatha Christie once did, Edwards takes a lot of chances with Death on Delivery, such as letting readers in on whodunit on the second page. The next 300 pages are crowded with outcasts--eccentrics, lovelorn old maids, criminals, scoundrels: you'll recognize your entire family before it's done.The best part is that Edwards' wit and wisdom helps us laugh at those who drive us nuts on a daily basis. A convenient catharsis for those days when (tell the truth, now) we all are wondering how we could order up our own: Death on Delivery.Cheryl Swanson, author Death Game [..]Reviewer with Gotta Read, [..]"},{"Title":"Death on Delivery","review":"Hannah Clare is the widow. Her husband was a partner in Brom Investigations. Hannah finds that she can't sit at home, and she becomes involved with helping the agency.Going undercover, Hannah is hired to keep house for Ted Yewbanks, the husband of a local socialite, Jania, who was found dead of \\"natural causes\\". Jania's sister hires the Brom's agency to investigate. She suspects brother-in-law was responsible.When Brom dies suddenly under suspicious circumstances, Hannah knows there's more to the mystery than meets the eye.Edwards' cast of characters is diverse. She finds character flaws in the best of them, making them human and believable. Hannah Clare is more than a middle aged, smoking, grandmother, she is practical and smart.The story Edwards weaves is complex and held this reader's full attention well past the discovery of the last body, to the last word.I'm happy to say that Death On Delivery is the first of Hannah's adventures. I'll be looking forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"Charlie Carrillo: Tradition and Soul / Tradicin y Alma (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"If you are into southwestern folk art, specifically from New Mexico, than this book belongs in your library. Do not be put off by the title being in Spanish as the text is in English, with the exception of a bilingual section. The works of master santero,(one makes saints, usually in wood) Charlie Carillo are featured throughout the book that is is in full color. The text is quite interesting as the subject of santero is explored in both a historical and contemporary context. The text does include Spanish but is limited to the foreward. The tradition of the santero is thus examined and brought into the current state. There is also a discussion of related subjects like the Penitentes, which is a Roman Catholic Brotherhood dating back to the 1700's in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado. Included in the printed word is a concise glossary that provides defintions to the terms used that includes materials used etc. to create the santos and retablos(flat wood panel paintings). Of particular interest is the section that introduces the reader to the santos. This includes short &quot;bios&quot; on the santos and their particular role in the life and religious drama. This is extremely important to understand, in order to see the signifince of these figures for which the artist has toiled for hours to create and &quot;bring to life.&quot; The feast day of celebration is given as well for all of the saints &quot;bios.&quot; There is also an extensive bibliography, information on New Mexican Hispanic Culture and personal awards and achievements given to Charlie Carillo for his works(some 3,500 pieces as of the books printing) as well as a list of exhibits that have featured his works. Carillo also shares some interesting stories related to the pieces featured which includes the inspiration to the creatve process. Although the written word is extremely interesting the color photographs of the three dimensional santos and flat retablos are fantastic. Sometimes there are two or three different related pieces on a page but this does detract from the fine details given each piece. An artist, like any other person in their respective field of interest should be an evolving person that gets better with age. Some his earlier works, which are featured from the late 70's are rudimentary compared to his exquisitely detailed labors of love made more recently. The various phases of his evolving artistry is outlined and displayed. These are some of the most inspirational works you will ever see from an exceptionally talented folk artist. Great stuff to browse through whenever, this is a book for anyone interested in folk art or who may be a woodcarver themself. Highly recommended for the collector of books related to the arts of New Mexcio."},{"Title":"Charlie Carrillo: Tradition and Soul / Tradicin y Alma (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"excellent numerous color illustrations very informative narrative both about the subject of santero and bultos but the very talented artist and what moved his creations"},{"Title":"Only Twice I've Wished for Heaven","review":"Dawn Turner Trice tells the story of Tempestt Rosa Saville.

The other characters, Alfred Mayes, Judd, Fat Daddy, Chittlin', Hump, Reatha Mae, Felicia, Thomas, Aunt Jennie and Ms. Lily were definitely characters and left nothing to the imagination. However, I must say that I expected more drama from reading the jacket cover. Certain portions were not explored and left this reader asking questions. For example, Temmy's friend Gerald saying he had a secret about her father but it was never revealed and Temmy's father ignoring her while he was talking with one of his students. These two incidents were never explained and it left the reader wondering. Some of the happenings in the book were predictable-City Hall's actions and Valeries' secret.

The book was set in the mid 1970s. The main character, Tempestt an 11 year old girl and her family are given a chance of a lifetime, to move on up to Lakeland. Lakeland was a one square mile of nice apartment towers and green lawns where the Black elite live sheltered from the ghetto by an ivy covered wrought iron fence. They have been living in a dirty neighborhood all her life. Once they moved to Lakeland Tempestt had disliked the neighborhood. So soon she escaped the fence that separates Lakeland and 35th street. Moving into a new place might be kond of hard and uncomfortable. On 35th street Tempestt meets Ms. Jonetta Goode, who knows everyone's stories, and her own history is long and dark as 35 th street itself. This street leads Tempestt into a dangerous path where she witnessed the death of her friend Valerie, and the cause of the arrest of a preacher.I recommend this book to people because it's an interesting book to read and lets you look at a young girls life and how she starts a chain of events on 35th street. It is a good book and makes you want to read more and makes you think what would happen next. But what I didn't like about it was that it was mostly focused in one place, 35th street.

Lakeland represents where Chicago's &quot;up and coming and just arrived&quot; black folks live. Just across the gate however, is 35th Street which is a neighborhood that is the complete opposite of Lakeland. Seperating the 2 communities is a fence however that fence does not prevent Tempest from exploring all that life has to offer on the other side of the gate, good and bad.Tempest periodically ventures over the gate and onto the infamous 35th street where she is introduced to a wonderful, powerful, soulful and rich cast of characters. She is also esposed to the tragedies of life including, but not limited to, drug addiction, prostitution and suicide. Although her father moves the family to the Lakeland community so they could have a better life, Tempest learns most of her lessons when she is on 35th street.The novel is told from the wonderful perspective of both a 12 year old child and a 50 something year old adult who come to love and depend on each other as the novel progresses.The writing in this novel was absolutely exquisite. However, I think the fact the the reader knew what was going to happen to the other young character, Valerie, from the outset of the novel, made the story incredibly touching and sad."},{"Title":"Only Twice I've Wished for Heaven","review":"&quot;Only twice I've wished for heaven&quot; is a superb first effort by Ms. Trice.

Thankfully, this is not another &quot;McMillan look-alike.&quot;We are getting a fresh and real life story. The setting is Chicago but it is the essence of so many neighborhoods in so many cities. She accutely captures the mindset of African-Americans setting themselves apart in the name of upward mobility and those of the people on the other side of the fence. To tell the story in two voices, representing both sides is a good touch. The reader will be drawn into the lives of the main characters, Tempestt and Ms Johnetta and see their worlds through their eyes.Don't blame me if you stay up all night just to finish this book. Just have a few extra cups of coffee at work."},{"Title":"Only Twice I've Wished for Heaven","review":"It is not often that a book moves me to tears.

If you are looking for an understandable book on strategy that can be applied to business, I would highly recommend reading Sun Tzu's &quot;The Art of War&quot;."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Can it really be just ten years since the Great Rising Sun Hysteria?... There was that decade-long spasm when the media and the Leftconvinced themselves that the Japanese had it all figured out. Sothere was this ridiculous craze in Japanese management techniques andfaux profound philosophical teachings. Riding in on the crest of thiswave came A Book of Five Rings by one of the most revered warriors inJapan's history, Miyamoto Musashi. Shinmen Musashi No Kami Fujiwara NoGenshin, aka Miyamoto Musashi, was orphaned by the age of seven and,in order to earn his way in the world, became a swordsman, killing hisfirst man at the age of 13. Eventually he fought some 60 duelswithout ever being defeated. By the end of his career, he had becomeso expert and dominant that he would fight his opponents with nothingbut a stick. Then in 1643, he retired to a contemplative seclusion ina cave, where, just before his death. he wrote Go Rin No Sho (A Bookof Five Rings), a book of strategy addressed to his disciple TeruoNobuyuki.The book is essentially a treatise on the Way of thewarrior, the strategy that should be employed in combat:It is saidthe warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword, and he should havea taste for both Ways. Even if a man has no natural ability he can bea warrior by sticking assiduously to both divisions of theWay. Generally speaking, the Way of the warrior is resolute acceptanceof death. Although not only warriors but priests, women, peasants andlowlier folk have been known to die readily in the cause of duty orout of shame, this is a different thing. The warrior is different inthat studying the Way of strategy is based on overcoming men. Byvictory gained in crossing swords with individuals, or enjoiningbattle with large numbers, we can attain power and fame for ourselvesor for our lord. This is the virtue of strategy.-----------Thisis the Way for men who want to learn my strategy:Do not thinkdishonestly. The Way is in training. Become acquainted with everyart. Know the Ways of all professions. Distinguish between gain andloss in worldly matters. Develop intuitive judgment and understandingfor everything. Perceive those things which cannot be seen. Payattention even to trifles. Do nothing which is of nouse.-----------To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior youmust study fully other martial arts and not deviate even a little fromthe Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled, accumulate practiceday by day, and hour by hour. Polish the twofold spirit heart andmind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. When yourspirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewildermentclear away, there is the true void.Until you realise the true Way,whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you may think that things arecorrect and in order. However, if we look at things objectively, fromthe viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departingfrom the true Way. Know well this spirit, and with forthrightness asthe foundation and the true spirit as the Way. Enact strategy broadly,correctly and openly.Then you will come to think of things in awide sense and, taking the void as the Way, you will see the Way asvoid.In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence,principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit isnothingness.Essentially, he has two extremely simple messages: behumble and study what other people do. This is a thoroughly Japanesephilosophy and the recipe for both their success in the 80's and theirdemise in the 90's. It is really tactical thinking more than it isstrategic. The Japanese system calls for precisely duplicating whatalready exists, for learning what is already known. The Americansystem demands innovation, the end run around the status quo. If youwant a metaphor for the two systems, two images come inescapably tomind: David vs. Goliath and the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark whereIndiana Jones shoots the enormous scimitar wielding Arab. You canjust picture Musashi studying Goliath's moves or the Arab'stechniques, being reactive and imitative, while the American picks upa gun or a sling and uses technological innovation to triumph.Nowimagine if you will thousands of American businessmen riding the trainto work in the morning with this book clutched in their hands, eagerlyseeking clues to the Japanese economic miracle in the pages of a 17thcentury sword fighting manual. Pretty amusing, eh? It's quite alovely little book and it is helpful for understanding the strengthsand limitations of the Japanese psyche. But if you approach itseeking profound and vital truths to apply in your own life, you aremore than likely going to be disappointed.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Small book which allows you to look at things from a different perspective.

This book is a must-read if you want to understand samurai. But I must mention that he was a soldier, not a commander. His track record in single combats is a miracle, but not very good in large-scale battles."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"For whatever reason, the publishers decided to leave out portions of the text, and add a massive amount (about 40% of the already shortened book) of Japanese history with photos.The history is great. The photos are. . . Photos.If you've any interest in this subject, find a copy of the Shambhala Dragon Edition by Thomas Cleary.

He wrote \\"According to this Ichi school, you can win with a long weapon, and yet you can also win with a short weapon. In short, the Way of the Ichi school is the spirit of winning, whatever the weapon and whatever its size.\\"The same is in business: the leaders who are attracted by the goal rather than by embellishments are the true leaders. For example, the dot-com bubble of 2000 was caused by the managers who forgot about the primary goal of the business: net income. Those who were obsessed by their stock prices regarding of massive losses and the lack of revenue became bankrupt. They put attention to the fancy office buildings and furniture rather than to the assets that generate earning. Musashi wrote about it: \\"Just as a horse must have endurance and no defects, so it is with weapons. Horses should walk strongly, and swords and companion swords should cut strongly. Spears and halberds must stand up to heavy use: bows and guns must be sturdy. Weapons should be hardy rather than decorative\\".Musashi also encourages to maintain a balance of your skills throughout your life. This balance could be thought of as Yin and Yang. The balance is to be neither over-familiar with something nor under-familiar. The over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is not recommended by Musashi, as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy, and thus your boisterousness, or over-calm. The over-familiarity makes you stick to a conviction. This is a very important for the business. Take, for example, mr. Warren Buffet. A quality standing out about Mr. Buffett is his ability to morph. If you read his materials from the 1960s, he said very different things than in the 1970s and early-1980s. Early on he was buying dirt-cheap stocks by simple statistical standards and typically smaller stocks (smallcap), later he bought \\"franchises\\", then he entered a period of buying great managements of big companies and being a long-term holder, then, amazingly, he was buying smaller things dirt cheap again just as value came back into play as the twenty-first century began. He tactically morphed steadily over the decades. Trying to freeze his tactics from any decade and replicate them in the next few would never have led you to his actual actions. Musashi wrote about that this way: \\"You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troops to have likes and dislikes.\\""},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This book was on the 'suggested reading list' of another author. I found it intriguing, and curiously interesting reading. The book is based on the survival and fighting/killing style of a Samurai. It speaks of the first time Musashi killed a man, and how he did it. It teaches one the proper use of a sword, knife, or stick. It also teaches the forms of battle used by the Samurai. I liked this book a great deal, yet would not recommend it as a book to help one in business or life. Maybe I just missed the point."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This was a pretty decent read and I am happy to include it in my library. While I rate the 'Code of the Samurai' and the 'Art of War' on a much higher level, this book is not without it's merits.I haven't read other translations, so I can't really comment on the quality of this one. However, the introductory material suffered from quite a few mistakes. Commas were missed, the improper use of a/an was found at least once and even the word 'then' was misspelled. This wouldn't be allowed in a college term paper; it should have been caught in a mass market publication.As to the quality of the book for it's knowledge alone, I would break it down by who the prospective reader is:Kendo Artist: This is a must. No ifs, ands or buts.Other Martial Artist: Highly recommended, but not necessary.Soldier: Recommended, but take it with a grain of salt.Businessperson: Read it only if you are curious."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I don't know how I'll apply the principals in this book, but I will reread it many times - mostly, I enjoyed it as literature, and value the translator's notes!

The book is priced so low as to be practically free, and is valuable even if you're not an executive or a swordsman. It is a classic in every sense."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"The only good advice I ever got from a book came from this one: \\"Do nothing which is of no use\\" (p. 49). The Book of Five Rings has a lot of good advice, but that's the one that speaks most clearly to my condition. The Book of Five Rings must be read as metaphor, because life conditions today are so different from those of medieval Japan. But Mushashi was a wise and powerful thinker, and his ideas apply well beyond battle strategy. He lived integrity: unity and purity of thought, word, and deed, and his rare qualities are always worth studying and emulating."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"And, with luck, I'll be reading it for at least twenty-five more. This translation of Musashi's classic was the first which I purchased, and it still is my favorite in some respects. If you are looking for \\"How to Become a Samurai in Twelve Easy Lessons\\", pass by. If you are looking for a book which will yield up new layers of meaning with the passing of time and (hopefully) your continuing maturity, here you are. The areas to which the principles in this book may be applied and the success in said application are only limited to the amount of imagination and study put forth by the reader."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I purchased this book in hopes of improving my fighting strategy. As an amature fighter myself I could relate to everything that was said, further, his language is straight forward and is meant to be directed to those who battle and those who control men in battle.If you try to translate this into business strategy, it will lose its essence and true purpose of the writting. It will lose meaning because it wasn't meant for business. He actually says that money must not be our only motivation, but self improvement. If you are interested in Japanese history, this is a must. If you are interested in martial arts, this is a must. If you are looking for business strategy, I suggest The Prince, or The Art of War."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Don't know whether my Taiwanese/Chinese background gives me bias. However, I'm quite used to read abstract/doctrine books like this one.When reading books like this (or Confucius, Sun-Tse), my philosophy is - you need to pay attention to every word, and every word is a starting point, instead of an end. Thus, the book just provokes you to think more, to think through the \\"Way\\", instead of teaching you everything. You are your own teacher.I think - from this book, the more important teaching is on the spiritual vs. technical. Thus \\"the Way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death\\" makes me think a lot.Do you know why Musashi called it - book of the Ground, the Water, etc.? That'll be an interesting teaching as well.Overall, I like the book a lot, though I have difficulty to understand all the English words. I might find a Chinese version or I need to learn Japanese. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to think through \\"the Way of warrior\\" by themselves."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Well, its OK.

This book can help you deal with any situation life can throw at you, if you can comprehend the content and apply it properly."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Read this as well as Sun Tzu for a good over view of staragy. Sun Tzu offers more practical advice while this offers more insight in to the proper state of mind ( and as such is probably more generally applicable to different situations, war, bussiness, personal relationships, etc.) I have only recently begun my study of these two great works but if I were to lay out an easy ( and maybe erroneouse ) distinctino then it seems to me that this is more for the individual in combat ( negotiations, love, whatever) while Sun Tzu is more organizational ( But they are both still stratagy and tactics not one or the other ). As someone else here pointed out, Musashi does not tell you how to fight ( run a bussiness, argue, etc ) instead he descibes what your state of mind should be. ( there are specific references to different type of sword cuts but this is not the bulk of the advice). Mushashi presupposes that you know the the mechanics of your art, he is teaching you how and most importantly when to apply them. He probably dwells on timeing more than anything ( other than practice and reflection.) There is a short list of things to always do, remember the importance of training, percive that which can not be seen, pay attention even to the trifle, etc. Probably most importantly ( other than the chapter on the void but I expect most will skip that, pity ) is putting yourself in the others place wich he illustrates with a simple but effective analogy.As a trial attorney this book is invaluable and invites repeated readings as new insight is to be found as your understanding deepens. I recall a case I won once, with a great witness but bad physical evidence, when it came time to look at the physical evidence the judge stated that it did not look like what it was purported to be to him. He was right and had I argued, pointed out that he was not an expert in that necessary feild etc, I would have lost all credibility with him. Instead I humbly agreed and mentioned that I probably would not have brought the case if the creadibility of the witness was not so compelling and persuasive. We won. As Mushashi points out, put yourself in the place of your enemy and remember timeing is everything."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is a book on the Way of the warrior, or rather the Ways to achieve victory through intelligence and focus. Musashi describes the five Ways of swordsmanship, as being essential to the good Samurai. It is both amusing and fascinating to realize, modern day business owners rely heavily on the wisdom of a man who wrote this over 400 years ago. But, I suppose that just proves it truly is wisdom, that will last. Though this book may seem strange to those, who haven't read it, you learn stuff from it, after a while. So, it's worth it!"},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Miyamoto Musashi lived in the medium age Japan, among wars and social crises. The kind of life he had led him to develop a special philosophy (and very practical) towards work, discipline, fears and the trascending questions. His life can't be an practical example for us NOW. We don't live in societies where war is the main way of living (fortunately), but, and this is an important BUT, his insights about living in the middle of a noncooperative relations (dangerous ones, i would say), the moral and psichological resources everyone has to survive, and the basic practices to develop the capabilities to it, are valuables for every modern person, for the new environment we have ahead (job place, market, personal competition for excellence), what is as competitive as the Japan he lived (but less bloody). Indeed, being capable to compete supposes a Samurai style planning and training capabilites. Read what one of them advices to us."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I did not like this book quite as much as the Art of War. However, I think this book is a good supplement to the Art of War which is why is suggest that you read it second. A lot of good philosiphy is crammed into these pages. I was particularly fond of the pages which explore zen. However, I was not pleased with the pages of pages of sword fighting strategy. I will probably never fight with a sword, and have no relevant application for these sword fighting techniques. However, it is a fulfilling read for a person who has a few hours to kill on a road trip or weekend."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"As another reviewer stated this is not a book for the casual reader. While I have now read and studied the book and its teaching well over twenty times, I still find new things to ponder each time. Going from this if you are learning the way of the sword. DO NOT go read a section and try to do it yourself, you will only end up hurting yourself. Think and meditate upon the text before ever trying anything. Also the book alone is not a teacher, only a reference. If you really wish to learn the way of the sword seek out a teacher. However when it comes to books on this topic you will find no better. Which is why I give it 5 of 5 stars, but to someone who is not truly interested in the way it will most likely bore them. As for the book itself. It is broken into 5 main sections Ground/Water/Fire/Wind/Void, each being their own philosophy and style with the sword."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"One of the most illuminating books I have ever read and one of the best works on strategy ever written. Musashi takes the reader into the world of helical learning. The novice sets off understanding the book at face value and as his understanding of strategy gets more advanced through study, he comes to the realization that the advanced techniques are actually the basics, the same but taken to a higher level. He has gone full circle and arrived at the beginning but at a higher level than whence he started.But it doesn't stop there, making the circuit again and again and each time rising ever higher in understanding he progresses through the purely physical applications into the mental and spiritual applications of Musashi's ideas thus honing mind, body and spirit and fusing it to will, showing him how to succeed in adversity.A timeless classic and life-changing book."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"The Kindle edition (MobileReference version) (with linked TOC) contains the Victor Harris translation of Musashi's writing, without the translator's footnotes. The translation itself makes up two-thirds of the book, and is followed by some additional material on Musashi which does not appear in the Table of Contents. This material seems interesting, though the source is unclear (it does reference Wikipedia). It is not the same as the added material in the 1974 Overlook Press print edition, which has a similar cover. That's not a complaint, I'm just filling out the product description.Seems like a good mobile edition of a great book; it is well formatted for the Kindle and, so far, I have found only a small number of typos."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I have read this book at least 20 times and every time I read I get something new from it. I'm a business man and I read it primarily for the business value that it gives through the deep insights that Musashi accumulated through his life. Even the initial pages about how a carpenter should treat different kinds of wood for construction is simply mind blowing and outlook enhancing. I strongly recommend that you buy this translation (not Cleary's as his translation misses the nuances and tries to present the book in simple english - that can't be done) and read it and then reread it to enhance your understanding of the world and the strategy you should employ to stay ahead in business, career and life."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This book left me with a double feeling. Happiness, about being able to read about ancient wisdom and the sense it all made. Sadness, not being able to apply all knowledge in our era.As Sun Tzu's Art of War was written even more abstract than this book, I found it easier to convert its knowledge into practice. As this book is more focussed on the inner-self of a human being, I strongly recommend you first read some Zen books before digging in on this one. Then I would recommend Zen Mind, Beginners Mind.The knowledge of this book is definitly four-star material, but this translation into English misses out on some key points.

This is a difficult topic to write about, imagine trying to write a manual on how to survive a street fight. The books value is not that it can be taken as a combat manual, but that it is historically significant for that time in samurai history, and that it is designed to open the reader's mind to ideas on strategy in the broader sense, not in the tactical sense. This is honestly depicted in the book. The reader will do well to start thinking about how to practice the strategies described in this book but in actual physical training. And that is the main purpose behind the writing of ths piece."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Musashi's treatise on combat is, in many places, a rather dry recitation on footwork. But it is also, in many places, a thoughtful critique of traditions that serve no practical purpose in real life, and the need to experiment, to learn, and to embrace those ideas or skills that allow you to truly succeed in real life. Not the most engaging or accessible text, but very interesting and fairly short."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"The supreme authority on strategy to the Chinese is Sun Tzu and his thoughts on how to win literal and figurative battles should always remain part of military and business education. Miyamoto Musashi is a Japanese Samurai that lived in the seventeenth century, and is considered the greatest Japanese warrior of the time. By the age of thirty he had fought and won over sixty duels to the death and he retired undefeated. He then lived in a cave and recorded his thoughts on battles, considering them appropriate for all situations where planning, tactics and strategy are necessary.The modern Japanese businessman and entrepreneur studies the writings of Musashi as the Chinese study Sun Tzu, hoping to adapt his thoughts to the execution of their business strategy. When faced with opposition schooled in this way, the American business person needs to be schooled in a similar manner. They need to recognize when such a tactic may be applied and develop a counter strategy beforehand that will thwart it.As is the case with most Japanese writings, one must read this text very carefully in order to discern the complete meaning. Many times a second or third reading is necessary and it is always helpful if you have some understanding of the Japanese culture and traditions. Although Musashi fought with swords and other hand weapons, it is clear that he was a master at strategy as well as tactics. The warriors that he fought were clearly the best that Japan had to offer and to survive this many instances of hand-to-hand singular combat; he must have been nearly perfect. For even one serious mistake among his duels and he would never have been able to retire to the cave and write this book. This is one of the books that should be studied by anyone planning to do business with Japanese counterparts."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This book is a great read from start to finish. it is something to spark an imagination and also to allow a creative and educated look at any and everything you would do in life. Miyamoto is a true genius to create something so valuable on a personal level that everyone can relate to no matter what your situation may be. This book gives great insight to a man with a vision and plans to unify and set forth on a journey to find his path and way in life, much like a Muslim who may never meet his fate even into the afterlife. However, Miyamoto had reached his path b4 the end of his demise but left a legacy of the samurai for all people to follow in all walks and forms of life. I would recommend this book to anyone with a brain who is looking to succeed in life."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is actually a great book on practical Zen in a way of swordmanship in medieval Japan.

Well worth the meager price."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Musashi's now-famous 'Book of Five Rings' is simply not the most influential sword-fighting book written in Feudal Japan. The most important book on Japanese swordsmanship, and the text of the Shogunate's own selected shool of swordsmanship is 'The Sword and the Mind': available as a translation by Hiroaki Sato. Musashi had a very personal and unique style of fighting involving the long and short swords used together. Quite possibly his style developed through the influence of his father, who was an expert in the jitte: a parrying weapon held in the left hand. Even if wielding the long sword by itself, he recommends holding it only in one hand, and developing the strength to do so: he mentions how often you will have to grab enemy spears or other objects with your left hand while fighting, and how holding a sword in two hands limits your sword's movement. Musashi was fully devoted to swordsmanship, and it seems as if he spent all day every day of his life swinging his swords about: no wonder no one could match him! Musashi's main principles are: 1) Train as much as possible 2) Always be on the attack, and turn every defence into an attack 3) Do unexpected strange things to confuse the opponent 4) Attack while the opponent is in the middle of doing something else such as taking a step or breathing etc 5) keep yourself relaxed while fighting 6) Train to achieve complete control of movement. There are lots of little useful anecdotes he tells us about, such as how to keep the sun at your back and thus in the opponent's face. He also gives us a window into 17th Century battles concerning the benefits and detriments of the various weapons and so on. What clearly rings through the entire book is that this is the work of someone who is intimate to an incredible degree with the movements of the sword and the body. A great deal of his strategy involves timing and rhythms: catching the opponent at just the right moment. There is no doubt that these principles are of the utmost importance in winning any kind of sport; however, they are very simple principles and really depend on the swordsman having an incredible amount of skill and training which gives him enough freedom of movement and acute sense of timing to carry them out. One can sense the love Musashi has of fighting and the thrill he gets at his feeling of superiority at winning. However, Japan was not as impressed with his style as he was. It was the two-handed style outlined in 'The Sword and the Mind' that became the standard for samurai. I am not a duellist who's life is on the line, so I am not in a position to muse about why the preference remained for a two-handed grip, but certainly having more control of the blade, more speed, and a longer sword must have been factors. So, even though Musashi was undefeatable, he became so using apparently inferior weapons. While this is all the more impressive, it also means that his style is defective in its most basic element: its weapons! I should probably add here that Musashi clearly was acquainted with literature, and the fact that he was trying to immortalize himself through his book is obvious on every page. He was a great artist too, and his paintings and sculptures have been prized ever since he created them. He wanted to remain the best swordsman after his death, and this book was conceived as his means to that end. There is a great deal to be sure to be learned from this work - it is quite possibly the best book ever written on hand to hand combat, and it is very well organized. I should add too that where Musashi speaks of large-scale military manoeuvers he is speaking from experience, since he fought in and commanded in several battles. We however must remember that in his own time and later his style of two swords hardly had any students - and there are no fencers from his Nito school that ever became famous. While his very seemingly-practical 'hands-on' approach to swordsmanship appeals to us impatient moderns, the deeply introspective, psychological mind-games of Munenori's \\"The Sword and the Mind\\" appealed to the samurai of the Edo period. However, the samurai of that period took on the role of civil servants and their role as warriors became less and less important, so practical advice on winning battles such as Musashi gives seemed less relevant to them than spiritual cultivation. It is really a miracle that Japan's greatest samurai actually wrote a book telling us how to become as great a fighter as himself! This book is a guide to success in martial arts, and it will give your martial arts knowledge a touch of 'class', since this book is a true classic of the best kind: if you can quote Musashi in your teaching, it can only look good for you! I ought to note that Thomas Cleary's edition of the \\"Book of Five Rings\\" also contains the entire \\"Sword and the Mind\\" of Munenori, so Cleary's book would be ideal to buy!"},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is a timeless classic that belongs on everyone's shelf.

Seriously, the parallels between the two worlds are difficult to draw. Call me myopic. This seems to be an excellent manual for a samurai. But if you insist on extrapolating business principles from it, I also recommend &quot;Taming and Training Cockatoos&quot; (the similarities between nesting and portfolio analysis are flagrant!) as well as &quot;Please To The Table&quot; which appears to be a Russian cookbook, but also serves up a delicious recipe for managing sycophants! Seriously, if you're looking for a thoughtful, educating management book, read Drucker, if you want corporate strategy, read Porter, for economics, try Krugman. This is an old warrior manual that doesn't offer any new insight for the budding capitalist.

Captures the essence of the meaning of technical concepts best."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Based on my readings, Musashi's motive in writing his Book of Five Rings had been to correct misrepresentations of his views on swordsmanship by his contemporaries. Having become a legend in his own time, Musashi's reputation was being exploited by ambitious rivals claiming to have adopted the master's martial techniques and philosophies. Thus Book of Five Rings was intended by its author to establish his point of view for correcting misconceptions.Those in America who've been advocating since 1974 to study Book of Five Rings to gain some business advantage over Japanese businessmen are barking up the wrong tree. Musashi's writings are poetic and thought provoking. Indeed, one can even learn something new and ancient about strategy from the master. It is, however, doubtful that Musashi's words can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. So then those in the 1970s who had originally marketed the book as \\"the alternative to the Harvard MBA\\" were barking up the wrong tree.In addition to the charming and useful writings, the original (1974 English translation) Book of Five Rings includes photos of the master swordsman's quite beautiful art work, now residing in Japan in a museum dedicated to Musashi works."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I studied martial arts when I was younger, karate to be exact, and at times you had to really reach to get into the Zen of the discipline.

But aside from potentially valuable, it is also quite lovely. To be read, enjoyed, savoured."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is one of many books that people just don't understand. This book teaches a person the Way. As defined by Musashi, the way is the divine footprints of God, telling us how to live our lives to correct way. That is what the Way is, and that is what Musashi spent 50 yrs. trying to find. In this book, he imparts all his knowledge of the Way. He also tells how to fight using his style. He tells how to come out the victor in a sword fight no matter what techhnique the enemy uses. At age 30, Musashi was invincible. He had never lost one out of 60 battles using just about all the available weapons of the time. This book in short, teaches you how to live the Way, as God would like to see, how to relieze everything going on around you, and how to become the greatest swordsman."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is a wonderful book on swordsmanship. It's not about strategy. Strategy is very high level (there are three levels of warfare: strategic, operational, and tactical). This book is about tactics. Strategy is how to win a potential war from a national level; operational refers to how an area commander (e.g. General Schwartzkoff) fights a theater; tactics is how you take a hill or defend your ship. I've got tons of experience in program management, have published articles on management, have scientific degrees and an MBA, and I fail to see how this is a management book. It seems like a HUGE stretch to me. The rating, unfortunately, seems to depend on what one expects from the book. I expected something that would be strategically useful (or at least operationally) from a management perspective. Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" (one of my favorite books and far better, I think, than von Clauswitz) certainly qualifies. This book does not. However, I just read John Suler's \\"Contemporary Psychoanalysis & Eastern Thought\\" in which he explains how the martial arts (referencing this book & others) relates to psychology & spiritual development. Thus, I must positively revise my view of this book."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I have read 4 different translations of Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings and I would have to say this is the worst translation I have read by far. It is obvious the translator does not have a passion or understanding for Japanese Martial Sciences. The translator made numerours mistakes, and he consistantly referred to Japanese swordsmanship (kenjutsu)as Kendo. This is a major mistake and the very first time I saw Kendo mentioned in the book, I wanted to put it down. It is quite obvious that the translator missed alot of subtle lessons Musashi tried to convery in this book. I would not recommend this version of a classic. However I would recommed A Way to Victory The Annotated Book of Five Rings by Hidy Ochiai. Mr. Ochiai is an accomplished martial artist and has a good understanding of Japanese Martial Arts. I would also recommend reading Legacies of the Sword by Karl Friday. This book will give you a complete understanding of a traditional Japanese (kenjutsu) school still operating today."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Everybody should read this book. That's all there is to it. Musashi takes the reader into a world filled to the brim with devotion, self-respect, disciplin, honesty and purity of thought. Even though this book was written by and for warriors and samurai, and in a completely different time and culture, it is a remarkabe source of inspiration for selv-developement. Musashi's teachings are concise and to the point. He uses phrases like &quot;you must understand this&quot; and &quot;you must practice diligently&quot; and explains only general, but unquestionable and fundamental, concepts of the Way of the Warrior. These guidelines are not directly applicable in our time and age, but what is applicable are the things this book contains about working with yourself. Striving to achieve improvement on the inside as well as the outside.It would be a lie to say that this book is a &quot;positive&quot; book.

Miyamoto, or \\"sword saint\\" as the Japanese call him, was both a powerful warrior and a deep thinking philosopher. He produced numerous works of art, including self-portraits, paintings of buddhas, and sword tsubas. The depth of his thought can be seen clearly in this philosophical treatise, a must read for anyone who is serious about combat and the philosophy behind combat. However, the reader be warned that this is not a martial arts \\"how to book.\\" Miyamoto fails to divulge any specific sword techniques, only describing strikes, stances, and sword positioning at a most basic level. Having said this, the work is centered around the philosophy behind combat and killing. The most powerful weapon is the human mind which Miyamoto attempts to begin training with this fantastic work. It is a book that can and should be read again and again by both beginners and experts: it never fails to yield some bit of philosophy that helps strengthen the mind. While what Miyamoto says on numerous occasions is mind bending, such as his section on fighting and defeating fifty to sixty men, and difficult to fully grasp this is a work that I think everyone should read sometime in their life and should be required reading in every dojo."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Instead of purchasing another technical manual with series of black-and-white photograps of one chinese guy kicking the bejesus out of the another, I would whole-heartedly suggest buying this book and reading it with an open mind. I have trained (and at times taught) different martial arts ranging from tai-chi to boxing for almost 20 years. Never before or after have I seen a text so clear and concise, cutting straight into the heart of things. Although Musashi wrote the text bearing the sword-fighting in mind, it is by no means limited to that. He doesn't try and prescribe a certain technique that always works (as there is no such thing) -- rather he outlines different factors a successful combat strategy must rely on. It's a difference between giving a man a loaf of bread or teaching him how to make it.The students of Japanese martial arts can certainly relate easier to the way Musashi presents his concepts, but what he says is applicable to any combat whatever your style or school or, indeed, to any confrontation in a broad sense (hence the potential application of this book as a resource for learning the business management, strategy and negotiation tactics)."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Okay, so I really have no clue as to what compelled me to buy this book. I hate to admit it but it looked \\"pretty\\" and it looked \\"historical,\\" so I got it. I also love the Japanese film classics starring Toshir Mifune as the ultimate samurai warrior. Many of them illustrate a combination of charm, sophistication, humor, even comedy, with violence, ruthlessness, and arrogance. The comparative lack of graphic bloodiness tends to focus the viewer on the human dynamics and art of the situation, and while some of these classics have been translated by the Hollywood film industry for Western tastes, what transpires still has a \\"foreign\\" feel. One sees the action and senses that something going on here is different, uncomfortable. Upon reading a few paragraphs of the Book of Five Rings : The Classic Guide to Strategy, I understood why.For one thing, I had not understood that the character in the samurai collection that Mifune had been portraying had actually been an historic individual living in a unique period of Japanese history. Why I should have been surprised, I don't know, since the exploits of the likes of Pat Garret, Wyatt Earp, and Doc Holiday became the basis for a good deal of 19th and 20th Century pulp fiction, TV series, and movies in the United States. In fact, the period in Japanese history that the translator describes sounds not unlike the \\"Wild West.\\" The sod busters and the ranchers have made their peace, leaving hundreds of gunmen unemployed. The lucky ones find work as lawmen while the unlucky wander the country looking to enhance their reputations by lethal confrontations to see who's \\"fastest on the draw.\\" The winner may ultimately find a job as a peace keeper; the loser finds a spot on boot hill. In the case of the American western, the contestants use guns; in the case of the Japanese samurai, they use swords and other equipment. Still there seems something more to it. The something more, I think, is a philosophy, a school, an etiquette, even an art that leaves the Western mind a little uncomfortable.With some of the techniques of sword work and battle strategy, I think that as Musashi himself informs the reader, it is very difficult to \\"write\\" how to do a mechanical task. One can only convey the \\"feeling\\" that performing such a task has for the expert writer on the subject. In modern times this facet of the learning process is overcome by photo illustrations, but even then only to a very limited extent. As the author points out, there is no substitute for experience with the process and practice, practice, practice. Even the very limited experience I acquired years ago when I took fencing lessons helped me picture more clearly some of the moves the author described.Part of the difficulty in connecting with the author's experience as he performs the various actions of sword fighting may be that this book is a translation from the Japanese, was originally written in an older version of the language, and embodied an ancient version of the culture itself, one that is no longer available even to modern Japanese let alone a Western translator. A warrior of Musashi's time may well have connected far better with the similes he uses than a modern person. The unique benefit of this fact, however, is that a great deal can be read into the work. Part of this is the author's intention, but part of it is due to the very ambiguity of the work. Just as the author himself suggests, the reader who does not concentrate on the words but allows the mind to float over them makes all sorts of interesting discoveries. For instance a book on dealing with problem people suggested a technique much like Musashi's \\"To Know the Times,\\" essentially to match the rhythm and intensity of the subject until one can gain control of that rhythm to de-escalate it. His \\"To Become the Enemy\\" immediately brought to my mind the individual characters of Civil War generals Robert E. Lee and his opponent George McClelland. As Musashi suggested, the enemy always feels he is outnumbered which means that a few may defeat many if they are trained in The Way. Or as Lee is reputed to have said before a battle, &quot;The Army of the Potomac is a very good one, unfortunately General McClelland brought himself along.&quot; Lee understood The Way. He knew that McClelland's personality, or lack of The Way, produced vast armies of the enemy in his mind.In all a very interesting and surprising book, one I expect to read again and again to mine for concepts.

Like a father or a some sort of mentor, Musashi continually exhorts the reader to practice and to think about what has been written. His tells the reader what he should be thinking about in order to be victorious, not what to do.This absence of technical information makes sense. Come on, does anyone think that Jack Welch proved finance theorems with Immelt all these years?

As a student of a chinese art, it was hard for me to comprehend the techniques which were presented in the book. I did enjoy the read but found some things lacking. It was somewhat poetic (for lack of a better word) and had too brief of explanations. I realize that one has to use their imagination but the book is not applicable to all aspects of life.

I am a CEO of a mid-sized company and have been able to use many of the concepts covered in the book in real life.It is not a book to read cover to cover in one sitting, you should read it a little bit at a time and reflect on the content.It is helpful if you have an understanding of eastern philosophy but not necessary.The book is written by Miyamoto Musashi perhaps the most well known Samurai leader in history and is a unique opportunity to read his thoughts and strategies."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Another classic that, under the right circumstances, can change the way the reader sees things. Consider this a guide to the psychology behind action. It's not a guide for someone who only wants to improve a hook kick. It IS a guide for someone who wants to develop the appropriate spirit for efficiently applying maximum force with minimal effort in many different arenas. A book that warrants more than one trip through its covers to understand it."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"All those who have even minimum interest with martial culture should read this book, from militaries to karateka's.

Instead it talks of doing things with certain 'feelings' with the ultimate goal of becoming formless. There are multiple levels of meaning such that on first reading there seems little sense. After contemplating a passage you develop a minor understanding. After expert application, another understanding, and so on. A Westerner can better understand this book after reading The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. Even so, it has taken me almost two years of martial arts training to begin to understand the concepts in this book.Yes, the concepts are applicable to modern life. But are they effective? Maybe."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"The previous reviewers are misguided. This is an essential guide to strategy that must be learned in the context of action and practice. The Art of War is the high school text book, this is the graduate degree version. In the end, after you have read the passages many times and practiced often, you may be lucky enough to realize you didn't need to read the book at all. That's shibumi.If you're reading it for any other reason, you're only seeing what you always see. If you're reading it without practice, you're wasting your time. This is one of the top 10 books written by man."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is powerful book to read and UTILIZE in your life. While it can easily be taken for face value as a book on physical fighting strategy, it is more than that. One can take many of the thoughts and translate them to a more theoretical use on strategy. For example, a quote speaking of \\"the gaze\\" relating to seeing an enemy and their movements: \\"It is important in strategy to know the enemy's sword and not to be distracted by insignificant movements of his sword\\". This could easily be translated to business, sports, etc. Just substitute \\"sword\\" for the essence of the thought to apply to \\"business\\", \\"army\\", \\"team\\", etc.The first 3rd of the book is a historical account of events of Musashi's life, and also includes many images of artwork created by Musashi. They are black and white however. The rest of the book is the actual \\"Book of Five Rings\\". It consists of 5 \\"books\\": ground, water, fire, wind and the void. It is to be noted Musashi after a time found he did not need to follow any particular \\"Way\\" and practiced many.Regarding the layout of the book, I like the footnotes at the bottom of many of the pages which help describe words or thoughts you may not have easily or readily known otherwise.---*** THE BOTTOM LINE ***---A good book to have, with worthwhile strategy, although, regarding strategy I prefer Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\"."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"This is a great book for the swordsman,samurai enthusiast,or anyone who wants insite into the spiritual history of japan.It contains helpful advice for anyone looking to better their life and overcome fear."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I have been reading this book for twenty years in various editions and translations and this Victor Harris translation is my favourite. This book can be read in less than an hour but you will be able to pick up new understandings each time you read it whether the first time or the two hundredth time.I can tell that some of the reviewers who have given this book neutral or worse reviews just don't get it. There is a very good reason that this book along with Sun Tzu's &quot;Art of War&quot; are considered the two classic Eastern treatises on strategy. The principles are clearly applicable both to combat and to the daily battles of business, marketing and sales. This is a profound book. Study it and it will yield many lessons."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"There's no doubt this book is an interesting read, from which one can learn a lot. But attributing the infinite wisdom of the most successful people today to this book is an overly pretentious act, for after all, this is a book explaining how to best cut your opponent with a long sword.If it is ancient wisdom you are after, I would recommend the Hagakure and The Art of War much more than this one. But if you're interested in learning the roots of Japanese culture, then the Book of Five Rings will do just fine."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"Admittedly, I do not own this edition, but I bought it as a Christmas gift for a friend.

This edition is good for simplicity and the lay reader."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I read this book through once, and thought: okay, I just read a book about a 15th centurey samuri warrior, and he enlightened me all about how to fight with a sword. Great. Now what can I do with that.But there is more, there is much much more. This book contains within it philosophy, and a sense of the greaterness of ones self in relation to the cosmos. Musashi didn't write a book just about how to fight with an antiquated sword, he wrote a book that allows the reader to see further than their petty lives and embrace a more global way of thinking.Musashi wrote this book to enlighten the reader as to how he lived; and how he thought a warrior should live. And everyone today is a lawyer, whether it be in your job, in your social life or wherever, you are always fighting and planning on how to make things come out best in your favor; and this book helps you to realize these battles and win them.This review is very ephemeral and doesn't say much; but it is tough to explain a book of this magnitude in a small 1000 word essay. You need to read this book to gain even a slight understanding of the magnitude of it; then you can reread it and hopefully gain a little more understanding; until in 50-60 years you might understand it fully.

Ground2.) Water3.) Fire4.) Wind5.) VoidEach book goes into a specific type of combat for various situations and weapons, which can be brought over into every life of business people.

In many respects Musashi, a Ronin represents Japan's search for an identity, a country ruled by military might in the form of the Shogun, yet keeping an Emperor who they revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless, masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's devotion to his master. He was his own master, in a time when Japan had no voice, serving all, without righteous. It would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the Samurai, that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of Miyamoto Musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession, master of the sword."},{"Title":"A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","review":"I base this review not on my own understanding, but on that of one of my seniors in Shotokan Karate of America. This senior has an old, much-highlighted hardcover copy, from which he reads regularly. I suppose that this kind of endorsement is valid only to the extent to which you trust my being impressed by the senior and are willing to take my word that this man knows his art and is worth emulating in his practices.For myself, I have practiced karate for a little over ten years, so I am only starting to appreciate how much I don't understand. I have owned a copy of this translation of the _Book of Five Rings_ for about the last eight years, and have read it several times. I have been told that this is a good translation. Each time I read the book I understood (or thought I understood) something more than before. But that's the way with this kind of thing, I guess; reading this book will not make someone without any training like Musashi, but if you already understand some part of what he is saying, you'll understand his words when you read them. Interestingly, in a practical way, if you are on the verge of understanding something, hearing it from someone who's been there (like Musashi) may just help push you over the edge. Is the kind of mind described in this book useful for random people? well, yeh, but it's not a quick fix.

I love how all her heroines are plus sized beauties and have great hunks who love them that way.I also love that her heroines have class and style. They are strong women who can handle any situation put before them.In His Brother's Child, the heroine,Faith, is pregnant. The result of a one night stand at a party. She is also the victim of a cruel joke. The babies father wants nothing to do with either of them so its up to his brother,Edward to pick up the pieces. The kicker is that to Edward, Faith is a dream come true. He knows he loves her from the get go but because of her distrust of men, thanks to his brother, she is afraid to open up her heart again.Its not only a love story but a story about hope. How it only takes one person who,with loving patience, can give a person the strength to overcome fears and to embrace life.I hope to read many more of Pat's books. Each one is a treat."},{"Title":"His Brother's Child","review":"As long as Pat Ballard keeps writing, I'll keep looking forward to reading her books. Even though she writes outside of my normal genre of reading (thriller), I put all other books down when there is one of hers to read. I recommend you do the same.This book arrived in my P.O.Box the day I was leaving on vacation. Between the flights to and from Baltimore, I devoured this book. In this book, she brought to life \\"Edward, a man who could bring Faith from tears to laughter within seconds...she also found, to her surprise, that she loved to hear him talk.\\" How many women would not enjoy finding a man like this?If that weren't enough to make you want to keep reading,..\\"His lips left hers and nibbled at her ear lobe, then started working their way down her neck, then lower. Faith moaned with pleasure...\\" I could feel the tension mounting as I read the words while on the airplane. As you read this book, you will discover a beautiful man (Edward) and woman, in love even though Faith is carrying the child of his dead brother. To complicate matters further, Edward's brother had only had sex with her because of a bet.As in all of Pat Ballard's books, Faith is not a size 6 ~ she never has been. She's a voluptuous woman with beautiful curves who has many of the same issues to overcome as the rest of us...distrust of men and feeling frightened, scared and vulnerable. I wish for all of you beautiful, strong women out there to find a man as beautiful as the men of which Pat Ballard writes. Maybe she will have a contest to appear in her next book with the man of your choice.Let's hope that Pat Ballard doesn't tire of writing because any of us who have taken the time to read her books will continue to look for the next one in print...at least I am!"},{"Title":"His Brother's Child","review":"Although enjoyable, this book seems aimed at a young audience. There were too many unanswered questions in my mind. I liked the characters. Faith Carr, a little distrustful of men and very unconfident about herself, finds she is pregnant after a one night stand. The father of the baby (Frank Brenner) doesn't want anything to do with her and later dies in a car accident. The father's brother, Edward Brenner steps in and offers a way to provide for the child. Marry him, have the baby and later divorce which will allow him to support her and the child.A little far fetched in this modern world - ever heard of trust fund - but ok we want a romance with some strife. It's just these two great characters are never fleshed out. What really makes them tick? The feelings are never explained in depth. Why does Edward fall in love with her so quickly? It would have been better to learn more about Frank - except for the fact he was \\"wild\\" and slept with Faith on a dare - we don't find much else about him. What did he say that made her trust him and what did Edward do that made her learn to trust again?This premise works better in Regency or early American romance when it was almost imperative a woman marry for the sake of her baby. See the recommendations above for one of each. But for a quick read with great characters you wish you knew more about; go for it. If expanded, I could have empathized with Faith a little more. There was also a mystery intertwined with the romance - it was ok; nothing special."},{"Title":"His Brother's Child","review":"Please note that the Writers Club Press edition of His Brother's Child is no longer in print.

There was very little description, and what there was was fery perfunctory and dry. The conversations were formal, using no slang or idioms, in other words not the way people talk. You are never given a clear idea of what the heroine looks like. Since she's hung up on her weight, it's kind of germaine to the plot! Is she a size 12 or a size 20? I wanted to know! There is a pretty laughable drug smuggling plot point, and no one seems to have a cell phone, much less a computer. The story seems to have a contempory setting, so some technology would be expected. The hero loves the heroine, but why? Just because of the way she looks? This is a very simple, VERY chaste love story, and it would be suitable for those who don't want sex in their stories, young teens, or a more mature tween.

There's a movie crew shooting the game and right next to the Dodger's dugout, Mickey sees the luscious and famous movie star, Florence Hampton. When the director asks for a man from each team as bit players, the Dodgers pick Casey Stengel and the Giants choose Mickey.The Giants lose the game (and baseball fans and non fans alike will appreciate Soos's short and vivid game descriptions), the glamorous Miss Hampton whisks Rawlings and Stengel away to film some scenes, then they're off to a champagne party. The next morning Mickey takes his hangover for a walk on the beach and finds Hampton's bloated body washed up on the beach. His friend, journalist Karl Landfors, talks him into investigating Hampton's death.Soos's simple, almost journalistic prose holds the reader captive in the early 20th century baseball world. Soos, a physicist at MIT, says he always liked \\"reading mysteries and doing physics mostly for the puzzle...I think Peter Lovesey's Cribb & Thackery series is what got me writing historicals.\\"He uses books, film and photos to learn how the cities looked in the early part of the century. \\"I do use actual incidents and players, then I start to play the game of \`what if?' to tie them together in a mystery plot.\\"Although I'm a baseball fan, I don't consider myself a fan of historical baseball -- at least I wasn't until I discovered Soos's series.

Among the movie crowd is Margie, the actress who continues in Mickey's life in other books. Also is a murder, of course, which despite the title, doesn't exactly happen at Ebbets Field, but has Dodger connections. Mickey must balance his loyalty to Coach McGraw with his affection for Margie, his re-connection to the unusual Karl Landfors (re-appearing from Murder at Fenway Park), and making more movies.

From chapter one, &quot;The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion&quot;, the only history of this nefarious document's origin that I have found, Heiden gives the most detailed background history of Germany and the surrounding nations. His ability to take you from the end of WWI into the turmoil and chaos of post-war Europe is unparalleled. Being German and having lived through that time, he is able to impart an understanding and a grasp of the forces pulling the German people into this malestrom of uncertainty, desperation and chaos that brought the German people to such a level of anxiety that they could readily embrace such a figure as Hitler. For anyone interested in how one of the high cultures in Europe could degenerate into madness in such a short time, this is a &quot;must read&quot;."},{"Title":"Der Fuehrer: Hitler's rise to power","review":"Very few books that I have read about Hitler go into this level of detail.He was an uneducated loner, born in Austria. He was desperate to be a part of Germany and ran to fight for Germany in the first world war. He was brave under fire. He couldn't get over Germany's defeat and blamed the Social Democratic Liberals, the Unions, the Marxists and of course the Jews. He hated organised labour and never held a job.When he was homeless and living in a men's shelter in Vienna, he wore a long raincoat and looked like the dirt poor Jewish immigrants roaming the streets of Vienna. Strangely his closest friends in the men's shelter were Jewish fellows who helped him out. While the other men in the men's shelter were out in the streets doing mundane jobs to bring in a few extra pennies, Hitler stayed indoors at the mens shelter and read up to 3 newspapers everyday, studying them in depth.When his \\"Movement\\" (ie National Socialism) started to take off in 1929, he was an insomniac and worked right through the night. He loved eating candy and never drank, smoked or socialised much with woman. He was a small little nothing who couldn't look anyone in the eyes, until you spoke to him about race or politics. Then the man was transformed, became loud, aggressive and obnoxious. He loved to lecture people about race and National Socialism.The book is long (700 + pages)...it goes into immense detail regarding Napoleon Bonaparte, the depression, the collapse of the German government and why the Germans of that era loved marching and military-like functions.Strangely, prior to becoming chancellor of Germany, Hitler was terrified of the German police and of getting deported, because he was an Austrian foreigner. After the Putsch, he kept a low profile to avoid getting arrested again. As his fame grew and more and more of the ultra rich (especially in big industry like mining), financed him, he started getting into the habit of having his chaffeur drive him around Berlin aimlessly. People would get excited when they saw him and he loved the attention.The book maintains that it was the war that transformed Hitler from a homeless nobody into a mesmerizing and charasmatic speaker. He was supposedly a political genius. He had a very low regard for all other people (from his experiences gathered in his homeless years). He loathed the German intellectuals and peasantry whether they had blonde hair and blue eyes or not. He saw no value in the life of individual people but only cared about the group value in the survival of the German volk.It was a tough book to read. But there are not too many books written by people who actual saw Hitler rise from a nothing and a nobody to a dictator. The book was written PRIOR to the world becoming aware of the holocaust. So except for the numerous speaches of Hitler where he constantly says that \\"The Jew is to blame for EVERYTHING\\", there is not much reference to the cataclysm that occurred when this animal came to power."},{"Title":"Der Fuehrer: Hitler's rise to power","review":"While even many of his followers believed Hitler to be a &quot;joke&quot; not a threat, and few people really believed his propaganda, he was able to pull the nation out of the post-WWI depression and achieve complete power over Germany! The welfare state became his power base -- and it's all explained in this magnificent book written while it was happening. Every United States Voter should read this book, especially in the dawning 21st Century."},{"Title":"Der Fuehrer: Hitler's rise to power","review":"Adolf Hitler has been the subject of scrutiny from every angle, so why bother reading another book about him? Because Heiden's book is not just an intellectual dissection of Hitler, it comes from the perspective of a man who heard Hitler speak and witnessed his rise to power firsthand.This is no dry \\"names and dates\\" account -- Heiden boldly interjects his opinion of the character of the prominent players, and the motives behind their actions. And Hitler is neither deified nor demonized. He is portrayed from the first as a man.Heiden is not impartial, but his partiality never comes across as vindictive or hateful. His book has the perfect balance of familiarity when helpful, and objectivity when necessary.This book is required reading for anyone who wants a complete picture of the National Socialist movement prior to the onset of the war."},{"Title":"Der Fuehrer: Hitler's rise to power","review":"I concur with the 4 other reviews here, especially the first note about the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. This book, written before the end of WWII, offers unique insights that aren't covered in most history books. I found this book on a bin of books that my college library was giving away. After a year on the shelf, my wife picked it up and brought it to my attention. It goes beyond the same cookie-cutter Hitler book that you might find in the history section. It offers a plausible narrative on the roots of the revolutions that replaced one tyrant with another. I'm not yet finished reading it and I already recommend it."},{"Title":"LA Leyenda Del Beisbol Cubano: 1878-1997 (Spanish Edition)","review":"A must read for cuban baseball fans...written in spanish with the cuban baseball flavor. Accounts of all major cuban baseball names with lots of interesting details. The best part is that it covers the major baseball events in which Cuban baseball players have been involved. It brought me many wonderful memories."},{"Title":"Kiss From a Rogue","review":"I was really looking forward to this book because I loved her first one about Sinclair and Jo Quincy. I was disappointed in this book, though and here's a list of reasons why: (1) Neither of the main characters had the same kind of spark as the ones in her first book; (2) even the cat in this one (Macbeth) lacked the pizzazz of Sir Ambrose; (3) too many characters! I needed a score card to track the plot; (4) I thought the plot was less intersting (smugglers?), and (5)I just didn't find Tony or Sylvia very appealing people. At least with Jo and Sinclair, there was wit and humor. With these two, he seemed directionless until he stumbles upon this village (not exciting to me) and she seemed just like any other female victim of the era--impoverished lady trying to solve her problems in a man's world."},{"Title":"Kiss From a Rogue","review":"Widow Sylvia Montgomery has been left with a bankrupt estate and with the whole poverty-stricken village depending on her, the only way they can survive is to continue their smuggling. The problem is that their only ship sank, killing her husband and most of the village's able-bodied men. So they have to deal with a lecherous, unscrupulous captain and a rival gang that's trying to take over their business.Tony Sinclair has been running his family's estate, but now that his elder brother has returned from the war, it's his job, and Tony's at loose ends. He decides he's been respectable and responsible long enough, so rather than take a job in the city, he goes traveling, and finds himself stranded in Sylvia's village, and decides the attractive widow would be a perfect start to his life as a rakehell.It's a fun story--warm and delightful. Sylvia's concern for the village and her acceptance of the responsibility, as well as her reactions to Tony, make her an appealing heroine. Tony's determination to become a rake, in direct contrast to his honorable and responsible nature is entertaining as well--there's something about a self-deluded hero that always appeals to me, I'm not sure why.Tony's solution to the village's dilemma is a little too facile, I thought--along the lines of the divorced woman in a contemporary being able to support herself and her extended family by baking cookies in her kitchen.Oddly, I guess the reason why this didn't grab me that much is that it was just too sweet--it felt like a Disney movie. (It's no coincidence that the product description calls it a cross between Pirates of the Caribbean and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.) The villains were a bit too 2-dimensional and easy to defeat; the conflicts were there, but there just wasn't a lot of meat to them.Still, it was a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Kiss From a Rogue","review":"This was a wonderful sequel to her first great book, WHAT AN EARLY WANTS. Without giving away the plot, I will say the heroine is brave and fun, the hero is to die for, the chemistry between them is great, and the story is exciting and just moves along. I read it in two days. This is a gifted author who we'll be hearing from a lot in the future (I hope). Do pick up this book, and her first one (I loved it!) for great escapism and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Kiss From a Rogue","review":"'Kiss From a Rogue' by Shirley Karr has smuggling, 'a want to be' Rake and widow who is trying to save her village.

In fact, I loved the whole series from this story line...I can't wait for more books to be published!"},{"Title":"Kiss From a Rogue","review":"In 1816 Dorset, the estate of Lady Sylvia Montgomery's late husband is bankrupt. Sylvia feels she must take action not out of some aristocratic obligation, but because she worries what will come of the locals; some families have already fled to Canada. Thus, the ingenious Lady assumes leadership of the local smuggling operation.While his brother served in the Napoleonic War, Lord Anthony Sinclair properly behaved as expected of the spare. However, now Benjamin the Earl has returned safely to London and married \\"Joe\\" (see WHAT AN EARL WANTS), a brilliant investor, who has made a fortune for him and the family, Tony has no idea what to do in life. He decides to become a rake while he ponders his future.Tony's skirt-chasing leads him to Dorset where he meets the beguiling widow who he knows has a secret that he plans to uncover and exploit to get Sylvia in his bed. However, he falls in love with her and he believes she reciprocates; but she is an earnest woman working at saving her villagers. To earn Sylvia's respect he must stay at her side, but is unprepared for the illegal events that unfold at Lulworth Cove.This sequel returns Tony on his romantic caper with another equally strong take charge female. The Regency story line is filled with plenty of action, but the real adventure is Tony's efforts to prove to his beloved Sylvia he will be there for her regardless of the escapades she leads them into; she assumes he is a wastrel. With her second wonderful historical, Shirley Karr shows she is no one hit wonder as readers will take immense delight in the gender bending battle of the smuggling sexes.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Personages, Cahier D'Activities","review":"It's an acceptable book but not worth it's cost. It accompanies the Personages text book as a workbook. It's great for learning french but not worth it's price."},{"Title":"Playwrights' Center Monologues for Men, The","review":"I saw my friend with this book in my acting class, and I asked if I could take a look through it. I read through about five different monologues, and when the class was over, I drove to the local theater bookstore and bought a copy for myself. I could have bought it over Amazon for a discount, but I just couldn't wait.The book contains 55 monologues. Most are standard 1-2 pages long, but some are relatively long. One in particular is 8 pages long, and is more of a short one-man scene than a monologue. In fact, only about half of the monologues are excerpts from plays. The rest are written to be a monologue (or a short one-man scene) from the scratch.I've read about two dozens now, and almost all of them filled me with inspirations. Very well written with lots of actable beats. While some are too long for most audition situations, there are still plenty of short monologues that will serve you very well. And as study/practice material (whether in-class or on your own), this book is a pure goldmine.This book belongs in every aspiring actors' bookshelf.p.s. There is a women's version of this book too. When I was at the bookstore, I read two monologues at random, and even though I was cold-reading a woman's part, I immediately got a sense of the character in the writing. I have zero doubt that aspiring actresses will find that book of immense value."},{"Title":"Cluttering","review":"Seriously, this book changed my life. But, I'm a clutterer, and I learned a ton about my speech disorder by reading this book. It probably wouldn't have the same life-changing results for everyone.This book is written for the speech pathologist, and there is a lot of technical lingo in it, but I found it pretty readable for the lay person.It talks a lot about the personality of a clutterer, which I found extremely helpful. Before I read this book, I felt like I was alone in the world and that no one understood me completely. When I realized that my personality traits were shared with clutterers, I no longer felt alone in the world. I also realized from reading why no one understands me completely.I can't say enough good about this book. I think it should be a must read for all SLP's (Speech Language Pathologists). Also, I think that the more that SLP's understand cluttering, that the more that they will understand the root of speech disorders.This book has a compilation of foundational research in it that has yet to be equaled. I'm glad that Amazon finally put it on their site, and that people are now selling it used.Also, I repeat that this book probably won't give everyone the miraculous results that it gave me. But, if you are a 25+ year old clutterer, with few or no secondary disorders or problems, then this book will change your life. And, if you're an SLP, you really should read it. You should have access to a technical library that has a copy."},{"Title":"WALKING THROUGH FIRE","review":"the quality is really good! i got a used the one, but it is in a perfect condition. and it is faster then my expectation."},{"Title":"D. H. Lawrence and Italy: 2","review":"D.H. LAWRENCE AND ITALY is composed of three stories: 'Twilight in Italy', 'Sea and Sardinia' and 'Etruscan Places'. The first two &quot;books&quot; seem to be based on journals he wrote while traveling with his German born lover then wife Frieda, whom he refers to as q-b for queen bee, through various villages on the mainland of Italy and the island of Sardinia. Lawrence does not record his experience of &quot;famous&quot; sights in these two books, in fact he says he is not interested in historical places, museums etc. but rather he wishes to see the people and the places in the out-of-the way areas of Italy. He and Frieda travel by bus, train, and boat--close to the ground.Those who have read Lawrence's fiction will recognize his writing. He describes what he encounters with a visceral language--people, clothing, food, establishments. Some of the places are stunning and some so filthy you wonder how he could have stayed overnight. He visits lemon and olive groves and various high places along the coast and in the interior valleys. His writing is graphic--the reader will be as appalled and enchanted. He reflects Italy just before and after WWI.In the third book, 'Etruscan Places', Lawrence describes his visits to various Etruscan sites, including the painted tombs of Tarquinia. His writing is less descriptive than that of the first two books. He is concerned with nothing less than the meaing of life, and the conflict between religion and truth (he died a few short years later at age 44 so his reflections seem almost prescient). He muses that societies are organized around death or life. He speaks of the use of fertility symbols such as fish and lambs for Christians and dolphins and eggs for Etruscans; the significance of the color vermillion -- male body painting by warrior classes where red paint connotes power contrasted with the the red skin coloring of the Etruscan tomb portraits which seems to have connoted the blood of life. He says the Etuscans loved life and the Romans who subdued them loved power.Lawrence's book provides good background for those who would know more about Italy. Many of the places he describes have changed since the 1920s--some for the better. The people have changed--their clothing, homes, etc. are less unique and colorful, but they are better fed, warmer in winter, and cleaner. Hopefully their lives are better, but I don't think Lawrence would agree."},{"Title":"D. H. Lawrence and Italy: 2","review":"These essays are classics. Etruscan Places almost single-handedly revived \\"modern\\" interest in the Etruscans and was essential to the preservation and study of their tombs and paintings. Throughout, Lawrence is sensitive and insightful. An added patina to these works is the fact that they were written in the 1930s during the build-up toward WWII. There is an immediacy mixed with nostalgia here that is compelling."},{"Title":"D. H.

Lawrence and Italy: 2","review":"If i were to read only two travel books then this would be the second one, although both my wife and an English friend read it in German translation and reported that it was terrible. Maybe it doesn't translate well. Lawrence, as young man, describes a thread running through his life as he starts the journey by heading south toward Italy on foot from Bavaria with Frida, a way of travel that many Germans still understand very well. Descriptions of people are attractive, like the one-legged Italian who tried to seduce the cold, northern women at a dance. I liked best his description of his own Alp&uuml;berquerung, his description therein of the hurried English hiker, the way that Italins have ruined the alpine valleys with industrialization. And I felt loss at his growing distance from Frida. The book made me want to see the lemon and olive trees above Lago di Garda and the villages high above the lake, but we haven't done that in spite of our nearness to the region. Gardasee is completely overrun by German tourists now, not just by those wearing heavy hiking boots."},{"Title":"D. H.

Word of warning - I picked it up as my first book on the subject and felt I was reading a foreign language. After reading three books about individual mystics, I again picked up Mysticism and found that the book was incredible and probably the best reference book ever written, or to be written, on this topic. I am sure I will refer to it again and again for further detail on certain ways of the mystics. It is apparent that this was Ms. Underhill's mission in life - to interpret and explain mysticism for all of us."},{"Title":"Mysticism;: A study in the nature and development of man's spiritual consciousness,","review":"What the world, which truly knows nothing, calls \`mysticism' is the science of ultimates . . . the science of self-evident Reality, which cannot be \`reasoned about', because it is the object of pure reason or perception.- Coventry Patmore, \\"The Rod, the Root, and the Flower\\"._Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness_ is a republication by Dover Publications of the twelfth edition of a work first published in 1911 by mystical writer Evelyn Underhill which attempts to shed light on the nature of mysticism in terms of philosophy, psychology, and mysticism itself through beautiful prose. Evelyn Underhill (1875-1941) was an Anglo-Catholic writer on mysticism, influenced heavily by Neoplatonism and her mentor the Roman Catholic mystic Baron von Hugel, who presented the teachings and writings of medieval Catholic mystics to a largely Protestant audience. This book discusses mysticism from a Christian perspective (emphasizing Catholicism in particular), though mention is made of some Moslem, Jewish (the Kabalah), and Oriental mystics. In this book, mention is made of such mystics as Philo, Saint Paul, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Plotinus, Saint Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, John Cassian, Saint Gregory the Great, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Saint Hildegard of Bingen, Joachim of Flora, Richard of Saint Victor, Mechtild of Magdeburg, Saint Francis of Assisi, Jacopone da Todi, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Jalalu \`d Din (Islam), Ramon Lull, Dante, Meister Eckhart, John Tauler, Henry Suso (part of the \\"Friends of God\\" movement), John Ruysbroeck, Thomas a Kempis, Margery Kempe, Richard Rolle, Julian of Norwich, Saints Catherine of Sienna and Genoa, Saint Ignatius Loyola (the Jesuits), Saint Teresa, Saint John of the Cross, Jacob Boehme (the \\"inspired shoemaker\\"), George Fox (Quaker), Thomas and Henry Vaughan, Saint Francois de Sales, Brother Lawrence, Madame Guyon (quietist), William Law (Quaker), Eckharthausen, Saint-Martin, and Blake (poet). Furthermore, the following anonymous mystical works are mentioned \\"Theologia Germanica\\", \\"The Mirror of Simple Souls\\", and \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\". Philosophically, Underhill emphasizes the psychological theories of William James (cf. _The Varieties of Religious Experience_) and R. M. Bucke (cf. _Cosmic Consciousness_), the vitalist theories of Henri Bergson, the theology of Karl Barth and Rudolph Otto, and in particular the writings of her mentor Baron von Hugel on mysticism.This book is divided into three main sections: \\"The Mystic Fact\\", \\"The Mystic Way\\", and \\"A Historical Sketch of European Mysticism from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Death of Blake\\". The first section attempts to define mysticism in terms of man's quest for Truth and the Absolute. It outlines the philosophical schools of Naturalism (shown to be problematic), Idealism (shown to be more appropriate to mysticism but limited), Philosophical Scepticism (shown to be self-refuting), and ultimately the mystical embrace of Reality. Underhill also relates mysticism to vitalism (mentioning the theories for example of Bergson) and psychology (mentioning the theories of William James and the nature of consciousness). Next, Underhill turns her attention to the characteristics of mysticism, attempting to outline the mystical type. Underhill also discusses mysticism and theology (noting the problematic relationship between mysticism and religious orthodoxy), mysticism and symbolism (noting symbolism in Dante and the Holy Grail symbolism for example), and finally mysticism and magic (referencing the works of Eliphas Levi and showing how mysticism and magic are in opposition mentioning the Kabalah, Hermetic science, and alchemy). The second section of this book is devoted to understanding the mystic way. Here, Underhill again goes over the traits of the mystic type. Underhill discusses the awakening of the self (psychologically a form of conversion emphasizing both the expansive and transcendent and the personal and immanent), the purification of the self (the need for the cleansing powers of perception, detachment, mortification, spiritual poverty, chastity, and obedience), the illumination of the self (noting the sense of the presence of God, the lucid vision of the world, and automatic activity and also mentioning \\"nature mysticism\\"), voices and visions (noting the difficulty in interpreting voices, visions, and automatic writing among mystics), introversion: recollection and quiet (noting the importance of contemplation and the degrees of orison, but also the dangers inherent in the perversion of this state in Quietism, mentioning the condemned writings of Madame Guyon who fell into this snare), introversion: contemplation (emphasizing that contemplation is \\"ineffable\\" and \\"noetic\\" and has two forms: the immanental and the transcendental also mentioning the \\"Via Negativa\\" and the \\"Divine Dark\\"), ecstasy and rapture (emphasizing trance, \\"pure apprehension\\", the perception of Eternity, and rapture), the \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" (showing the apparent loss of contact with God, its psychological and mystical character, and the painfulness of this occurrence), and the unitive life (emphasizing the role of \\"deification\\" and union with the divine at the culmination of mystical experience). The author concludes by noting the importance of these \\"spiritual pilgrims\\" in the development of religion and how even the common person may seek God in this manner. The third section of this book is devoted to a history of mysticism, emphasizing in particular the Christian mystics in Europe. The author notes the course of mystical activity, breaking it up into the Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance periods. The author explains that mysticism reached peaks in the third, fourteenth, and seventeenth centuries. The author then provides a list of the famous mystics.This book is a very important spiritual work for those brave seekers who attempt to search for the Absolute. The writing is beautiful, and the exposition of the mystical character is profound. It is certain to be of great solace to those who seek God in their lives and who hope to learn of the mystical masters."},{"Title":"Mysticism;: A study in the nature and development of man's spiritual consciousness,","review":"The author states at one point that only a mystic can write about mysticism, or rather about the true mystic experience. Conventional language, mere words, are poor tools for expressing transcendent reality. In spite of this I found myself exclaiming again and again during my reading that I knew exactly what was being described.The core here is that only Being can know Being, we behold that which we are, and we are that which we behold. There is a spark in man's soul which is Real and by its cultivation that we may know Reality. You can only behold that which you are. Only the Real can know Reality. If this resonates to you, if it sounds strangely familiar, then perhaps this work is for you.The mystic is drawn to the path by the force of love- the overriding desire for union with the Absolute. It is by this power that he or she is drawn to transcendent reality. This love leads to the state of contemplation which is the subtle state of consciousness that allows access to another plane. It is a form of consciousness recognized by Plato and Plotinus as well as Augustine and Aquinas. It is that form of consciousness beyond the emotional, intellectual, and volitional striving of ordinary men- a different way of knowing.The second half of the book is structured according to the pattern of awakening, purification, illumination, ecstacy and rapture, the dark night of the soul, and the unitive life. In no sense is it a \\"how-to\\" guide, but it is a most valuable validation for those who have travelled any way at all on the path. It has also been traveled by others.I find it significant that the author ends her appendix of biographical sketches with William Blake's death in 1827. There have of course been genuine, accomplished mystics since then, but the materialist and rationalistic world is more hostile to the testimony of the true mystic than the \\"dark ages\\" ever were.And yet Mystic Union is no less a reality- and no less obtainable by the boon of grace.After all, it is to know God that is our ultimate and highest purpose- all else is secondary if not ultimately trivial."},{"Title":"Mysticism;: A study in the nature and development of man's spiritual consciousness,","review":"The author states at one point that only a mystic can write about mysticism, or rather about the true mystic experience.

While I have read about the lives of Saints, this seemed to be an entirely new subject. A rigorous, almost analytical study, of the subject that seemed to move the subject out of the realm of this few selected to the common man.As an engineer, rather than a theologian, by trade I found the book just up my alley. She studied the subject and the people and put together a flow that covered the topic in stages with plenty of data and logic. How does the subject fit within philosophical and psychological frameworks? What is its core theology and symbolism? Is there a relationship with the occult, magic, and other religions?The book then turns to the mystic and the path commonly taken by these uncommon people. An otherness awoken, a process of purification and simplification, then a progression though heights of ecstasy and depths of darkness to the defining unitive life.My copy has helpful bullet points at the start of each chapter to let you know what you are getting yourself into. It also has a nice appendix of European mystics down through the ages.Yes, the book was written a long time ago and I did not agree with nor understand it completely.

He brings to life all the ancient tales of classical myth. All his works are filled with that wonder, that marvel at the vastness of the culture from which the story originated. Granted, I think this series should be meant for a higher reading level, as there are complex threads running beneath the tale, concepts of morality and honour that youngers won't understand.

Many parents have the difficult task of raising children that have experienced this type of abuse and there are so few resources available for them to understand the complexities involved in helping their children. This book covers topics of behaviors the child may express and how parents can cope and respond to those behaviors. MAny times the signs of the inner pain the child feels but can't express are seen through the acting out. With this book, the author discusses in great detail and in simple language the hard realities of the situation and gives helpful suggestions in dealing with the child. The majority of books are geared towards adults who are survivors of abuse who never told anyone of their experience as a child. When the child does speak out they can receive the proper guidance if parents and caretakers are informed about the circumstances they will encounter. Karen Johnson's book is informative and one I recommend to any family facing the long term affects of abuse."},{"Title":"Through the Tears: Caring for the Sexually Abused Child","review":"This is a fine book for a professional who is working with both the parents/caregivers and the child whose been abused.But it is an exceptional book for parents/caregivers, who have just learned about,or who are in the early stages of the stuggle and pain of dealing with a child who has been sexually abused.Both warm and caring in it's first person presentation, yet also with lots of practical ideas and steps that really need to be addressed."},{"Title":"The Dodge Brothers: The Men, the Motor Cars, and the Legacy (Great Lakes Books)","review":"This book is truly a must-read gem. It is the first academic book about the Dodge Brothers. Though it has many in-depth footnotes the book is absolutely readable and tells a nice story all in around 200 pages. It is perfect for the professor of history or the person just curious about Detroit or automotive history. The book is also full of great photos: images showing the brothers, their families, the cars and the plants where they were built.I, who know a lot about the Dodge Brothers and the Dodge Families, was surprised at what I did not know and what I learned from this book. Mr. Hyde puts to rest many rumors and brings to light much new information which is important to the history of car manufacturing in Detroit. Most importantly he shows how the Dodge Brothers supplied Ford with engines and all the mechanical parts for his first \`Ford' cars. Without the Dodges there would probably have never been a successful Ford. Then the Brothers turned to making their own car. Built with honesty and care the firm's cars became known as a solid and dependable. They were true innovators. When they both died in 1920 the company was on top of the world. A few years later the widow's of the Brothers sold the company for $146 million. And again a few years later it was sold again to Walter Chrysler, and is still today an important part of DaimlerChryslerThe Dodge Brothers were an amazing team and built an amazing company from sheer hard work and honesty, the true American Dream!

It also gives them from differnt viewpoints; for example how a person from a psychodynamic perspective would define a term versus a cognitive-behavioral therapist.The only downside to this book is that it does seem too technical at times.

It contains over 17,000 definitions of terms you would come across almost every day in Psychology. Put together by Psychologists Arthur S. Reber and Emily S. Reber, this is every Psychology students dream.The definitions are effective and easy to understand and there are even some definitions that seem utterly pointless. It covers all relevant fields within Psychology and also discusses how some definitions are incorporated into every day Psychological research and treatment. It also goes into detail on other more important concepts such as addiction.Although detailed and concise, the authors from the start make you aware that it's not a biography and does not hold definitions about important people in Psychology. It does, however, include the definitions that hold the name of the Psychologist that adds to certain important theories such as \\"Freudian Slip.\\" Along with the Psychologist definition, it also directs you to the exact psychological medical definition.Here are some examples of the definitions contained within to give you some idea of what to expect.InsomniaA general term for chronic inability to sleep normally, as evidenced by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent waking during the night, and/or early morning waking with attendant difficulty in falling back to sleep. In the vast majority of cases insomnia is caused by either anxiety or pain. Over the years a large number of synonyms have been used, including agrypnia, ahypnia, ahyposia, anhypnia, anhypnosis and other variations. The current view is that insomnia is not a single disorder but a complex group of related disorders, which has led to the suggestion that the term disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep be used in place of insomnia.AgraphiaPartial or complete loss of writing ability due to cerebral pathology, an analogue of motor aphasia. Several special forms are often noted.As you can see the definitions vary widely in size and detail, but there are also massive definitions that take up almost an entire page. As also indicated with the definition of Agraphia, there are many different variations of the same condition, but the dictionary is arranged which allows those variations of Agraphia to stay in linear fashion with the base definition so you don't have to be flicking through a number of pages to see the alternative types and what they do.It's a highly useful tool and is something worthwhile for all those embarking on a Psychology course in the future as I promise you'll be picking it up every 5 minutes."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Psychology, The Penguin","review":"I purchased this book as a \\"good to have\\" as a psych undergrad student.I consistently find that the term I want to check isn't there, or the definition is so vague as to be of no use.

This is the second of a magnificent trilogy, all with deceptive titles. His first, \\"In Anticipation of Development of Executive Information Systems\\", is a stand-alone masterpiece in its own right. The first several chapters of \\"In Anticipation\\" indeed sound like a serious technical dissertation, unless you're a computer geek like me and realize its all very clever, non-sequitur babble, perhaps intended to scare-off or, at the very least, confuse readers who have no patience or sense of adventure. By the fourth chapter, Harry begins to brilliantly unravel the preceding techno-maze to reveal a mind-blowing plot which continues unabated through the rest of the trilogy. Without giving any spoilers, I can say that this second installment and the third - \\"Revenge of Development of Executive Information Systems\\" pull no punches in tackling the serious issues of our time in provocative, but respectful ways. Midgets, trannies, barnyard animals, teh ghey, S&M;, goths, emos, Rick Astley, zombies, alien abductions of albino midgets and trannies, - the list goes on and on. Whatever you can imagine, Harry's already got it covered.OK, I've said enough. Unfortunately, the trilogy hasn't yet been offered as a box set.

In the story, a boy named Sakae is used by his parents in an attempt to get money without any actual work. Instead of money, they get the Seven Lucky Gods. Unfortunately, these gods aren't very helpful. This story and the last one were the worst in the book.The parts of &quot;Wasted Minds&quot; follows the adventures of three JCIA agents. There's Tamuro Gomi, who can teleport, but only from garbage to garbage, Yura Enjoji, who's really strong, and Sekoi, who is, I suppose, a regular human being. The &quot;Wasted Minds&quot; stories are the best in this volume, showing some of the quirkiness that can be found in Rumiko Takahashi's other works. There's also an attempt at romance, although I think that that should have been left out - it felt more like an afterthought, like it was tacked on. These stories made me laugh, but, once again, they weren't as good as some of the author's series.The last story was about a school club trying to make money by charging people for seances. Unfortunately for the people trying to make money, things don't go entirely as planned. Really, that's all there is to the story - it's very short, shorter even than the first story in this volume. I didn't think it was very interesting or very funny, and it's probably the weakest story in this volume for me.If you're a big fan of Rumiko Takahashi, you'll probably want to read this, but I don't think it's a keeper. Personally, I think it would be better to buy another Inu-yasha volume."},{"Title":"Rumic World Trilogy, Vol. 2","review":"There's one short story about a boy who gets to meet the &quot;seven lucky gods&quot; (which turns out not to be so lucky), five that are about a pair of young people with extra-sensory abilities (one teleports, one is super strong), and one about talking to the dead (&quot;The Entrepreneutiel Spirit&quot;). All are humorous to a more or lessor degree. If you enjoy the author, you might want to check this out.Note: this is VOLUME TWO of the Rumic World Trilogy."},{"Title":"Rumic World Trilogy, Vol. 2","review":"All right, those of you who have read Takahashi's later series such as Ranma , Maison Ikkoku, Inu-Yasha, and even Urusei Yatsura, have come to expect more from the great Rumiko Takahashi. None of the stories in here are really stand out stories, such as The Laughing Target, which was in the first volume. Some of them seem dragging, like The Golden Gods of Poverty and The Entrepreneurial Spirit. They feel like just a short, shallow attempt to make us laugh. At least in her other series, there's been an extended plot which truly gives her more things to draw on and the stories end up seeming very meaningful and funny, but in these everything comes to quickly. Well, with the slight exception of Wasted Minds. Wasted Minds feels kind of like the others, but it draws you in more and is longer (5 chapters instead of 1). For the best in Takahashi romantic/slapstick/comedy/action, definitely try Urusei Yatsura or Ranma , and if you want to lean more towards romance but you still want your fair share of zany humor and peeping Toms, try Maison Ikkoku, and if you're a fan of Fire Tripper or The Laughing Target (both in the first volume of the trilogy) then try Inu-Yasha. So for people expecting Takahashi at her best, try again, but if you want to see the origins of who is in my opinion the greatest manga artist ever, and/or is already a fan of Takahashi, this is a good buy. Just don't expect to be able to compare it to either of her four main series, all of which I've mentioned."},{"Title":"Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","review":"I bought this book sight unseen.

What a loss to society and the English language!As a film critic, he was not in a class with, say, Stanley Kauffmann for discussion of film quality and technique, or John Simon for bitchiness, but Crisp was a lovely English stylist, and his unique point of view made him a delightful companion at the movies.Even if you don't agree with his judgments, they are a hoot to read. This book has a sunny quality that contrasts with the acrid humor of his autobio, _The Naked Civil Servant_. While you might visualize him telling you that story over a stiff drink in a dark corner, the tone of this book is more like a breezy meeting at a teahouse.Of Cher, he writes, &quot;She is tall and rangy and so lean that you fear that her collarbone will saw its way through her hazardously thin shoulder straps.&quot; Since &quot;the French appear to think that they invented flirtation ... Their films on this subject are almost always pervaded by a cloying quality of self-congratulation.&quot; Of &quot;My Dinner With Andre,&quot; he says, &quot;I could not bring myself to make a report on it because it was as boring as being alive.&quot; Mr. Depardieu is &quot;the European equivalent of Mr. Nolte, though he lacks the golden skin tone, as of a basted chicken, which adds so greatly to the allure of the American star.&quot;Most of the pieces in this collection were written for a column in Christopher Street magazine, and the audience for that publication must be kept in mind with regard to some of his film choices -- and as Crisp, well into his 70s and 80s at the time, makes remarks such as &quot;sex is a mistake&quot; and &quot;homosexual men are pathologically incapable of making love with their friends or making friends of their lovers....&quot;Call this a lightweight junket.

But we gradually discover that it is in the struggle itself, in the following of this star, that the implicit goal is attained.Told in the framework of classic Greek mythology clothed in the dream world of a modern mind, redolent of a love of Nature personified and of all natural things, iconoclastic in its destruction of present-day hypocrisies and shibboleths, this allegorical adventure still points beyond the obvious to a Dawn Country, ever distant yet ever within us, awaiting the spirit bold enough to set out on the arduous journey.The four Books of which the allegory is composed, The Hunter, The Rites of Autumn, The Dark Tower Fell, and The Rites of Winter, trace the evolutionary struggles and aspirations of our protagonist, man, and of the gods he has created, from his most ancient beginnings as the maker, in his own crude image, of his first god, through a journey in time of discovery and insight; of pain and ecstasy; of triumph and defeat, leading to that highest of mountains, the final revelation of Zeus - outwardly his own creation, inwardly the embodiment of his essential self and the epitome of all that man is or ever wished to be. But in the end Zeus still eludes him - pointing to farther journeys and higher stars-to man's eternal pathway into the limitless universe of his own mind and being...."},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"If you buy this book, you will make the 22nd worst decision.The examples included in the book are not based in actual business decisions, irrespective of what the title says,althuough in the discussion of the examples chosen, the author tries to link the example chosen with daily business situations,with irregular success.Personally, I feel cheated by a misleading title.If you are a middle-to high manager, there is nothing there for you"},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"Stuart Crainer describes good management decisions made throughout history based on the ideas and insights of &quot;executives, consultants, academics, commentators, and opinionated people from the business would and elsewhere&quot;(p.xvi). The 75 greatest decisions are arranged under ten headings. They are Industry Inventors, The Name Game, Getting on, Marketing Magic, Lucky foresight, Leading by Example, Competitive Advantages, Bright Ideas, and People Power. Under each heading Crainer provides specific examples of decisions made and offers lessons learned. Although Crainer recognizes management as a scientific process and that management science has a place in decision making, he, also, contends that reality is often more complex than analytical models allow for. Crainer states that decision making does not always allow for consistent, systematized, or rational thinking. On human-side of decision making process, the author holds that emotion or prejudice also play a large part in the decision making process. He, also, contends that managerial decision making is based on intuition, experience, and analysis. While he believes analysis is a crucial part of decision making, he states that intuition and experience cannot be measured. He calls these components the &quot;mysterious art&quot; of management.In the section titled &quot;Industry Inventors,&quot; Crainer recognizes those who created a new industry. Examples range from a posting of an advertisement by a slave owner to locate slaves in 100 BC to Bill Gates decision to license MS-DOS to IBM in 1981. Most notables are the example of Henry Ford's decision to start his own company in 1903. Crainer argues that this decision led to the first industrial mass production line, created a market for automobiles, and provided and outlines for industrial production. Ford, also, saw the potential for international operations and established his first sales branch abroad in France in 1908. The lessons stated by Crainer were to create your vision and that flexibility is a must. He holds that Ford saw the potential for a mass market for automobiles and created a means to provide it. He, also, feels that Ford's inflexibility in production and limiting of choices caused him to lose ground. Ford failed to focus on the need for marketing.&quot;The Name Game&quot; section focuses on the importance of a name. While this section offers only three examples, the discussion of Thomas Watson, Sr. deciding to change the name of Computing Tabulating Recording Company to International Business Machines was cited. IBM had no international operations at the time, but Crainer describes this as a &quot;bold statement of ambitions&quot;(p.28). The lessons cited for this example include thinking big and thinking internationally.In &quot;Marketing Magic&quot; Crainer holds that marketing is the essence of business. He, also, describes that great marketing decisions are noted for their simplicity, opportunism, and success. Crainer quotes Philip Kotler as saying, &quot;Good companies will meet needs; great companies will create markets.&quot; (p.37) Richard Sears' decision to put his products in a catalog, thus opening a new rural market and the decision by Mattel to extend its Barbie brand by introducing Ken in 1961 are examples presented in this section. However, the lessons learned in the example of Harley-Davidson are invaluable. The example states the decision of Harley executives to start the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G) as a strategy that worked to get customers more involved with the brand. The lessons from this example include loving the product, connecting with customers, and making quality and issue. Crainer states that the executives' decision to form the group demonstrated a deep commitment to a product. At the time of publication, the H.O.G. had 325,000 members, demonstrating a true connection with customers. By using branding and name recognition for its products, Harley-Davidson also insisted on a high quality regime. Crainer describes that some decisions are based on luck, foresight, and gut reactions in the &quot;Lucky Foresight&quot; section. The most notable example in this sections that of the creation of the Walkman radio by Sony. Sony's chief Akito Morita is quoted as saying that &quot;the public does not know what is possible, we do&quot;(p.77) when faced with the need for market research. Morita envisioned the Walkman when he noticed that young people liked listening to music wherever they went. The lessons described by Crainer include starting with a philosophy, trusting your nose, and forgetting market research. Morita's philosophy help spawn Japan into an industrial power as opposed to the belief that Japanese products were substandard.The author illustrates the ethical elements to decision making in &quot;Leading by Example.&quot; He describes the decision of Aaron Feuerstein of Malden Mills to keep his business open and 2400 people on the payroll after a fire destroyed his factory. Crainer depicts Malden Mills as unusual for a business in 1995. In an environment of downsizing, Malden Mills held onto traditional corporate values of loyalty and trust. Feuerstein used his personal savings account to maintain the payroll for the 2400 employees displaced due to the fire. In return for his loyalty, the factory was back at almost full capacity in 90 days and the employees' productivity and quality increased dramatically. The lessons learned from this example are clear, ethics pay and businesses are a large part of the community and the community is a large part of the business.In the next section Crainer portrays examples of good organizational designs. Of note in this section is the description of Michael Dell's decision to bypass dealers and sell direct to consumers. The demonstration of supplying superior customer service, decreasing costs, and improving product design are just some of the lessons learned from this example. &quot;Getting On&quot; describes the need for managing your own career. Crainer states, The route to outstanding performance is to identify and improve your unique skills, and then find jobs or assignments that match your skills, values, and so on.&quot; (p.123). An interesting example used to illustrate this concept was the decision by Napoleon to promote people based on merit. In a time when inherited nobility determined promotion, Napoleon recruited based on talent, irrespective of nobility. The lessons from this are that talent rules and understanding motivation are crucial.&quot;Competitive Advantage&quot; heading begins with a description of Porter's five competitive forces. Crainer relates that competitive advantage changes and can be bought. Interestingly, Crainer depicts Harvard Business School in this section. Crainer proffers that &quot;no other school can match this potent combo of branding, finance, and ivy.&quot; (p.149). Crainer states that with the development of the Harvard Business Review and the HBS fund that Harvard created a place for itself. The major lesson learned from this example is customer loyalty. The Business School relies on alumni and donations to maintain its HBS fund for financial aid to its students.In &quot;Bright Ideas&quot; Crainer describes that you make your own luck. He states, &quot;luck may come your way, but you still have to convert it into business reality.&quot; (p.175). Crainer depicts the creation of McDonald's in this section. He describes how McDonald's began as the idea of two brothers and was developed by Ray Kroc. The lessons learned include seeing the opportunity, maintaining control, and insisting on quality.In his final section, &quot;People Power,&quot; Crainer recites the establishment of a center for executive development by GE in 1956. Ahead of its time, GE recognized the need to develop its managers and incorporate the organizational culture. Many companies such as. Ford, Intel, Apple, and Sun Microsystems, have since followed suit. The lessons here are in developing people for the future and that leaders must teach. Unfortunately, Crainer did not take as much care in describing bad decisions as he did with great ones. The 21 worst decisions may be placed for humor rather than true learning. Examples include the selling of the bottling rights for Coca-Cola, Apple's refusal of cloning its operating system, Xerox's turning down the first PC, and the failure of Matsushita to license Betamax resulting in the commonplace VHS video. Crainer does not delve into the reasoning behind these poor decisions to offer any true lessons from the results.Crainer, while acknowledging the existence of analysis in decision making, seemed to place a much greater focus on gut feelings as a basis. I am sure that all of the great decisions involved much more analysis than described in this book, however, it was refreshing to note that relying on your gut is still acceptable, when it works. I am assured that since one can justify, and communicate his decision that any means necessary to reach it are reasonable and defendable. However, de"},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"Anyone coming into this book looking for a deep case study of decisions will be disappointed. This book is more of an introductory survey course into business decisions made - the decision is cited, given a page of explination and the lessons to be derived are bulleted to end the section. Some of the decisions are a stretch - noting the posting of a reward for a runaway slave as the first example of advertising. It's as if he took a number of management textbooks, distilled them into one cliff notes version and presented it in themed chapters. Yet that is why the book is so informative - you are exposed to a wide variety of decisions with the meat extracted for quick digestions. Decisions are stripped from a lot of their extraneous outcomes, and focus is put on what makes them great (or worst in the appendix). It is a launching point - giving you examples and letting you think beyond the story. The reader is left to ponder many of the points brought up. It is to show you how seemingly little things (Microsoft retaining the right to license DOS to other companies) can build empires. Sit down, read and absorb the examples, and then try to apply them to your decisions."},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"This is an interesting collection of short (1 to 3 pages) accounts of management successes. However, I went into it hoping to get insight into the decision process of great managers and did not find it. In fact, it was not even clear whether these were good decisions or merely good outcomes.\\"The Greatest Lessons\\" that followed each account were interesting, but they had no cohesion. In fact some were contradictory: \\"Style is all\\" (decision #2) or \\"give people something that is useful and informative\\" (23)? \\"Move on\\" (4) or \\"persist and then persist some more\\" (10)? \\"Change constantly\\" (16) or \\"continue the legacy\\" (19)? \\"Trust your nose\\" (24) or \\"innovations need believers\\"(25)?

You can probably find a story here to back up any management theory you choose."},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"I give this book 3 starts - not because of all the lessons I learned but because I enjoyed getting some of the history behind the decisions and about some of the companies. I think other than enjoying this history in some of the stories (which because of the way it is written it is easy to pick up and put down - and skip to the next if not interested) I would have given it two stars.I found that while in some cases Mr. Crainer would bring up new companies and share some interesting insight, in many others he focused on the same companies (HP, IBM, Ford). I would have like to have had good decisions made by one company in 'One' of the decisions instead of in a number of them.Frankly, I was also disappointed by the &quot;21 Worst&quot; as well. #17 for example read: &quot;American Express's travails deserve mention. An almost dysfunctional management team led by CEO James Robinson III damaged the Amex brand. Robinson's grand strategy to turn the company into a financial supermarket collapsed. In 1993, Robinson was replaced as CEO by Harvey Golub, but not before the company's Shearson Lehman brokerage subsidiary had eaten up about $4 billion in capital before being sold off.&quot;That's it. There is nothing to describe what it is that happened to creat the $4B capital loss or the decision that went into making it the worst. I struggle to see what learning or benefit I, as a reader, can gain from this &quot;worst decision&quot;. Other sited decisions, in my opinion, were similar.Unless you are interested in some history about some of the companies/decisions, I would recommend spend your reading time on another book."},{"Title":"The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made: ...and 21 of the Worst","review":"Great authors, historians, musicians, and sports stars are usually included in end of the year \\"best\\" lists.

A stark vision of the devastation of war as it shredded the fabric of the Korean culture. The book is every bit as poignant today as we welcome home the heroes of another foreign war fought in a beautiful but rugged landscape. The technology has evolved but not the commitment of men and women to bring betterment to a people. The Korean War was only half successful; half of that nation is a stable democracy. But the suffering of both the soldiers sent there and the Korean people was great. This story is told from the perspective of a boy, torn by the difficulties and destruction he witnessed.

Bonington chillingly describes the survivors' long wait and gradual realization that something has gone terribly wrong. No one really knows what happened to Boardman and Tasker, especially since their bodies were later found, indicating they were not killed in a fall as Bonington surmised. This book cannot illuminate the mystery, but can illustrate the magnitude of our loss."},{"Title":"Everest, the Unclimbed Ridge","review":"\\"Everest: The Unclimbed Ridge\\" is the story of the 1982 British attempt on the then-unclimbed Northeast Ridge of Mount Everest. Co-authored by Sir Chris Bonington and Charles Clarke, it illustrates both the thrills and deadly perils of extreme high altitude alpine-style climbing.Bonington put together a light but elite team for his 1982 expedition, featuring himself and accomplished climbers Pete Boardman, Joe Tasker, and Dick Renshaw, backed by two support climbers, Adrian Gordon and Charles Clarke. The first part of the book is a quick recap of previous climbing on Everest, following by a fascinating narrative of the team's journey to its base camp on the North side of Everest.The struggle to forge an alpine-style route up the Northeast Ridge is candidly portrayed by Bonington and Clarke. Their narrative is supplemented by quotes from Pete Boardman's diary and letters. The team, climbing at over 8,000 meters without oxygen and with only limited use of fixed ropes, makes slow and painful progress over challenging terrain.After weeks on the mountain, things begin to go wrong. All the climbers are physically deteriorating from too much time at high altitude. Chris Bonington, then in his late 40's, discovers he can no longer keep pace with his younger counterparts. Dick Renshaw suffers two minor strokes and must be evacuated to medical care. Pete Boardman and Joe Tasker make one last try at the summit, and disappear.Boardman's body would be found years later on the ridge near where he and Tasker were last seen from a distance by Bonington and Gordon. The Northeast Ridge would finally be climbed, with fixed ropes and supplemental oxygen, in 1995. These facts were obviously unknown to Bonington and Clarke when they closed out this narrative in 1983. The reader is left with a poignant mystery and the enduring question of high altitude climbing: was it worth it?This book is highly recommended as a fascinating and well-written narrative of a high altitude expedition and its effects on the climbers."},{"Title":"Everest, the Unclimbed Ridge","review":"Great Book!First half is a bit slow - discussing the history of Everest, and then the excitement builds as the adventurers start their way up!Not as \\"sensational\\" as \\"Into Thin Air\\", but I enjoyed it more.Definitely recommended..."},{"Title":"Everest, the Unclimbed Ridge","review":"Wonderful book.

Although, she had hated the conspiracies and the intrigues of the life he lived, she loved and was proud of his commitment and loyalty to his country. As he lay dying in her arms he made her promise to return to England to collect her inheritance then leave as quickly as possible for her safety's sake. Having not set foot on English soil for nearly 12 years she really did not know anyone. Lord Justin Barclay was a distant relative many times removed and had arranged for her to stay at his Aunt's home. Justin was handsome enough to turn any ladies head but Evelyn was determined it wouldn't be hers and difficult as it would be, she would try to learn the truth surrounding her father's death.Lord Justin Barclay, handsome and titled, was not all as he appeared. He'd been working undercover as a spy for some years now and because of family connections he was selected to ferret out the secrets of Evelyn's father's last assignment. As beautiful as Evelyn turned out to be he looked forward to spending time with his very lovely new assignment. What he was not expecting was to be so enchanted that rather than looking to entrap her and prove her of treasonous activities, he would be more apt to prove her innocence.This was my first book by this author and I was totally immersed in the romance and mind twisting intrigue almost from the very first pages. This was a difficult book to lay aside both from a sensual and mystery standpoint. Just when you would think that circumstances between the two protagonists were settling into a set pattern for the usual historical romance scenario, another betrayal event would set you off down another road of twists and turns keeping the intrigue level high! And if the intrigue doesn't keep your interest piqued the sensual by-play certainly should! Sprinkled throughout you are introduced to some very strong and vivid secondary characters as well that I certainly hope to see expanded upon for sequels. I'd love to see what happens to Angel Arolas when cupid finally targets him! However, one of the aspects that I truly enjoyed in this story was to see such a strong caring heroine, turn what appeared as a strong and self assured gentleman into a \`real' man who ended up taking charge of his life to suit what was best for him! This was an extremely satisfying read and one that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"All Men Are Rogues","review":"This book is fast paced and sexy. You'll fall in love with these characters. Evelyn Amherst, the heroine, is intelligent, savvy and more street smart than any character I've come across in a romance novel. Definitely more street savvy than high society realizes. She has to be.Justin Barclay is a man looking for a way out. He's tired of the double life he's been leading and the guilty burden he's been carrying for far too long. His secrets are killing him.Both these people start off using each other as pawns. For Evelyn, Justin is an innocent escort through a world she left long ago and needs to master once again in order to save herself. For Justin, Evelyn is his last assignment- if he plays his cards right.Once you crack the spine on this one, you'll be hooked. The writing is GREAT. The characters truly come to life. The mystery will absolutely keep you rivetted. If you want an incredible escape, this is a no-brainer. BUY THIS."},{"Title":"All Men Are Rogues","review":"I just couldn't stay interested in this book. I wanted to. I wanted to root for these characters but I just wasn't feeling it. Perhaps there should have been a little more character development in the beginning and more interaction to develop the relationship. It tends to go off on thoughts for too long that are also repetitive. I could not feel the emotion between the characters and found their obstacles boring. It seemed like it was supposed to very suspenseful, but it wasn't. Angel would be a good character for another book...if there isn't one already. This is the first book I've read by this author. I just think there should be more work on developing the emotional connections of the characters (between all of them) and better editing of their thoughts. These were likeable characters and I think they were sold short in this one."},{"Title":"All Men Are Rogues","review":"This was my first book by Sari Robins and I will certainly look for more of her books. For me, this started a little slowly - I just didn't feel the connection between Jusin and Evelyn. Maybe it was becuz she actually liked him - in most books there is the immediate tension. Of course as you continue into the story you find more than enough tension - enough so you are never certain whether this couple will ever get together. The intrigue with the masterful plot of treason and the motive behind the colonel and his quest to capture Evelyn make for a very good story. In the end this was a beautiful love story and I thorougly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"All Men Are Rogues","review":"reality check: Romance heroines have come a long way, with or without the bodice-ripper clinch and the Ah-nold type heroes on the cover. And villains have come a long way since the mustache-twirling melodrama maniacs. They may even be spymasters for British Intelligence who have none of Bond's sensuality or M's ethics, but plenty of flaws cloaked in duty to king and country. Lord Tristram Wheaton intends for Lord Justin Barclay to carry out a mission vital to homeland security. Trouble is, Justin has to kill a woman suspected, like her father, of being a traitor to the British crown. However, Justin starts to fall for the lady as romance turns Hitchockian in the best \\"Notorious\\" sense, with hero and heroine guilty over divided loyalties and conflicts of the heart.The novel's heroine and spy target Lady Evelyn Amherst is as emotionally guarded and scarred as Ingrid Bergman-at least when it comes to the subject of love or marriage.Despite a determination to finish her murdered father's mysterious last mission, she feels guilt over deceiving while lusting after Justin, who she seduces in marked contrast to yesteryear's frightened breathless passive miss submitting to the hero's wicked desires despite herself.Evelyn and Justin's emotional and suspenseful journey is no less bold, taking them through tangled loyalties, discoveries of each other's true mission. Is the mission marriage? Ah, but a rogue wouldn't give away the ending..."},{"Title":"All Men Are Rogues","review":"I bought this book together with &quot;Her Scandalous Intentions&quot;, and after reading that one (which by the way was a total disappointment) I let this one sit unread for several months, until the other day I found myself with nothing else to read, so I grabbed this one. And almost put it down again when I came across all the mistakes in the forms of address. Justin is called &quot;Lord Justin Barclay&quot;, which made me assume he was the younger son of a Duke or a Marquis, so he held a courtesy title. But then we read that he is the Marquis of Rawlings, in which case his title would be &quot;Lord Rawlings&quot; not &quot;Lord Barclay&quot; or &quot;Lord Justin Barclay&quot; and his mother would be &quot;Lady Rawlings&quot; not &quot;Lady Barclay&quot;. You would think that the author would know these basic facts, or at least her editor would. Does anybody check these books for errors before they are printed? I'm not an expert in the matter, and even I knew that. I think it is embarrassing.And talking about his mother, I did not like her, but neither did I like the way he treated her when he finally stood up to her. I think he was a little harsh. Granted, his mother was a harpy, but she was still his mother, and he always said that he knew deep down she loved him, so I had hoped for reconciliation and maybe a little mellowing on her part. But anyway, it is the author's right to work out the situations as she sees fit, after all it is her novel, I'm just expressing what I would have preferred.Other than that, the rest of the book was fairly good. Entertaining, fast paced and romantic. I liked the fact that the hero Justin is sweet and tender and vulnerable and at the same time dangerous and sensual.I loved Angel, and hope he gets his own novel. Oh, and by the way, if she is going to include Spanish words in her writing she should get advise on how to use them properly from someone who actually has good knowledge of the language. For example, when Angel says &quot;You English are [chiflado]&quot;, it should have been &quot;chiflados&quot;, since he is talking in plural and in Spanish the adjective changes depending on whether is being used in singular or in plural. I know this is not big deal, and most readers won't even notice, but anyone who speaks Spanish would.I know that by my review, it doesn't sound as if I liked the book, but I really did. I'm just writing about the mistakes in the hope that if the authors or the editors ever read the critiques, will try to fix these errors before they are printed. Little things like that take away from a good story and ultimately give a bad name to the genre."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"I am falling in love with this series and all the characters in it!

She goes to stay in the tower hoping to find her own true love. What she finds that night is Erik Sinclair instead, although she does not know it until the morning. Erik has paid a bride price to Alexander (Vivienne's brother) and has promised to wed her in the morning but flees with her instead. With the help (and hindrance)of her family and a spriggan named Darg their journey is wonderfully unexpected!All the characters we meet are very well written.

The fairy is the best part of this series."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"Once again Claire Delacroix has ceated another 'can't put it down till I'm done book'. I won't repeat the story line as others have done so beautifully and I do think the book is a five but I must mention a couple of things. It seemed the story was cruising along and suddenly it just wrapped right up without much ado. Things could have been a little more graphic or 'something'? Also I was quite disappointed with Tynan and Roseamunds story line towards the end of the book. Not to despoil it but what the heck happened there? Does anyone else out there think they will return somehow in book 3 or is that just wishful thinking on my part? I did so adore them as a couple and I have to know what became of them and that dratted \\"Darg\\". I guess that's what keeps us waiting for the next instalment."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"In all fairness, before I review, I would like to say that my mother-in-law absolutely loved this book and the one before it in the series and she loaned it to me, absolutely convinced that even though I only thought the first one was okay, I would fall in love with this. That said...Pros:-no grammar errors or typos that I noticed-the H/h of the previous book did not make a celebrity appearance in this one (though they were referenced and talked about)-Rosamunde's (the Aunt) character was gone into a bit more (she was indeed the pirate, clothes and all, that I thought she was from the first book) and you get a nice little scene of her opening up-This book STAYED in third person POV (no randomly switching to second person/addressing the reader, thank goodness)Cons:-The Hero, Heroine, Brothers, Sisters, storyline, characterization, everything else about the book I could possibly think of...I'm really not trying to be harsh. As I clearly stated at the beginning, someone whose opinion I generally respect enough to get a book recommendation from LOVED this. I very clearly did not.The heroine is in her early 20s and fully believing in fairies, when in the last book everyone was mocking the 12 year old sister for doing so. And when I say fully, I mean expecting at any moment for them to actually come in and sweep her off her feet to a fairy realm. After she referenced for the fourth time or so that she felt foolish or had acted a fool (within the first 25% of the book) and THEN declared that though she was impulsive she had never been foolish, I actually, IN REAL LIFE, called her a stupid liar (out loud!) and put down the book. Only at my MIL's assurance (that it did get better) did I picked it up again. Next thing you knew she was randomly calling down birds to perch on her arm, getting thrown off a galloping spooked horse, and merrily singing while the stereotyped old family friend laughs at the bawdiness of it all (having, of course, been all but screaming in terror that she was an evil sorceress a few lines earlier). All within about 3 pages.And the fact that she cannot tell the difference between reality and fantasy for the first half of the book, constantly acting irrational, saying one moment that she despised the H and the next forgiving him absolutely and spreading her legs? Of course, THIS is the section where all the sordid intimate scenes are. And I really had to skim over those because it was felt dirty, even morally wrong to read it, as if someone was taking sexual advantage of a handicapped child, a child who had no way of knowing right from wrong and whose mind couldn't be trusted to handle reality. This is all in the FIRST HALF.Of course, the second half apparently she snaps out of dreamworld apparently and is focused on \\"the quest\\" and the spriggan Darg shows up again (now able to be seen, felt, and heard by more than just Elizabeth-the-12-year-old-who-is-NOW-considered-wise. There is a tiny itty bitty bit of conflict at the end and everything is resolved extremely quickly and neatly (Of course. *spoiler* HEA! *end spoiler*)Did I mention the brother setting up his little sister to get raped/knocked up by some guy he didn't know (and who showed no proof of identity, whom he instructed the guards to ignore all pleas for help) for a sackful of money? (First chapter). And only getting upset when the H didn't show up at the alter the next day (because having someone keep an eye on a stranger who only gives you their word they'll do the right thing is apparently too sensible). REALLY? And of course, this is one of the many \\"pranks\\" their beloved brother pulls. And they all still love and revere him anyway. Riiight.I will not be reading any of the rest of this series and, having completely read the book being reviewed, regret having read it at all. TSTL heroine, TSTL family members, stereotyped cast members on all of the H's side, and nobody was actually really likeable. The H showing promise of a solid (if flat) character but (at best) still pitiable/simply there and set against a heroine (and rest of cast) who did not bring out any spark of chemistry or feeling other than wanting to gouge my eyes out with a spork.I do NOT recommend."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"In 1421 Scotland, Alexander, Laird of Kinfairlie, feels euphoric about his marriage auction that worked so well in spite of the objection of the bride, Madeline the oldest of his sisters. Alexander blithely ignores all that went wrong as he keeps thinking all's well that ends well as Madeline, who previously refused to marry, is happily wedded to Rhys Fitzhenry.The successful brotherly matchmaker turns to Vivienne though Alexander plans to improve the process since the Madeline caper (see THE BEAUTY BRIDE). He thinks he found the solution when Nicholas Sinclair, the man who broke Vivienne's heart years ago, arrives to court his beloved as he can offer a home since his older brother Erik has been disowned. Nicholas insists he bed her in her tower where she awaits his return so that she has no choice but to marry as he needs a bride and heir rather quickly to deflect any estate challenges. Rationalizing he needs the coins for the other sisters, Alexander agrees. Vivienne and her beau enjoy the night together until morning light reveals cynical Erik as her mate and he insists she will begat him a legitimate heir.Though similar in design to the first Kinfairlie medieval romance, THE ROSE RED BRIDE has a flavor of its own because Vivienne and Madeline have different personalities. The story line is fun due to Erik's denials that he loves her while vivacious Vivienne believes they were destined together, but rejects his cold insistence that she is an heir breeder. Fans will enjoy Alexander's latest matrimonial fiasco and look forward to the next jewel Snow White in the fall.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"I liked the quick pace and engaging characters felt like I was taken back in time, quick and easy read."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"Vivienne Lammergeier is, by far, one of the stupidest heroines I've ever had the misfortune to read about. Granted people were less educated and believed in fairies and magic at the time, but she takes the cake. After hearing a story of magic and fairy lovers from her brother, she wants to reenact the fairy tale for herself and claim her own fairy lover. She is met in the tower by a man and willingly gives herself to him on the spot without his name, seeing his face or knowing his intentions toward her. That's just plain dangerous. She was so stunned and surprised and hurt when the man who appeared was actually mortal. I couldn't muster one iota of sympathy for her. Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!As for her brother, he acted like a man does and did at the time, using her love of tales against her, not investigating her suitor more or asking her opinion if she actually wanted to marry the man who showed up at her door. Not liking him much either.As a whole, the trilogy is really good. This book, however, is an unfortunate train wreck you have to force yourself to get past to enjoy the larger story.I understand why the hero acted as he did and why he made the choices he did.

Different from others I have read."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"THE ROSE RED BRIDE by Claire DelacroixJanuary 22, 2006This is the 2nd book in the trilogy that began with THE BEAUTY BRIDE. Set in Scotland in the 1400's, each book focuses on a different person in a family that had lost their parents a few years previous and brother Alexander is now Laird of Kinfairlie. The first book had the oldest sister, Madeleine, married off via an auction. This second book has Alexander asking \\"Nicholas\\" to take the next oldest sister, Vivienne, to bed, and then supposedly having them marry the following morn. What happens instead is that Nicholas is really not who he says he is, but is really the brother, Erik. Nicholas had been a suitor that Vivienne had spurned before, and Erik came for Vivienne, knowing of this fact. Instead of marrying Vivienne, he steals her away and finally tells her his story, of how he was left for dead and his wife had gone missing. He had two young children living with Nicholas, and Erik needed to save them from whatever fate Nicholas had in mind for them. As Vivienne has already fallen in love with Erik, she is willing to trust him and decides she will help him regain his rightful place at Blackleith, save his children, and hopes that Erik will fall in love with her and eventually marry her.I enjoyed this book as much as I did the first one. I think these books are enjoyable when read in the right frame of mind. They are historical romances, and I think period pieces are not for everyone. I do find that Delacroix does a great job writing these historical romances and I hope to read her third book in this series (The Snow White Bride)."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"Setting - Kinfairlie, coast of Scotland, 1421 --- In the second installment of the Jewels of Kinfairlie, Alexander, laird and brother of five sisters, is continuing his quest to marry off the two oldest sisters while pondering the fate of Kinfairlie's ability to manage over the winter. Having successfully married Madeline the eldest, Vivienne the second eldest was proving to be a more difficult challenge. Now as luck would have it a man claiming to be Nicholas Sinclair, a former suitor of Vivienne's, came to Kinfairlie not only requesting the hand of Vivienne but offering a pouch full of silver along with a condition that Alexander was finding totally objectionable. Nicholas wanted to BED THE BRIDE before the marriage took place! With severe misgivings and the fate of Kinfairlie weighing in the balance, Alexander agreed believing the man's word of honor that the wedding would take place the very next day. Alexander was convinced of the man's honorable intentions and believing Vivienne would be pleased with what he believed was her former suitor, he came up with a plan to meet the suitors demands. Unfortunately, this would be the second time Alexander's best intentions for wedding his sisters would fail miserably.Knowing his sister Vivienne's predilection for adventure, Alexander that evening told a tale that was designed specifically to entice Vivienne into innocently sealing her own fate. Thinking that she would be meeting the man of her dreams Vivienne crept to the tower room that night ready to meet her destiny, a mystical \`fairy' lover. Into the darkness a hooded lover crept thru the tower window and commenced to making slow sweet love to Vivienne. Unfortunately the morning light revelations would shatter her dreams. The dream lover turned out to be Erik Sinclair, older brother of Nicholas and his intentions did not include marriage, unless Vivienne could deliver him a son!-- In a wonderfully ORIGINAL sequel to THE BEAUTY BRIDE, Claire Delacroix has fashioned an exciting action packed sensual romance. Our heroine, Vivienne was absolutely marvelous having every right to throw a HUGE hissy fit the next day when she discovered her \`fairy lover' was no fairy and had taken her maidenhead with no immediate plans of marrying her! Instead, she was ready to go along with a hand-fast, believing deeply that the sweet loving person she laid with was truly the person that was hidden beneath the tortured and scarred warrior she discovered in the morning. Jam-packed with lively characters (such as Darg the impish spriggan and Elizabeth the youngest sister who was the only one to see and hear the naughty fairy), the author delivers non-stop action, amusing scenarios, and some poignantly loving reunions. This is Delacroix at her very magical best penning in the medieval / fantasy genre where in my opinion she simply shines! I am eagerly looking forward to the last of this trilogy when the two sisters team up to give their brother, Laird Alexander his well-earned comeuppance!

Great writer, great setting and loved the chivalry."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised in the Red Rose Bride. There were kidnappings, daring escapes, voyages and fairies in this magical romance. This novel is entertaining due to the plot and the characters.Vivienne's brother Alex, Laird of Kinfairlie tells her a story about how a maiden can be wooed by an immortal man in the castle tower. Vivienne who loves fairy tales believes this wholeheartedly and awaits her dream lover in the castle tower that very night. She has no idea that her brother has made up this tale only to lure her into the tower so she can be stolen away by Eric Sinclair. Earlier, Alex had agreed to a marriage between Vivienne and Eric. But Alex was also fooled because Eric lied to him about his identity. He claimed to be his younger brother.Vivienne, indeed, meets her dream lover and is utterly shocked the next morning when this man proves himself mortal. He kidnaps her stating they will not wed but instead have a handfast marriage of a year and a day. Vivienne is rightfully furious but when she discovers that Eric needs her assistance to free his two daughters from the clutches of his nefarious brother she is more than willing to aid his cause.These two meet up with angry relatives and mischief making fairies and over the top servants. Through it all Vivienne never wavers in her support for Eric. She is loyal even in the face of adversity. Eric at first is secretive but as he spends more time with Vivienne, he cannot help but be charmed by her and soon shares the mysteries of his past. This is a fun novel full of magic and mayhem."},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"GREAT DEALER FAST AND EFFIENT RECIEVED WHAT WAS ORDERED I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS DEALER AGAIN WITH NO THOUGHTS THANKS"},{"Title":"The Rose Red Bride","review":"I liked the first book and was happy to buy the second (third has such bad reviews I am not even tempted). I have stopped reading even though I am 75% done. I just can't read anymore how much a fool the heroine makes of herself. She is an absolute idiot. The eldest brother, who I disliked in the first book, doesn't learn his lesson and repeats stupid acts.

They had execellent songs that spanned the first 100 years of Amerian folk music.This is not the set. If you were looking for the original set, you'll be disappointed. The songs are by in large obscure and the number of songs is limited.In other words, I'm sorry I bought this set.

I recommend this book to my students who want to start playing jazz piano, but haven't learned about chord symbols. Dan Hearle's book provides to material they need to know."},{"Title":"Poetry Please Eman Poet Lib #09 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"This is a collection of truly popular poetry: It contains the poems most people wanted to listen to when the BBC asked them to make suggestions for a programme of poetry readings. Not surprisingly the listeners preferred melodic rhymes and accessible contents. There is some light verse, but poems about the English countryside vastly outnumber it. I was surprised that even towards the end of the 20th century poems such as Rupert Brooke's &quot;Grantchester&quot; or Edward Thomas' &quot;Adlestrop&quot; are the ones English people love best. At the end of the day the collection tells us quite a lot about the way cultured English people saw the world, their country and themeselves in the 1980s. It may be frustrating for most contemporary poets, but the people seem to prefer sentimental ballads to anything even remotely daring - it is as if Ezra Pound and his followers had never lived.P.S. Charles Causley wrote the introduction to the book and contributed one of the poems (a fairly sentimental ballad, as it happens), but this is NOT A COLLECTION OF CAUSLEY'S POETRY!"},{"Title":"He went with Christopher Columbus,","review":"This story reminded me a lot of the Count of Monte Cristo. After Peter's uncle tries to kill him, Peter joins Columbus' crew in order to escape, and assumes another identity until he dramatically reveals himself to his family. I also liked the fact that the author showed both sides of Columbus' journey; the glory, the gold, the wealth, but also the Indians that were enslaved, Columbus' sad last years, and the greed that corrupted the expedition. Great read!"},{"Title":"Angels In The Fire: A POWERFUL STORY OF OVERCOMING","review":"This book is a true story of one's man power to overcome a extraordinary difficult childhood. It demonstrates strength of spirit and shows how one's troubled past does not always have to lead to a troubled future. It also shows that although our earthly lives may be difficult, we are supported from a spiritual realm. This was one of those books I didn't want to put down. It is a well written, inspirational and hopeful book."},{"Title":"Angels In The Fire: A POWERFUL STORY OF OVERCOMING","review":"I am a fan of biographies and memoirs and this one reminded me of A Child Called It by Dave Pelzer--- only without the graphic abuse. This man as a child went through abandonment by being passed from foster family to foster family, but the great part of the story is how he not only survives, but succeeds in the end. Great show of how our lives are led by purpose and trials make us stronger."},{"Title":"The Presidents' Own White House Cookbook","review":"Published in 1968, this collection of Presidental palate preferences of 255 reciepes is fine dining. In addition to a review of the White House occupants, the book provides many reciepes which are compatible with current cooking. The author provides a brief historical briefing for each dish, resolves challenges for receipes meant for wood stoves and offers practical tips for updating the menu. Many items still stand on their own merits and are uniquely flavorable.No matter what political party may be in vogue, receiepes found in this book will garner votes on both sides of the kitchen table."},{"Title":"Home on the Ranch (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1633)","review":"Belle Day accepts a job as a live-in physical therapist to the daughter of Cage Buchanan. Cage suffered a loss in his past and has held a grudge against Belle's family for years. Having someone he considered the enemy under his roof bothered him..especially when where he really wanted her, was in his bedroom.....I was excited to hear that this was being released. Fans of the Men of the Double C series fell in love with the Clay family, which Belle became a member of when her mother married Squire Clay. This book was wonderfully written and was not lacking in any way. My biggest dissapointment is the only Clays mentioned by name, besides Squire, were Tristan and Sawyer. The best books written in this series were the stories of Jefferson, Matthew and Daniel, and not to see these characters mentioned by name was dissapointing. Although this book is not in the same league as \\"Stay\\", it is a worthy addition to this series and a must read."},{"Title":"Home on the Ranch (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1633)","review":"The story of Belle Day and Cage Buchanan was, well, a bit meh... Take it or leave it, really. I have to say, so far the post-'Men of the Double C' series by Allison Leigh has not lived up to the first five books. Seems to be going through the motions at this stage.No spoilers: I liked Belle - she has problems and unresolved issues but she's taken those emotions and channeled them into becoming an underpaid therapist (aka good heart, little superannuation). Recently the subject of scandal, she's fled her day job to go work with Cage Buchanan's daughter out on a ranch somewhere near the Double C. The process by which this arrangement has been organised is never explained to my satisfaction; but whatever, this is a romance novel, so I'm prepared to suspend my disbelief. Anyway, so Cage was quite annoying. He's got major issues with Belle's family, with his ex-wife (who's depicted as pure caricature of evil, grasping, non-maternal ex-wife), with relating to his daughter, with the nearby townsfolk, with everyone. The only thing that saves him is that he's hawt, apparently. Luckily, he's able to get over all of his considerable emotional problems and social interaction dysfunctions by falling in love...So, in the end, 'home on the ranch' was OK, not fab, not terrible. If you're wanting to find out what happens to all of the Clay family (and extended family) members, then read it, you get to see the rest of the family briefly, including Squire, Belle's mum, Clay sons, etc."},{"Title":"Office 2000 for Busy People","review":"This book will suprise you with how easy and quickly you can learn Office 2000 and with more depth including important infomation you can use NOW!

Livingstone's humanity and generosity of spirit illuminate this book. The details of his journey through Southern Africa are interesting and vivid, though not crammed with incident. Modern readers will be interested in Livingstone's observations on race relations in the different colonial settlements of the region. But the highlight of the book for me was the personality of Livingstone himself, his sympathy and insight, his matter-of-fact documentation of danger and hardship, his global perspective. A particularly rewarding read if Speke and Burton have left you with a bad taste in your mouth."},{"Title":"Missionary travels and researches in South Africa: Including a sketch of sixteen years' residence in the interior of Africa, and a journey from the ... down the river Zambesi, to the eastern ocean","review":"Amazon doesn't tell you that this book is Volume 1 of 2. Additionally, when you receive the book and find out it is 1 of 2, you can't buy Volume 2. Apparently what is needed is the following ISBN, which is supposed to contain both volumes: 1-58976-287-8. Very poor identification on the Amazon website."},{"Title":"Missionary travels and researches in South Africa: Including a sketch of sixteen years' residence in the interior of Africa, and a journey from the ... down the river Zambesi, to the eastern ocean","review":"David Livingston was an incredible man. He explored areas of Africa that had been previoulsy ignored by most of Europe. His notes on the regions he explored and the people he encountered are meticulous and fascinating. Prior to his visit to the region of Nyasaland, every year between 5,000-20,000 slaves were being sold to slave traders in the region. Livingston attacked the slave trade head on and was largely responsible for its downfall in that area. While some of his personal notes would be considered ignorant or offensive by modern standards, he was progressive and open minded for his time. He is a great historical figure who is too often ignored."},{"Title":"Missionary travels and researches in South Africa: Including a sketch of sixteen years' residence in the interior of Africa, and a journey from the ... down the river Zambesi, to the eastern ocean","review":"My first trip to Africa made me fall in love with the place. At Victoria Falls I saw the statue of David Livingstone, and upon returning home I read a brief biography of him that I had long owned.

The CONTENT is not bad - it is the cheap quality of the book, like it was made on a copy machine. You also cannot read the very pale type. I would try to get my money back but for ten bucks it's not worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"While browsing the MA books, this title jumped out at me...I bought a copy of The Karate Dojo back in the early 80's when I was a green belt (I'm now a 5th Dan) and after almost 30 years, still have it on my bookshelf and read it from time to time. This looks like a possible newer edition, but that would only mean an already outstanding book must now be superb. A book is only as good as its author, and Peter Urban is an excellent writer who captures the essence of karate and the \\"traditional\\" karate lifestyle (think \\"old school\\") with his personal experiences, anecdotes and special section of classic & entertaining martial art folk tales. The book's title is spot on and really sums it up in a nutshell: \\"Traditions and Tales of a martial art.\\" Again, this is NOT an instructional or how-to book, but more akin to a writer's (martial artist's) journal or diary. It's an easy & fun read. No matter what style/art you study, how long you've been studying, or if you're someone who just likes martial arts in general (whether you take the arts or not), I think you'll LOVE this well-written & fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"I picked this up one day because it was on sale. The book was a good primer on daily training, but to me the best part was the collection of stories at the end. There is one about how Master Funakoshi came to be the one chosen to promote karate to the Japanese and a really cool one about the graduation ceremony for a Shaolin Monestary (those guys were really tough) and several others that really help you appreciate the budo. I find myself rereading them about once a year."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"Very good book for any martial artist, beginner or master.

Participants of other martial arts would also benefit from reading and recognizing the shared characteristics and spirit among us."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"An excellent overview of karate by an American legend.

For many of us who have been practicing for decades, this was one of the first books we may have read.It contains a collection of both interesting stories and pieces of information for students of martial arts that detail physical training regimens as well as martial philosophy and history. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book but rahter an introduction to martial arts training in general. As this book is a classic, written by an American martial arts pioneer, it is worth having."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"Peter Urban was a pioneer in American karate and helped not only spread the art of goju ryu, but the ripple effect helped the promotion of other martial arts as well in the 60s and 70s. While a little eccentric, Urban was true to the bushido roots, while adapting karate for an American population.This book covers karate philosophy in its mid-twentieth century form and promotes the positive aspects of discipline and etiquette. The book deals with attitude and motivation of spirit. The second half of the book has \\"dojo stories\\" that help embody the essences of karate training.This is just a nice and simple book worth the read."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"As a ShoDan assistant instructor of Shiho Karano Kenpo Karate, I strive to educate myself about the martial arts. I've found some good books on the subject, and I'm always on the lookout for more. Since \\"The Karate Dojo\\" has been in print since 1967, I figured it must provide valuable direction. It does, mainly by portraying a snapshot of martial arts history that challenges the budo practitioner to forsake mediocrity for mastery and character.The book has three basic parts. First, the author provides a somewhat Karate-centric view of martial arts facets such as the dojo, belt ranking systems, and character self-analysis. In the second section are a number of martial arts parables that teach through historical narrative. Finally, Sensei Urban uses the last chapter to discuss the \\"contemporary\\" Karate scene (i.e. the mid-1960s). The overall theme is one of extreme discipline and perseverance within the martial arts, necessary to achieve a seemingly mystical level of physical, mental, moral, and spiritual ability. In other words, it takes hard work and commitment to become a \\"weaponless weapon.\\"\\"The Karate Dojo\\" is a quick read - I finished it in less than a day. There are a number of stylized line drawings and black-and-white photographs to complement the text. It's a portrait of an era in Karate that seems to be almost mythical - and mostly lost, at least in the West. The author fondly discusses harsh daily training under the strict discipline of a revered master in a dojo where everyone's practically family. I've tasted some of that, but nothing close to what Sensei Urban describes. And that's where I differed with the author. Yes, optimal mastery of any activity requires the type of commitment he advocates, and that's OK for some. But I believe it's possible to benefit from a consistent and disciplined practice of the martial arts without making an all-consuming religion out of it.At any rate, despite some dated aspects and a monkish focus on martial arts that may be beyond what many would bear, \\"The Karate Dojo\\" contains worthwhile insights for the martial artist. If nothing else, its high standards may challenge one to take their current commitment and practice to a higher level."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"The author's name is synonymous with the Goju style of Karate.The volume covers the dojo etiquette, the system of belts,kata and jiu-kumite. The Goju style has a progressive series ofbelts from white to green to green/stripes to purple to brownto brown/stripes and finally to the first level black belt.Incremental knowledge of the katas combined with excellence ofexecution are important distinguishing factors between thevarious belts. At the higher levels, candidates must havesome formal teaching together with entries into various competitions sponsored by local, national and internationalassociations in the art. Contestants have a separate karateetiquette to be displayed before the judges and their fellowcolleagues.Master Peter Urban shows the all-importantconnection between excellence of execution of the kata andtransferal of those skills to the formal jiu-kumite. The bookcontains a series of stories related by the author. These storiesform an integral part of the book. Mastery of the art requirescontinuous practice and study on the part of candidates.The skills learned in Goju Karate can be transferred into lifepractices and habits.

This book is a must for all serious students."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"Having discovered the Urban legacy only recently, through my sensei, I thoroughly enjoyed the trip through the maestro's mind that this book represents. Between this and 'karate psychology' (aka 'Karate sensei')we are given passage into a brilliant martial arts masters mindset. Urban wasn't just a groundbreaking sensei in terms of his being first to connect martial arts with the 'new world', but he was a fascinating thinker, in whatever he might have done. This aspect of his brilliance becomes clear in-between the pages, not so much as in the content but the eclectic style he writes with. The patchwork, almost mad-magazine throw it on the wall and see if it sticks style lets us see the way he makes connections between things and the ride is a most worthwhile one. The man clearly would have stood out in some way no matter what he did in life. The fact that he became who he was just delineates a rare example of the perfect person finding their perfect calling perfectly.As a (goju) martial artist, AND psychology enthusiast, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Karate Dojo: Traditions and Tales of a Martial Art","review":"The book is a nice read, it has an enjoyable read and some curiosities.

Compelling.This made me realize that my company was dysfunctional due to a clear lack of trust along the lines of the organization. One chart in this book very clearly identified the behaviors and patterns that were a result of the level of mis-trust. I immediately re-directed my energies into building trust-worthy professional relationships with my most-respected co-workers, while explaining the motivation and purpose of my actions. When I left the company, the professional and personal relationships that had the foundation of trust endured.On my way out, I dropped my copy of this book on my boss' desk.

The Speed of Trust is full of profound statements and observations that people of all levels can apply to their life. The author clearly explains to us that trust is like air: we don't pay any attention to it until it's not there. Trust is by far one of the most critical aspects of our personal and professional lives that need to be examined and improved on a regular basis.I highly recommend this book for everyone to read more than once to be able to apply the tips and principles the author communicates to us. He can be a little long winded on some points but in this case I didn't mind because sometimes it took a little reiterating to understanding key points that he usually detailed with examples."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"This book is truely on of the best business books written.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is one of my top 10 business books. Learning by example is a great way to absorb lessons in life. Trust is a must when dealing with all relationships, Stephen M.R. got it just right. I did learn from this book to open up to the possibility of restoring trust.

Nevertheless, I cant convince myself to rate it higher, despite the very good quotes, that this 322 content page work failed to fascinate me, a veteran reader of self help books, with either some points new or impressive which I can still remember after an hour or two. Even worse, some passages are just too long and the key ideas are not well organised. If your primary problem is of getting other people's trust on you, this is okay.

This should be probably the most important factor if the author is sincere with his message. Using this metrics ,the book fails again.

To get a Trust outcome requires the right inputs and in this book, the next generation's spokesperson for the Covey dynasty, Stephen M. R. Covey, tells us what trust means as well as provides plenty of examples of how important trust is when it comes to delivering business performance.M.R. uses the \\"ripple effect\\" metaphor with Self at the center and waves rippling from the inside out to describe the \\"5 Waves of Trust.\\" Using this metaphor, the first trust wave is Self-Trust (credibility driven), then comes the Relationship-Trust (consistent behavior driven) wave, an Organizational-Trust (alignment driven) wave, a Market-Trust (reputation driven) wave, and finally a Societal-Trust (giving back or contribution driven) wave.Staying with the emphasis on managing \`Self' first, Covey then provides the substance of the Self-Trust wave; the 4 cores of Credibility - integrity, intent, capability, and results. For the Relationship-Trust wave he identifies 13 critical behaviors. With the remaining trust waves, the dialogue continues the book's main theme - understanding the cost of mistrust and the value of trust - as it discusses organizational alignment, market reputation, and societal contribution. As M.R. says, \\"the dividends of trust can significantly enhance the quality of every relationship on every level of your life\\". If you doubt that, read this book.Dennis DeWilde, author of\\"The Performance Connection\\""},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"This book offers a very good action plan regarding achieving and/or reconstructing trust which, if followed, would certainly be effective. Most of it is like common sense that you may have never heard anyone put words to before. The only shortcomings of this book are that it is severely anecdotal (some of the anecdotes are strong and useful, but many are too personal to the author and they therefore lose credibility or pertinence) and kind of long-winded - by the time you near the end, you are ready to not even look at it's cover for perhaps a year! Overall, though, a great book which appropriately emphasizes that the same qualities which make for good personal relationships make for good business relationships, as well - which is helpful if you are or you are dealing with a person who can see the importance from one angle but perhaps not the other."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"After reading this very honest book, I sent it to my favorite sociology professor.

I have a former colleague who is a pathological liar. I tried explaining to him how much easier life is when people trust you. It's also less expensive... no extra money or time wasted on rebuilding.

Covey's book provides a framework for understanding trust, and a set of guidelines for building and restoring trust. Abundant anecdotes illustrate its lessons. An impressive array of business leaders, gurus and authorities lent their names to blurbs for this book, most of them endorsing the proposition that trust is good for the bottom line of any business. It would be hard to argue with that. If the book's style reminds you of \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\\" there's a reason. The author is the son of 7 Habits' guru Stephen R.

I read and recommend a book-a-week. I don't know anyone who reads all the books I recommend. And I can't give every book an extraordinary rating. But five months into the year, I've clearly found another Top-10 book for 2010.Clients and colleagues raved about it. So I bought it, but didn't read it. I mean, it's 322 pages, plus the index. Finally, I read a review that hooked me. So I read it. Wow! This is one powerful book. It has the potential to change the culture of your organization.Stephen M.R. Covey is the son of Stephen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People--a classic. So could the son crank out anything special--especially on a subject as basic as trust? Yes. Very special.\\"Contrary to what most people believe,\\" writes Covey, \\"trust is not some soft, illusive quality that you either have or you don't; rather, trust is a pragmatic, tangible, actionable asset that you can create--much faster than you probably think possible.\\"Covey's content is very deep (character isn't enough, you must also pair it with competence). His four cores of credibility will preach (Integrity, Intent, Capabilities and Results). And his 13 behaviors that flesh out the core are stunning, important, memorable and teachable. Examples: #1 Talk Straight, #3 Create Transparency, #4 Right Wrongs, #8 Confront Reality, #9 Clarify Expectations, and #11 Listen First.Behavior #7 is Get Better. He quotes a story told by Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus about IBM Founder Tom Watson Sr. in their book Leaders: Strategies for Taking Charge:\\"A prominent junior executive of IBM was involved in a risky venture for the company and managed to lose $10 million in the gamble. It was a disaster. When Watson called the nervous executive into his office, the young man blurted out, \`I guess you want my resignation?' Watson said, \`You can't be serious. We've just spent $10 million educating you!' It's this type of learning that caused Watson to say, \`If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.'\\"So what would it take in your organization to ignite the \\"speed of trust\\" so failures are an appropriate part of your culture? Covey's answers and thinking are original and without the taint of fads or trendy stuff. You'll read, ponder and remember. But it's also a page-turner. Stories punctuate the principles and pithy quotations convict, like this one from Blaine Lee: \\"Almost all conflict is a result of violated expectations.\\"You'll repeat the hilarious story of his parents' encounter with the Highway Patrol and your listeners (staff, board, family members) will never forget the episode or the core principle (intent). The dozens and dozens of illustrations will ensure that you'll never think of trust--and the cost of squandering it--in the same light again.Alan Greenspan said, \\"Rules cannot take the place of character.\\" Covey quotes a psychologist and corporate ethics trainer who said, \\"I see a lot of organizations who say they are going to tighten the rules. I don't see a lot of them saying that they're going to work to be extremely clear about what their values are, and give people training on how those values translate into actual behavior.\\" Amen.Covey says that \\"leadership is getting results in a way that inspires trust.\\" His 13 behaviors tell you how to do that. I urge you to get your team reading and wresting with this important book."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Most of us would agree that Trust is the foundation to all relationships - both personal and professional. What this book does is bring this concept to life in a manner that makes it very very compelling and practical.

The 13 behaviors of building high trust are clearly explained, with plenty of concrete examples.

But I just listened to an audiocast of the author discussing the book -- And please forgive that I'm chomping at the bit. (I promise to do a follow-up after I make myself read it.)It's all very nice to talk about how important trust is -- but exactly HOW to create it matters even more. And in order to answer those questions, we need to be very clear about the exact behaviors that get in the way in any given organization. More generally, why do the majority of people not really trust the management in their organizations? I'll put money on it that it often boils down to arrogance and elitism on the part of an astounding number of managers who believe that the \\"thinking\\" should be left up to them, and employees (those on the front lines of the actual work) should simply do as they are told without asking too many questions.Creative thinking and innovation are NOT going to happen in those sorts of organizations, and such places probably SHOULD fail as the innovative companies grab market share. There are a number of resources and studies (i.e. IBM's 2010 Global CEO Study, etc.) that point out that the trust necessary for innovation can only grow when managers truly RESPECT their employees. And when they do, they are far more inclined to WANT to flatten the wall and structures, remove the communication and process roadblocks, and institutionalize mechanisms for the gathering, vetting, and implementation of employee ideas for both processes and products.I discuss some of the \\"how-to's\\" related to all this on my blog \\"Kowabunga!

Lawrence A Haines - author of \\"In the Best Companies - People Are Everything\\"."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"I have not yet read the entire book. At present I am at page 111. Usually it takes me a day or two to read such a book, but I find this book a difficult read.The book contains one very important eye-opener. Trust consists of two components: character and competence. Character can be subdivided further into integrity and intent. And competence can be subdivided into skill and results.This fits nicely with the two halves of our brains. The right half of the brains is about avoiding pain which, at a personal level, consists of demonstrating that you have sound principles (character) and good intent (whether your actions are consistent with these principles). And the left half of the brain is about creating pleasure, which manifests itself as control over some aspect of the world (skill) and the pleasure of achieving results.So the important point about this book is, that trust arises out of the functioning of the entire brains. Moreover, trust is not something that you can ask from somebody, but is an emotion you cause in others by your actions and your communication with those others. It is something that is INDUCED BY what you do, and not something you can ask in advance, or ask for when it is not there. It is an emotion, and as such a fact you either cause in others, or you don't. And that is quite an eye-opener.The problem I have with this book, is that it implicitly assumes that altruism is THE ethics. Probably the writer, Stephen M. R. Covey is not aware of that he is doing it. In fact, I think he has taken this point over from his father, Stephen Covey, in whom I also found the same naivete. He, like may others, especially his father, probably have accepted altruism as THE ethics, and make the mistake that altruism and ethics are the same thing. I think that neither Stephen M.R.Covey nor his father have read anything written by Ayn Rand. Or if either of them did, they have not really thought it through.Not that Ayn Rand is (was) without flaws either. Far from it. In fact, Ayn Rand's defense of selfishness is an 'over the top' version of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bastiat's far more subtle concept of self-interest.My point is this: self-interest can also be a source of trust. Let me give an example.Suppose you go to a barber, who offers a hair cut for free. How long do you think he will be prepared to do this? Can you imagine him cutting hair for days on end, year after year, and doing an excellent job, and truly listening to what his 'customers' want, primarily motivated by 'brotherly love', by altruism? Just imagine yourself in his shoes. Would YOU be able to do that? Working for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week as a barber, without any pay? I think that you might last for about 2, at most 3 months. You would not last a year, let alone 10, 20, 30 years. After a few months the work itself has probably lost its luster totally. Moreover, such a person, because he does the hair cutting out of 'brotherly love', would probably not pay much attention to the wishes of his customers. This is because he is not really working for you, but for himself. He tries to enjoy the emotion of gratitude for delivering something for free. Moreover, he might be artistically inclined to put HIS ideas on your head, not yours. Imagine what THAT would do with your hair!Now compare this with a barber you know. Somebody who cuts hair for a living, that is, somebody who GETS PAID for his hair cutting. Such a person might be expect to cut hair for years and years. I know of a barber who works as such for about 35 years. Can you imagine a barber doing this without pay? I can't. Moreover, this person, because he is paid by ME, will take good notice of my wishes. And if he does something out of his own initiative, he will make dead certain that it will not offend me. In fact, he will attempt to cut my hair in a way that will please me more than I even expect of him. And this is because it is in HIS interest to take care of ME.My point is this: the first barber is motivated by altruism. And that is why I do NOT trust him. The second barber is motivated by self-interest. And that is exactly why I DO trust him. Self-interest therefore can be very important. I even dare to say, that the deepest root of trust is self-interest. Or, more precisely, self-interest is the root of both trust and distrust.If your self-interest is in harmony with the self-interest with others, then there is trust. This is the case of the barber working for money. If self-interest is acknowledged, and everybody acknowledges that everybody else is, ultimately, motivated by self-interest, then trust becomes a fairly simple matter.Just analyze each situation in such a way, that it has become clear that, and how, the self-interest of each participant is taken into account, and trust follows.If, on the other hand, self-interest is at the expense of others, it causes distrust. It leads to hidden agendas and all of the problems written about in this book. So what I assert is that both trust and distrust find their root in self-interest. If you focus on the self-interest in others, make clear that it is in harmony, or even in synergy with your own self-interest, and address this in a way that satisfies it for all parties involved, then trust will be its consequence. If self-interest is violated, then it will definitely lead to trust issues.Covey is totally unaware of this deeper aspect of trust. In fact, I suspected this from the beginning of the book, when I saw that he abstained from giving a definition of trust. I have always found that whenever a book does not define its most important term, the writer has not reached the deepest understanding possible of what he is writing about. Every really good book either begins or ends with the definition of what the book is about. In a book written for a broad audience it is customary, that the definition is at the beginning. And when it is a science book, the definition is often at the end. But in either case, the lack of a clear definition means that the writer does not really understand what he is writing about. Not that that makes the book uninteresting. Far from it. This book is interesting, if only because of the insight, that trust consists not only of character, as what most people believe, but also of competence.Let me address this shortcoming of this book. Let me give a definition of trust. The emotion of trust arises, when an action is either consistent with the self-interest of others, (character) or is recognized as in the service of the self-interest of others (competence). In fact, the disturbance of distrust only begins when we observe an action that violates our self-interest. Only then we begin to question others. Children, for example, begin with blind trust, and only begin to distrust when they are abused in one way or another.There are other weak points that really annoy me, and make this a hard read. Covey believes, for example, in talent. This concept has been heavily under attack recently, up to the point that it has been unmasked as a pseudo-concept. We know, for example, that the extraordinary achievements of somebody like Tiger Woods or Mike Jordan come from the 10.000 hours rule. This means, that competence in whatever field can be explained by seeing, that the person having this success has trained for 10.000 hours or more. In some fields more is required. For example the extraordinary ability of pianists like Alfred Brendel comes from maybe a 20.000 to 50.000 hours rule. In other words, science has discovered, that innate ability plays a much smaller role than imagined, and can in many cases be considered as negligible. Maybe in the field of actresses some might have a basis of good looks. But even then plastic surgery is often the cause of really good looks. No talent about it. And maybe a basketball player has the luck of being long, and that can be considered 'talent'. But extraordinary ability is ALWAYS the result of at least 10.000 hours of training. (Which, by the way, explains the failure of Mike Jordan in baseball. The problem was not a lack of talent, but a lack of training, because talent is, like the word instinct, a pseudo-concept, giving a name to something we do not know, and thus creating the illusion that we have an explanation, while we don't. This means, that the concept of TASKS in this book has to be abbreviated to ASKS. The T should be eliminated, because it is of no importance. So at this point the book is obsolete.Because of these two points I find this book difficult to read. In my eyes, Covey is a little naive. This book would be far more interesting, if it would connect trust with self-interest, and if it would start with a definition of trust, and not to 'beat around the bush' as it does now."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Having read many leadership related books and been trained in many seminars, nothing compares with the guiding principles in this book.This book should change the way you think about how you lead and who you lead. It not just inspires, it changes you to be a trusted leader. The result? You change for good the world around you!The negative will say this is idealistic, but in reality it is possible with those that commit to the importance of these guiding principles.The bottom line is that most organizations are disfunctional because of low trust cultures. However, you can be the one penetrating these cultures strong trusting leadership.The question is: can you arise to the challenge of being a true leader?This book defined my leadership roadmap for the remainder of my career."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Like a Sermon, Pretty Preaching, But Not Enough Case Studies and How Tos!His presentation style is too one-way, dry, and not lively and humorous enough. Listening to his audiobook is no different from reading the book, which is even more enjoyable.Lots of repeated ideas from the book, and not many new ideas and examples added.The author should attend Dale Carnegie Course or sharpen his training and presentation skills because he speaks pretty fast and tries to spoon-feed audience with ideas without enough pausing and time for audience to respond.Many of his ideas came from his Dad, Stephen Covey. His is dull and dry in his presentation style too, but at least he is more humorous than his son, Stephen R.M.

Having conducted three dozen of the three-day intensive seminars on \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\", I can attest to the quality of content of Covey's material.But this is not written by the author of The 7 Habits; this is by Stephen M. R. Covey, the son of the author of The 7 Habits. And the quality of the content is fantastic!The subtitle of this book (The One Thing that Changes Everything) says it all. Without trust, there is no relationship...with anyone, inside or outside the workplace. While this book is designed for changing a workplace culture, its applicability is holistic.I am proud to say that the company I'm employed with has adopted the concept, and I now facilitate \\"Leading at the Speed of Trust\\".\\"When trust is high, things speed up and costs go down. When trust is low, things slow down and costs go up,\\" writes Covey. And it's so apparent! We see it in organizations every day. Where trust is low, everything is questioned multiple times. It takes so much longer to do things. That duplication of effort simply costs more! And those costs come right off the bottom line!Covey describes five levels of trust, and uses the simili of a drop of water falling into a pool, and the ripple effect. At the center is self-trust (competence and character). Rippling outward are the concentric wave of influence described as relationship trust, organizational trust, market trust, and societal trust. What are most powerful for individuals are the self-trust and relationship trust levels.Covey describes four cores of credibility (integrity, intent, capability, and results) that create and sustain one's character and competence at the level of self-trust. Then, upon that foundation, one builds, extends, and sustains relationship trust by practicing 13 high-trust behaviors.The book is filled with specific examples that support all of the concepts. And there are lots of supporting information that drives deep learning of the concepts. For example, for each of the 13 behaviors, Covey provides a definition, the opposite, and the \\"counterfeit\\" (behavior that looks like a trust behavior but doesn't have a sufficient foundation of competence or character).The bottom line is that trust is not just some nice social aspect to have in an organization. There is economic value in building, extending, and sustaining trust for any organization. It's the one thing that changes everything! Nothing is as fast as the speed of trust!Stephen M. R. Covey stands apart from his father as an excellent business leader, thinker, and influence in the world."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Clearly trust is crucial to successful and functional relationships. And, I agree it is based on both Character and Competence. When something is important, you really need those two things, at a minimum, to feel good about your task and chances with or without a team to work with.I agree and that seems to be the book's premise. The book goes on but that is really what you need to know AND actually do.With all the talk of trust in the market today and the simplicity of the model you'd think that there would be more of it around. Not as common as one might hope, especially in our prime organizations, or at least the lack thereof seems more evident and consequential."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"The author, son of Stephen Covey of 7 Habits fame, begins by convincingly proving that when trust goes up, the speed of any transaction goes up and the cost goes down.The author offers \`Five Waves of Trust' that spill out in concentric circles across all relationships:First Wave is self-trust, which is the foundation of all credibility.Second Wave is relationship trust, accomplished by consistent behavior.Third Wave is organizational trust, accomplished by alignment.Fourth Wave is market trust, accomplished by reputation.Fifth Wave is societal trust, achieved by contribution to the larger society.One key point is the author's insistence that inspiring trust starts with yourself. Keeping commitments to yourself is key if you expect to have any credibility with other people.Any book on the topic of \`Trust' automatically has the gravitas of tackling a core subject dear to everyone. The importance of the topic, however, should not be confused with how good the author's ideas are. This book is overwritten, and should have been cut in half. The examples Covey gives are often personal, but conveys a navet&eacute; that undercuts his credibility at times.Although I still recommend this book, an interesting alternative Maister'sThe Trusted Advisor."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"After I read this book, I gave it to the head of our department.

I highly recommend this book!NatalieOahu, Hawaii"},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Our company requires managers to read this book as part of its leadership development program. Getting to the point, the book is about an important concept. Unfortunately, most all the observations and insights found the book are a matter of common sense and were already learned, if not mastered, during childhood.The book is padded out into an intolerably rambling and repetitive recant of something that can easily be summarized in one sentence: \\"Being trustworthy and working toward building trust is important for good relationships.\\" Really, that's about it -- an entire book that expands on the obvious. Yup, mutually trusting relationships are a good thing. I can't argue with that. Even so, I didn't need an entire book to remind of it.Ironically, the book has lead me to not trust its author, Stephen Covey. The book is full of air, yet thousands of companies have spent good money and wasted their employee's time with this simplistic, mind-numbing pablum. Save your money and, even more important, your time. Trust me!"},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Overall, this book is more about \\"rain-making\\" than it is on \\"trust.\\" The book starts off with the author, Stephen Covey, describing how he comes from a family that makes their money by selling self-help type books. Time and time again, he and his father have come up with \\"how to be successful\\" programs that they teach to corporate leaders in expensive seminars and such.Over time, as the sales of each program drop off, Covey needs to invent the \\"next big thing\\" in order to keep money rolling into the family coffers. This time, he has invented \\"the Speed of Trust.\\" He goes on to explain how he will do everything he can to make \\"Trust\\" into the corporate catch-phrase of the next few years. In order to do this, he makes up a handful of terms and then tries to build them into a program.In actuality, the book has no substance whatsoever and has nothing to do with trust. The book is filled with endless padding, thousands of quotations from business leaders saying how wonderful his book is, and virtually nothing of value. The gist of the book is: be nice and do the right thing. That is absolutely it. You will learn nothing more than the idea that it is important to be nice and do the right thing. This is not a book you will keep on your shelf for quick reference, but rather one you will use the pages of to light the fireplace.In conclusion, the book is more about how the Covey family dupes corporate leaders and common laypeople into buying their \\"how to be successful\\" programs in order to keep money rolling in for his family. The book is all about glorifying the fabulous \\"Covey\\" family name - he refers to his family name at least a hundred times in this book. In the future, I will never again buy anything with the name Covey on it. I give the book 2 stars because you actually do learn a little about how, despite being arrogant and entirely self promoting, people will still buy your worthless product. After all, I did."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"The speed of trust goes to the heart of what drives human motivation. For organizations attempting to transition from a tightly controlled, micro managed environment to one of employee empowerment and high commitment, this is a must read. Stephen M.R.

I've been a fan of the seven habits for years and when I saw this, but Stephen Covey's son, it almost shouted at me, \\"You've got to read this!\\" So I picked it up.I started reading the book and read about half of it. But I rarely have time to sit down to soak in a good book so I decided to listen to the rest of it in my car and bought the audiobook instead to finish this off. Well, I didn't realize it until it arrived, this is VERY abridged. I'd say it has 1/8th of the content. I figured I wouldn't continue where I left off in the book since it is less than two hours long and just listen to the entire thing. So I thought it would be good to review this from the perspective of mentioning what you might be missing in this abridgment.The short answer is, not much! In fact, I wonder if the book would have been more effective if it had come this short. Of course they wouldn't be able to charge the same price if they did, so I'm sure this is a profit issue, but the audiobook does hit ALL of the highlights. What you are really missing is that Covey will usually give several examples to illustrate his points in the book but in the audiobook he tends to give only one example and, in some cases, none. And I actually like it that way. While reading the book I thought to myself on occasion, \\"Okay, I get it. Next point, please,\\" but I didn't find myself doing that with the audiobook. Like the trust issues he dealt with in the book during the Franklin/Covey merger... gone from the audiobook and good riddance. I thought that story would never end and I don't think it gave much added value to the book in the first place.That being said, I would encourage you to listen to the book twice. He does cover some topics pretty quickly. For example, he gives 13 ways to build trust and I thought I got a lot out of it. But with the rapid-fire succession in which he shared it I don't think it quite sank in so I plan on giving this at least one more listen... maybe more. Reading the book once would have had it set in but I think a few listens are required to get the same effect... which is still faster than reading the book once.As for the content, I based the five-star rating solely on that. If found it thought-provoking and very relevant to what I do, or what I should be doing. It gave me several ideas on how to build trust both at home and at the workplace. I've already followed some of its ideals and I've already noticed a difference. Trust can be earned and lost very quickly and I think Stephen does an excellent job of covering the topic throughout the audiobook.This is a fantastic and relevant addition to the Covey collection and I don't hesitate at all on recommending this to anybody! Pick it up, give it a serious read, and you won't regret it either."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Many journalists and pundits are saying that the current economic meltdown is not so much a financial crisis as it is a crisis of trust where people's trust is wavering regarding business, banks, the economy and the government. One of the unique aspects of trust is that it has a strong connective property when it's healthy and intact; however, it also has the potential for a violent repulsive force if the trust is damaged or broken. In his book, The Speed of Trust, best-selling author Stephen Covey writes about this ethereal trait that pervades virtually every aspect of the human condition. He writes that it's difficult to imagine a single instance on the micro or macro-levels that can escape the specter of trust. Soundview likes this book because Covey introduces a novel \\"Five Waves of Trust\\" model as an instructional metaphor to the inner workings of trust in our everyday activities and relationships. This distillation helps make the gossamer nature of trust more tangible and actionable. Additionally, the author provides a look at the 13 behaviors of highly-trusted leaders as well as something he calls the \\"Four Cores of Credibility.\\" This is a great book from a great author whom you can trust!"},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"In this best-selling book Mr. Covey (son of Stephen R.

In this day and age we simply don't have time to check everything out thoroughly. So when things are happening quickly and decisions need to be made in the moment, what do we fall back on? Trust.In this insightful and practical book, Mr. Covey looks at what builds trust, what erodes trust, and what an important factor it is in enhancing productivity and creating satisfying relations -- whether you're looking at commercial or personal relationships.Stephen M.

It's not enough to offer just one of those two. If you are good at what you do but people have reason to mistrust your ethics, you pay a penalty. But also, you can be a model of integrity, and if you're not good at doing what you commit to do, you'll pay a trust penalty there as well.Building from those four core attributes, he identifies 13 specific behaviors that build trust, and spends a chapter on each:* Talk Straight* Demonstrate Respect* Create Transparency* Right Wrongs* Show Loyalty* Deliver Results* Get Better* Confront Reality* Clarify Expectations* Practice Accountability* Listen First* Keep Commitments* Extend TrustWhen evaluating these behaviors, in yourself or in others, it's important to find the 'sweet spot' where distrust is overcome but judgment comes into play so you don't get burned. And in that process, it's important to recognize that each of these 13 behaviors has 'counterfeits' that look on the surface like they're building trust, even as they actually undermine it. As an example, flattery is one of several counterfeits to straight talk.Like my own book Principled Profit, Covey repeatedly demonstrates that high-trust environments, based in both character and competence, wildly outperform the traditional hierarchical micromanaged corporate environment. Trust, in other words, is very good for business. It's why all the local McDonald's were left untouched during the Los Angeles riots--because McDonald's had shown itself as a concerned community partner, for years. It's why Johnson & Johnson is one of the only pharmaceutical companies that has a reputation for genuinely caring about its customers. It's why when an IBM executive who had lost the company $10 million expected to be asked for his resignation, founder Tom Watson Sr. responded, \\"You can't be serious. We've just spent $10 million educating you!\\"My favorite chapter is toward the end of this substantial book: 'The Fifth Wave--Societal Trust: The Principle of Contribution.' Spiraling out from previous chapters about trust within an organization (built around the concept of alignment: the messages reinforce the desired behaviors) and within a market (where the key element is reputation), these are the third and fourth waves, the fifth wave is about 'conscious capitalism,' a/k/a social responsibility: the idea (and the statistics to back up the claim) that making a difference in the world is good for the soul, and also for the bottom line. And the key principle is contribution--doing things specifically to improve the lives of others.This is one of the most important business books I've read in a long time, and a complete validation of the points of view I've been promoting for years.

The Marshall Group a company that is a competitor of his company Franklin/Covey. If you look at the quote alone, you can see that Mr. Covey Jr. takes the title and the major point of his book from this sentence and expands/pads it to a 300+ page behemoth.Another point I find quite bothersome is that in Covey Jr.'s attempt to state his qualifications is that his company grew in sales,, Well, they did, but primarily because Covey became Franklin/Covey and absorbed a huge competitor and their clients...I rate books by what I call a \\"Duh\\" quotient. Every time I see a blatantly obvious statement or point like \\"it's easier when people trust you\\" I mark a \\"Duh\\",, This 320 page waste of time has at least 200 \\"Duhs\\",, I honestly stopped counting.Ironic that someone would write a book about trust when it appears they are duping you..

It can also be applied to the family/personal view of interactions within the community at large. It can definitely help you to change how you work with untrustworthy features in your peers, yourself, or generally manage life if you wish to apply the concept. For instance at one point we trusted Wall Street, Banks and the pillars of society with our money, investments and future. Now that the economy has unraveled through bad judgment, manipulation and abuse of trust you can see that the lack of trust has negatively impacted our housing market. We are no longer so trusting of our banks processing foreclosures because they have rail roaded paperwork through the wheels of justice by auto procsesing - in other words - no one checked - no one looked - no one was personally responsible - that leads to more distrust. We cannot rebuild our economy or our relationships through a lack of trust. This is a useful tool that anyone anywhere can use, apply, and learn from. Some might say that this is \\"obvious\\" .. but, in reality... our nation/commumnity and corporate work world has been on a slippery slope sliding ever downwards because we don't trust each other .. and the rule of thumb has been \\"buyer beware...\\" and if you don't hire an attorney for every transaction .. its your fault. Until we return to the fundamental belief in investing in each other & that we are responsible for bringing each other forward we will remain at the the bottom of this pond..paddling, splashing and never getting anywhere. At some point we must admit our sins, forgive, and throw each other a line...or we will never get anywhere ... without trust. Look at Staples, Inc., a company that had started out with grand principles has slowly fallen backward as it grabbed for the immediate victory without accounting for the long term impact on its internal culture & the impact this would have oan building their customer base. The confident mega retailer stepped into the brave new world with confidence because they exuded down home trustworthiness to wit they sacrificed as they stumbled into the new economy. Now, trembling and anxious they are burning away trust because internal anxiety has been created to maintain \\"appearances\\" as well as recover lost business. Internally the lack of confidence has translated to anxiety throughout the company. Retail stores are shorted in terms of staff and yet are expected to create the same quality of performance; while customers rant that the lack of service and supplies has become a real reason for walking away from Staples to other competitors. In addition internal employees who work over the phones are slapped with ever changing finishing lines and lack of trustworthy leadership which lends to increased anxiety on the part of staff. Where did Staples Inc go wrong? it stopped trusting the path they had followed which led them to success they experienced in the past. What they need is to get back to the tool that worked best for them: BUIDING TRUST & BEING TRUSTWORTHY. This is a handy tool: use it!"},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"We are using it for a Leadership Symposium.

It could also be the difference between meeting an organizational goal or become a dismal failure.Covey takes us through a journey in understanding the answers within ourselves to these questions and moving outward.

The lack of trust in modern society, and its continuing decline is a major issue not just in business, but socially, politically and in the family. Thus this is a timely book and the 3 star rating is not meant to indicate that it is really wrong or poorly written in any manner.The reason for the only 3 star rating is that there is a whole lot of padding. The author does a very insightful job of investigating the components of trust, and exploring and explaining the dynamics of how trust can be built (and destroyed) in families, in teams, and in institutions. These explanations make it worth buying the book and at least reading it's . . . table of contents. The only problem is that the book is easily twice as long as it needs to be. I really think there's nothing wrong with a short book, but the author and/or publishers must have been afraid that the sixty page or so treatise these could have been wouldn't have been taken seriously.A good book you should read and implement, or perhaps read the first few pages of each chapter and skim at will when it starts to sound like it's just filling space on the page."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Trust can make things easier, and distrust can definitely make things much harder. You already know that. But do you know how to check out where you need to change in order to create more beneficial trust? The Speed of Trust can help those who need a template for such self-examination.Mr. Stephen M. R. Covey is the son of Dr. Stephen R. Covey of 7 Habits of Highly Effective People fame. If you've read that famous book, you may remember young Stephen referred to by his father as the seven-year-old son who was asked to keep the yard \\"clean and green\\" and did neither at first. Dr. Covey writes the foreword for this book and refers to that example. Ms. Rebecca Merrill helped with the writing of Dr. Stephen R. Covey's book First Things First which was coauthored by Roger Merrill.Trust is expressed by a paradigm that includes five waves of trust (self trust based on the principle of credibility, relationship trust based on the principle of proper behavior, organizational trust based on the principle of alignment, market trust based on the principle of reputation, and societal trust based on the principle of contribution). Most of the book is taken up with examining those five waves and their underlying principles. The core of the book comes, however, in the 13 behaviors that establish trust (talk straight, demonstrate respect, create transparency, right wrongs, show loyalty, get better, confront reality, clarify expectations, practice accountability, listen first, keep commitments, and extend trust). Each section of the book comes with ways to check on your performance and to create plans for improvement.This book is by far the best development of the subject of creating and restoring trust that I have read. That makes the book an essential reference. I congratulate and appreciate the authors for tackling this important subject.I would be remiss, however, in being a trustworthy reviewer if I didn't point out some weaknesses in the approach:1. Some of the examples of trust and mistrust drawn from Mr. Covey's experiences aren't terribly satisfying to read. Perhaps the most jarring example is one of the early ones in the book that describes the distrust that the Franklin Quest people felt toward him after the company merged with Covey Leadership Center. Mr. Covey comes across as unbelievably naive for not having taken into account how the two cultures should mesh (if at all) in engineering the merger. That's a more fundamental lesson than the lack of trust point. In addition, he doesn't seem to realize that merely being the son of the company's founder would make many people who didn't know him skeptical of his qualifications and his talent. Having read about how naive Mr. Covey was in this situation undercut my confidence in his ability to address the subject of trust. But I did appreciate his willingness to share such a painful experience in his book.2. Most of the examples that are cited that do not involve Mr. Covey's direct experience are very overused. They same examples have been used to prove excellence in many other dimensions. As a result, the book doesn't come alive as much as it might. The examples conjure up memories of other books and arguments rather than cleanly bringing across the authors' trust-related points.3. The book's structure and style are pretty pedantic, but without the precision that an academic would bring to the subject. In most areas, the authors rely on your sense of what's right rather than giving you clear lines of what to do and what not to do. That's fine if you already have a well-defined sense of how trust is formed and re-established. But if you don't know the answers already because you haven't lived in that kind of an environment, the book will leave you with too little direction.4. Ultimately, long sections of the book are very general and boring. The major exceptions are the examples drawn from Mr. Covey's own family. I found those examples to be fresh and interesting.After you finish this book, I suggest that you think about those who have gained your trust and distrust. What did they do? Examining those personal examples will add a lot of depth to the general ideas presented here."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"There is one thing that is common to every individual, organization, nation, and civilization throughout the world--one thing which, if removed, will destroy the most powerful government, the most successful business, the most thriving economy, the most influential leadership, the greatest friendship, and the deepest love. On the other hand, if developed and leveraged, that one thing has the potential to create unparalleled success and prosperity in every dimension of life. According to the author, that one thing is trust.The author says that \\"The Five Waves of Trust\\" define the way we establish trust and make it actionable. Understanding these waves will enable you to speak and behave in ways that establish trust, allowing you to become a leader who gets results by inspiring trust in others.First Wave: Self Trust. The key principle underlying this wave is credibility.Second Wave: Relationship Trust. The key principle underlying this wave is consistent behavior.Third Wave: Organizational Trust. The key principle underlying this wave, alignment, helps leaders create organizational trust.Fourth Wave: Market Trust. The underlying principle behind this wave is reputation.Fifth Wave: Societal Trust. The principle underlying this wave is contribution.Here is a list of useful concepts I liked in the book:Trust is the \\"hidden variable\\" in the formula for organizational success. The traditional business formula is: (Strategy x Execution = Results). But there is a hidden variable: (Strategy x Execution) x Trust = Results.Trust always affects two outcomes: speed and cost. When trust goes down, speed goes down and cost goes up. Consider the time and cost of airport security after 9/11, or costs for Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance in response to Enron, WorldCom and other corporate scandals. When trust goes up, speed goes up and cost goes down. Warren Buffett completed the acquisition of McLane Distribution from Wal-Mart on the basis of a two-hour meeting. Because of high trust between the parties, the merger took less than a month.In a high-trust relationship, you can say the wrong thing and people will still get your meaning. In a low-trust relationship, you can be very precise, and they'll still misinterpret you.If we can't trust ourselves, we'll have a hard time trusting others.Who do you trust? Why do you trust this person? Now consider an even more provocative question: Who trusts you?To use the metaphor of the tree, integrity is the root. Even though it's underground and not even visible most of the time, it is absolutely vital to the nourishment, strength, stability and growth of the entire tree. We've all seen people with enormous capability, strong results, and good intent who go about what they're doing in a dishonest way. On the other hand, to have integrity only is to be a \\"nice guy,\\" or a thoroughly honest person, who is basically useless. To most people, integrity means honesty--telling the truth and leaving the right impression.Results matter to your credibility. They give you clout. Returning once again to the metaphor of the tree, results are the fruits--the tangible, measurable, end purpose and product of the roots, trunk and branches.Sometimes, poor behavior turns out to be bad execution of good intent.Communicate clearly so that you cannot be misunderstood. Declare your intent, so you leave no doubt about what you are thinking. Be honest and call things what they are. Don't manipulate people, distort facts, or leave false impressions.Be real and genuine and tell the truth in a way that people can verify.Make restitution instead of just apologizing. The opposite is to deny or justify wrongs because of ego and pride, and to cover up mistakes. Apologize quickly, take action to make restitution when possible, and demonstrate personal humility to achieve this behavior.Give credit to others and speak about people as though they are present. Don't badmouth people behind their backs and don't disclose others' private information.By establishing a track record, making the right things happen, being on time and on budget, and not making excuses for not delivering, you quickly restore lost trust on the competence side.Continuously improve by learning, growing and renewing yourself. Others will develop confidence in your ability to succeed. The opposite is the eternal student--always learning, but never producing. Don't be afraid to make mistakes but learn from them.Take the tough issues head-on. It is far better to address the real issues and lead courageously in discussions of uncomfortable topics.Do both: hold yourself and others accountable.Genuinely understand another person's thoughts and feelings, before trying to diagnose or advice. The opposite is to speak first and listen last, or not at all, and to pretend to listen while waiting for your own chance to speak. Use your eyes and your gut to listen as well as your ears, and don't presume you know what matters to others.Keep all commitments the symbol of your honor.Extending trust leverages it to create reciprocity. Do not extend false trust by giving people responsibility, but no authority or resources to complete a task. Extend conditionally to those who are earning your trust, but extend it abundantly to those who have earned it.Doing good is no longer an addition to business; it is part of business itself.Inspire trust by starting with yourself and your own credibility, and then consistently behave in trust building ways with other people.Restoring trust within an organization may seem difficult; however, the fact that high-trust organizations outperform low-trust organizations by three times provides a strong incentive to make the effort. In the 1990s, Nike was criticized by activists for not being socially responsible, based on the conditions in some of the plants of their foreign manufacturing partners. However, Nike's behavior over the ensuing years resulted in 2005 with being listed as #13 on the \\"Best Corporate Citizens\\" list."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"Stephen M.R. Covey is the son of the famous Stephen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Not surprisingly, many of his father's themes are interwoven throughout this book.Covey maintains that \\"Nothing is as fast as the speed of trust,\\" meaning nothing can accelerate a transaction, a task, or project of any kind like trust. For instance, when there is a high level of trust between parties in a business transaction, deals can be made in minutes with a handshake.Not only does trust make things faster, it simply makes every aspect of our lives better. To use another business example, a high level of trust between an organization's members promotes innovation, generates productivity, and results in cost savings. Trust \\"changes everything.\\" It's not just a touchy-feely concept. Covey gives statistics to back it up.Covey explains that trust is a function of character and competence. He further breaks these components down into \\"4 Cores of Credibility\\" - integrity, intent, capabilities, and results. He also outlines 13 Behaviors that generate trust. The Cores and Behaviors \\"are the tools that establish or maintain trust in every context.\\" Similar to the 7 Habits, it all starts with the individual - i.e. self trust. Trust then can extend or ripple an additional 4 waves - to relationship trust, organizational trust, market trust, and societal trust. Covey gives tips for how to develop trust at each wave, resulting in increasingly remarkable outcomes.After reading the book, you will believe that, \\"prioritizing trust - actively seek to establish it, grow it, restore it, and wisely extend it - will bring personal and organizational dividends that far exceed any other path.\\" Although it has value for everyone, this book is especially helpful and important reading for those in leadership positions.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper"},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"SPEED OF TRUST - I really wanted to like this book more, but ultimately couldn't. COVEY talks about business and personal life as if the principles of trust are interchangeable between the two, and to my liking doesn't pull it off. He makes no mention of the role feelings and intuition play, personally a substantial part in how much trust I place in relationships with people in my private life, and sometimes in business too. While COVEY talks about concepts like judgement, evidence, fact based measurement, results orientated - I'd hate to run my home based around key performance indicators and the profit margin!Bounded rationality is a recognised phenomenon in business, many decisions, deals and trading is completed successfully using intuition as well, which is often required to complement the amount of information being presented before the opportunity passes. In many non-Western cultures, deals and enduring relationships are made on quite a different normative base than that used in the West. Many of the informal rules in those environments are much more subtle, symbolic, and invisible.Another opportunity missed by COVEY is the application of Prisoner Dilemma game theory. The Prisoner Dilemma game, where two prisoners choose to either compete or cooperate to minimise negative utility is a well known and widely used concept that powerfully illustrates the divergent consequences of trust/distrust, betrayal, and potential for unconscious relationship punishment. Perception of threats to our survival needs, fear based & predator/prey behaviour play a major role in forming or destroying mutually beneficial relationships. Why COVEY did not refer to this, one can only speculate.Overall I agree with some of the other reviewers - SPEED OF TRUST could've been shorter - a lot of repetition. The Action Plan and Credibility survey are interesting but don't stand on their own. Opportunities missed, and thankful I purchased SPEED OF TRUST using a 40% discount voucher, otherwise it's overpriced. And also - over recommended - the first 11 pages are endorsements - it's excessive, as if somehow the author doesn't trust in his own marketing ability - ironic that! Recommendation - if you can source it at your local library or borrow it from someone else who has it, save your cash."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"I have certainly observed the effects of the trust issue in corporate life.

I call it the \\"currency of the boardroom\\".Stephen has taken what is often passed off as \\"airy-fairy\\" and made it both tangible and accessible. His superb examples and illustrations from real life help the reader quickly see the empirical evidence that trust truly speeds up everything. Trust saves time -- Trust saves money. Even more, he has identified, explained, and elaborated on 13 behaviors that enable anyone to establish and enhance trust in any relationship.Building on the legacy that his father has built, the younger Covey gives us all solid advice and important tools to live lives of character.

He argues persuasively and offers strong evidence--for how trust dramatically affects results of every kind. But he thankfully goes further--from his own experience and his careful study he offers a roadmap for how to create abundant trust in ourselves, our relationships and our workplaces.I predict that this book will be THE seminal reference on trust for the next century.

Our organization held a seminar based on this book and received numerous accolades for sharing it with our community.

Covey, the new economy is looking for businesses and individuals who can practice the virtue of trust. The Speed of Trust shows the importance of trust and how the rate at which it is built can help businesses win over clients and employees too. The book proposes that establishing trust is essential to creating high performing companies.Gone are the days when companies would be secretive, make bad decisions and get away with it. Today's economy is increasingly becoming open and information spreads fast. How do you show your employees and customers that you value them and that you are on the same team? By working to build a transparent business culture, in which information is readily available, bureaucracy is eliminated and innovation is allowed to thrive.The ideas in the book resonate with me, not because they are moralistic but it is the way the economy is working today. A bad reputation will spread fast and will hurt your company and a good reputation will spread fast too and boost the company. I wish Covey showed how businesses could build back any lost trust. Nevertheless, this is recommended reading for all business professionals."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"An extrordinary book on trust.I orderd 8 books, one for each team member and we are studying it together. I recommend that everyone in business or interested in personal relationships read this book."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"\\"The one thing that changes everything,\\" says the author (son of 7 Habit's author), and he proceeds to make a compelling argument regarding how fast trust (or lack of trust) moves and how much we can do about it. Covey introduces the trust phenomenon across 5 waves - Self Trust, Relationship Trust, Organizational Trust, Market Trust and Societal Trust, with a chapter devoted to each. Trust can be demonstrated via what he calls the 4 cores of credibility - Integrity, Intent, Capabilities and Results. Using a tree as the metaphor, Integrity is the root of the plant, growing through Intent and Capabilities with Results representing the final fruit. All are necessary. Trust solicits dividends, while lack of trust brings taxes. It's a critical component to success in this new global economy. As he moves on to Relationship Trust, Covey introduces the 13 Behaviors of Trust, as follows:1. Talk Straight2. Demonstrate Respect3. Create Transparency4. Right Wrongs5. Show Loyalty6. Deliver Results7. Get Better8. Confront Reality9. Clarify Expectations10. Practice Accountability11. Keep Commitments12. Listen First13. Extend TrustReplete with examples from his own experience, history and business, Covey closes this rich with application book with advice on Smart Trust (when to trust and when not to, with a Johari Window(tm) template) as well as specific insights on restoring trust and developing a propensity to trust.He closes the book with this short paragraph: \\"Extending trust to other rekindles the inner spirit - both theirs and ours. It touches and enlightens the innate propensity we all have to trust, and to be trusted. It brings happiness to relationships, results to work, and confidence to lives. Above all, it produces an extraordinary dividend in every dimension of our lives: the speed of trust.\\""},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"The Speed of Trust is essential reading for any manager or supervisor.Whatever your business model, strategies or execution plans they will not deliver the desired results without trust on all levels and in all directions.By taking an emotional concept and backing up its importance with hard facts Covey proves how vital trust is at all levels of an organisation. Trust is inherent in every decision we make and whether people are trusted and feel trusted will impact on every process in a business.Every initiative, strategy and performance of day to day business relies completely on trust on all levels and in all directions.

I was delighted to learn and share how important the topic is. We agreed it was instructive in a simple and easily readable fashion. If you have ever been a \\"shoot from the hip\\" relationship developer, I highly recommend reading this book which gets into the meat of defininig, creating, repairing and understanding the foundation of all relationships, trust. I especially recommend Stephen's book for those in middle management as you are sandwiched in meeting the needs of relating to your superiors, staff and clients & customers."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"In light of the recent financial crisis and events that led or contributed to the current recession, the topic of this book is both timely and enduring. Covey describes trust as being based on character and competence, where character is required and competence is situational. He uses financial terms as a concrete way to convey the cost of low trust and the benefit of high trust, describing the former as a trust tax and the latter as a trust dividend. The quickest way to make a withdrawal, he insists, is to violate a behavior of character, and the quickest way to make a deposit is to demonstrate a behavior of competence. He goes on to detail seven low trust taxes (redundancy, bureaucracy, politics, disengagement, turnover, churn, and fraud) and seven high trust dividends (increased value, accelerated growth, enhanced motivation, improved collaboration, stronger partnering, better execution, and heightened loyalty).Covey also outlines what he characterizes as five waves of trust: self-trust, relationship trust, organizational trust, market trust, and societal trust. For each of these waves, he applies the concept of the four cores (integrity, intention, capabilities, and results) and the thirteen behaviors of high-trust leaders (talk straight, demonstrate respect, create transparency, right wrongs, show loyalty, deliver results, get better, confront reality, clarify expectations, practice accountability, listen first, keep commitments, and extend trust). The book includes a multitude of practical applications and pushes the reader to reflect on his or her own behavior.Despite the fact that I have recommended this book, I do so with some caveats. First, I listened to this book as an audio download and although I generally like it when an author reads the book, that was not the case for this one. Covey is a Harvard MBA, but I was astounded at the number of mispronunciations. His reading style has a hesitating tempo to it that comes across as patronizing, and his incessant family examples are over the top. He's a business man, not a family therapist, and as Tom Peters would say, he should stick to his knitting. Those examples got very tiresome. Still, there are nuggets in the book, so perhaps reading it rather than listening to it is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Speed of Trust: the One Thing That Changes Everything","review":"every entrepreneur must read this book if he or she wants to be successful.

Either I had just read an explanation for something that had bothered me in the past, or I understood just why I had trusted someone or that person had trusted me. For both the realizations of what worked in the past and the realizations having to do with things that had not worked and why, this book is fabulous! It also pointed out to my just why trust is so essential, and why some relationships are absolutely doomed to failure -- because the trust levels don't match. This book is not about blame, it's about what is and what a person can do to create more trust (provided that is what you want).

I have bought a bunch of copies and given them away, and so far everyone I know who has read it is equally impressed. Its message applies with full validity at a personal level as well as at a societal and organisational level.

First, I share the frustration of most with our national leaders. Second, I see in organizations with which I work the lack of speed in decision-making because of the lack of trust. And I see people all around me who cannot resolve issues because there is a lack of trust. I really like Covey's definition of trust as comprising both competence and character.

However when it comes to practical application and trust building, trust measuring, and trust analysis, I still find the new book \\"More Trust. More Sales\\" by Mr Grafe best.

Technically, it's about the officers and crew of a small corvette tasked with escorting numerous merchant vessel convoys across the Atlantic during World War II. But in reality, it surely must rank as one of the best books about war ever written. Where Monsarrat really shines is his introspection into the minds and lives of the characters --the men on the corvette \\"Compass Rose\\" and later, the frigate \\"Saltash\\". With vivid prose, the author introduces us to the initial crew of Compass Rose -- a green, barely trained group of mostly civilians devoid of any kind of military discipline -- and allows us to watch as they mature into highly trained professionals and fully developed human beings, warts and all. Along the way, they encounter unimaginable chaos, suffering, death, despair and a whole lot of other adjectives, including love and triumph.

Many of my students reported being moved to tears at the sinking of Compass Rose and at the death of Julie Hallam, and all seemed to feel that the \\"love interest\\" of Monserrat's work seemed both more genuine and more realistic than Willie Keith's infatuation with May Wynn.

Accurate in the big picture with interesting, surely representative, vignettes of the sailors and their families. But the focus is on the action, what it was like in the violent, stormy Atlantic trying to convoy life-sustaining merchant ships to and from Britain under threat of the stealthy, deadly U-Boat wolf packs.You get put in the shoes of a captain, a subordinate officer or a common sailer as they go about their duties and face up to the fear of a torpedo and a cold, oily sea waiting to gobble them up without hope of rescue.The battle of the Atlantic was a very close run thing. Heavy losses from 1941-1943 threatened to starve Britain out of the war. It was only in late 1943, early 1944, when Allied tactics and technology finally adapted, that the tables were turned and the U-Boats were the ones sent to the bottom.But what makes this book a stand out is the first person descriptions of the fear, drudgery, exhilaration, camaraderie, and tragedy of war at sea during those days.

Sounds boring in concept, but a page turner as presented by author Nicolas Monsarrat. This tale follows captain and crew through the war and two commands: a small corvette, and then a frigate.The people studies - the interactions, internal struggles, fears, loves - are as interesting as the seagoing warfare itself. Very well constructed and wholly believable. And this corner of the war was a whole new experience for me, seen from the viewpoint of the escort sailors and officers, battling the German U-boat wolfpacks.Monsarrat gives us boredom and terror, great leaders and tyrants, victory and submission, all well told.

It was during North Atlantic convoy duty that the sister ship of the Mojave, the Escanaba, was sunk off of Greenland on 5am June 10, 1943. In fact, my father's ship, the Mojave, had changed position with the Escanaba earlier that day. It was only after coming into port at St. Johns Newfoundland that it became apparent to the other seaman that the Escanaba had been lost. There was a Hudson's Bay Company truck that had come to the port to deliver blankets that some of the crew of the Escanaba had ordered. The manager for Hudson's Bay inquired of the officer on duty what had become of the Escanaba. The reply of the officer was \\"I cannot say,\\" which was what was always said when a ship had been lost. The manager then inquired whether seamen from some of the other ships would like to buy the blankets that had been intended for the crew of the Escanaba. My father purchased two of those blankets, which our family still enjoys using.My mother gave my father this book for their first wedding anniversary. As for me, my middle name is taken from that of the main character of this novel."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This audio book is excellently read by Robert Powell who has a wonderful gravity to his voice and does the varied accents and personalities of the crew so well. It represents a high of story telling. This audio book was abridged from the famous 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat who wrote it based on his wartime experience as a corvette commander in the British Navy in W.W.II. As noted by Bernard Edwards in \\"The Cruel Sea Retold: The Truth Behind Monsarrat's Epic Convoy Drama,\\" the novel is based on real events. Undoubtably, it was the best novel Monsarrat ever wrote. It became the basis for the classic war film with John Hawkins with the same name as the novel. Unfortunately, this book still is only available on cassette. Most libraries have long since lost the audio book or it has been broken by one of their patrons. One can only hope that it will be re-released as a CD sometime soon. The genre of wartime experience is a very big one, as of late, most people have been re-discovering memoirs of the Pacific War due to the new HBO Series, \\"The Pacific.\\" Having read many works in this area as well as some non-fiction histories by popular historians like the late Stephen Ambrose or the late Canadian historian, Pierre Berton, I'd have to say that this novel is one of the best. It has well-drawn characters and the intimacy of a very realistically depicted war at sea. There is none of the false bravado and theatrics of the movies. Instead, the war described on this pages is frequently monotonous, and frustrating in the extreme as the corvette attempts to destroy the submarine packs attacking the convoys. There are moments of great intensity and even horror as they fail to stop the enemy or are required by their orders to abandon, or even harm shipwrecked sailors who are in between them and enemy subs that they must try to destroy.

It has to be the consummate novel of war. It oozes truthfulness, at least by my perception, and therefore stands as a history of a desperate, desperate time. By the second year of the Battle of the Atlantic things looked truly grim and it is a testament to Churchill, I suppose, and to the extraordinary courage of these men, so vividly portrayed, that Great Britain prevailed.

Its author Nicholas Monsarrat served in the North Atlantic during WWII so it is very much a first-hand account of his experiences.Most of the action is at sea aboard the convoy escort vessels \\"HMS Compass Rose\\" and \\"HMS Saltash\\" during the Battle of the Atlantic.Its focus is the human element of the war - on ordinary people during extraordinary times.It was made into an excellent film in England in 1953."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this novel some years ago.

Both take place in small warships which is conducive to revealing personalities and dynamic group psychology. The reader sees the action primarily from the standpoint of Keith Lockhart, a former journalist who begins as a freshly minted volunteer reserve officer. His character resembles the author, Nicholas Monsarrat, who was RNVR himself, served in and eventually rose to command both a corvette and frigate during the war. Nearly uncontrollable bureaucratic forces at play as the war drags on leads to a greater impersonality as humanity seemingly loses out to weapons and toughness as they move from the 90 person crew of the corvette to the 170 of the larger, more capable frigate.In comparing \\"The Cruel Sea\\" to his other war book, \\"Three Corvettes\\": the former, a bestseller, is a better structured story, while the latter, a rivetting first hand account actually written during wartime is better journalism."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is excellent literature, a wrenching novel, a superb sea story, and entirely faithful to the history of World War II in the North Atlantic. Monsarrat's personal experience combined with his eye for detail make him an extraordinary writer. His prose will transport you to the very moment that he describes. This is an authentic classic and a must-read for everyone who would go to sea, as well as for every student of WWII. I've re-read my well-worn copy several times over thirty years."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I first learned of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" from the U.S. Navy's recently revamped reading list. After reading the book, I can see why it was included on the list. It provides a first-rate, historically-accurate account of the Battle of the Atlantic, in which Great Britain endured a systematic commerce destruction campaign by the German U-Boat fleet.Nicholas Monsarrat allowed the reader to join the crews of the ill-fated corvette \\"Compass Rose\\" and the luckier frigate \\"Saltash,\\" by individually describing the lives of various members of the crew. Primary attention is paid to the Captain, Cmdr Ericson, and the Exec, Lt Cmdr Lockhart. On the pitching decks of \\"Compass Rose\\" during a winter transit of the North Atlantic, Monsarrat investigates what is necessary to forge a crew from conscript civilians, and to meld them into a fighting unit. From experience, I can say that he captured the way that the \\"personality\\" of a ship develops, based upon the varying personalities in the crew.Monsarrat is a good writer, and he definitely draws the reader into his story. I almost felt physically cold when he described the trials that a sailor undergoes in a winter storm. It definitely brought back some memories of my own North Atlantic experiences.I did not like everything about this book, however. Monsarrat went to a lot of trouble to develop the personalities aboard \\"Compass Rose,\\" but paid curiously little attention to the crew of \\"Saltash.\\" Perhaps he was running out of time or interest in writing, or maybe he wanted to indicate that a larger ship is more impersonal. In any case, I felt that the reader missed out due to his decision. Also, the love interest of Lockhart appeared to be out of place in the book. It was unnecessary, and took up space that could have been devoted to the story line.Do not let the above detractions prevent you from reading this book. This book is a must-read for World War II history buffs, as well as for leaders wanting to learn from challenges that Monsarrat placed before Cmdr Ericson.

Reading the chapter when the Compass Rose goes on its first convoy with extremely rough seas I felt identified. I could perfectly picture myself in the middle of the Sea of Ireland riding 20 feet waves in 30 knot winds on a tiny ship with leaks everywhere.

Gripping, acurate and well recommended.PS Also read Alistair MacLeans \\"HMS Ulysess\\" for a similar read."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This book literally changed my life.In the eleventh grade in Greenville, South Carolina, i had an English teacher who designated Thursday as &quot;Free Reading Day&quot; and encouraged the entire class to read anything they wanted to (well, within limits -- &quot;Playboy&quot; would have been Right Out, i'm sure.) -- and, in case you had nothing of your own, she laid out an assortment of magazines and books on a table at the front of the room.On that table, one Thursday, was a copy of &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. Since i've always been at least a bit interested in sea stories, and it looked interesting, i picked it up. From the first i was hooked solidly.In the next three or so years, i reread it twice at least, possibly more than that.And then i joined the Navy -- and i am sure that it was because of what i read in this book, and what i sensed behind it, in what Monsarrat -- who, like his viewpoint character, Lockhart, was there from the beginning, working his way up to command his own ship before the end of the war -- didn't so much say as assume about the sea and the Navy -- *any* Navy.Monsarrat presents us here with a brotherhood of the sea, corny as that idea may sound. Sailors, more than the other Armed Forces, tend to regard other sailors -- even enemy sailors -- as brothers in arms, and, as Monsarrat says, the only true enemy is the cruel sea itself.As he shows us here, the sailor who was your enemy five minutes ago, who was trying to kill you as you tried to kill him, is merely another survivor to be rescued from the cruel sea once you've sunk his ship.And, even more so, as Monsarrat portrays it, there is a kind of brotherhood that binds sailors in the same Navy together in very mcuh a family manner -- you may not like your cousin, but you want to know what's happening to him and, when all is said and done, he IS your relative.The best summation of this sort of attitude (which i felt to some extent myself during my time in the US Navy) comes when Ericson, the Captain, is touring his new ship as she stands under construction in a Glasgow shipyard; he meets one of his future officers, and mentions the name of his previous ship, which was lost with over three-quarters of her crew, and realises that&quot;He's heard about 'Compass Rose', he probably remembers the exact details--that she went down in seven minutes, that we lost eighty men out of ninety-one. He knows all about it, like everyone else in the Navy, whether they're in destroyers in the Mediterranean or attached to the base at Scapa Flow: it's part of the linked feeling, part of the fact of family bereavement. Thousands of sailors felt personally sad when they read about her loss; Johnson was one of them, though he'd never been within a thousand miles of 'Compass Rose' and had never heard her name before.&quot;To be part of a band of brothers like that is a proud thing, and Monsarrat captures it perfectly.He also captures the terrified boredom of being in enemy territory with nothing happening as you wait for the enemy to make the first move, and the shock, confusion and horror of combat (particularly sea combat, in which the battlefield itself is the deadly, patient enemy of both sides).And he captures the glories and rewards of life at sea, the beauty of a glorious clear dawn at sea, the stars and the moon and the wake at night and so much more.This is the book that made a sailor out of me.It will tell you what it is to be a sailor."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"\\"The Cruel Sea\\" focuses on the British naval experience during World War II--more specifically, on the crew of a corvette during the first half of the war and, to a lesser extent, of a frigate during its waning years. Like most war stories, the plotting is at times necessarily predictable (yet still thrilling), but Monsarrat's epic is a cut above in both its human element (even in its occasional depiction of Germans) and in its presentation of the morally gray aspects of war. This is no ode to blind patriotism. Instead, the novel is an elegy on the selfless bravery and selfish survival instincts of a group of sailors whose reasons for being in the war are as varied as the men themselves: the stern but fair-minded Lieutenant-Commander Ericson, the indolent and tyrannical (and somewhat comical) First Lieutenant Bennett, the nervous and self-doubting Sub-Lieutenant Ferraby, the level-headed and thoughtful Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart (who, I would guess, is Monsarrat's alter ego), and a supporting cast of dozens. There are some spine-chilling and devastating battle scenes, but the book never once loses its focus: the men (and women) who fought and endured the war.Another surprising aspect of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is its intense lyricism. There are many sentences and descriptions that linger in the mind long after one has finished the novel. The death a crew member: \\"He did not exactly surrender to the sea, but he stopped caring much whether he lived or died; and on this night, an ambiguous will was not enough.\\" An officer finding out his girlfriend is pregnant: \\"The child would be the occasion of their marriage, not the cause for it.\\" Equally impressive is the novel's unusual wit--humor far beyond the stereotypical bawdiness of sailors: the friendly banter between crew members, the scrapes between men on leave and family members or other civilians, the hilarious clash of cultures when the frigate is docked for repairs in New York City.Generally, I am averse to \\"war novels\\" (with the exceptions of the usual famous classics); I'd rather read the real thing--journalism or history--and forego the shallow characterizations and poor writing so common to the genre of military fiction. So I can't explain what caused me to pick up this 500-page book, but I am certainly glad I did. This novel is a neglected classic and should be read by an audience far beyond the aficionados of war novels."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is an exciting and yet very poignant novel of naval warfare which took place in the North Atlantic during World War II. It focuses primarily on two English naval officers whose job it was to escort--with first an inadequate corvette and then a frigate--the numerous convoys that went back and forth across the Atlantic throughout the course of the war.It was a difficult job to begin with and got worse: by 1941 Allied shipping was being destroyed by German U-Boats at an alarming rate. During one memorable journey, eleven of the 21 ships they were sent to escort were sunk. This was an enormous toll, both in supplies and in lives lost.What this great book does is give us a first hand view of the action, and also the effect that it had on these men, and the lives of those around them. To be sure there is blood and gore here, but it is not sensationalized or glorified. It is simply recorded in a straightforward manner, and is all the more chilling because of it. What is really emphasized is the psychological effect. We get a clear picture of their exhaustion, their fear, their terror, and their frustration in their inability to deal effectively (at least early on), with an unseen and deadly enemy.They are at sea for months at a time and incapable of dealing with family problems on shore: philandering wives, sick mothers, far-away sons and loved ones. Their homes and villages are being bombed. They begin to feel hatred--not only of the enemy, but of the ship itself, and all that it represents: exhaustion, terror, helplessness, and death.The captain must make terrible decisions at a moment's notice. After one attack, he steams towards where he believes a U-boat to be, an area which also happens to be occupied by English survivors of an earlier wreck. He decides he must drop his depth charges, knowing for certain that these sailors will die. Later, he agonizes over whether there was a U-boat there to begin with.We get a sense of the dangerous nature of the sea itself. There is no place to go during wild Atlantic storms, and sometimes they last for days. Everything in the ship is tossed around. There is no hot food. Sleep is impossible when you are routinely thrown out of your bunk. Everybody is banged and bruised and sometimes severely injured by suddenly being heaved against a bulkhead. Of course there is also the terror of being swept overboard entirely. The only saving grace was that, during a storm, the U-boats didn't attack.The book covers this aspect of the war, and covers it thoroughly, from 1939, which is chapter one, to 1945, which is chapter seven. It is written from the perspective of adult men and women we learn to know well and come to care about deeply. We are saddened when they are wounded, or killed. And the termination of the love affair between the first mate and his \\"Wren\\" was nothing less than heart-wrenching. This is a great novel, and belongs on the shelf with perhaps the half-dozen or so of the greatest novels of World War II."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is perhaps the finest novel written out of World War II. It is drawn on the actual service in the Royal Navy of the author. It is the story of two ships, maybe 200 men, German submarines and the constant relentless ocean. Even when there is no combat action, the sea is always there in all its forms - just waiting for a small defect to occurr and then it will claim another victim - be it man or ship.The sailors of the Compass Rose are a dramatic cross section. The captain is a reservist from the merchant navy while his officers are all volunteers from the civilian sector. One officer's only sea going experience is crossing the channel in a small yacht with a one woman crew. Not the best of material.The crew is even more diverse. The senior ratings, coxswain, signalman, engineer and several others, are all professional Royal Navy and it is one these men the captain will lean the most. The remainder of the crew is drawn from all walks of life from clerks to vet assistants. Together they are all molded into a working crew.The contacts with the German submarines are numerous but the end result is disappointing to some in that only two submarines are sunk between the two ships. Lots of survivors are pulled from the sea though as the submarines whittle away at the convoys chugging across the sea.One gets a sense of the unending grind that the men endure as the ships make thier rounds from Liverpool to New York with a side trip to Russia for variety. Even shore time is not enjoyed as the local Liverpool area is pounded by German bombers and wives and girlfriends are not willing to endure the constant seperation.Compass Rose is sunk and the crew, once more, is held together by the captain. Some men are heros and die a heros death and others are simply freightened men trying to stay alive which few do. It is a sobering time for the survivors as they look back at their life in Compass Rose.The captain and one officer move on to another ship and finish the war in her. Again, it is a return to the grind of fighting the sea and occassionally fighting the Germans. One submarine is sunk by the new ship and the war ends.There is little glory to be earned in this story, rather it is a tale of survival, hanging on to make it through the day or night. Everyone is a hero in this story from the junior sailor to the captain. It is a story that is being remembered less and less as the survivors of World War II diminish in numbers. It is a story to be read and remembered - when there was no array of electronic weapons and nuclear energy to draw upon to destroy an enemy; rather it was skill, patience, persistance and a willingness to endure that saw a successful outcome from a combat between corvette and submarine. Sometimes the corvette won and sometimes the submarine won. Many times it was a draw.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the war at sea during World War II. It should be in every naval officer's personal library regardless of nationality. Once read, it should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is absolutely one of my favourite books, and I'm reading it for the 5th or 6th time right now.Based on his real wartime experinces, the author creates a fascinating story of &quot;one ocean, two ships, and some 150 men&quot;. Living from day to day through the horrors of naval war in the North Atlantic with the wonderfully-crafted characters, one is only beginning to imagine just how terrible it must have been. You breathe with them, you fight with them, you sleep with them and you live through their good and bad times - finding yourself unwilling to put this book aside.Read this book, and Buchheim's &quot;The Boat&quot;, and you can truly say: &quot;Now I know what it was like!&quot;"},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"37 years ago in high school English class we were challenged to read The Cruel Sea. I have never forgotten the flaming seas, the U-boats hiding under floating survivors, the cruel consequences of war, the noble Captain, the obnoxious crewman with his mouth of insults I had to ask my mother what they meant. A young girl, age 16, never read a war story, loved this book and never forgot it."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I found this book purely by accident, thanks to a recommendation by another book review. I think this is perhaps one of the finest novels about combat, certainly about naval combat, that I have ever read. Every word rings with a sense of authenticity and drama that is all too often missing from modern literature.I'm loathe to give away any plot detail; the story builds slowly like a fine meal. In short, the book concerns itself with two warships during escort duty during the whole of British involvement in WWII. The first ship, a Corvette, is small and perhaps a bit amateurish to begin with. Its history, and the relations of its crew are treated in intricate detail. The second ship, a Frigate, is larger, less personal and much like the war more mechanized and colder; its is more effective, to be true, and a step closer to victory but also represents a loss of humanity.Monsarrat weaves these two stories into a seamless whole - the bood deserves to be called an epic, and at times I almost felt like I was watching an old British war film, like Sink the Bismarck: every word rang true. I had one small complaint, and that involves either a misplaced death near the end of the novel. Again, I don't want to give anything away but it just felt unnecessary.Please, read the book. If you are at interested in Naval history, or just want a good read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"Take it from a retired naval officer, this is one of the best novels ever written about war at sea. Monsarrat explores the savage and relentless nature of the struggle against the U-boat menace in the North Atlantic. The sailors' enemies were not just the lethal German submarines, but miserable weather, bad food, wretched accommodations, physical and mental exhaustion, and emotional havoc. I wonder -- could I have stood the test?"},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; was recommended to me by my mom who read it as a young woman when it was first published. I was skeptical about reading this epic of WW2 battle at sea -- thought I wouldn't want to read about war in great detail -- but I found that the pages turn themselves. It is a GREAT book -- expertly constructed and beautifully written. It is an insight into the human spirit in a time of war, but it also works so well because it does an amazing job of making the ship itself a living, breathing character, in whose destiny one becomes intimately wrapped up. The copy I have is from the 50's and I'm thrilled to see it is still in print, though not surprised. The book is a true testament to the fact that GOOD WRITING, on any subject, is fascinating and stands the test of time."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"Nicholas Monsarrat's superbly written \\"The Cruel Sea\\" captures in fiction the essence of the Battle of the North Atlantic in a way that a history could not. It describes, at a very human level, the desperate struggle to safely escort convoys across the North Atlantic in the face in incessant Nazi submarine and aircraft attacks. On the success of the these convoys hung the outcome of war; without them, the Allied war effort would have ground to a halt and Britain would have starved.The narrative of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" centers on two men and two ships. George Ericson, a middle-aged commercial sea captain and Royal Navy Reserve officer, is recalled to the fleet in 1939 to lead the newly commissioned corvette HMS Compass Rose. Also central to the narrative is young Lockhart, a very green and newly commissioned Sub-Lieutenant who will grow into a fine naval officer and Ericson's \\"Number One\\" on both the Compass Rose and a follow-on command, the frigate HMS Saltash. \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is populated by an astonishingly rich cast of supporting characters, including ship's company at sea and wives and girlfriends ashore.The story itself, richly informed by the author's own experiences at sea in the Second World War, is that of the convoys. The Compass Rose and the Saltash will spend weeks at sea, sheparding merchant vessels under wartime conditions, enduring the harsh weather of the North Atlantic, and fighting the Nazi onslaught. It is a fight that calls for patience, endurance, skill, and cunning, much of it learned the hard way, on the job. The fight will demand the utmost from the men of the Compass Rose and the Saltash, making heroes of some and breaking others. Monsarrat captures it all in superbly readable, often lyrical prose: the mundane routine, the terror of combat, and the heartbreak of loss.\\"The Cruel Sea\\" does not attempt to glorify war. Monsarrat faithfully describes the huge human cost of war, in the strains on tired and frightened men, the struggle to acquire and keep the hard edge necessary to kill in combat, and in the sometimes unsuccessful effort to have a normal life ashore.This book is very highly recommended to the reader interested in the Battle of the North Atlantic and to the reader looking for a superb novel of the sea."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I enjoyed it.

As a former naval officer, I can attest to the authenticity of the descriptions of the sea, the consequences for the crew of heavy weather and the anxiety of going into battle. But what makes this particularly compelling is the way Monsarrat develops his characters, both underway and ashore. Even bit players in this drama are fully revealed as real people with genuine strengths and weaknesses, all sharing the experience of life on a small ship while leaving their wives, families and girlfriends at home. Not everyone is a hero in this story, either. It's easily among the most important works of naval fiction written about World War II.

Nothing else come close."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"Not for those who fear the stormy seas, this authentic novel will have you grasping for steady lines as you live the life of a convoy patrol in the North Atlantic during the early years of World War II. Like life itself, in heroic situations, all who serve do not live as heroes. Nicholas Monsarrat brings this classic tale of adventure to life as only one who really knew the Cruel Sea could do. This book is best read on Kindle as references to obscure nautical terms such as asdic, (Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee) are used and the Kindle dictionary and Wikipedia are invaluable resources to better enjoy this fine book. A mistaken notion of war at sea is thinking the story is about ships in conflict. This story rings with reality because it portrays war at sea as one of men in conflict. Under pressure of such conflict judgement is questioned and enemy and ally alike are strained to find correct answers.In the final court of judgement, it is the sea that holds supreme, the sea, the Cruel Sea."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is a grab you by the throat hard and gritty story of two small RN ships and their crews in WW II. It's not a happy story as it's filled with misery and suffering which makes it all the more compelling. While the movie based upon this book was good the book is far more realistic and true to the events of the day. I've read this book at least four times over many years and each reading was every bit as good as the first. If you have seen the movie than you should purchase and read this book. If you like WWII Naval fiction than this book is a must."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is an absolutely thrilling, gripping, involving story of war at sea. I have no disagreement with those who say this is one of the best novels to come out of WWII. I've had a copy with me through the years, ever since I first read it in high school. Monsarrat has a beautiful feel of the language, made more so by his own familiarity with the subject at hand. Every time I pick up the book and reread passages, I am still enthralled by the fine writing. There is even a lovely, poignant love story in the middle of it. Here is a passage describing nothing in particular, merely the ship &quot;Compass Rose&quot; when the convoy was a quiet one and the men aboard her could relax a bit:&quot;They found that some nights, especially, had a peaceful loveliness that repaid a hundred hours of strain. Sometimes in sheltered water, when the moon was full, they moved with the convoy past hills outlined against the pricking stars: slipping under the very shadow of these cliffs, their keel divided the phosphorescent water into a gleaming wake that curled away till it was caught and held in the track of the moon....Compass Rose, afloat on a calm sea, seemed to shed every attribute save a gentle assurance of refuge.&quot; (p 105, 1951 Knopf edition)There was a movie made by the British earlier on, with Jack Hawkins as Ericson, the captain. The plot obviously had to be shortened, and I think the love story was changed a bit. The novel is better, still, and I do hope that they do NOT try to make another movie of it, for surely the Hollywood treatment will only cheapen this superb piece of work."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"Finding an original hard cover version of this novel was quite a chore but well worth the wait. Monsarrat follows the exploits of the crew of a British corvette and later a destroyer as it escorts trans oceanic convoys during the battle of the Atlantic. The officers and crew are continually pitted against an always lurking pack of determined German U boats. The tension created as a result of the staggering losses of ships and human life and the battle of nerve and wits between the opposing commanders is gripping. Monsarrat does some wonderful character development of the crew members, showing how the strain of war creates serious personality changes. Its seems as if Monsarrat has served in the Navy as the authenticity of his story seems beyond question."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read about men at war, with each other yes because they have to be, but mainly with that cruel mistress the SEA. The characters are dynamic, and you find yourself, cursing their enemy as if it were your own. I would recommed this book to anyone who enjoys either the sea or stories about men at war. The only comparable book is Jan de Hartog's The Captain, However this book is far better."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is no ordinary blood-and-glory sea story, with a ship full of heroes who can do no wrong. Here is real life - the misery of North Atlantic weather, in a small ship rolling constantly in the tremendous swell. An untried and amateur crew aboard a newly built ship are pitted against an omnipresent and invisible enemy below the waves, who is able to mark ships and sailors for death seemingly at will. In perhaps the most bitter fight of WW II, the crew adapt and learn, making Compass Rose a highly effective weapon against the German U-Boats.Written in 1951, Monsarrat bases his story on his own experience as first officer of a corvette on convoy escort duty. He clearly identifies with his primary character, Lockhart, who joins HMS Compass Rose in 1939 as a very junior Sub Lieutenant. The people and ships are fictional, but this is nevertheless a true and moving story. A brilliant story, totally unforgettable!"},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The cold gripping fear, frustration,and agony of the convoy escorts in the North Atlantic during WWII. The physical and emotional sacrafices of the men assigned to escort duty to protect the life blood of Great Britan. Monsarrat is a fantastic story teller, filling the reader with emotions in a way that very few writers will ever master. The realization that Command is really lonely,and the second guessing of descisions is a tough pill for Captain Ericson to swallow. These sailors are not Regular Navy from a Family lineage of Naval service, rather the average Joe brought together by the war. Yet they form a strong fighting unit. As as in every war, death is not picky about whom it takes. A great book that will be hard to put down till it is finished. Give it some time and you will read it again."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"SUPERB BOOK, a Classic I use this title because the story is written from the viewpoint of a RNVR Officer (a prewar voluntary reserve officer, background and qualifications yachtsman). I mention this because having a father that served on USN convoy duty before the war started (USS Jacob Jones), and having lived in the UK amongst many who also served in the war, I realize now that the book and the film provide an accurate and vividly emotional portrayal of what it was like. Also, add to list of why &quot;There will always be an England&quot;"},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I have read dozens of WW2 novels and histories, but this is the perfect melding of the two genres, having been written by a veteran of the Battle of the Atlantic.

Having myself toured a WW2 corvette which is moored in Halifax (NS) harbor, I so clearly imagine life on the first ship described, and the challenges these men faced."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I am a big fan of military history.

I felt like I knew the very people described in the book and could empathize with them.

I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII particularly if they are interested in ships and seamen."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The Cruel Sea. Great sea story brought to life.

Carefully scripted and written, the reader is drawn into this story of the British ships Compass Rose and Saltash, and their desperate cat-and-mouse game on the high seas with Nazi U-boats. This fine trade paperback edition from Burford Books will introduce a whole new generation of action/adventure enthusiasts to a truly skilled and engaging writer whose ability to involve the reader from first page to last is rarely equaled and never surpassed."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is a wonderful book. I first read it twenty years ago and have re-read it twice since then. Nicholas Monsarrat is a superb writer and he gives an exciting account of what it must have been like to be aboard British corvettes in the North Atlantic during World War 2. The ships were small and the risks were great. Although a work of fiction, it comes out of Monsarrat's first-hand experience. I look forward to reading The Cruel Sea once again and strongly recommend this excellent book."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"It's a pity this book's out of print. I read it for the first time in a Dutch translation when I was 17 years old. It made a deep impression on me. When I read the English version, fifteen years on, this impression was even deepened. What the people on board of the cargo-vessels and warships that crossed the North-Atlantic during WW II had to endure is almost beyond description. Monserrat did a terrific job doing this. I was captured from the beginning to the end. I myself being a ship's captain was moved deeply by this story of the sea, the war and the movings of small human beings caught in between. Anything Alistair McLean might have written about this subject is put very much in the shadow by this terriffic book."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I read a lot of military fiction, ranging from \\"it's all glory\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but wish they had, by \\"it's all hell\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but are trying to send a message. Somewhere in the middle, with a bit of both aspects and a lot of experience, are the relatively few novels written by guys who've been there, writing from experience about situations that closely paralleled what they went through - a bit of hell, a bit of glory, and a lot of detail.The Cruel Sea sits near the top of the latter category. Nicholas Monsarrat was a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and spent his war on small ships, fighting German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. The main character of The Cruel Sea, Keith Lockhart, is a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and...It's a first-rate book. Even without Monsarrat's biography, it's obvious that he knows what he's talking about; it shows in the details. Most military fiction has a certain amount of scenes away from the front, dealing with the main characters' personal lives; The Cruel Sea has the same, and does it excellently... by no means glamorously (there's one particular thread, about a lieutenant's unfaithful wife, that is the antithesis of glamor), but very realistically; the scenes don't seem at all tacked on \\"to give the fighting men a human side\\", but feel like - and are - an integral part of the book. The characters are the same people in a London bar or in the middle of the Atlantic; you get the feeling that most of the people, and most of the incidents, are based on real people and situations that Monsarrat either knew or knew of, during his time in the war.A certain, very small, percentage of military fiction transcends the \\"military\\" label - fiction about people, in a military situation. The combat isn't the focus of the story; it's simply a part of it. Life at sea and character development take precedence over fast-moving plots; there are, realistically, no individual bad guys (how many soldiers or sailors know the names of the men on the other side?), but the work is executed well enough that a plot would feel irrelevant.I've read hundreds of books of military fiction. A bare handful are as good as this one. Thoroughly and absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"Andrew Mendelson's review mentions a &quot;misplaced death&quot;. He misses the point it was as un-necessary and as useless as many in the war - and that is one of the points of this classic war novel. Monserrat writes well about the sea because he was at sea and this story is one of his strongest because he tells it from the point of view of someone who witnessed it for real.The Cruel Sea is an extensive fictionalising, reworking and fleshing out of his wartime short stories &quot;HM Corvette, East Coast Corvette, Corvette Command&quot;, published during the war when it was quite clear he did not expect to survive the Battle of the Atlantic on which the bulk of the Cruel Sea is based. The Cruel Sea is taughtly drawn, superbly observed and records the transition from amateur civilians into trained professional killers with all the physical, and emotional casualites that were incurred along the way.The 1953 movie (also available on Amazon) is also a good adaption of the tale."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"If a one-word review were acceptable, it would just be: &quot;Great!&quot;. You're living through the career of a moderately able submarine hunter in WWII. Like in real life, he was out there in a nutshell called a &quot;Flower class&quot; corvette, facing the stormy North Atlantic and loads of prowling German subs. Have you ever wondered how those heroes' lives really were like? You will live with the corvette's green crew through their hard training, through endless boring hours of seasickness, through personal problems like bad superiors or unfaithful wives, through mobbing and loneliness,... You will see ships around them explode and sink, till finally - oh, I shouldn't spoil the story, should I?A fascinating book, I couldn't stop reading day and night. Try to be part of WWII, let your imagination play, don't watch movies...If you're interested in more of it, try the other side of the coin, as described by Lothar Guenther Buchheim."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"The Battle of the Atlantic is often referred to as a crucial campaign in the history of World War II; in keeping the sea lanes open throughout the war, the Allies kept the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in the fight and began the build up for operations in the Mediterranean and in Europe. Popular and historical focus in the Battle of the Atlantic often falls on the German U-Boats as their captains' daring and their crews' boldness make for more dashing stories. In contrast, technologies such as radar, sonar and the cracking of ULTRA are often credited with winning the battle for the Allies, and little attention is paid, generally, to the ships and men who fought the Germans and prevailed in the Atlantic.The Cruel Sea is their story. It is the story of a British destroyer tasked to escort Allied convoys across the Atlantic. It relates the entire course of the war, and illustrates the challenges that the British Navy and the Allies faced at various points in the Atlantic: manning ships with draftees in volunteers in a time of war, the the fear and uncertainty of pre-radar/sonar escort operations in the early years of World War II, and the slow and gradual triumph over the U-Boats after 1943. The Cruel Sea also is a gripping story of human nature, providing insights into loyalty, leadership and courage through the actions of its characters.The Cruel Sea is not a book about war; it is a book about people, men mostly, in a time of war and how they react to adversity. As literature, it is beautifully written, a masterpiece. The author crafts his words so that the reader is gripped by prose as well as by the action and flow of the story. It was a joy to read. The Cruel Sea is a valuable bit of history as well, shedding light on a service and a battle that few know about beyond devoted students of World War II."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"I've read this one several times over several years (first as a college history class assignment), and it still amazes me how Monsarrat is able to capture the spirit and tribulations of men at sea during war time. If you're at all interested in WW II or naval operations, you must read this book, as Monsarrat penetratingly explores the psyches, motivations and character of the book's principal characters. As the war in the North Atlantic goes on, the reader grows with the characters - who are for the most part Royal Naval Reservists or newbie volunteers, rather than professional Royal Navy &quot;lifers&quot;. Together, the men and the ship go through their shared baptism of fire against the U-Boat scourge during the dark days of 1940-1942 convoy duty. This book, like Alistair MacLean's HMS Ulysses, is a true naval history classic. Don't skip it."},{"Title":"The cruel sea","review":"This is a naval story set during World War II. That should put off no one. Monserrat is a trul fine writer, who grips any reader so well with his detailed story about intelligent, able, men going about a horrific duty, taking every precaution available, grittily making plans to cope in the midst of danger, but knowing that their risks are great, and catastrophe frequent. It is truly a wonderful book - a wonderful mix of characters (and the author is as interested in character as plot).

Sometimes I wonder how they have so much energy! This story had a good message and introduction of additional characters from the small town. I enjoyed the story of newlyweds Summer and Neville - oh so opposite and so in love. They came together in the end to resolve their very different backgrounds with their parents and a closeness with each other.

If he could strike gold with Horace Rumpole, why not with Lucy Purefoy? Unfortunately, no such luck.Lucinda Purefoy is a bishop's daughter recently graduated from college. She takes an advertising job, but something is missing, so she decides to volunteer for an organization called SCRAP, Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors, who help former prisoners readjust to society. That's how she meets Terry Keegan who's just done four years for breaking and entering. They fall in love.The conflict begins when Terry tries to explain to Lucy why he got into burglary in the first place. \\"It's not for the money,\\" he says, \\"It's the excitement.\\" She wants to get closer to Terry so she decides to try it for herself. She begins by shoplifting. When Terry finds out about it, the roles are reversed. Now he's the one trying to get her to go straight.When Terry looks down his nose at her trivial efforts, she decides to increase the stakes. There lies the problem with the book. It's just not believable; it reads more like Bridget Jones's Diary than a crime caper. I would imagine Mortimer was trying to lampoon do-gooders here, but Lucy is such a dim bulb that the reader is constantly telling himself, \\"She can't be serious!\\"The minor characters are worse. Lucy's father the bishop is more liberal than Teddy Kennedy. When he finds out Lucy is sleeping with Terry, he's all for it. Also, when the leader of SCRAP resigns, they solicit Terry's criminal overseer, Chippy McGrath, to take his place. Mr. Markby, Terry's parole officer, is just as clueless. These people just don't measure up to the Rumpole characters. Somebody should have had the courage to tell this to Mr. Mortimer."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Lucy Purefoy, a confessed do-gooder, joins SCRAP (Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors), eager to help criminals rejoin society and become vital, working, happy parts of it. Her first and --- it turns out --- only charge, Terry Keegan, wants none of Lucy nor of SCRAP. He's finally won his freedom and vows to leave everything about \\"the system\\" behind. When he walks out of those prison doors, he has a little money in his pocket and a pretty good idea of where he wants to go, and it most definitely has nothing to do with Ms. Lucy Purefoy. His Aunt Dot always did quite well by him, so why not make a fresh start from there? Sadly, no one told Terry that Aunt Dot passed away during the three years he was off paying his debt to society.A bit desperate, Terry calls on his old buddy and partner --- or ex-partner --- in crime, Leonard \\"Chippy\\" McGrath, hoping to room with him just until he can get back on his feet. Unfortunately, Terry discovers that Chippy hasn't changed one iota since their days working together, and when Terry turns down Chippy's offer to join his cadre of B&E; specialists, he finds himself back on the streets, stripped of his cash and his hopes of a bed for the night. With the whole idea of independence looking more and more difficult, Terry decides that the enthusiastic Ms. Purefoy might be able to help after all --- just this once.Naturally, the good-doing Lucy is ecstatic to have a real criminal to reform, especially after all those dull weeks spent in training. Excited that Terry has responded to her efforts, she redoubles her energies to find him a suitable place to live and lands him a legitimate job. Quite honestly, Lucy thinks, it's so simple.In order to most effectively help Terry, Lucy decides she needs to fully understand him, so she embarks on an ambitious plan to do so. She's a hands-on kind of gal. And you could say she goes beyond the call of duty. Way beyond. Maybe it's her naivet&eacute;, having grown up the daughter of a Bishop, or her wide-eyed belief that people are basically good, just in need of a break and a little faith. Whatever, Lucy learns more than she bargained for about a life of crime.Full of eccentric characters --- Lucy's father, a bishop whose modern interpretations of the church's teachings include tolerance for extramarital sex and gay marriages; Terry's cohort, the appropriately named Screwtop (unhappily, a reference to his brain function); Lucy's ex-boyfriends, a motley group of eccentric winners and big-time losers; and a romantically inclined prison matron with a hopeful roving eye --- QUITE HONESTLY is a quick-reading hoot.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"That the guy's only doing it for some doll.\\"From Frank Loesser's \\"Guys and Dolls\\". There is a Guys and Dolls like quality to John Mortimer's new book \\"Quite Honestly\\", but with a twist. In John Mortimer's world of criminals and those who would seek to redeem them it's better than even money that the doll's only doing it for some guy.The \\"guy\\" in this instance is Terry Keegan. He's a youthful offender newly released from prison. The \\"doll\\" is Lucinda Purefoy. The daughter of a very liberal Anglican (Episcopalian) Bishop and recent graduate of Manchester University (of which I am a proud alumnus). In a rather rash career move she is recruited to join an association dedicated to the rehabilitation of Britain's prison population, \\"Social Carers, Reformer and Praeceptors\\" known to all as SCRAP.Terry is Lucinda's first assignment and from the beginning we see that things will not necessarily turn out quite the way Lucinda envisions things. The story is told in the voices of both Terry and Lucinda in successive chapters. It is a very neatly drawn point/counter-point process. First we hear Terry's account of their first meeting, then Lucinda's, and so on.The plot hook for \\"Quite Honestly\\" is a simple one: will Lucinda succeed in her planned redemption of Terry. For Mortimer at least it seems the road to hell and maybe to love (if there is any difference between the two) is indeed paved with good intentions. Along the way we are treated to some of Mortimer's typically humorous and insightful writing. Mortimer's wry asides about Lucinda's father the bishop and the Anglican Church (ground Mortimer has trod before in his Rapstone Chronicles series) are humorous in principal part because they seem so on target. As you would expect from someone who has given us Rumpole and characters such as Peanuts Molloy and Tony Timson, the words and thoughts we see coming from Terry are also funny, the more so because they seem to ring so true. The story takes twists that may or may not be expected and Mortimer adds a layer of absurdity that somehow makes these unexpected twists somehow seem rational. It is hard to believe, of course, that people can act the way Lucinda does but I don't think Mortimer is engaged in writing a realistic \`noir' crime story. His aim is to entertain and as long as one doesn't expect super-realism I don't think they will be disappointed.John Mortimer's \\"Quite Honestly\\" was fun to read. While it may not be the best piece of writing he's ever done, it is still a cut above most of what you might find in the front shelves of your local book store. The characters are not quite as fully formed as fans of Rumpole may have come to expect. However, those characters developed over time and over many stories and here we have a relatively short novel (about 205 pages) that brings us protagonists with a clean slate. I think as long as you go in without expecting it to be quite as masterful as the stories he has created for Rumpole you will enjoy \\"Quite Honestly\\"."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"This is a love story without imagery depictions of gnarly positions written beautifully by Mr. Mortimer. Lucy wants to do some good in this world so she volunteers to be a reformer to Terry who has just been released from prison. Terry is not that easy to change therefore Lucy faces a big challenge in front of her. When push comes to shove Lucy perseveres; she is the daughter of a bishop. A lot of eccentric characters make up Mr. Mortimer's tale. The dialogues are funny. Each chapter is told from Lucy's point of view or Terry's side of an experience. The language is particularly stunning and swift. With Mr. Mortimer's knowledge of British law and order, and its justice system, his narration is tremendously exciting especially that he adds an extraordinary sense of humor into looking at situations. From the first page to the last this book is wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Remember the O. Henry tale of love where the man sells his watch to buy an ornament to his love's beautiful long hair? And she sells her hair to buy him something? John Mortimer updates the meme.Terry Keegan is a small-time, young burglar about to be released from prson. Lucy Purefoy is an idealistic young woman who believes, more or less, that love and goodness can change the world, so she joins SCRAP (Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors). As a praeceptor, Lucy is to befriend a released prisoner and help him or her find a job, a place to live and keep them on the straight and narrow. Praeceptors are, of course, not to become their charges' friends and especially not their lovers.You know what's going to happen, don't you?Terry knows that there is a better, higher road in life, but he doesn't want Lucy's help. He'll find his own way, thank you. Lucy, of course, knows, just knows, she can change Terry's course in life.The story is told in alternating voices, first Lucy, then Terry. Along the way, author John Mortimer introduces us to characters who are a hilarious send up of contemporary mores. There's Lucy's father, a bishop who doesn't think God is on his side any more, not since the deity smiled upon Bush and Blair. Lucy's mother is an genteel alcoholic, totally self-absorbed. Lucy herself reflects the values of the age, never without a man of the moment in her bed. In all, Mortimer skillfully and efficiently describes our era, where traditional values have been abandoned for . . . well, for whatever strikes one's fancy.Of course, Lucy and Terry begin their descent along the slippery slope of love. Terry wants to earn the respect of Lucy by doing good. Lucy wants to bond with Terry by understanding what keeps him burgling houses.The plot is predictable as is the climax, but it's still lots of fun as Lucy and Terry wend their way through one hilarious episode after another. Mortimer has an easy style and is, overall, delightful.Definitely a light read, but always a very enjoyable one.Jerry"},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"I enjoy Mortimer for two basic reasons. First, his stories are interesting and well-developed. More importantly, I find his novels and stories to contain a vastly amusing curmidgeon-like perspective on the foibles of current British society. This is certainly true even in the Rumpole stories. To say that the man can be maddingly witty is a vast understatement. Of course, the humor masks a very serious and perceptive observer of contemporary Britain; but it generates vast amounts of chuckles nonetheless.This novel is no exception. Mortimer, among other topics, manages to skewer \\"do-gooder\\" associations (that being SCRAP, otherwise known as Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors), the prison system, theories of criminal behavior, upper-class guilt, various theories of reforming convicted criminals, and the hierarchy of the Church of England. Satire can often be overdone, and Mortimer clearly sometimes pushed the envelope. But Mortimer fans and others will delight in this highly contrived, but nonetheless, amusing disgourgement of the author's latest collection of pet peeves.Mortimer, recently knighted, is not in the best of health these days, and has passed into his eighties. He was somewhat \\"shaky\\" when he spoke in Washington several years ago to a full house of enchanted listeners at a Smithsonian Institution function. However long he remains with us, he is to be savored and enjoyed--and re-read often."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"How does John Mortimer do it? Everything I read by him is so consistent, so witty, so darn good! I have read and reread the famous Rumpole books, and I love them dearly, but I also apreciate the brilliance of his pen in his non-Rumpole works such as this unpredictable and funny novel of love and crime. As is often the case in his work, Mortimer plays with the concepts of justice, crime, right and wrong, and the result is a delight. It is the story of a see-saw; a woman stands clearly on the side of virtue, and a young man on the side of vice, however the author slowly causes them to slide gracefully towards their oppostie extremes. While this is going on, the feeling of love rears its ugly face, and nothing seems to make sense anymore.I strongly recommend this delightfully daffy meditation on crime and virtue."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Over the years a collector of Rumpole and his other works I have thoroughly enjoyed his writing, some to a greater extent than others.This, his last work ,I believe, is not memorable as it should have been.It appears to be aimed at a teen feminine market as many of the latest movies appear to be.This ,obviously is my own opinion but leaves me wishing for the wit and characters to be found in so many of his other works.The angst between the two main characters has its witty moments but on the whole fail,in my opinion, to achieve any high points."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Recently graduated from Manchester University with a degree in social sciences, Lucinda Purefoy feels good about her future. Perhaps because of her being an offspring of a caring liberal Anglican bishop, Lucinda believes she should thank society for her opportunities. Thus the idealistic Lucinda joins the volunteer group SCRAP (Social Careers, Reformers and Preceptors) that assigns one of their compassionate guides with a recently released former convict to expedite the ex prisoner's return into society.Lucinda meets her objective burglar Terry Keegan as he is released from Wormwood Scrubs after he spent three years behind bars for breaking and entering. Terry wants nothing to do with the do-gooder so he plans to dump her in the first fast food place he finds. However, stubborn Lucinda is like dry mustard refusing to come off even when Terry visits his childhood crony Leonard \\"Chippy\\" McGrath seeking work. Chippy is an environmentally concerned businessman, who Lucinda will soon learn runs a vast crime complexQUITE HONESTLY is a fabulous look at society using a rotational point of view between how Lucinda sees her need to help Terry and his perspective that she is a pain in the rump. The story line is fast-paced and filled with amusement as John Mortimer looks closely in his ironic manner at incarceration and prison reform through his Good Samaritan and a former guest of the state. Rumpole aside, this is a fabulous thought provoking tale that will have readers laugh yet ponder the goal of imprisonment and what is best for both society and the ex-con (not necessarily inclusive) to return to the civilian world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"i was very please with the condition of the book and the speedy delivery as this was a gift for my sister has she could not find the book in her locale."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"I first became aware of Mortimer's humor, by way of the \\"Rumpole Of The Bailey\\" series on the BBC. I find myself laughing out loud at his observations and wonderful descriptions of people and events. Once you have read a John Mortimer book, you will be hooked for life, anxiously awaiting the next gem from this delightfully entertaining author."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Young Lucinda Purefoy wants to do good. To that end she gets involved with an organization that helps convicts when they get out of prison. What happens when Lucinda is assigned her ex-con leads to a bunch of adventures that turns do-gooderism on its head. Mortimer is at his best in this wryly witty look at liberalism at work. What's funniest is that Mortimer is poking fun at his own kind. A delightful read in every way."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Fresh out of prison, budding career criminal Terry Keegan walks into the arms of starry-eyed idealist Lucinda Purifoy from the Social Carers Reformers and Praeceptors. Keegan is the illegitimate son of a shrewish witch who was raised by his saintly aunt and her career criminal husband. Lucy is the lap-of-luxury airhead daughter of an alcoholic mother and a clueless father.Lucy is determined to reform Terry, and Terry is determined to do without Lucy. Their lives become hopelessly entangled and crimes abound as the two slowly undergo a transformation in both their relationship and their lives, with them ending up at ... Well, read the book.One problem that seems to permeate all of Mortimer's crime writing comes starkly to the forefront here. Although he does portray the damage that crime does to the criminal and the criminal's kin, he ignores the harm done to one very important class of people--the victims of crime. All the victims of crime in this book are either completely anonymous or completely despicable. Hard to generate much sympathy for them. The criminals, on the other hand, think of themselves as Robin Hoods who steal from the rich, but don't give to the poor.As a former prosecutor, I've dealt face-to-face with thousands of crime victims. Many are despicable, but most are decent people who worked hard for what was taken away from them. I'd like to see Mortimer write the occasional story from the victim's vantage point."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"I hate books where the point of view jumps from chapter to chapter. In alternating chapters, the story is told by Lucy and then by Terry. Thus the same material is covered twice. A great device for an author to double the page count, but repetitious and boring. Even though I liked the Rumpole series, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Quite Honestly","review":"Quite frankly, I expected this to be a continuation of the elder statesman's remembrances. In 'Where There's A Will,' which I got from the library and had much trouble understanding, he had the old man's encumbrance of honestly remembering things as they were. You have to be British to understand their 'take' on a will. Some years ago, I typed my husband's 'memoirs' which he distributed to his kinfolk. I did a bit of editing and he acquiesed, after saying \\"we didn't talk that way.\\" I saw that an old man does not remember things the way they actually happened. I have been accused of such, but I do and always did have a good memory.He uses the 'he-said, she-said' approach to this new novel. In 2002, I wrote a short novel using actual emails to and from which was to be titled \\"He Said, She Said\\" but, alas, it is somewhere hidden among my souvenirs as I do not know how to get published. It was a good love story.John Mortimer wrote PARADISE POSTPONED (he didn't mean Hawaii) and the Rumpole novels. This one has a ways to go to even be compared with his earlier works."},{"Title":"The Qualinesti (Dragonlance: Elven Nations, Vol. 3)","review":"The Qualinesti is clearly a Dragonlance great.

This is a great book and you will love every mnute of it if you like Dragonlance"},{"Title":"The Qualinesti (Dragonlance: Elven Nations, Vol. 3)","review":"\\"The Qualinesti\\" is definately a great book. Not only is it full of action and adventure. But it come across with actual real emotions that people can relate too. There is jealousy, deceit, sadness and many other emotions filling this book. I had heard mixed reviews about this book before I read it. But, I was pleasently suprised by how good this book actually was. I liked it as much, of not more, than \\"The Firstborn\\" (The first book in this trilogy). This book brings about the end of a legacy. It is a little depressing, but it is nice to see the state of the Qualinesti under the leadership of Kith-Kanan and his son. A definate must for Dragonlance fans."},{"Title":"The Qualinesti (Dragonlance: Elven Nations, Vol. 3)","review":"Before I make my comments, I'd like to point out that I greatly enjoyed the first novel in the Elven Nations trilogy by Thompson. The second book was terrible, but making my way into the third novel, I was very optimistic about a return to quality with Thompson again as the writer.In that, I was sorely disappointed. Considering that this trilogy is supposedly about the formation of Qualinesti, the second Elven kingdom,it is surprising that we see very little about its formation. Instead, at the beginning of the third book, we are jumped ahead years to when Qualinesti is ALREADY founded, with leadership in place, people settled, and mainly just a few self-defense and succession issues to work out. In other words, some of the most conceivably interesting parts of the series (like a struggle to actually form the city and nation) are left out.Add on to that, the unappealing characters, a Kith-Kanan who has reverted to loving Hermathya in spite of not loving her anymore in the first book, an evil wizard on a mountain top, and a deus ex machin . . oops! I meant Kith-Kanan's long lost son by Anaya, we get an unfortunately unsatisfying ending to a trilogy on what should be one of the Dragonlance's most interesting stories."},{"Title":"The Qualinesti (Dragonlance: Elven Nations, Vol. 3)","review":"It's a shame that this series is out of print. I had to get mine off eBay for nearly $40.00! Now I know why. Though the series is written by different authors, you would never know it and the series is more about Kith-Kanan than the elves themselves. Sithas (Kith's brother) is featured in the 2nd novel for a few chapters, but it's mostly about Kith-Kanan. The Qualinesti focuses on Kith's two kids mostly but Kith gets some limelight as well. This book presents a very different view of the Elven nation than the one we know from post-cataclysm. This Qualinesti has men, dwarves and elves living together, while PC Qualinesti is inhabitted purely by elves. If you can get your hands on this series, do so!"},{"Title":"The Qualinesti (Dragonlance: Elven Nations, Vol. 3)","review":"This book started out with some promise, and I was especially excited because the authors of book three were different than the boring author who wrote book one and two. Let me begin! These authors could have collaborated with the previous books or author for specific info. I would like to know what happened to some characters from the first two books, but instead we get new characters and those stories are not told and forgotton. A crime! On top of that, this book doesn't have an ending! It is like the last fifty pages are gone and several characters and missions and stories in the middle of this book are never addressed or finished! I was completely shocked at the amateur technique of these two authors. This whole three part series was a complete waste of my time! The only redeeming value was....well....I will think of something in the future, right now I can't! Terrible! Shame on these authors!"},{"Title":"Le Tour: A Century of the Tour de France","review":"If you want a Tour book to go on the coffee table, this would be a good choice.

But as a history book, it is too short on content to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Le Tour: A Century of the Tour de France","review":"This book consists primarily of photographs, in chronological order, of the great race. But what photographs! This may be one of the best histories of the race, in pictures, alongside A.S.O's centennial history of the race in 2003. Similar in style to Philippe Brunel's classic, \\"An Intimate Portrait of the Tour de France\\" (not all of the pictures are of the racers during the race), except that the later photos are in color.(My Listmania blurb on the book was in error, this is a good photographic history of the race, now an overview -- I was thinking of a different book.)"},{"Title":"Reading Books for Pay","review":"A collection of information that can probably be gathered at the library, combined all in one book for the hopeful.

Goes on to mention getting more education to raise your reading abilities.Then goes on to talk about being a proof reader, copy editor, and possibily even an indexer, of course with all the contacts you will make by offering to edit the newsletters of local clubs or whatever. Numerous example letters to write to offer your services to overburdened businesses. Many exclamation marks throughout the copy. Photos are scattered throughout the book that have nothing to do with the information.Goes on to talk about reading plays, getting involved in the local theatre and aspiring to be a recorded bookreader. Also includes information about writing magazine articles. An absolute load of ideas on possible ways to perhaps make a living in media. List of magazines and writers organizations, probably sadly out of date.Information about being a researcher for a writer as this was written before Google. While dated, it can provide some information. It concludes with information about becoming self-published.

Im very familiar with both cities and i have to say for the tourist, Austin does not hold a candle to San Antonio..it's sort of like comparing Baton Rouge to New Orleans. I mean dont get me wrong id rather live in Austin, but if your going to these cities for fun, spend like two days in Austin, then make your way to San Antonio...fast,,,the riverwalk alone is worth spending several days. As for this guide, I like the way it's layed out and the ratings of sites is very accurate. The hotel and restaurant guides are pretty basic, but it gives you an general overview. If you have never visited this area...be sure to ride out into the Hill Country, all the German Heritage and scenic vista's is not to be missed..."},{"Title":"Frommer's San Antonio & Austin","review":"We used this book a LOT during our week vacationing in San Antonio.

But we did their recommended downtown walking tour one day, and it was just like having our personal tour guide with us as we read about each stop. The first night we found our way to a Tex-Mex restaurant that they recommended, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Other days we drove to outlying towns that were also recommendations, and we never would have discovered them on our own without that book.

It appears that HWY 151 was extended to HWY 90 several years ago, but the book has it stopping at the 410. This provided us with several overdriven directions until we discovered the error.

In the synopsis of SubUrbia, one can read of the plot in the book. The true power of the book, however, is not in its plot. The power is in the searing criticism of American society. Bogosian masterfully depicts the evils of American society through the actions and the very constitutions of his characters. These characters find themselves aimlessly adrift in the horse latitudes on the way to adulthood. Bogosian's wake up call to America is driven home when the abrupt ending is punctuated with crazed shouts from a foreigner"},{"Title":"subUrbia","review":"This is an excellent play that explores the true grit behind being a youth in America. Touching on some of the things that effect teens today, Bogosian brought to life the true picture of the beatnik degenerate youth of today. A vivid picture of suburbian teenagers struggling with life. It was almost as if you'd taken a piece of my youth and written a screenplay surrounding it. My only negative is the word choice. Bogosian portrays the truth behind teenagers in America today, but overly typifies their language. The slang Bogosian uses wavears from accurate to grossly inaccurate.

Taking class after class while working dead end jobs that will eventually do nothing but make you unappreciated by your boss, ignored by your family, and eventually forgotten. Many people sadly see the world like that, and that's what this play is about, a group of people's fight against and acceptance of hopelessness. Relief is so far off into the future that it does no good. The characters are bold and able to relate to in a story that could've been sophmoric and gone for cheap laughs.

My story is rather interesting on how i acquired this book. I wrote reviews such as this on books on amazon.com and Mr. Di Maggio contacted me via e-mail and asked if I was interested in reviewing his book if he would mail it to me. I agreed not knowing whether this was a hoax or really true. Much to my surprise, days later I received a hard cover copy of his book \\"Rob's Trilogy\\" with an autograph on the inside cover. Not only was this a great book, I really appreciate the thoughtfulness Mr. Di Maggio put into it to pay for the shipping charges just to get a simple review. This book is a trilogy about a boy named Rob and his discovery in the woods which changed his life. If you like the idea of a science fiction book mixed in with a reality based adventure book, you will probably like \\"Rob's Trilogy\\".

The first chapters set up a framework for separations technologies. The rest of the book adds the important details. The first three chapters provide an excellent review of thermodynamics and mass transfer. In fact, I finally understood fugacity and how to estimate activity from equations of state after reading this book. The authors also incorporate principles of energy conservation not found in similar books. The topics include emmerging technologies in reactive distillation, membranes, and adsporption. Many HW problems are set-up for solution on process simulators. There are several chapters on advanced separations that will make this a valuable resource for lif-long learning.

The good thing is Dr. Seader was the professor for my second design course. As a teacher I think he is great with an ability to effectively communicate theory and its practical application without getting caught up in the details. Unfortunately I felt this textbook tries to consolidate the knowledge he has gained in his career resulting in a very dense book. Some problems are solved using direct calculations but a large amount are done using Aspen (a program no one in my class had used) which I felt didn't adequately help develop sequential problem solving skills. The costing analysis theory is good but most of us used Peters & Timerhaus for homework.

I found that my prof was assigning homework from another text, which he felt was a better book (the department chose the book, not him). When I tried to look information up in the book, I would spend hours hunting because it was spread out so much. Even the index didn't help much; one topic would be listed in several different locations. Not only would you quickly discover that this topic wasn't helping you, half the time you couldn't figure out where they put what you were hunting for.I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book. I didn't read most of it. This is really unusual for me, as I almost always learn more and better from the text than the lectures. I learn by reading the material, not hearing it. The poor quality of this book made the class that much more difficult. The only time anyone in class resorted to using the text rather than our class notes was during tests. It was definately the worst ChemE book I was required to buy."},{"Title":"Separation Process Principles","review":"I was really excited to sell my book back once the course was over for this one.

If you want details on refrigeration cycles, this is the place to look after you've had a go at Coulson or Hicks (Standard Handbook of Engineering Calculations).Although some of the information may be available on-line. You would need to spend days and weeks collecting it. Then, there are the worked out examples of calculations, just like Hicks (missing from Coulson), that are invaluable.

Then again, even that wouldn't be enough. These are wondeful explorations of the human psyche and spirit. No two are similar yet they are all a piece of the whole. The whole: exactly what we humans are, what we do and why. I recently bought Back In The World and I can not wait to finish it and read it again and again, just as I have with The Night In Question. M.J. Iuppa, thank you so much for assigning this to us to read for class, it was beautiful and imaginative and I just can't get enough. Read it, read it, read it!!! Especially Powder.

It's jarring to emerge from one story, and then be expect to plunge right into the next. Learn new characters, understand the new basis of another story.So I'm usually biased against story collections from the beginning.That said, I really, really liked \\"The Night in Question\\" by Tobias Wolff. All of the stories in this collection are crisply written, highly entertaining, and oddly satisfying despite all the missed connections, shattered illusions, and the other myriad vagrancies of life presented therein. Some are bound to be classics. I think \\"Firelight,\\" \\"Flyboy,\\" and \\"Mortals\\" are three such stories.There are flaws in this collection. \\"Bullet in the Brain,\\" for example, relies on an absurd and unbelievable set of character actions to advance the plot. Basically, a theater critic ridicules an armed bank robber for showing such bad taste and robbing in such a clich&eacute; fashion that the bank robber shoots the critic, starting off the real part of the story, the synaptic explosions that jar loose a final, poignant memory.But these flaws are minor. It's a durn good book, and if you like good readin', you'll read this."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"A 1996 collection of short stories from the writer that Ernest Hemingway always wanted to become, but never quite got there. Wolff creates a fully realized character in half a page; a universe takes a full page. In about a page-and-a-half, he gets you to fall in, out, around, and through love, and leaves you with a head full of questions and a heart full of ache so efficiently that you'll think non-prescription drugs were involved. Joy. Betrayal. Lust. Envy. Rage. Childhood innocence. Adult disillusionment. Everything that makes us what we are so carefully observed, chronicled, and most important, so true. In the top tier of post-Viet Nam American writers. Author! Author!I can't list a 'favorite' story. I don't know, literature doesn't work that way for me, but \\"Bullet in the Brain\\" certainly deserves mention as the most powerful closing to a collection of stories I've read. A metaphor for Wolff's writing as a whole: so clean, so deep, it goes through you and brings sweet, agonizing release.For Proust, all it took was a cookie. I must be American; I prefer a bullet. And 5 pages to 700.For some of us, escaping life is critical to the reading choices we make; for others, just living life colors our preferences. Tobias Wolff is one good reason I'm more or less in the second group. Every word is true, and every word is beautiful. I'd fill this page with stars. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;"},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Wolff is an amazing writer. He says more in these short stories than other writers say in entire books. I heard Bullet in the Brain on This American Life and I had to buy the book. I am so glad that I did. Kids will be studying these someday in school."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Using the leanest of prose to create searing imagery and unshakable truths, Wolff has outdone even himself. The best thing about these stories is the clarity. You understand the characters and their resolutions the first time through. There is no literary treasure hunting here. Wolff is one of the great short story writers of this century."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"This is a carefully crafted set of stories by a master. The prose is sinewy and firmly grounded in the real experiences of real people. Wolff has the short story teller's gift of transforming ordinary, mundane events into revealing glimpses into the human condition. Many of these stories deal with a generation of wanderers who came of age in the seventies and eighties in America. Regular people whose unremarkable lives suddenly jump out of an uninteresting pattern. These stories show the reader, if not the characters, how the smallest events and details can suddenly shape our experience of life and our understanding of ourselves"},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Tobias Wolff has written yet another fantastic collection of short stories with The Night in Question. Wolff has yet to disappointment me with any of his writings thus far, and since I believe I've read all of his works but for one or two, it does not seem as though that may be a possibility. The Night in Question is a collection dealing with all too human aspects in a series of stories that are unlikely, but certainly not beyond the realm of possibility. The peculiarity is not the focus in Wolff's stories; rather, it's the human reaction to the peculiarities that make his writing rich and enlightening.Once again, I recommend virtually any of Wolff's work with supreme confidence, and The Night in Question is no exception. My particular favorites in this work were \\"Flyboys,\\" \\"The Life of the Body,\\" and one that was very unusual for Wolff, \\"Bullet in the Brain.\\"~Scott William Foley, author of The Imagination's Provocation: Volume I: A Collection of Short Stories"},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"The three stories that I especially liked in this collection, \\"Smorgasbord\\", \\"Lady's Dream\\", and \\"Firelight\\", three of the last four stories in the book, all deal with situations fairly far from the dramatic and unusual.In \\"Smorgasbord\\" a prep school student goes out to dinner with his roommate and a wealthy Latin American student at the behest of the latter's young, beautiful, and sophisticated stepmother \\"Leen-da\\" (Linda). In response to Linda's implicit request for something out of the usual, the decision is made for the group to introduce her to a different kind of eating experience--that of the Smorgasbord. As the roommates chow down (the resentful stepson sulking alone in the car) Linda dedicates herself to the aloof observation of the restaurant patrons (many of them obese and greedy as they protectively hover over their heaping plates) while smoking a cigarette. She also chooses to question the narrator on some aspects of his life--his girlfriend, and so forth. In doing so Linda acts as a sort of muse, inspiring a reverie that travels forward and backward in time--touching on the boy's relationship with his girlfriend and his various aspirations.\\"Lady's Dream\\" deals with a young, well-educated, and high-principled New Englander stationed in the deep South after choosing to volunteer for the Korean War, and Lady, the southern girl he meets there and marries. The dream consists of Lady's thoughts as she drowses on a long hot car trip with her husband--a dream that includes recollections of how they came to know one another. Lady views this past with a regret that is familiar to many of us--of roads not taken--or of better decisions that might have been made. Over the course of these dreams Lady wishes that she could go back in time to warn her younger self of the somewhat oppressive marriage to her stickler of a husband--whose marriage to her seemed to stem mostly out of the desire to challenge his own father by choosing a mate outside of their elevated social cast.\\"Firelight\\" seems autobiographical in its detail and emotional slant, as a boy and his widowed mother ramble about a Midwestern university town pretending to shop for carpeting and house rentals as a form of entertainment. In the end they find their way to the home of a university professor whose family is about to move because he has been denied tenure. While his mother puts on the pretense of looking over the place, the boy relaxes beside the roaring fireplace and dreams of the life that he someday hopes to live--one that would include such a fireplace.As I read my synopses of these stories I notice that all three deal with notions of social class and one's aspiration for the future. In reading these I find myself identifying with these characters as I remember my own aspirations--especially as a young person--and of events that in retrospect seem as important omens. Indeed, it was a wonderful academically-oriented family in my own hometown that I admired and often spent time with as a college student--the father and older brother (both scientists) serving as my mentors. I am also reminded of that fact that quite a few of the girls that I dated were the daughters of college professors--and that it was the daughter of such a professor that I married to complete the dream that I now live."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"This is, hands down, the best collection of short stories I have ever read. Do yourself a huge favor and get this book."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"If I could start this review with words like &quot;great&quot;, &quot;Wolff's knack for nailing our common humanity in the heart&quot;, or &quot;previous reader&quot; (which I am), I would. But out of genuine concern for YOU (the reader)--for repetitive reading disorder is as serious as carpel tunnel syndrome--I would like to point to the synopsis on the back of this book that best sums up Mr. Wolff's gift, and it's consensus and brilliant expression in all the stories of this collection: (NOT VERBATIM:) In this book, the facts--the when's, where's, how's...etc--are as dangerous as lies. They are like Hemingway's icebergs: from afar, you can rely on them as hard, cold, inert points for your judgement. Get closer, as Wolff remarkably guides us so well, and you feel the collision, never realizing the but's and if's of each fact. You are immersed into the cold night sea, your heart pounds, you cannot stand on ground. What's great is that you know not to reach for the cold chunks of ice, but just to swim and stay alive. You learn to savor the steam that accompanies each breath, the feeling of your limbs, the oscillating waves that lift you. Case in point: The Chain. A series of events--a dog's mobbing of a little girl, the dog's assasination, a minor dent-job, a fatal crowbar blow to a young boy's head--these are all chained by the Biblical philosophy of &quot;Eye for an Eye.&quot; Wolff shows us these events, each transition shade by shade, and in the end asks us, &quot;When will it ever end?&quot; PS &quot;Lady's Dream&quot; and &quot;Bullet in the Brain&quot; stood out to me for their originality in style. Both are, in effect, dreams. The way Wolff tells them is simply amazing.

The breadth of subjects and points of view, the hilarious and touching situations they describe, the purity of his language and clarity of his imagery--all of it is unrivalled in his previous writing. Moreover, many of the stories pack the emotional wallop of his THIS BOY'S LIFE, a book that this reader thought would never be equaled in that department"},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"I am admittedly a Wolff fan. This group of shorts is impossible to put down. Not many authors do a short story as much justice."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"An mildly entertaining collection of stories. Not exactly my genre and not riveting, but generally well crafted and diverse. Some interesting characters and ideas. Full disclosure: I rarely read modern fiction."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Simply, THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, is filled with quick witted, short stories, that subtly asks and answers the small questions of all our lives. The actions of the characters are filled with a regularity that we all can be empathetic towards, and yet also be surprised in the turn of events that face those characters with the questions of mortality, fear, and solitude. This is an easy read, and yet thought provoking. I would recommend to anyone who truly enjoys short stories."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"First let me just state that the whole of The Night In Question by Tobias Wolff is really great. Each story is written in such a way that you feel like someone really familiar is just talking to you -- face to face -- and you don't want to leave.Second, if you can't read the whole book of short stories for some reason (you would really need a good one), then you need to spend some time reading the last story in the collect, Bullet in the Brain. I read this story in another collection of short stories by contemporary authors, and it's always been in the back of my head as one of the best. I just finished reading The Night in Question, and Bullet in the Brain was the ending of Wolff's collection. Having the chance to read the story again without seeking it out was great.Essentially, Bullet in the Brain is about a man who just can't shut-up during a bank robbery. But then the ending pretty much slaps you in the face because Wolff took one incident that would basically end any story and just moves it right along. I would have to tell the ending of the short story in order to explain this -- and I really don't want to -- but believe me, it's the most creative and interesting ending to a short story like itself.I was lucky enough to see a reading performed by Wolff at my university, and I will never forget the author's ease with the audience, and his smooth readings. Like he knew us all, and we knew him, and the story he wrote was meant just for us."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Before I picked up this book I was only vaguely aware of Tobias Wolff, never having, as far as I can recall, read anything of his. I did remember that he had written a memoir of his peripatetic childhood that was praised probably fifteen years ago. I was unprepared for the power and grace of this collection of short stories published in 1996. A little research on the Internet tells me that Wolff is primarily a short story writer -- he has certainly found his niche in that, although I gather he has recently written a novel -- and is a professor at Stanford. But, most of all, he is a born story-teller. This is not to say that one is not also aware of the lapidary quality of his writing. My point is that even absent his writing skill he would still be someone you'd want to engage in conversation, or rather someone you'd like to sit and listen to as he spins yarns about the mundane. The mundane is his subject, but like all good writers, he puts it in such a perspective as to make it new and insightful.Others before me, here at Amazon, have written about certain of the short stories here. The stories' subject matter is, generally, that of youth and young adulthood, and most importantly, about observation. His protagonists seem to have a preternatural writer's eye, which is part of what I look for in fiction. That's one of the great things about a great writer -- that ability to see things in ways most of us don't.My favorite story? Probably 'Firelight,' about a boy and his hapless but courageous mother who go to look at apartments. Simple plot, but with deep implications about belonging, what home and family is, and about hope. The coda of this story, with the little boy all grown up and with a family of his own, tells us, as so often in Wolff's stories, how childhood experience colors our adult lives. Beautiful. I suppose now I'll have to go and read everything Wolff has written. Nice to contemplate.Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"For fans of Raymond Carver, who wonder how his prose might have evolved had he not died in 1988, &quot;The Night In Question&quot; provides a possible glimpse. Wolff and Carver's close friendship is well-documented. And although Wolff is his own man and my favorite living writer, I believe that there's a tangible link between Carver's final stories, such as &quot;Blackbird Pie&quot; and &quot;Errand,&quot; and Wolff's recent work. Wolff keeps Carver's legacy alive in a totally original, compelling way. I have read &quot;The Night In Question&quot; no less than four times. I have listened to the abridged audio version (abridged in the number of stories only) 7 times. There is a sheer mastery of the short story form here that astounds me. Bob Dylan once said of Gordon Lightfoot: &quot;Every time I hear a Gordon Lightfoot song, I wish it would never end.&quot; I can imagine Carver saying the same thing about Wolff, for similar reasons. This book makes a great gift and is required reading for anyone serious about the art and craft of short fiction. I wished every story would never end."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"I've only read Tobias Wolff's short stories--both this book and the ones from &quot;In the Garden of the North American Martyrs&quot;--but this collection has continually left me speechless. Story after story focuses on the everyday happenings of mostly &quot;ordinary&quot; people with an attention to detail that reminds me of eastern poets. Yet Wolff blends his take on things with a distinctly &quot;American&quot; flavor--that is, he's an American writer at his best. Stories like &quot;The Chain&quot; and &quot;Bullet in the Brain&quot; are emphatic in their declarations of the human condition. After reading many of them, I couldn't wait to share some particular passage or insight with a loved one--or a stranger, for that matter. In this collection, moreso than &quot;In the Garden of the North American Martyrs&quot;, I got the distinct impression of a vibrant, funny, quietly wise writer who--as Holden Caulfield from &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; might have said--I really wish were a personal friend."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"&quot;The Night in Question&quot; is one of the best short story collections I've ever read. Tobias Wolff understands fully what F. Scott Fitzgerald meant when he said, &quot;Action is character.&quot; Wolff takes the reader's breath away not through twists of plot, but through his extensive knowledge of the human mind and heart, and how different minds and hearts work at cross-purposes. He knows the dirty little secret behind every human existence: because we are not each other, we betray each other. He knows why, in the title story, a woman is deeply offended by a sermon while her recovering alcoholic brother finds it completely inspiring; he knows why, in &quot;Firelight,&quot; a woman can't wait to flee an apartment she came to see about renting, while her young son wants to stay there forever. Wolff is a master at following the labyrinthine mental paths people take to justify their actions to themselves, to the point where much madness makes divinest sense. I found myself crying, &quot;Fool! Fool!&quot; at Wiley, the self-deluding, lovelorn protagonist of &quot;The Life of the Body,&quot; and my jaw dropped at the superbly ironic final sentence of &quot;The Chain,&quot; a brilliantly original variant of Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Strangers on a Train.&quot; Above all, Wolff understands the profound isolation of being a human soul trapped in an individual body; at one time or another, everyone has felt like Joyce, the main character of &quot;Migraine,&quot; that, &quot;In fact, everyone was alone all the time, but when you got sick you knew it, and that was a lot of what suffering was--knowing.&quot; These stories deserve to be anthologized forever and taught in every serious school of writing in this country."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"If this book were written by many contemporary American writers, it would be by far their best. However, when you're Tobias Wolff, you've got to be cognizant of the fact that you've done better. While this collection demonstrates the range of Wolff's talent, his ability to shed light on so many different individuals, and his mastery of the short story form, his true gift of articulation is more evident in earlier works, specifically, In the Garden of North American Martyrs. If Nabokov's writing is like someone dumping gooey chocolate syrup and crushed Oreos on a dollop of vanilla ice cream, Wolff's prose is as clear as a glass of water. Hemingway might have aimed at such clarity, but Wolff got it in Martyrs. The Night in Question warrants rereading no doubt. Some of his sentences are just gems and do things that any writer knows it's tough to make language do. Wolff also manages to create whole characters in 3 inches of print (and none of his books have more than 400 words to page) and makes their dialogue resonate with disturbing familiarity. The Night in Question, like all of Wolff's work - The Wolff Pack - will bite you, but if want to be consumed, check out some of the earlier stuff."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Tobias Wolff's 14 stories in this collection is quiet, spare, measured - and absolutely stellar. Wolff can take a mundane, everyday experience and thru his meticulous craftsmanship dig into the depths to mine it for every nuance of emotional significance. Nothing is present in any of his stories that doesn't serve a purpose: not a dog, a twig, a sweater, or a smile. Everything moves the stories forward and shows us more about each character and his/her relationship to others. \\"Firelight,\\" a story I've now read several times, is my favorite: a boy and his single mom, stranded in a university town, spend their weekends looking at houses and apartments for rent, knowing they can't afford any of them. At the end of the long day, they're invited inside the last house, one where a university professor lives with his wife and daughter. The story, told from the boy's POV, is bittersweet and focuses on a sense of being an outsider to the comforts of home, the warmth of the fireside - but he realizes that all is not as it appears within this family that he still envies.Absolutely wonderful collection."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"Reading the stories from &quot;The Night in Question&quot;, I noticed close similiraties of his works to the ones of Anton Chekhov. Especially the first one, &quot;Mortals&quot;. To tell the truth, I always thought that today's American Literature has only a-la Stephen King and Sydney Sheldon authors. It turned out otherwise. Tobias Wolff's book is so nice to read, that I even caught myself wishing to try and translate it into Russian. I'm sure Tobias Wolff is an international author."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"After Raymond Carver and Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff is usually tagged as the minor partner in the pioneers of \\"dirty realism\\", a fairly meaningless term which was used to denote a new orthodoxy of somber and minimalist fiction about blue-collar American life. Having read all three, I think Wolff is actually the better writer. His stories are richer and more complex than Carver's in terms of their characters and themes, and they're more accessible than Ford's. Those collected here are fine examples. The plots are often simple; the incidents and settings are everyday, you might even say mundane. Yet in even the smallest moments from the most ordinary lives, Wolff skillfully illuminates the larger forces that animate them: love, desire, revenge, regret, vanity, hope and gratitude. Time and again, in the space of a paragraph or even a single phrase, the story turns, escalates, opens up, reveals itself as concerned with something far more substantial than you might have sensed. You can fall through a moment of banality and find yourself in a story with the density of a planet. The economy with which Wolff manages this is sometimes breathtaking, as in \\"Lady's Dream\\" and \\"Bullet in the Brain\\" which lay bare entire lives in the space of a few pages. Every story here is excellent, but three stood out for me: \\"The Life of the Body\\", in which a civilized school teacher is unable to resist the siren songs of sex and violence; \\"The Other Miller\\", which explores the relationship between a young soldier and his estranged mother; and \\"The Chain\\", a three-act suburban tragedy with the corny arc of a Hollywood screenplay, but which still manages to be moving because at its heart there's truth. That seems to be the key to Wolff's work. It's the one thing you just keep noticing: there isn't a single climactic moment that doesn't ring true."},{"Title":"The Night in Question","review":"I liked this collection but, don't kill me, I thought In The Garden of the North American Martyrs was better. Maybe it's my imagination or something about the timing of my reading each, but with The Night in Question I thought that at times Wolff was packing too much into his sentences, too much insight. It was all trenchant observation and inspiration, but those pockets of narrative threw the rest of the story off kilter for me and detracted from what I liked so much about In the Garden: that the stories are so simple and -- within that -- so elegantly complex. This could be my imagination; I'm not sure.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. But I second everybody who said Wolff takes ordinary occurrences and portrays them beautifully and, as the pieces come together, with so much significance. Thanks also to the person who mentioned Carver. I agree, it would have been nice to see his writing mature.If you haven't read any of Wolff's books or are thinking of getting this book, definitely do. Buy In the Garden too."},{"Title":"Mnd og brn pa -lejr: For mnd, af mnd, om mnd der er trtte af deres rolle (Danish Edition)","review":"An outstanding book, &quot;Mnd&quot; offers some pretty major insights into practically all areas of life.

Ajijola's book that is being reviewed here is actually a bit more reasonable than his other works, where he stops reasoning and begins complaining and goes into a pathetic trance of helplessness because his Islamic God failed miserably in preserving the revelation this God gave to Jesus and the history of Jesus. Here, in this book he is more lenient though he could have been more objective and a lot more careful. He is way too sloppy at times in his reasoning since he is quick to dismiss the accounts of Jesus from the Gospels.I have no clue as to why this book was called the Myth of the Cross since it is not about the cross at all, but about the whole New Testament as a writing. There isn't too much discussion on the Resurrection of Jesus either. Its more of an outdated critique on the New Testament, Paul, Creeds, and how Islam is the solution for all problems.This book is very much outdated and scholarship on the Texts of New testament and research on Jesus and the Gospels and Paul has come quite a bit. A lot of his arguments are strawman arguments and his tone is not friendly at times. It sounds like he's jealous of Christians.He also has a problem with unclean spirits. He thinks the story of Jesus in Mark 5: 1-14 where Jesus allows a few unclean spirits to go into a herd of pigs, is superstitious. But he seems to have not noticed that in Surah 27: 15-19 Solomon can speak the language of birds and he has an army of men, birds, and jinn. Also he talks to ants. If anything the Quran is quite superstitious. In the Hajj there is one stop where people go and throw stones at a pillar which represents Shaytan. Why are people throwing rocks at pillars? People have actually been killed while doing the Hajj.Its is from my personal experiences that Muslims aren't too bright when it comes to Islam. For everything else Muslims are very smart, but when it comes to the Quran, they seem to become dumb and are known to be really sloppy philosophers. Deedat is a great example of a sloppy thinker.I've laid out a few times a challenge to Muslims who downplay the Gospels as the Word of God. If the Injeel was not preserved and the New Testament History is false then what is the true history of Jesus? Simply saying : Jesus was a prophet of God who preached one God and offered brotherhood, is not a good history at all because where is the evidence of this and what is your source and is it reliable and if so give reasons why your source is reliable? You can't use any Christian Historical texts or the Bible to support it since Muslims believe it is altered. So we are left with the Quran, which came about 600 years after Jesus! Its unreliable and unless for the historian. It does not use earlier sources and even if it did it has no bibliography. From the Quran: can anybody find out who Jesus was, where was he born, what did he do, how did he live,how did he leave the earth, who were the disciples (names), where did they go, why was Jesus born of a virgin unlike all other prophets, who did he preach to, how was the cultural climate at the time of Jesus, who was at the cross, and also what detailed evidence is there, in the Quran, that Jesus was not crucified at all. Surah 4: 156-158 says that Jesus was not crucified and that is was made to appear to them that He was not crucified. Why is this? The quran is silent on why the Islamic God tricked humanity. Come on! Mary, Jesus' mom was there, a few disciples were there, and innocent humans who were wishing that Jesus would not be crucified were there and even still the Islamic God deceived humanity and give no explanation for deceiving innocent god-fearing humans. The Islamic God did an illusion and never told us he did a magic trick until Christianity had spread for 600 years!That mans 600 years worth of Christians are going to an Islamic hell because they saw Jesus on the cross when it was all a hologram or mirage. And in the Quran the Islamic God does not even apologize for raping 600 years worth of human generations.The Quran is almost useless for the historian since there is a huge display of ignorance in it. From the Quran we know very little about the historical Jesus, Moses, Abraham, David, Solomon, Joseph, Ishmael, Isaac. Where were they born? Where did they live? Where are the genealogies? What did God say to them? What happened to them? How do they link up together? The Quran gives some conversations that are sometimes clear and other times vague. In the end the Quran fails to provide valuable historical verifiable information.A.D. Ajijola in the end, when he actually begins to talk about the helpfulness of Islam, gets into the typical Islamic emotional drive where reason seems to be misplaced and twisted. He claims that Islam has the best economical system possible. He dislikes all secular economic systems like communism and capitalism. But the question I have is: if the Islamic economic system is superior to both of these then why is it that most Islamic countries are third world countries? And also why is there such high poverty where lots of Muslims reside like the author's country of Nigeria. Looks like the Islamic economic system is keeping innocent Muslims poor and malnutritioned. Leaving them starving for crumbs of bread.In the end this book is a great representative of the failure of Islam and the Islamic God. The Quran teaches that:Surah 3:3-4 ( Ali Translation)\\"It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of God will suffer the severest penalty, and God is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution.\\"If the Islamic God revealed these revelations, why wasn't it able to preserve them? Isn't the Islamic God all powerful? Did we beat him and over power him too? Looks like it. Or it Could be that the Islamic God does not exist and so we have to look to other revelations to see which is the true God or Gods.By the way, as far as archeology and paleography goes the Bible has been preserved very well (General Introduction to the Bible) At least the Bible is used by non-Christian and non-Jewish archaeologists as a source for history of Palestine because it is very informative and incredibly reliable as a source of historyJesus and Archaeology,On the Reliability of the Old Testament,Biblical Archaeology Review (1-year auto-renewal)."},{"Title":"The myth of the Cross","review":"At last, someone has the guts to tell the truth about this bastard Christian religion. In this book, the author rips apart the myths of the original sin, Sonship of Jesus, Jesus being God, and Atonement. When one truly looks at the Gospels under a microscope like this author has done, you will find that Jesus was nothing more than a prophet of God sent to the Jews and the doctrine of Christianity itself is nothing more than a far-fetched ideology that was put in his name by someone else. To the Christian who really want to know the truth about Jesus and Christianity, this is a book of enlightenment."},{"Title":"The myth of the Cross","review":"Utilizing internal investigation of the Bible to arrive at a cogent and tenable analysis, A.D. Ajijola obliterates many of the falsified myths surrounding christianity as it is practiced today. The contemporary &quot;version&quot; of christianity is that which is diametrically opposed to the doctrine preached by Jesus (pbuh). Improbabilities, inconsistencies, and swirling contradictions buttress much of the doctrinal practices today, which through pristine analysis, the author has found were contrived in the 2-4 centuries after Christ. The author supports his findings by relying upon the excellent testimonies of the Bible, pre-eminent and world renowned christian scholars, and tertiary source material to conclude that the truth which is supposedly purported to be found within the realms of christianity, stand upon feet of clay when subjected to the most concentrated scrutiny- especially the unbiased scrutiny of its own practioners. Every christian, and those who know christians, should expand their spiritual horizons by taking a little time to examine the truth of the origin of their faith."},{"Title":"The myth of the Cross","review":"Muslim apologetics, like apologetics of many other weswtern religions, has for some time suffered from the bane of the &quot;knee jerk&quot;. In this book, which seems to have been written in reaction to a speech given by a priest in Nigeria, the author attempts to lay out a &quot;magnum opus contre gentiles&quot;. What he actually accomplishes is something quite less than that. He begins the work in the most promising of ways: laying out the fundamental &quot;creeds&quot; that differ between Islam and Christianity - the theories of atonement, crucifixion of Jesus, and deity of Christ.Throughout, the arguments are as shallow as they are poor. The author seems not to have ever considered how it might be that Christian scholars, who are well-aware of the verses he cites, have traditionally understood them. For example, he takes the passage from Deutoronomy indicating that those crucified are cursed as being evidence that Jesus could not have been crucified because, after all, Jesus was a good guy, and good guys are not cursed. Furthermore, sweeping and unfounded generalizations are littered throughout the text &quot;Christianity has no plan for how we are to live in this world&quot; (p.146), and so many others that it is pointless to mention them here. In the end, his final argument of the book, the one that he always tacitly returns to, is &quot;In this respect, Christianity differs from Islam, and therefore says what is false&quot;.What Islam needs, and what I am presently looking for, is serious apologetic scholarship. When I find it, I'll let you know. As for this book, read it as a psychological study on how one man attempts to justify his world view in the face of conflicting alternatives, but not as a serious theological work."},{"Title":"The myth of the Cross","review":"A concise book which explains the false beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ and pagan parallels. The author refutes the myths of the Trinity and explains the apotheosis of Jesus, a prophet of God. A simple and solid refutation of Christianity and it's blasphemous assertions. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Bhutan","review":"This folio-format study commemorates a Viennese exhibition at the Museum f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerkunde in 1997-98. While scholarly, and hefty in size and substance, it contributes more weightily to the knowledge we have of this Himalayan kingdom. I found it valuable as a corrective to the often more romanticized photo collections, easier to consult than more specialized if dry monographs, or more balanced than necessarily more hurried summations in travel narratives by and for Westerners. As co-editor Christian Schicklgruber introduces the collection, it mirrors how a visitor would approach Bhutan. Visual impressions, \\"the lay of the land,\\" flora and fauna, architecture, and regional peoples and their distinctive dress unfold.Schicklgruber reminds us of the challenges a \\"mountain fortress\\" faces, given the fate of Buddhist enclaves in Ladakh, Mustang, Tibet, and Sikkim. He considers the demands of the Nepali and often Hindi populations on the southern borders, and the competing cultural and ethnic identities of the Buddhist majorities in the heartlands. He notes how modernization for the nation may not equate with conventional Western judgments, and attributes the royal stewardship for the decisions demanded as this small region deals with the pressures from India to the south and occupying China to the north.Botanist Gerard Navara begins with a chapter on its landscape, while co-editor and Tibetologist (see my May 2012 review of her Bhutan: Himalayan Mountain Kingdom (Odyssey Guides) Francoise Pommaret's linguistic and ethnographic survey documents the various peoples with cultural and ethnic allegiances. It (as other contributions) can be slow reading, but it sums up value--much remains to be learned about the array of languages and dialects in such a small country. Marc Dujardin, in an ambitious analysis of Rukubji in the central region, explains how it's \\"living architecture.\\" As opposed to a Western understanding of monuments and concrete fixing a place's meaning, Dujardin assesses Bhutanese construction in its evolving context, sites placed by religious considerations where spirits may lurk, deities may abscond, and modern methods may undermine or support ancient ideas of how, say a farmhouse is to be rebuilt for every generation in the same family's spot.Then, everyday life and religious worship comprise part two. I admired ethnologist Martin Brauen's \\"Dreamworld Tibet\\" (see my Feb. 2012 review) and his report from another, if unspecified, central community shows his knack for conveying the reality of life in the mountains and not myth. He relates how taxes and tasks must be achieved, and what happens when women own land and farms.This aligns well with Dujardin's chapter, and we see how women negotiate power and control, even as a significant percentage of the village consists of the landless families. Brauen here as in his other book cautions any Shangri-La expectations. Buddhism, more skeptical towards female energy, keeps its hold over the village and the mindsets of men and women, even as education beckons. For, the farm, if run by women, may expect girls not to stay in school, and for all there in such a village, the afterlife is still seen as more likely to reward a male than a female, regardless of her merit in this life.\\"Zorig chusum\\" or the \\"thirteen crafts\\" have been passed down from parents to children for centuries. Barry Ison finds these exemplifying the material mixed with the spiritual out of the hardships and the diversity of Bhutan's situation. As its people cannot compete making cheap products for the globalized market, they can promote their heritage and expertise with wood, stone, painting, clay, bronze, metalwork, cane and bamboo, paper, tailoring, weaving. As in other sections, artifacts intersperse in photographs as evidence.For the third section, Buddhism and the state being mutually supportive, Mynak Tulku as a \\"high cleric\\" interprets ritual. Although an aside, I found his paragraph on p. 140 intriguing: Buddhism may have entered Bhutan far earlier than the 7th c. AD, perhaps as early as 2000-1000 BC.Schicklgruber matches gods to sacred mountains, and applies its shamanistic origins to a religious interpretation of the striking, fabled landscape on multiple levels. \\"To put it rather crudely one can say that the Bhutanese do not fulfil Western demands for precise levels of classification.\\" (161) These gods, from folk tradition, harass or please humans, and Buddhism superseding their mythic rule, it tried to supplant or overpower them. Even the raven crown of the king may stem from this.History, as nationhood (late for this realm) follows. Legends around the noble origins begin Pommaret's long treatment of sketchy or venerable sources transmitted from antiquity. Animism and even megaliths gave way to temples and Tibetans entered the \\"southern valleys of medicinal herbs\\" which gained fame with Guru Rinpoche's arrival in the eighth century CE. Drukpas and secondarily Nyingmapas gained pre-eminence in particular regions of the then-fragmented land. Pema Lingpa galvanized central and eastern regions as the \\"treasure revealer\\" (1450-1521). The first Shabdrung (visited by Portuguese Jesuits in 1627) repelled Tibetans to establish a western region under Drukpas. This ruler constructed dzongs in each valley to fortify then one unified theocratic-monastic kingdom.She continues with the coming of the British (1772-1926) to use their records to compare with Bhutanese accounts. As India pushed north, Bhutan gave in, and as a trade route to Tibet, the Swiss-sized kingdom in the middle sought to stay independent internally. By the early 20th c, \\"Relations were excellent but distant\\" between the Raj and Bhutan's first king, Ugyen Wangchuck. There's a tremendous amount of information in these two chapters, full of rivalries and assassinations, but the data add up to much more than a non-specialist may want to sift through.The final section features Karma Ura's perspective as a civil servant (and writer) on \\"tradition and development.\\" He reminds us that most Bhutanese still live more than a day's walk from the \\"motor road,\\" and the layout of settlement means mule tracks may endure for some as the ancient path. But, exposed as many in the capital and other towns on the road become to media and foreign goods, the elite crave more, and expectations rise faster than incomes, within a Buddhist-ruled system which cautions against excess. Globalization and development must be balanced against a precious and now rare combination of traditional values and ecological legacy. Village altruism weakens when impersonal cities beckon the young and ambitious. The lama may deserve a voice alongside the investment banker. Meanwhile, Ura's fellow intellectual, Kunzang Ch&ouml;den, who wrote the first novel in English (\\"The Circle of Karma,\\" reviewed by me Dec. 2012) by a Bhutanese woman, offers five interviews from females in the capital that grows 7-10% annually. (Thimphu has now around triple the population it did when this chapter itself was drafted in the late 1990s, to prove the point.)A glossary and list of objects illustrated end the volume. Not an exhibition catalogue in the usual sense, \\"Bhutan: Mountain Fortress of the Gods\\" instead presents an in-depth examination of the nation. While very factual in tone and heavily academic, the contributors serve as a cross-section of native and European scholars best able to explain this kingdom seriously to an audience for which fantasy and effusion seem to suffice given its dominant portrayal in the media as a happy hideaway.(P.S. This book reincarnated as an award-winning 2001 Austrian website, but that's long defunct.)"},{"Title":"Bhutan","review":"I am not much of a reader but this book simply took my breath away, the author did an excellent work that a thousand writers working for a thousand years could not have possibly realized."},{"Title":"Russian cooking,","review":"This book was not complete.

These three titans brought a laboratory curiosity, a few patents, and not enough capital, to effect the dramatic improvements in the utilization of fossil energy to replace the efforts of slaves, near slaves, and animals, and to make life better for us all.We have Edison, who started it all with his improved dynamo and the electric lighting system; Tesla and his crucial AC electric motor; Westinghouse who had the business insight and technical acumen to pursue the alternating current. Geniuses, yes. But of a very different sort.Jonnes does an outstanding job of portraying the times, and the interaction of the approaches to solving problems that each of these heroes had. So different, so complementary and so effective. There was nothing else like it anywhere on earth.I suppose anyone reading this review has read a bit about Edison and the light, Tesla and his eccentricities, and Westinghouse and his devotion to his workers. The tale of the Niagra generators and the first long distance transport of electrical power will probably be new to you, and it is a story well-told.But Jonnes has an awful lot to add to the usual stuff. She communicates the downright excitement of it all, the delicious discoveries of the new, and the suspense of the disasters to be overcome. This is no Ph.

If I, or anyone for that matter, desires more discreptive ac/dc circuits we should seek the assistance of a textbook. Ms. Jonnes did, in my humble opinion, an extremely nice job of presenting the primary components of the creation of electricity, both human and mechanical, and provided a nice evolution of electricity (i.e., from novelty entertainment to powering a World's Fair).

Its grandiloquent title suggests we are in for a treat, to live the compelling tale of the race for electric light. Indeed, the book jacket displays the wondrous shimmer of the newly illuminated Woolworth Building. But, sadly, the story is pedestrian, overly technical and lacking in the human dimensions that cry out for attention. That is, the unholy trinity of Edison,Westinghouse, and Tesla. Perhaps engineers and scientific historians will find it absorbing. Others may be left with a feeling of what might have been a rip-roaring saga of three giants over possibly the greatest invention of its time and, perhaps, one of the greatest in world history.Ms. Jonnes makes little of this chase to rule over the very lifeblood of the nation. The larger than life characters clearly demand more development: Edison, the proponent of the \\"horrible experiment\\", the electric chair to discredit his opponents; Westinghouse, a brilliant practical technician and friend of labor; and the urbane Tesla, the virtual electrical mystic, whose theories (and some engineering feats) live on today. The same sketching technique is made of other people and events that pass through this book. How compelling their cameos could have been- Sarah Bernhardt (of Edison's electrical display: \\"C'est grand, c'est magnifique!\\"); Edison financier J.P. Morgan (\\"legendary ferocious eyes...monstrous nose\\"); the genius Faraday; Astor IV (a Tesla backer); Tesla's mysterious 18-story tower in New Jersey; the Chicago Columbian Exposition won by Westinghouse's lighting; and the assassination of Chicago Mayor Harrison. The writing leaves us with little suspense and a weak understanding of the excesses of the Gilded Age, as reflected in the overweening egos and ambitions of these three competitors and their financiers. A saving grace are the photos - the diamond-like Woolworth Building; Tesla demonstrating his eerie wireless bulbs; a smitten Westinghouse admiring his beautiful wife; the white pigeon that was Tesla's \\"great love in his final years\\"; Edison catching winks on his workbench. Unfortunately, there are altogether too few of these, too many electrical renderings, and just too much technical detail."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Why is it that histories of technology are all inadequate and inaccurate? It is easy to find, from many sources, the exact order of battle at Gettysburg, but not why appliances in North America require 120 volts (AC) as opposed to double that in the rest of the world. \\"Empires of Light\\" by Jill Jonnes is an ambitious book, and it covers more than simply the bizarre War of the Currents between Edison and Westinghouse. It's a general history of electrical technology until about 1907, and it is highly detailed and descriptive. The book has much to recommend it, especially a profile of George Westinghouse, who, among industrialists in the age of the Robber Barons, was a remarkably admirable man. (If only there were more like him today!)Unfortunately, this book is flawed in three ways, and although I'll keep it on my shelf, I can't bring myself to review it with any enthusiasm.(1.) We in the USA like to think that everything of any value was invented here, by patriotic (white) Americans. (Ask your friends and neighbors where the automobile was invented, and they'll no doubt say America.) So it is that, from page one, Ms. Jonnes gives absolute and unqualified credit to Thomas Edison for being the sole inventor of the incandescent light bulb. The more one researches the matter elsewhere, it becomes apparent that Edison invented nothing, and there were many light bulbs made by many different men for at least fifty years before Edison first tried his hand at it. Many of these bulbs had carbon filaments, and many of the carbon filaments were made from bamboo fiber. Most were vacuum bulbs. According to Gavin Weightman's book,The Industrial Revolutionaries: The Making of the Modern World 1776-1914, \\"The use of [Joseph] Swan's lamps in Godalming in 1881 was the first practical use of the modern light bulb.\\" But the name of Englishman Joseph Swann is absent from \\"Empires of Light\\" as an inventor, and the name Swann is mentioned only in passing when the Edison Company had to merge with the Swann Company in the UK so as to avoid infringing on Swann's patents for the light bulb.Why has Edison been given so much credit for inventing the incandescent bulb? According to Weightman, at an electrical exposition in Paris, Edison's lackeys bribed the judges comparing the merits of various bulbs to choose Edison's bulb. (Highly plausible, considering Edison's knavery against alternating current.) Also, Edison was a tireless self-promoter, eager to impress gullible people (such as Ms. Jonnes). In his endnotes, Weightman adduces some impressive sources, but Ms. Jonnes seems to have gleaned all her information from a recent laudatory biography of Edison. Ms. Jonnes makes no mention of the development of the modern tungsten filament by William Coolidge of GE in 1910. In the matter of the origins of the light bulb, you can find, at many web sites (including Wikipedia), far more information and far more accurate information than in this poor book.(2.) I am certainly not among those who hold that those of the distaff side are incapable of understanding technology, but this is the second book by a woman that I've read recently (the other beingBrilliant: The Evolution of Artificial Light) which garbles the fundamentals of electricity. On page 19, Ms. Jonnes speaks of both \\"positive and negative\\" electrons. On page 62 we learn of lampblack being \\"carbonized.\\" (Will graphite one day likewise be \\"carbonized\\"?) On page 70, there is a diagram of an \\"Ordinary Parallel Circuit\\" in which the voltage drops as the wiring gets further away from the source. This is not particle physics; this is tenth-grade science, and someone should've told her that the voltage remains the same at all points in a parallel circuit. (You can demonstrate this with a voltmeter and your car. Check the voltage at the battery, the starter post, the dome light, the license-plate light, or anywhere else, and you will see that it's always 12 v. The last lamp doesn't get any less, as in her diagram.) On page 91, Ms. Jonnes describes the *brushes* of an electric motor as \\"segments of copper that rotated with the armature . . .\\". Instead of spending so much time in libraries reading the encomia of Edison's press agents, Ms. Jonnes would have profited by going to the corner garage and inspecting a real electric motor.I don't blame Ms. Jonnes for these errors as much as I blame the book's publisher, Random House. The errors in \\"Empires of Light\\" are nowhere near as bad as in other books, and it's impossible for anyone to get all the facts right, especially when they're unfamiliar with any technology, and that's why publishers *used* to have fact checkers and proofreaders. Unfortunately, many new books I've read in the past few years have glaring errors in them, errors which should've been caught during editing. Publishers apparently just don't care anymore.(3.) The worst thing about \\"Empires of Light\\" is the writing. Ms. Jonnes's style is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard in print. The trend in modern popular history books is to add imagined details or dialogue or thoughts that a subject *may have* thought or *perhaps* had spoken. In this book, we get long paragraphs of descriptions of scenes, usually in cities, as Ms. Jonnes imagines them. She takes us back to the morning of July 9, 1889 by painting a picture with her words:\\"Through the open windows, for it was summer, came the muted cacophony of Broadway below, newsboys yelling the day's headlines, hawkers tempting passersby with corn on the cob, teamsters lashing their horses forward.\\"[Sweet corn in early July?]or\\"November 15, 1890, dawned crisp and azure in Manhattan, one of those delicious fall Saturdays where the air shimmers sweetly, full of life's promise and tempered by autumnal tristesse.\\"Well, yessss . . . [clearing of throat] That may be quite nice forRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, but I don't believe that people who pick up a book about the history of electrical service are looking for the setting of a fanciful scene of \\"autumnal tristesse.\\" I doubt that even the poetry magazines are accepting such claptrap.Ms. Jonnes adores her own words, so the more of them, the better. There is not a noun in this book which lacks an adjective. Pronouns are shorter, so each gets two adjectives. In this bookno man has a jaw; he has a \\"jutting jaw\\"there is no mustache but a \\"huge mustache\\"there is never wind; instead, there is a \\"sultry spring zephyr\\"it doesn't rain; there is \\"a gusting downpour\\"it doesn't rain; there is a \\"stubborn drizzle\\"there is no lake; there is \\"glistening water\\"Redundancies mean nothing to her: \\". . . working largely at night when the city's much maligned street-cleaning crews spread out to remove the two or three million pounds of equine manure left behind each day by the city's 150,000 horses.\\" [Is that as opposed to *feline* manure from horses?] There is \\"squishy mud\\" and \\"powerful locomotives\\" and \\". . . stank of horses for equine trams.\\"Throughout the book, Tesla never speaks in public without yet another reminder that he spoke \\"perfect, but accented English.\\"Of course, every threadbare clich&eacute; that one can image must make an appearance:stifling dustsweltering heatblistering heatpelting raina warm sultry eveningAt first, I thought, If I can make it through a book by Jacqueline Susann, I can slog through this mess, but then I kept on reading out of morbid curiosity, eager to see how many superfluous adjectives she could pile-up.\\"The soaring Eiffel Tower and the amazing American wizard Thomas Edison, whose multilingual phonographs dazzled all visitors to the exposition's huge . . .\\" [pg.225]I see by the dust jacket that Ms. Jonnes has a Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins University!

I will base my review of this book based on his ridiculous 2 star review. I have been an Electrical Engineer since the mid-1980s. I enjoyed this book tremendously! This is a book that deals with the history of the THREE PRIMARY men who began the war of AC vs. DC electric currents. They are Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla.Apparently reviewer johnjones2 does not know his history. Charles Proteus Steinmetz never worked for Westinghouse; he worked for GE (that's common knowledge). He didn't join the GE staff until 1893, which was the year of the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. The war of electric currents was well under way before Steinmetz ever joined the GE staff. As you'll learn in this book (and others), the Colombian Exposition was a major battle ground for the war of electric currents. Steinmetz was an outstanding electrical engineer who later worked (for GE) to help optimize the AC motor by solving hysteresis issues. It was TESLA'S (who began working for Westinghouse in 1888 after a short stint with Edison), NOT Steinmetz's, ALL-IMPORTANT PATENTS that were needed to get the AC business going. That's the way business works! This book is about how the AC / DC war began and how AC proved to be the better technology (that's why our homes are now wired for AC). It's not about how AC systems were later perfected.Am I bothered that the author didn't mention Steinmetz - heck no. There are many other engineers who have worked on AC systems to make them better and more efficient, did I expect all of them to be mentioned in this book as well - again, heck no! For reviewer johnjones2 to say that the author had ulterior motives for leaving out Steinmetz is completely hilarious!In 1889, Steinmetz had to flee Germany because of his SOCIALIST activities (ulterior motive?), he then came to the United States. Rudolf Eickemeyer, who had begun building electrical apparatus in his factory in Yonkers, N.Y., gave Steinmetz his start in electrical engineering research. When GE bought out Eickemeyer in late 1892, Steinmetz remained on the staff and began working under the new owners.Now lets move on to reviewer johnjones2's technical issues. Really, there are none. The author does a good job setting the groundwork for how scientists began studying and discovering the basics of electricity and how that knowledge was developed so that man could harness the powerof electricity and use it in the way that we use it today. The so-called technical errors that are pointed out by johnjones2 are based on very trivial issues. I found his complaints about the authors \\"scientific drawings\\" completely off base and without merit. The author provides 11 diagrams and basic electrical schematics that help give the average reader an idea of the concepts involved. They are very basic in nature and are diagrams that are still used today to help explain the fundamentals of electricity. These are not \\"misleading\\" in any way. When reviewer johnjones2 complains about the author rating electrical generators in horsepower and says \\"something that certainly hasn't been done for a century\\", well, I think he missed the point. This book is about the history of AC/DC electricity and how it was developed a CENTURY ago.Lastly, as far as johnjones2's comment \\"she (the author) specifies early systems by the number of bulbs they could light-- as if all light bulbs had the same power consumption (but perhaps they did in the earliest days)\\", what an ambiguous statement. This one's not even worth the time.This is an excellent book written by a historian, not an Electrical Engineer (can you imagine how boring this book would have been if an Electrical Engineer had written it). This book is a good read for anyone and especially those who love reading about the Gilded Age era of American history."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Jonnes gives us a look at the story of electrification from Edison's discovery of the incandescent light to completion of the Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating station (using Westinghouse equipment based on Tesla's AC patents). She begins with an overview of what was known about electricity-the relationship between electricity and magnetism, discovered by Michael Faraday, and the development of electromagnets by Joseph Henry. Development of practical generators in the 1870s, was soon followed by the first arc lights, but they were cumbersome and too bright for home use. Edison took up the challenge to develop an electric light suitable for home use in 1878, completed in 1879, and installed in New York City in 1882.Edison firmly believed in his DC power system, but it was poorly suited to transmitting power long distances. Once AC transformers were invented, in 1885, George Westinghouse realized that AC was the more practical system. He licensed Tesla's patents for AC generator and motor and began installing systems. A major battle ensued with Edison promoting DC and charging that AC was unsafe. That resulted in the adoption of the AC powered electric chair as a means of execution. Edison General Electric and Westinghouse found themselves in direct competition many times.Edison was a darling of the media. His side of the story has been told many times. Westinghouse was personable, but far less open to the press. No biographies have appeared since 1926. Tesla was a frequent publisher, gave numerous demonstrations especially at technical meetings. His eccentric nature leads to some treatments as a man of mystery.The detailed treatment of the Niagara Power project is much appreciated. This was the first major hydroelectric project in the US. It was financed by a Wall Street syndicate headed by JP Morgan. We see the details of how the bankers brought in experts to get the best available advice on the project. Finally Westinghouse won the competition because he had licensed the Tesla AC patents. There was no nearby customer for the power from Niagara. Buffalo, 26 miles away was the logical one. But the project also spawned numerous industries that took advantage of low cost electric power. This is the founding of well known companies. Among them Alcoa (first production of low cost aluminum), Carborundum (abrasives made by electric furnace), Union Carbide (acetylene made by electric furnace), and Hooker Chemical (chlorine, bleach, alkalis, sodium hydroxide, sodium all made by electrolysis of salt water). Niagara began supplying power to Alcoa on Aug 26, 1895.The book also gives us a profile of three inventors: Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla. We are shown how financiers dealt with them. In Feb, 1892, JP Morgan and associates merged Edison General Electric with another holding, Thompson Houston, renamed the combine General Electric Co., and put CEO Charles Coffin in charge without even consulting Edison. George Westinghouse lost control of his company after it sank into bankruptcy in the Panic of 1907. He was soon forced out of the company. A proxy fight to regain control in 1911 failed. Tesla licensed his key AC patents to Westinghouse and initially received generous royalties. But he agreed to give up those royalties as part of a Westinghouse rescue plan in the Panic of 1891. His other patents were tied up in a deal with JP Morgan to fund radio development. After Marconi beat him to market, he was unable even to defend his own patents. He died penniless.This is a great read for those interested in technology and how it all came together. We are left hungering for a second volume to cover the rest of the electrification story. We hear nothing of Samuel Insull, very little of the development of electric street cars, electric railroads, interurbans, the electric automobile, TVA, rural electrification, or the expansion of electrical systems throughout the country. Excellent bibliography. Many references.

This is the first lesson I learned from Empires of Light: save the details for when they can be truly useful. Jill Jonnes writes like a historian who just finished an intro-to-composition course; however, for this book she probably should have spent more time with aspiring electricians at her local trade school. A book about \\"the race to electrify the world\\" would better benefit from its author knowing too much about electricity than from her ability to generate great varieties of adjectives for the same basic subjects--Nikola Tesla is always elegant and awkward, the weather is either oppressively hot or frigidly cold, and the men's Gilded Age facial hair is always worthy of description. Jonnes even repeats some of the same proper descriptions chapter after chapter, as if some readers might read the book as a collection of essays--George Westinghouse travels in \\"Glen Eyre, his private railcar\\" and Tesla dines at \\"Delmonico's, America's most famous restaurant.\\" On the other hand, I found myself wondering about the basic voltage equals current times resistance (V=IR) electricity equation: was Jonnes avoiding it because the inventors of electricity didn't understand it yet, or did she just not think it was important to her readers' understanding of the subject?There may not be any better books available on this subject, but Jonnes does neither the Gilded Age nor the birth of electrification justice. This book would benefit either by being edited to half its length or expanded to improve the social and technical context; as written, it's a lukewarm offering which I give three stars."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"What does one do when they are on a red-eye flight for six hours and can't sleep? They read! The target of my insomnia for this trip was Empires Of Light - Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World by Jill Jonnes. If this is a part of history you haven't ever been exposed to, it's a fascinating read...Jonnes goes back to the mid-to-late 1800's and covers the story of how Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse transformed society with the power of electricity. Back then, the predominate form of lighting was the gaslight... dirty, smoky, and not very efficient. Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse all had ideas about electricity and how it might be packaged in a form that could illuminate the night and run motors. Edison was a proponent of Direct Current, or DC, power, while Westinghouse was pushing the Alternating Current, or AC, power type. Since we obviously now have an AC power grid worldwide, you can tell who won the war over the long term. But in the beginning, things were far from settled. DC is a much safer power source, but it can not travel very far. As a result, power stations had to be built all over a city to provide the necessary electricity to that area. On the other hand, AC can travel great distances and is much more efficient, but it can be much more dangerous and deadly. It was this safety issue that led to some of the more \\"memorable\\" events of the time, like Edison pushing AC power for an electric chair to kill someone, so that AC would be associated in the public mind as dangerous. While Edison and Westinghouse were fighting things out on the lighting side, Tesla was a complete eccentric who wanted to invent the first AC powered motor (when it was thought that it couldn't be done).Being in the tech industry, what kept standing out to me was how those times were nearly identical to the dot.com era. There are new technologies that are changing the way that people live. Standards are nonexistent, and everyone is fighting to become the king of the new economy. A quote that seemed so appropriate: \\"For many years the Edison Company contented itself with flooding the country with circulars trying to ridicule the Westinghouse system. One morning it suddenly awoke to find it had a competitor. Now it says that if the contract is given to Westinghouse an injunction will head him off.\\" Remind you of any software companies today?While the overall writing style may not be as riveting as a techno-thriller, it's good enough to carry the reader back to a time where technology was *truly* changing people's lives. This is a must-read for people who think we are in \\"unprecedented times\\", when in reality we are just replaying the past."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This is a fairly good book on three pioneers of the electrical revolution: Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse. Only the last was a true industrialist, while the first two were inventors who more or less failed to capture the full value of what they created. The field of battle was was between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). Jonnes also attempts to evoke the era - one of huge transition, both technological and social/organizational - in which they lived.The best things about this book are in overview and context. I learned about the business environment and practices during the Gilded era, which was indeed extremely interesting and useful for my current project. This is well researched and clearly written. Moreover, what each of these individuals faced - their frustrations, ambitions, motivations, and methods - are also examined in some detail. While I know a lot about Edison from previous research, this was a gold mine of info on his principal competitors, Westinghouse and Tesla, whose technology (AC) won the battle to become the standard of wire-furnsihed electric power. Edison was an incredible inventor, but his obstinancy for sticking to what he created led him to bypass AC for the less workable DC (this is a pattern that led him to many strategic mistakes thru his career). Tesla was an eccentric visionary and loner, who made great discoveries early on only to get mired into megalomanaical schemes during the last decades of his life. Westinghouse was a true &quot;broker of innovation&quot; - finding and using talent with great efficiacy - and in many ways a brilliant pioneer of corporate and industrial organization; he was also a decent man with populist ideals in a time of ruthless exploitation and manipulation.However, this book failed for me on many counts. First, it did not go into enough technological detail for me - I still don't understand the difference between AC and DC from a scientific point of view. Second, I did not get much of a feeling for a story (billed on the cover as a titanic struggle) that was unfolding: instead, the book jumped around and got bogged down in certian details, such as the grizzly chapter on Edison's promotion of an AC-current electric chair (to scare the public) or the maneuvering that preceeded the COlumbian Exposition.Third, and this is a very personal perception, I did not like the way that Jonnes writes. While her book certainly was not as dry or lifeless as so many academic studies tend to be, I felt she was straining to write as eloquently as McCullough or Schama, which I believe is beyond her talent. This criticism may come from writing 101, but she uses too many adjectives. Waves of panic are &quot;ungulating,&quot; electicity is &quot;ethereal,&quot; etc., each time failing to find &quot;le mot juste.&quot; I really don't mean to be a snob about this - she is a better historian than I ever could be - but her writing style irritated me several times on every page.Recommended with these caveats in mind."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"The story in this book deserves to be told. The bibliography contains biographies of the main characters and accounts of such events as the construction of the Niagara power plant. This book brings a new perspective by pulling together the intersecting threads of these lives through these events, and thereby makes them more interesting and easier to understand.For someone who has lived in Silicon Valley for two decades, the similarities in the behaviors of entrepreneurs, managers and investors between today and the late 19th century are striking. The investors in a hurry to fire company founders are familiar characters, as is the behavior of companies that pick the brains of suppliers through a bidding process before developing their own technology, or the constant conflicts about intellectual property.Despite its merits, I cannot give this book five stars because it contains irrelevant materials and inaccurate details, and is written in a florid, sloppy style. For example, the two pages about the assassination of James Garfield are unnecessary, because it has nothing to do with electrification. As a milestone in time, it might rate one line, but not more. Otherwise, as a reader, you keep expecting it to be connected somehow with the subject, but it isn't.Minor inaccuracies in the text also bothered me, not for their intrinsic importance but for the doubt they cast in my mind about the validity of everything else. Tesla, for example, is introduced as a Serb. Then he is a Croat, and finally a Serb again. As another reader pointed out, the author does not seem to know the difference between power and energy. Chapter 2 is a short history of electromagnetism up to the 1870s, which does not mention Maxwell. In the afterword, Edison is also described as the inventor of motion pictures through his Vitascope system, which was introduced five months after the Lumiere brothers' cinematograph... I agree with another reviewer that the book might have been boring if written by an engineer, but a good engineer might have been useful as a fact checker.In the writing style, statements that Galvani had lost his \\"beloved\\" wife and \\"happily\\" practiced anatomy beg the question of how the author could possibly have known. A fiction writer may know such things about his characters, but a historian doesn't about real people who died 200 years ago. Barbara Tuchman could thrill the reader with history without ever presuming to know the private feelings of the people she wrote about. Why does the author refer to dynamo inventor Gramme as \\"Monsieur Gramme,\\" when she never uses any such form about anybody else? Is she trying to make him sound like inspector Clouseau?She also uses different words for the same things for no obvious reason. Referring to the same event as the \\"War Between the States\\" and the \\"Civil War\\" in the same paragraph, or to New York as \\"Gotham,\\" while gratuitous, may be harmless to American readers but it is guaranteed to confuse to readers in, say, New Dehli or Kiev who may be fluent in English but not familiar with these idioms."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Its fascinating to imagine the world as electricity was coming into its own. And then there's the reality.This book offers a perspective rarely seen of someone we consider a major American icon, and two others we all know were important but, unfortunately, often can't remember why.Living in Pittsburgh, I of course know the legend of George Westinghouse -- but most of my knowledge is of the more recent divestiture of his amazing company after years of mismanagement. I have to say I was pleased to find that while he was a Gilded Age industrialist -- perhaps with many of the characteristics that label implies -- his goals and intentions for his products, as well as his sportsmanly handling in many ways of Edison's ridiculous and often atrocious behavior, were quite noble.I was shocked to learn more about Edison -- our most celebrated inventor -- particularly his tunnel vision and ruthlessness in preserving his self-decided reign over a technology that had more to offer society than any one man could take credit for. Condoning Brown's dog experiements with AC was sick enough -- to hear that he promoted the development of the electric chair simply to get a leg up on his competition (Westinghouse)was truly sad.As a publicist, I find Jonnes descriptions of information, disinformation and yellow journalism paint a picture of Gilded Age America steeped in lessons we should have learned long ago about news, business and the legends of American icons.Well worth the read for anyone who loves to find those places where history repeats itself over and over again."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This book is a enjoyable overview and history of it's subject: The early days of the industrialization of electrical power in the United States.

I'm sure some important details or individuals are missing or dealt with only briefly, but the book accomplishes what it sets out to do: offer a informative yet entertaining overview of one specific area of American invention and industrialization in the last half of the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"EMPIRES OF LIGHT by Jill Jonnes is a 416 page history book. There are 16 pages of black & white photographs. Generally, the book is written at the level of a 16 year old. On the other hand, a couple of the chapters in this book cannot be understood without taking a college class in corporate business or financing. Also, for full appreciation of the book, you need to take a short course in electronics. The writing is not thorny or difficult or mannered. The cast of characters includes J. P. Morgan, Elisha Gray, Michael Faraday, and a handful of others. Elisha Gray was the inventor of the telephone. To learn more about Gray and his competitor, Alexander Bell, I recommend another fine book, THE TELEPHONE PATENT CONSPIRACY OF 1876 by A. E. Evenson. I also recommend, THE GATE:THE TRUE STORY OF THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, by Van Der Zee, which takes the same integrative approach in weaving together the relationships between corporate engineers, engineers in academia, financiers, and societal issues.EMPIRES OF LIGHT provides fine journalistic writing to break up technical details relating to corporate financing and patents. Here is an example (page 247): \\"George Westinghouse was hurtling along in his private railcar, the Glen Eyre . . . locomotive began to clang its bells urgently, for it was speeding into an industrial amphitheater [Chicago] . . . endless reaches of factories, marshaling yards, slaughterhouses, grain elevators, iron mills, slag heaps . . . soot-covered cable cars.\\" The following are some high points from the book:CHAPTER 5. We learn that Westinghouse (W.) invented a car replacer for fixing derailed trains, and a metal device for preventing derailing at junctions, an air brake (invented at age 22). In 1881 (age 34), he bought patents claiming train signals, and hired H.Byllesby away from Edison, to develop light bulbs for W. In 1885, W. read an article on alternating current (AC) generators and AC transformers, and decided that the future of the world resided in far-off waterfalls turning AC generators, and long-distance transmission of AC. The article was about the Gaulard-Gibbs system. W. bought the patents of Lucien Gaulard and John Gibbs (p. 123). We learn that Michael Faraday had actually invented the very first transformer and generator in 1831. Faraday's machines worked only with AC, because AC created the required magnetic field. W. re-designed the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer. We learn that all of W.'s electricians were against AC at first. In 1886, W. demonstrated use of AC to transmit 500V, in conjunction with transformers to step down the voltage to 100V (suitable for use for lighting in homes). By 1886, W. had 27 customers. But at this point, Edison initiated his hate campaign against AC, which involved public executions of dogs using AC (p. 139).CHAPTER 6. We learn about a Rumanian boy who was killed from AC from downed wires. This occurred April 15, 1888 on East Broadway near Catherine St. in Manhattan. This and other accidents enabled Edison to argue more strongly against AC. At this point in time, Edison had 121 DC stations, and Westinghouse had 22 AC stations. W.'s biggest roadblock was lack of an AC motor, while Edison's biggest roadblock was that DC power generating plants could only serve people in a 1/2 mile radius (p. 144). In 1887, the price of copper increased, to the benefit of W., because AC generators needed 1/3 as much copper as DC generators. At this time, W. owned the incandescent light patents of Framer, Maxim, and Weston. Also, at this time, Tesla (age 31) was busy inventing and filing patents on AC machines (dynamos, induction motors, transformers). An example of Tesla's breakthroughs was use of 2 alternating currents that were out of step with each other (\\"polyphase\\"). In May 1888, W. contacted Tesla via his employee H.Byllesby, and in July 1888 Tesla went to Pittsburgh to work for W. (p. 163).CHAPTER 9. We learn that Edison's source of funding was J.P.Morgan, while W.'s source of funding was his own wealth and stockholders. In late 1890, a huge bank in England (Baring Bros.) collapsed, and there was also an economic crisis in the U.S. W. raised money by creating and selling stock, with the help of August Belmont & Co., and by begging Tesla to give up the royalties on his patents (Tesla complied) (p. 229). As one might expect in any book about Tesla, we learn about his colorful attributes (elegant clothes, phobia of germs, and a parlor trick of running high voltages through his body) (pages 226, 227, 230, 273). Edison also had financial troubles, as his source of funding (North America Bank) collapsed.CHAPTER 10. Please remember, that the main issue in this book is AC versus DC. W. and Edison had submitted bids to light the Chicago World's Fair of May 1893. The DC bid submitted by Edison/Thomson-Houston/General Electric was for $577,485, and the AC bid of Westinghouse/Charles Terry was for $480,694. AC won. To light the Fair, W. needed to design around Edison's patents, so he designed and mass-produced a stopgap electrical light called the \\"stopper lamp.\\" At the Fair, W.'s generators were turned by oil engines designed by Allis-Chalmers. Here is a history of Allis-Chalmers acquired from the internet site devoted to this company's tractors: \\"Allis-Chalmers' history as a manufacturer extends to the 1840's in Milwaukee. In 1914 the company started building farm equipment. Allis-Chalmers grew to become one of the largest and most diverse manufacturers in North America. However, Allis-Chalmers became the victim of rapidly changing financial times and was eventually forced to sell the farm equipment division to K-H-Deutz AG of Germany in 1985.\\"CHAPTER 11. We learn of the Cataract Construction Co., formed by 103 lawyers and bankers, for converting Niagara Falls into a power station, using ten 5,000 hp turbines. Bids were submitted by W. (AC generator), by Edison GE (also AC), and by Thomson-Houston (DC generator). The Edison GE plan was apparently based on a design stolen from Westinghouse, and GE's president Charles Coffin was one of the accused.CHAPTER 12. A glitch in the Niagara project was that an engineer, George Forbes, somehow got control of the project, and dictated that the generators should make 22,000 volts of AC at 16 cycles/second (totally impractical specs). Eventually, Westinghouse won the contract, and build the generating plant in a workable fashion (p. 305). (The book is not really clear on how Forbes got control, or on how W. finally got control.)CRITIQUE. The book fails to provide any organized account on how the United States decided on 60 cycles per second. While different values for this frequency are disclosed, here and there in the book, the book really needs to provide an organized account on how 60 cycles per second became the standard. Another shortcoming, is that the book should do a better job at identifying the various courtroom cases, and at listing the relevant patent numbers. However, for the interested reader, the book should have gone a step further to list the relevant patent numbers. While the book does contain some schematic diagrams of electronics, these are not enough to educate the beginner on the workings of motors, generators, and transformers, and I was left with the feeling that the author really does not care much about the topic of her book (early advances in electronics). Margaret Cheney's fine book on Mr.Tesla provides a dozen or so patent numbers. With these numbers in hand, any reader can get the patents for free at espacenet dot com, or at uspto dot gov. Espacenet provides patent images that are of much higher quality, than those from uspto.To conclude, this book will be highly readable, for those with some sort of background in at least one of these things: corporations, financing, electronics, or patents. I recommend this book to any person interested in how the \\"modern world\\" came to be. I liked EMPIRES OF LIGHT, and also THE GATE by John Van Der Zee, for the same reasons. Both books take an integrative approach in their writing, and disclose relationships between private engineers, academic engineers, financiers, and issues generally affecting society, as it relates to a common engineering goal."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"I enjoyed the book and finished it, but I agree with other reviewers that a good editior could have shortened the book by a third and made it twice as good. Just striking every other adjective would be an automatic big improvement. I also agree with other reviewers that some additional fact-checking would have helped: On page 27, it says that Ben Franklin did his kite experiment in 1852. He died in 1790, and actually did his kite trick in 1752. Yes, that's just a minor typo, but after reading that, you start to doubt other dates and facts."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Empire of Lights is the story of the quest to conquer the American Electric Industry. Thomas Edison, Nicholas Tesla, George Westinghouse are all giants in their own right with great accomplishments and life stories to fill up many books. It should be no surprise that whenthey come together, they end up altering the way humans live. Edison the experimenter, who invents stuff by relentlessly tring out many things vs Tesla the theoretician with visionary dreams; Edison the all-controlling boss who loves the spotlight vs George Westinghouse a generous boss under whom Tesla flourished. Students of Electrical Engineering with poor grades can feel a little better ; even the great Edison failed to understand the significance and utility of the AC distribution system championed byGeorge Westinghouse and Tesla. This book may infact enhance the understanding of modern day students by providing perspective on the drawbacks of the DC system and benefits/challenges in implementing an AC system. In a way, the war of the electric currents is similar to the arguments between the coal and nuclear industry of today. The AC current was portrayed as a deadly form of electricity totally unsafe for human use. The Electric industry of late 19th century was lucky that it didnt have to suffer major liability lawsuits for fatal injuries. It will be interesting to see if the Nuclear Industry can overcome the fear in the minds of the people."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This book explained a lot to me.

The story of the origins of electrical thought as well as the origins of the two greatest electricians, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, is very well told. The book thoroughly discusses the inventions of these two great men stretching from the invention of the light bulb and the direct current system of Edison to the wireless transmission of signals the Tesla invented near the end of his prestigious career. Life in America was changed by electricity and the book shows this through significant events such as the Chicago World's Fair and the first ever execution by the electric chair. Adding in the battle between Westinghouse's alternating current system and the direct current system of Edison, the book is full of corporate fights and disasters. The backbiting that occurs between the AC and DC forces is incredible as men attempt to resist beneficial change in the interest of capital. With Jonnes's great ability to tell the story of the \\"mysterious fluid,\\" it is easy to become enthralled in the compelling story of how electricity came to be the engine for today's society."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Some reviewers focused on the author's overuse of adjectives or a small number of mistakes about electricity.

The story itself is interesting, but in her focus on the enigmatic Tesla, Ms. Jonnes left out the single most important scientist on Westinghouse's steff, Charles Proteus Steinmetz. This hunchbacked German immigrant is credited by all scientists with the fundamental ideas and engineering of alternating current -- including finding the solution to its most vexing problem, hysteresis losses in transformer and motor cores.Without Steinmetz's brilliance AC would have been stillborn, despite its theoretical (and, as we know today, practical) advantages. But he's missing from the text, from the index, from the book, an inexcusable omission that makes me wonder if Ms. Jonnes could have had some ulterior motive for Steinmetz's excision and Tesla's sole prominence.In addition, the text has a fair number of technical errors that would have been easily corrected had the author shown the text to a competent electrical engineer or physicist. There are also many &quot;scientific&quot; drawings, most of which miss the point and may even be misleading. She confuses power with energy, rates electrical generators in horsepower (something that certainly hasn't been done for a century) forcing constant multiplication by 4/3 to get kilowatts, a recognizable unit; and she specifies early systems by the number of bulbs they could light -- as if all light bulbs had the same power consumption (but perhaps they did in the earliest days).Not a book I can recommend to somebody who cares about the engineering and development of electric power, but still interesting for a while and in spots."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Just finished reading this.

Both Tesla and Westinghouse started at university but did not complete, and Thomas Edison did not even complete grade school.As well as their electrical inventions, they all branched out into associated fields. Tesla made radio transmissions before Marconi; Edison invented the phonograph and also a way of extracting iron ore by magnetism, and George Westinghouse pioneered the steam turbine for marine propulsion in USA. Long after his death in 1914, Westinghouse steam turbines were installed in the world's fastest liner, ss United States, in 1952.On a personal level the three men were courteous and approachable; Westinghouse treated his employees very well but Edison was not so generous to his. Westinghouse had a long and happy marriage and Edison was married twice, with six children who saw very little of their workaholic father. Nikola Tesla lived into his eighties, but remained unmarried, and was said to have lived a celibate life. He died alone in a New York hotel room in 1943.At the end of the book, the author reminds us that electric light has changed the true meaning of 'night'; we have lost the character and the poetry of the night that earlier generations knew.Before his death, Tesla said he had 'an inexpressible satisfaction that my polyphase system has lightened the burdens of mankind and increased their comfort and happiness'"},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"It's great to read an historical topic with journalistic spark (pun intended) and admirable unbias.

The book reads like a novel and it contain photos of the time."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"i read this because i was interested in tesla but now im interested in edison and westinghouse too. must read this. only caviat is for kindle readers last 20 percent is notes. disappointing cuz the book was soooooo good."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"The one reviewer who said the author goes nuts with adjectives is correct. Barring that one sometimes humorous distraction, this book tells a very interesting story about what I always believed was just something that occured because of the efforts of good old Ben Franklin and then Thomas Edison. Boy was I wrong. It describes the myriad of inventors and inventions from around the world that all eventualy come together to make electric light and electric power available as we know it today. It tells the story of a great number of others who contributed bits and pieces to the whole puzzle. I now have to believe that there were probably many others in the orient, for example, that were working on the same inventions at the same time that even this book did not discuss. I was also thrilled to read where the author went beyond the nuts and bolts of the inventions themselves to discuss the difficulties of business and financing for these marvelous inventors in a time when there was no SEC or other agencies who could (to some degree) protect their business interests. For me this book was exceedingly captivating."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This book is so good they could make it into a movie. I've worked for an electrical power utility for over 38 years and I'm a history buff so this was a double pleasure for me. Jill Jonnes gives us a fascinating look at the origins of electrical power in the U.S.There is something here for everyone: the macabre account of the first execution by electrocution, and the equally gut-wrenching story of the lineman in New York who died a horrible death dangling from high-voltage wires forty feet above the pavement. His body burned and spewed blood while the frightened onlookers could do nothing to save him. Then there is the inspiring story of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla, the three who get the most credit for advancing and solidifying electrical power as a viable business in the U.S. Whether they were \\"geniuses\\" or not is a matter of your own perspective. They were certainly workaholics who had extraordinary intelligence and vision about what could be done with new technology. (Edison once worked five days straight while inventing the phonograph.)There was a great battle between alternating and direct current. Edison stubbornly fought AC all the way. He felt it was unsafe for use by the general public because of the danger of lethal electric shock. He bragged that with his DC system, anyone would survive accidental contact, although the proponents of AC led by Westinghouse countered with the fact that Edison's DC system had caused many fires, both in customers' houses and in the central generating plants. The author points out that Edison may have had another reason, his own pride. Anyone in the business at that time could see the obvious advantage of AC over DC. DC was limited to about a one-mile radius of the generator, where AC could be transmitted several miles by stepping voltage up or down as needed with Westinghouse's new transformers. And once Tesla's AC two-phase motor was developed for commercial use, Edison's DC system was doomed.Tesla turned into a sort of benevolent mad scientist after the Niagara project--Dr. Frankenstein with his gigantic Tesla coils, shooting lightning into the atmosphere. At one point his lab pulled so much power he caused the Colorado Springs powerhouse to trip off line, throwing the entire area into a blackout. Tesla's visionary dream, apparently, was to develop a means of transmitting power wirelessly. All humanity could tap into the standing wave generated by the Tesla coils, or whatever, and thereby receive free electricity. Tesla naturally needed huge financial support for this and he turned to J.P. Morgan who had financed the Niagara project and many other large ventures. But Morgan had seen too many of Tesla's projects come to naught, so he declined to back any more of them. Among Tesla's many experiments were the fluorescent light and the radio transmitter-receiver, the later being carried forward by Marconi who may have purloined some of Tesla's patents.Two great projects did the most to advance electric power: the 1893 Columbia Exposition in Chicago, and the Niagara Falls hydro-generator plant. Tesla and Westinghouse were the brains and brawn behind the Niagara project completed in 1895, and it was Westinghouse who got the contract to light up the Chicago World's Fair. In 1893 only the wealthiest Americans could enjoy the advantages of electric light. The fair, known as the White City, showed all Americans the marvels of electrical light and appliances.The advent of electrical power in the U.S. was a struggle of hard-driven men plowing new ground against constant financial and legal setbacks, the intrigues and subterfuge of their competitors, and the race forward with a technology that was only barely understood at the time. But once it took hold it spread like wildfire as almost everyone, rich or poor, wanted to convert to electric. Indeed, the success of America in WW II, the great arsenal of democracy, was due in large part to the fact that by 1940 cheap electrical power was available in every part of the country, even the desert of New Mexico."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"\\"And from those humming dynamos would flow an invisible river of electricity, quietly crossing the bridge to the transformers, there to become high voltage and mighty, flashing out into the world, where individual transformers would again lower its invisible and silent flow to light tens of thousands of bulbs, to power great industries, to run the buffalo streetcars, to brighten man's nights and lighten his load. They had called him a dreamer, but this was no dream.\\"Jill Jonnes captures the excitement of an era, the thrill of seeing light where there was darkness, and the relentless competition among men who wanted to be the one to light the country. I almost passed on this book, rich in the details of history, the petty, the significant, and the unsavory. After reading the first chapter, a primer on the workings of electricity, I almost pulled the plug. I'm so glad I persisted.In this book Tesla, Westinghouse, and Edison are fleshed out in detail, enough to let us in on their feelings and motivations. The triumvirate do not share pages evenly, and Tesla, the man in whom I'm most interested, is a star illuminated less than the other two. For the modern man turning on a light is a mundane action, yet Jonnes presents the breathless magic of the Chicago's world fair with flair and skill. It's almost as if she takes the reader back in time to the days of buggies, trolleys, and gas street lights. The grandeur of the Chicago World's Fair, a triumph for Westinghouse and Tesla, is contrasted sharply with the dark and desperate times of the Panic of 1893 , of failed banks, failed railroads, and the failed lives of those thousands of hopelessly unemployed.Empires of Light is the story of three historical dynamos, of triumphs, tragedies, and resurgence. It's one of those books that when one turns the last page, he or she is happy and satisfied to have read it."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"I loved this book! I bought it hoping to learn, more than anything, about Tesla. I ended up learning an incredible amount about Tesla, Edison and Westinghouse--and a lot about the time period they lived, as well. Each of the three men came to life in this book!The vast majority of the book is really interesting. There are a few parts where it seemed to bog down a little bit with unnecessary detail, and a little bit of repetitiveness in parts.Overall, though, Jill Jones has done an excellent job at portraying the challenges each of these three men faced, their character (good and bad), and how the times in which they lived impacted them. Most of all, she shows how they impacted the world.It's a thrilling time period to study, and I don't think I would have wanted to start reading about these men any other way than by reading about them together, as Jones weaved their stories together in this book. I think understanding them together gives a fairly balanced view of each man that would be harder to get in a single biography of any one of them."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This was exactly what I wanted, the history and description of how the early implementation, financing and design happened. I hate when we get an autobiography of the inventer's life and not a detailed description of how they developed the technology and what mistakes and breakthoughs the inventer got. This book is fantastic."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This is a book about an important topic in our lives: electrical power. Although the author discusses early discoveries in electricity, the main focus is on the period from the late 1800s to the early 1900s - a period when great advances were made in the development of large scale electrical power generation, as well as on the giants who led the way. The science is discussed, at least to some degree, as are the economics of the time. Mini biographies of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla are also presented. The writing is clear and engaging such that the book is difficult to put down. My only disappointment was that, in my opinion, the science and engineering aspects were not discussed enough; I think that an appendix with more scientific details would have complemented the book very well. But despite this minor shortcoming, the book certainly succeeds in giving the reader a flavor of those exciting times. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"This is a splendidly written book, and is essential history for those who seek to anticipate the future. For almost all of us alive today in the United States, electricity has always been there (even if not always so omnipresent). If we think about a world without electricity at all, it is to wonder what it was like to experience the night with only flickering lamps and candles to push back the shadows. I had never considered, however, what it was like to experience the coming of electricity as a new thing in the world. New brightly burning lights, new quiet motors --- a new power coursing invisibly through thin wires. Over the last dozen decades, an electrical infrastructure swept the country and transformed our lives -- most of our energy consumption is now via electricity. Ms. Jonnes captured the excitement of this transformation at it's very source; the inventors and businessmen who made the future happen. Those of us who have been part of the Internet revolution will recognize many similarities in these two revolutions. All of us should acquaint ourselves with this history of the electrical revolution, because already the seeds of a new electrical infrastructure revolution have sprouted which will again transform our economy. Ms. Jonnes book is an excellent education written in an engaging style. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"As an Electrical Engineer AND a history buff, I found this book to be outstanding. I expected a drier, more technical discussion but was very pleasantly surprised by how readable the entire book was. In my opinion, Jill Jonnes had a very good understanding of her intended general audience and mixed in just enough technical information to keep the storylines smoothly progressing while not bogging down the reader with tedious electrical theory and details.With this in mind, this is a great book for just about anyone who wants to further understand how electricity as we know it today came into existence. From the earliest (even ancient) electrical discoveries that she superbly describes in just the right amount of detail, the book easily flows into the inter-twined lives of Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla. Before this book, I vastly underestimated the contributions of Westinghouse and Tesla; I know feel I have a more accurate view of their roles.Ms. Jonnes does a very good job of placing the efforts of Edison, Westinghouse, and Tesla (and their supporting casts, including the financiers) into the proper context of life and society at the time (1870-1910 or so). I feel this is critical since no events or major inventions occur in a vacuum and it greatly improves the storytelling.In summary, this is an excellent book for most people with an interest in electricity AND history; some of the more critical reviewers, I believe, may be nitpicking a bit too much."},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","review":"Jill Jonnes has put together a well written and entertaining story of three men for the ages.

While there were some theoretical writers that I was familiar with. Bhabha, Said and Bourdieu not being the least significant of them, it was invigorating to be surrounded by a theoretical and pragmatic framework that I was, for the most part, unfamiliar with. Javier Franco Aixel&aacute;'s essay on Culture Specific Items was a particularly thorough analysis of those concerns and Bassnett and Carbonell's contributions went a great distance in exposing the colonizing and dominating influence of translation and traductology, though any easy solution to this tendency (or institutional imperative) was belied by Andr&eacute; Lefevre's explication of the explicitly conservative nature of canonization in literature anthologies in the United States.While the text would most likely not be particularly useful for a beginning student of translation theory and/or pragmatics, it provided me with a clear view of another aspect of translation and has started me off in another direction with my research in the seminar in which I am presently enrolled."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"This was an excellent book of short stories. Turtledove says alot in just a few pages and I was left me hungering for more. I admit to being a fan of the alternate history/reality genre and Turtledove is a master at making such &quot;potential pasts&quot; believeable. Perhaps my favorite story of the group (and it was not an easy decision) was concerning the arrival of an official of the Persian court to the conquered province of Greece (I believe the story was titled &quot;Counting Potsherds&quot;). This tells a nice compact story of how things can quickly change on a person at the flick of a wrist.This story is representative of Turtledove's work because he allows the altenate history to be a seemless and natural background to the story, as if this was the real course of events. Some writers make too much of describing the alternate history and do not give enough time to giving life and action to the characters in their stories. Turtledove's worlds are certainly different from our own but the focus is still on people and everything that people do. If the world they're set in seems foreign and unfamiliar to the reader, the humans themselves make up for it by simply being real people which is the real strength of his work. Pick this one up."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"Harry Turtledove's name has become almost synonymous with Alternate History. Guns of the South is perhaps the most talked about AH novel of today. Even historical SF novels by other authors sometimes have Turtledove's blurbs on the cover.In this highly readable anthology, the Grand Master proves that he is perfectly capable of handling other types of fiction. Sure, it contains plenty of AH stories. One particularly interesting example (&quot;Counting Potsherds&quot;) involves a world in which Persia conquered the Greek city-states, squelching out democracy. Another (&quot;Islands in the Sea&quot;) tells of a lively and informative debate between Chritian and Muslim theologians. The title story, &quot;Departures&quot;, is set in the Agent of Byzantium world, telling about the life of St. Mohammed.The non-AH stories, however, are perhaps more interesting. They reveal many sides of Turtledove that were not apparent before. There is everything from baseball stories (including the tale of a batboy who turns into a bat) to Jewish-themed fiction (including one amusing story which asks whether a genetically engineered cud-chewing pig would be kosher) to fantasy (can a well-meaning werewolf escape a midieval lynch mob?) to hard SF (humans and aliens mingle in a futuristic bar). The tone of the stories is also highly variable, ranging from the dead serious (should humans become involved with the affairs of low-tech aliens?) to the utterly silly (what happens when a confused time traveller from the far future accidentally ends up in a 20th century office building?). These stories have practically nothing in common. Some make you think, some make you laugh, some just make you say &quot;huh?&quot;, but all are very enjoyable.A great choice for Turtledove fans everywhere, and even those who don't enjoy his AH may want to give it a try."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"A new paperback shouldn't shed pages on the first reading.

I only wish he would write more of these; perhaps a volume two. I especially remember the story regarding democracy and its abortive beginings in Greece."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"Turtledove is one of few writers in the genre of science-fiction and fantasy who write compelling short stories, and this book is full of great ones. His knowledge of and respect for history, evident in these pages, leads to stories that are historically plausible alternate happenings (excepting, of course, the ones with vampires, etc. :-). His historicity makes these stories even more wonderful to read, knowing that &quot;it could have been&quot;, and it leads the reader to realize and spend thought-time on just how much of history is decided by very small events and chance, and how so much of what we know and who we are today might not have been if seemingly insignificant things hadn't happened (or had happened) even thousands of years ago.I would receommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, science-fiction, gothic horror, or fantasy --&gt; it will appeal to all. I also recommend it to anyone who enjoys literature (of whatever genre) that causes one to pause and think and see things a little bit differently after reading it."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"In any collection of short stories there will be some tales that are stronger than others. _Departures_ is no exception to this rule. Harry Turtledove's alternative histories make for a fun read, the fact that most are under 20 pages contributes to this: its a book you can pick up, read a bit, put down and return to later without having to review characters or plot.The stories are arranged chronologically, some with characters that will be familiar to regular readers of his work. (Each story has a brief introduction by the author.) There is an element of science fiction to the collection, but the majority are certainly historically plausable. While I am not a fan of alternative history or of science fiction, I was pleasantly surprised: the stories themselves were entertaining, and for the most part they weren't too far-fetched.

But at the same time, please don't expect strict &quot;alternate history&quot;. Some of these are fantasy stories, for one thing, featuring werewolves, vampires, etc. Also, I am not sure how any story that takes place entirely in the future can be considered &quot;alternate history&quot;, although I suppose that the stories set in the future do tend to feature at least a window into the present or past, and it is cast in an unusual, &quot;alternate&quot; light. Also, several of these tales deal with relatively obscure periods of the history of the Greek speaking world, an area in which Mr. Turtledove holds a PhD. It got me so interested in that period that I ended up going to the library to learn more about it, but just be prepared for the fact that these stories don't all deal with well-known themes of this genre. Definitely thought-provoking, and well-written tales."},{"Title":"Departures","review":"An immensely enjoyable collection of alternate history tales.

He explains it all, and explains it well.)In closing, Bolter considers the changes that computers have already initiated in our lifestyles and our thinking processes, and ventures some predictions as to future changes and developments.Remember, though, that this book WAS written in 1984, and that the developments which we have seen since then are more extensive than those that Bolter laid out... if you are more interested in the specific impact of newer technologies, such as the internet and telecommunications, you'd be better served with a subscription to WIRED magazine, or a text such as Marshall McLuhan's &quot;Understanding Media.&quot; This text provides a more general look at computers, their origin, and the fundamental ideas that they have instilled in our lives.Fascinating ideas, especially if you are interested in the role that computers and new media have in shaping and directing our modern lives... &quot;Turing's Man&quot; isn't casual reading, perhaps, but it IS engaging and provocative."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"I just finished the book. My understanding is that someone who \\"attains the age of reason\\" is someone who is willing to act decisively and to take responsibility for his actions even if it might result in a loss of personal freedom. Well, Matheiu appears to be more free at the end of the novel than he does at the beginning even though he did act decisively at the end of the novel with regards to Ivich and Marcelle. Is Sartre trying to suggest that acting decisively and assuming responsibility actually increases one's freedom? In that case, what is freedom? Does one exercise one's freedom by asserting responsibility? In Mathieu's case, I guess he got lucky because his actions at the end of the novel, which he might have ordinarily expected to have reduced his freedom, actually ended up increasing it. The fate of Daniel, with the loss of his personal freedom, was his just rewards for being such a villain throughout. Does anyone know whether Marcelle in this book and Paula in Beauvoir's \\"The Mandarins\\" is actually the same character? An unsatisfying element of Age of Reason is the question of Boris - what happened to him? Also, Lola left the book angry, and that anger went unresolved. The character Bobby made a brief but unforgettable appearance. Why did Sartre choose not to develop him better? Maybe I should read the next two books in the trilogy! Anyway, good book....not heavy reading as commonly assumed...but does give brief pause for thought. I think Sartre's existential ideas are out-dated now, but at the time of writing they were probably very intriguing. To me, Sartre comes off as self-obsessed and a bit immature. The recent biography of Sartre and Beavouir by Hazel Rowley reinforces that notion. I would not trust Sartre to keep an appointment, for example. That's the problem with these folk who are obsessed with their own personal freedom. They make bad buddies."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"When does a broke philosophy teacher with a pregnant mistress attain the age of reason ? How can &quot;philosophy&quot; (read higher consciousness), &quot;freedom&quot; (read utopia), and &quot;a life that doesn't cause misery to oneself and others&quot; coexist ? Is that at all possible ?Sartre ponders upon these questions as does Mathieu, the central character of this book. Mathieu is obsessed with the idea of freedom and does not want to lose it at any cost. On one hand he refuses to marry his mistress of 7 years and on the other, he refuses to join the Communist party when asked by his best friend. Sartre examines the ambiguity of freedom and philosophical formulas at a time when the need for collective effort and active involvement was acute.The dialogues between Mathieu and other characters - his friends,his brother, his mistress are engaging. Still, at times the book seems a drag but I guess that is because Sartre is painstakingly descriptive about some of the &quot;vacant&quot; characters.Sartre does not come to any conclusion in this book (of course, its the first in the trilogy), yet does not leave the reader unsatisfied(you know what I mean). Personally I didn't find Sartre's ideas in this book to be either original or truly brilliant. What I love about the book is the writing. Miracle words, poetry in one page, brute force in the other.Read it once."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"This is the first in Sartre's Road to Freedom series that follows the life of Mathiue, a disillusioned Philosophy professor who is trying to maintain his freedom in a conforming world. His life suddenly gets a shock when his long time mistress anounces news that will finally bound him forever. The rest of the novel is Mathiue's attempt to remedy the situation and presrve what freedom he has before it is lost forever.One of the overall themes of this novel is freedom and the individuals attempt to remain free. This is one of the corner stones of Existential philosophy, which Sartre was one of the central characters. If you want to understand Sartre's philosphy and apply it to a situation then read this book."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"It's hard to move oneself past the overwhelming image of the Great Jean-Paul Sartre, but if you're at all interested in getting beyond the pretentious references to existentialism and into the heart of the matter, this novel is an excellent gateway. Sartre addresses a topic the Simone de Beauvoir does in All Men Are Mortal, what does it mean to be really free? As the main character Mathieu deliberates on a lifechanging choice, the scourge of World War II threatens Paris and his way of life. But an inner battle rages, too (apologies for what may be too heavy-handed of a metaphor...) and Mathieu realizes a period of his life is coming to an end, no matter what his choice. The theme Sartre and de Beauvoir have in common? When men and women are free to make their own choices, we must sit helplessy by as they often make the wrong, wrong, wrong ones.Sartre and de Beauvoir both illuminated, to me, the principle that freedom is the goal. The choices humanity makes using that freedom can be devastating, but the option to make devastating choices is an irrefutable aspect of life, and, to my mind, is a very compelling one.I approached this novel by Sartre, after reading Nausea several years ago with some trepidation, but with determination after spending a lot of time on de Beauvoir. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The story was lifelike with a philosopher's vision and view, a slight aloofness that gives the reader a window not only to the life of Mathieu and his circle but also to Sartre's philosophies and carefully worked out beliefs."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Like many of his more philosophical works, Jean-Paul Sartre dealt with almost taboo (at least in the 40s) social issues on the Age of Reason, usch as abortion, concubinary, the quest for personal freedom, and the government. The Age of Reason does drag somewhat, since it's a good 300 pages long, but it's worth reading, since some of the parts in this book are very well-written and keeps you in suspense throughout the length of the book."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"To me, this is the French Great Gatsby. It's that good. Probably Sartre's most accessible work it still has a contemporary ring to it. It is in my top ten novels of all time.

I have read it 3 times and will read it again soon."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"The title of Jean-Paul Sartre's vividly realistic novel of Paris on the dawn of World War II refers to adults who have achieved sufficient maturity to accept responsibility for their actions. _The Age of Reason_ expertly weaves Sartre's philosophy of existentialism into a compelling story of people who desire freedom and responsibility but are extraordinarily incompetent.The American Heritage Dictionary defines existentialism as \\"a philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness and isolation of the individual experience in a hostile or indifferent universe...and stresses freedom of choice and responsibility for the consequences of one's acts.\\" Mathieu, the novel's lead character, is in his mid-thirties and proclaims that he would like nothing better than freedom but is curiously lacking in the necessary maturity. A penniless professor, he impregnates his girlfriend, Marcelle, then schemes to beg, borrow and steal to pay for her abortion. Mathieu even toys with the idea of marrying Marcelle. Mathieu is also in love with Ivich, a young woman whose self-inflicted wound Mathieu childishly emulates on a dare. Sartre's novel also contains a self-hating gay man, Daniel, who plans to save Marcelle, but only by further degrading himself and Mathieu in the process.Sartre's writing style is true to life, naturalistic, and is never less than totally engaging. With the author we visit various Paris nightclubs and bars which have just the right touch of darkness and sleaziness. Sartre's characters are hopeless but recognizably human. Lola, a sad, aging nightclub singer, deeply in love with the completely useless Boris (Ivich's younger brother) evokes strong sympathy nonetheless. Even Mathieu, as despicable as his conduct often is, believes by the end that he has finally \\"...attained the age of reason.\\""},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Its paradoxical, sardonic, satiric, and pedantic... its a glance into Sartre's life.

On the other hand, if the concept of Freedom is approached with good faith and an eye towards the chaos of stars, this is a dreary, depressing, godawfully tedious vision of the creative possibilities of freedom. With friends of freedom like this, who needs enemies? In my view, Nausea is a thousand times more powerful than this book, which despite its sometimes bleak tone, has more ambience and frankly more conceptual power, which makes it more affirmative. Of course the power of freedom includes the possibility of making bad choices ; how redundant. I'd rather see more monstrous choices. He could afford to be dark rather than dreary, surreal rather than realist in a dull fashion, and give us a sense of possibility : the possibilities for monstrous transformation. These are present in Nausea, where we get a sense of the world slipping from a man in order to open up an incredibly fertile chaos, and through this the possibility of losing the cage of humanism and discovering the beauty of insanity, our true nature, which gets covered over by the fetters of identity and roles with which we condition ourselves. This is the positive message of existentialism, one in which we lose our humanity not to discover an inhumane or poorly botched set of choices, but an alien consciousness whose botches are brilliant and full of surprise. These people's lives are boring and unexplorative ; they need to break loose from their stupid normality and discover the wildness of being. Maybe Sartre was on quaaludes when he wrote this ; in any case, I far prefer Nietzsche's existentialism to this tedium any day."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"My big problem with this book is that it is so ridiculously tendentious. That is, it so obviously serves as a mere vehicle for Sartre to get his &quot;existentialist&quot; (or whatever you may call them) ideas across. The characters are (purposefully, of course) insipid and full of a malaise that makes for plodding reading except for Sartre's most devoted recruits (and there are quite a few of them to judge from the reviews).All that really happens, so to speak, is that the book's protagonist, Mathieu, wanders around with acquaintances of various sorts (one can hardly call them friends or lovers, in any substantial sense of those terms) wondering what to do about the pregnancy of his mistress and how to finance her abortion.&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; ostensibly, as referred to in the book, indicates Mathieu's own age, 34, at which one is supposed to shift from a restless, Bohemian existence and settle down to responsibility. On the deeper, more ironic level, it is a prolonged sneer that the so called Age of Reason (whose French exemplars include Descartes and Voltaire among others) is now debunked and effete, and that we now know that (as shown by the characters in the novel) there is no real rhyme or reason behind men's actions. Man is not, &quot;the rational animal&quot; as Aristotle would have it, and the onset of WWII is there to prove it.As Mathieu puts it, &quot;Perhaps it's inevitable; perhaps one has to choose between being nothing at all and impersonating what one is. That would be terrible,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;it would mean that we were naturally bogus.&quot;The thing is that there's nothing particularly new or original even in the philosophy as spelled out above. Shakespeare said the same thing hundreds of years ago, &quot;All the World's a stage, and we are merely players.&quot;Simply put, I can't stand this sort of rot. Even the enthusiasts of Existentialism and the &quot;condemned to be free&quot; mantra have a hard time making sense of it and are still pathetically quibbling over what these terms mean.Look, if you want to read great French literature, read Proust. If you want to see the barren meaninglessness of life displayed in remoreseless detail, read just about anything by Paul Bowles.This book, as the main character says of himself, is a washout. If you think you're reading something profound here, you're fooling yourself...much as Sartre did."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"If this novel had been my only exposure to existentialist thought, I never would have considered the philosophy seriously. The characters in this novel are so obnoxious I'd feel more comfortable hanging out with Dick Cheney in a dungeon full of scorpions, and I feel sorry for anyone who identifies with them or knows people who are like them. Sartre intentionally makes the characters so hateable because he wants to show us the necessity of taking responsibility for one's freedom, but I'm not sure his point works; such people may decide that they willfully want to own up to their whimsically obnoxious ways.

Obviously the idea of freedom is subjective and Sartre certainly does not presume to have found the answer in absolute terms. He uses the protagonist, Mathieu, as well as the peripheral characters, to examine different view points; albeit, with mixed results. The Age of Reason can certainly be read as an independent novel, but if one is to truly understand Sartre's vision, it will be necessary to read the other works in the trilogy, The Reprieve and The Troubled Sleep. Both are excellent and follow up on the secondary characters that are first introduced in the Age of Reason. The three novels, known collectively as The Roads to Freedom, represent, to me, the most significant analysis of what freedom means to a given individual. It will force the reader to reexamine long cherished views and address their own concept of freedom. If you haven't been introduced to the writings of Sartre, The Age of Reason is an excellent starting point."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"the age of reason is the 1st book in a trilogy, roads to freedom. i have not yet read the next two books, but after this one, i plan to. this is an excellent novel.it is a thinking man's book not an action thriller. it's concepts are existential in nature and deal specifically with the concept of freedom.the story, which covers only a few days in the the life of character mathieu in 1938 france, deals with mathieu's obsession with his personal freedom. he has just been informed of the unwanted pregnancy of his girlfriend. i personally did not see the pending war as a significant element in the story. it is there, but does not drive the quest for freedom. this is most likely picked up in the later novels. as mathieu searches for funds to abort the child, we meet his friends. all of them have hidden personal problems of their own. the results of this quest and the resolution of his problem make up the storyline.the interesting issue is the understanding of freedom. what does mathieu think about it in the beginning and how does that change as he reaches the age of reason.the story is best summed up in mathieu's comment near the end:\\"i don't know what i would give to do something irrevocable.\\"this is a book that raises amazing questions and has the potential of changing your life."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Mathieu Delarue, a 34-year old philosophy professor, has led his life so that he has maintained complete freedom, which he defines as closing off no possibilities in his future. This makes philosophical sense to Mathieu, who wants his freedom in place, if and when he is required to perform a great act of conscience or begin a mission of self-fulfillment. It's 1938 and going to Spain to fight the Fascists has been tempting but not quite right. Meanwhile, Mathieu remains interested in the life of Gauguin, who, in his forties, left a Sunday-painter's life in France to become a great painter in Tahiti.While Mathieu has lofty philosophical ideas, the effect of his freedom, he admits, has been to \\"dexterously construct an undistinguished but solid happiness upon the basis of inertia and to justify himself from time to time on the highest moral grounds.\\" He is, in the words of other characters, a small-time government official, a solid member of the bourgeoisie, and a person whose relationship with Marcelle, his long-time girlfriend, is indistinguishable from a marriage.Then, Marcelle becomes pregnant and Mathieu, who wastes his money drinking with students in bars, has to choose. Will there be an abortion, enabling Mathieu to preserve his so-called freedom? Or, will Mathieu marry Marcelle and basically recognize the nature of the prosaic life he has made?Then, add to this dynamic an evil and manipulative friend who resents Mathieu's bogus sense of freedom, a childish female student who has come to represent freedom in Mathieu's mind, and a lack of money to pay for a safe abortion. The effect of this literary concoction is an absolutely great and riveting tale, where Mathieu comes to terms with his illusions and responsibilities. And, it has a surprise ending!But say you don't like novels in which a protagonist confronts the nature and limits of his or her life? Then, read THE AGE OF REASON anyway, simply to enjoy Sartre's amazing writing. In this case, read with a ready eye for his numerous descriptions of light in Paris or for his amazing facility with similes and metaphors. You're only in Chapter 1, for example, when you read:\\"Her mouth snapped out the last words: a varnished mauve-tinted mouth, like a crimson insect intent upon devouring that ashen visage.\\"\\"She collapsed on to his shoulder, sobbed a little, but she did not cry. It was all the she could allow herself: a rainless storm.\\"A great book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Having already read *The Reprieve,* I have now finished two-thirds of Sartre's \\"Roads to Freedom\\" trilogy--that's over 800 pages--and I cannot wait to begin the third volume...that's how compelling I find these novels. It's difficult to explain their appeal. In *The Age of Reason,* a philosophy professor discovers his lover is pregnant and spends the next two days frantically trying to raise enough money for an abortion. His life zigzags haphazardly through a rich cast of characters whose stories and intertwined fates--complex, tragic, absurd--continue in the next volume.What Sartre does is immerse us in the struggles of these characters as they each attempt to define and make sense of their lives...this struggle informed, of course, by the existential principles of Sartre's own philosophy. What Sartre does so well in *The Age of Reason* is to portray the psychological torment of men and women under even fairly ordinary circumstances. Here is the quiet drama of consciousness, the sufferings of daily life...at least as it is experienced by those who give it any thought.What does it mean to be free--to have a life that means something? These are the questions that obsess Mathieu as he runs into one dead-end after another in his search for the abortion fee and at the same time wallows in a hopeless erotic obsession with a self-destructive young female student. All the distinctive trappings of a French existential novel are here--the drinking, the brooding, the caf&eacute;'s, the jazz bars, the intellectual dissection of every act and motive, the relentless self-analysis...it's a riveting read if you don't require a lot of explosions, kidnappings, and sordid murders to entertain you.Unlike his stylistic experimentation in *The Reprieve,* Sartre narrates *The Age of Reason* in a traditional, straightforward style, but it's no less briskly-paced; if anything, there is a higher pitch of emotional intensity in this novel and less ennui than in *The Reprieve.* Its not absolutely necessary to read *The Age of Reason* first, I didn't, but I would definitely recommend doing so, as it enriches vastly your understanding of the characters in the second book.As I mentioned in my review of *The Reprieve,* I can hardly believe that the Sartre of *Being and Nothingness* fame was capable of writing in such a lively and entertaining manner, *Nausea* aside. So this series has so far come as one of the most pleasant literary surprises I've had in years. If the French, their philosophy, or existentialism appeal to you at all--or just a good novel about interesting characters facing the void within life--then I'd unreservedly recommend you take a look at *The Age of Reason.*"},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"I feel out of my league reading the thoughtful and well-informed reviews provided for this novel, but still desire to add my own thoughts. I read this first when I was 18, and I do not purport to have any great knowledge of the philosophy of Sartre. It is several years later and over the course of my college career I have picked it up time and again to read a chapter or two.I am unsure of whether or not this book is a mere front for Sartre's philosophy--I do know it is a sort of fictional application of Being and Nothingness--but what continues to drive me back to this book is the sheer power of the narrative. Only in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man have I found such an encyclopedic representation of human struggle and motivation in twentieth century literature.While I am no true student of philosophy, I have no use for a thinker who cannot provide an accurate depiction of the real world. If they are not presenting reality properly, they are not observing it properly. Sartre seems to be a man with an immense mind and a remarkable pen. Although his conclusion grates with my own feelings about life, I respect his standpoint because the journey towards the conclusion portrayed a world with such real pain and such familiar people that I cannot help but be moved."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Jean-Paul seems like such a likeable character. Especially towards his later years, when he became quite politically active in anti-colonial issues. But a lot of his early work is inconsistent. This novel, the first of a trilogy, was written leading up to and during the second world war, and is a compelling portrait of a parisian bourgeois as the shadows of fascism grew longer. This bourgeois professor, mathieu, fancies himself a prime actor in his own life, a man free to act as he chooses because he doesn't have any illusions. But that is his worst illusion. He is 35 years old and acts like a modern spoiled american university student. He can't commit to anything, whether it be to head to spain to fight against franco, marry his pregnant mistress or demand that she have an abortion, or act decisively enough to win the heart of his OTHER girlfriend, a spoiled early 20's russian emigre.SO the whole novel passes with us watching these spoiled bourgeois lunk-heads wander around and do nothing with all their vaunted freedom.But That's the point. As you get into the trilogy more, you see that mathieu's problem is that his life is unbearably light, to steal from Kundera here. And it is Kundera's \\"unbearable lightness of being\\" that provides a great insight into what Sartre is getting at here. Our freedom as human beings comes into play when we make choices, not avoid them.So, I recommend this book, but stick it out because this first volume is tough at times. The characters herein are all fools. But they are all learning to act, and as Hitler draws closer, you can see they now know that they will HAVE to make a choice in the near future.And after you read these three volumes, read Kundera's book, which is about a lot of the same issues but is a lot more humane and sexy too. Say what you want about Sartre but he wasn't really a sexy writer. In fact he kind of reminds me of wallace shawn in \\"manhattan.\\" But that's another story."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"This work discerns Sartre in his element. Reason characterizes the modern age: through reason, we abstract our realities, turn away from experience and into the \\"cognitive\\", \\"mental\\" field, and consequently loose our grounding.This novel is a phenomenological journey into the absurdities of life; through it, we delve into the mood of the times: one in which anxiety towers over our very Being, one in which anxiety is the primordial mood in which we dwell. Anxiety, a consequence of Being turning (into) \\"pure abstract\\" Thought, reminds us that without a full acknowledgment of our \\"being-in-the-world\\", we remain homeless, uprooted, fearful of that which is. We value the \\"supersensuous\\" over the sensuous, \\"mind\\" over \\"body\\", and as such, loose sight of our concrete existence and meaning-making possibilities.Through strikingly insightful \\"experiential\\" writing (i.e., descriptive, not explanatory), Sartre, dare we understand him, engenders in us a despair at our current state (and many who do not \\"like\\" Sartre use this as a defense of their position: he is too dreary, too \\"depressing\\"). Yet if we choose to listen carefully we observe that nothing he says is out of the ordinary, out of touch with our own experiences: rather, his descriptions sound at least vaguely familiar, attentive as they are to the nature of commonplace Being itself.This is not only a masterful philosophical work (though certainly not by some philosophers' definitions of philosophy), but a beautifully written art work as well. The two belong together in Sartre's case; this becomes clear when one considers that to obtain a truly powerful description of that which is, language must be attended to deeply and fully."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"It's always puzzled me that this book gets so little attention when Nausea is so acclaimed -- and even Nausea gets trashed by many of the more academic critics. I read a series of interviews with Sartre at one point, after all of his major books were a ways behind him, and he himself did not seem to consider the Roads to Freedom trilogy of particular significance or importance. I find this puzzling because the Age of Reason is one of the best novels I have ever read. It is more of a story than Nausea (and more of a story than its sequels, from what I've read of them), and, well -- it's just incredible. The psychological accuracy and moral neutrality with which Sartre places himself, and the reader, in each character's shoes, is remarkable; the existential &quot;adventure&quot; of the book is intoxicating, and there are some simply incredible moments. As with anything Sartre writes, it is a bit self-indulged, and the characters will not appeal to everyone, but personally, I found this an incredibly rewarding book; it left me feeling giddy."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"Sartre's characters are shallow, self-centered worms bent on self-destruction. However, because of a broad streak of narcissism, they are unable or unwilling to do significant harm to themselves. As a consequence, they turn their destructive ambitions toward their unsuspecting, but nevertheless deserving, acquaintances. Each character is deluded in the belief that he or she is seeking some noble objective, for example Mathieu's quest for ultimate freedom, while in fact settling for cheap self-indulgence at others' expense. These characters are irredeemable and certainly not worthy of the several hours required to read Sartre's novel. One wonders which character, if not each of them, represents Sartre's alter ego."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"This is the first volume of the trilogy entitled \\"Roads to Freedom.\\" The other two volumes, in English, are entitledThe Reprieve: A NovelandTroubled Sleep: A Novel. The trilogy concerns the lives of a variety of French people over a period of two years, 1938-40, which covered the lead up to, and France's disastrous defeat at the hands of Germany in the Second World War. I first read the trilogy some 40 years ago, and was exceedingly impressed with Sartre's power as a novelist, and a chronicler of the human condition. I was most impressed with the middle volume, started with it on this re-read, and was not disappointed. I'd advise the first time reader to tackle them in order. Although they can be read independently, there will be a much deeper understanding of the characters if one \\"begins at the beginning.\\"And the beginning in this case is the summer of 1938. The novel's motive force is a wanted/unwanted pregnancy, which precipitates a \\"mid-life crisis,\\" in both principal characters: Professor of Philosophy, Mathieu Delarue and his long-term \\"partner,\\" Marcelle Duffet. There are several other major characters, including two young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, the brother and sister, Boris and Ivich. Boris has a significant relationship with a woman roughly twice his age, a nightclub singer, Lola. Ivich fears that she has just failed her exams, which will necessitate a return to her home in the detested provincial town of Laon, and seeks solace from Mathieu, with results that are not necessarily predictable. There is also Jacques, Mathieu's bourgeois lawyer brother, and Sarah, who is married to the artist Gomez, who left the Parisian life to fight in the Spanish Civil War. And there is the homosexual, Daniel, who feels that the \\"mark of Cain\\" is upon him. Another character, Bruet, asks Mathieu to join the Communist Party, when it seemed like such a sensible choice, save for the necessity of following \\"the party line.\\"Mathieu and Marcelle had previously agreed that if there was an \\"accident\\" she would get an abortion. Ah, the theory, but there is much \\"right to life\\" queasiness when the \\"accident\\" is no longer theoretical. And then, alas, as the seemingly unlimited choices of youth become more circumscribed, was it really an \\"accident\\"? For so many of us who have been through the realization of middle age, Mathieu's summation of Marcelle's position resonates: \\"Her last chance\\"...\\"Between thirty and forty, people staked on their last chance.\\"Even though in his 30's, and a Professor, Mathieu does not have the money to pay for an abortion that would be properly performed, and thus the spectra of a \\"back-alley butcher\\" hangs in the background if he cannot borrow the money. He makes the rounds, from Daniel, who has the money but claims he does not, to his brother, Jacques. Sartre deftly sums up Jacques, as being in the \\"older but wiser\\" category, and if he was an American, would have become a Republican: \\"Jacques was very proud of his youth... for five years he has assiduously aped all the fashionable dissipations, he had dallied with surrealism, conducted a few agreeable love-affairs, and occasionally, before making love, he had inhaled ethyl chloride from a handkerchief.\\" But now, ah: \\"...what is bohemianism, after all? It was amusing enough a hundred years ago, but today it is simply a name for a handful of eccentrics who are no danger to anybody and have missed the train.\\" Mathieu retorts that \\"your age of reason is the age of resignation.\\" Later he debates with himself: \\"Marry her, you shoddy bohemian, marry her, you have reached the age of reason, you must marry her.\\"And does the \\"resignation\\" come for Mathieu, as it does for all of us? \\"...he had finished the day, and he had also finished with his youth...disillusioned epicureanism, smiling tolerance, resignation, flat seriousness, stoicism-- all the aids whereby a man may savor, minute by minute, like a connoisseur, the failure of a life.\\"The reader knows, unlike the characters, that all these concerns of bohemianism and the bourgeois would soon be swept away, first placed in abeyance by the \\"reprieve\\" of the week of the Munich agreement in the fall of '38, and then finally by the fall of France in 1940. This volume lacks the stylistic brilliance of \\"The Reprieve\\" and has a few nightclub scenes that \\"drag,\\" so I'd only rate it as 4.5-stars, rounded up."},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","review":"I'd love this Paul Sartre tail because I'm 30 and I became to see the world in a diferent way.

Add to this annoying stylistic tendency a career in philosophy, and you have the makings of a literary disaster on the order of Jean-Paul Sartre's THE AGE OF REASON. Amazingly, this book is the first of a trilogy - one can hardly imagine what treats follow this opening volume.The story takes place in Paris (naturally) over a two-day period in the summer of 1938, as the Spanish Civil War rages and Europe sits on the precipice of Hitler's war of conquest. The shadow of world war is undoubtedly intended to add meaning and import to the story, but only ends up with a Jew in 1938 referring to concentration camps. Matthieu Delarue, a professor perpetually short of funds has enjoyed a seven-year relationship with a woman of questionable repute named Marcelle who has unexpectedly become pregnant. Matthieu unilaterally decides that abortion is the only appropriate response and sets out on a quest of sorts to obtain the necessary funds. Revolving around Matthieu during these two days are Matthieu's sycophantic student Boris Serguine and his borderline paranoid schizophrenic sister Ivich, Boris's clinging, almost-over-the-hill dancer/girlfriend Lola, and Matthieu's long-time acquaintances Daniel and Brunet. They spend most of their time visiting one another, seeking cheap thrills (shoplifting, petty larceny, drowning cats, or cutting themselves just for the sensation), eating, drinking, dancing, taking drugs, loathing themselves and each other, and generally looking down on everyone else around them. As a group, the characters are thoroughly unlikable, either whiny narcissists or pompous didacts (or both), the best fate for whom would be the suicides they seem to dwell upon so endlessly. No wonder the Nazis overran France in a matter of weeks.The ostensible theme of THE AGE OF REASON is personal freedom, but as it plays out for Sartre, being free apparently means having no guiding principles, assuming no responsibility for one's actions, committing to nothing, and sacrificing nothing for another person or a greater cause than oneself. Presenting a group of characters who see themselves as free but are paralyzed by inaction and chained by their own self-doubts is rather an obvious form of irony. The only halfway likable character is Daniel, a homosexual who breaks sufficiently free of his chains to \\"come out\\" to Matthieu, expresses genuine concern for another human being's welfare, tries to guide Matthieu toward the morally correct course of action, and ultimately takes responsibility for another person's future well-being.Matthieu's life \\"hemmed him in...it had a vague and hesitant purpose, a kind of insistent futility, a smell of dust and violets...'I have led a toothless life,' he thought. A toothless life. I have never bitten into anything....What's to be done? Break the shell? That's easily said. Besides, what would remain? A little viscous bit of rubber, oozing through the dust and leaving a glistening trail behind it....And suddenly, above his besmirched body...there hovered a pure consciousness, a consciousness without ego, no more than a mere puff of warm air; there it hovered, in the semblance of a look, it viewed the shoddy bohemian, the petty bourgeois clamped into his comforts, the futile intellectual,...the listless dreamer immersed in his flaccid life, and the verdict of that consciousness was: \`The fellow is a wash-out and deserves his fate.'\\"If you can stand the prospect of 400 pages of this and worse, then by all means, go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you. Sartre's \\"explorations\\" of personal freedom take place within the psyches of an insufferable group of utterly unrealistic characters.By the end of the novel Mattieu claims he has truly \\"attained the age of reason,\\" and most readers will have reached a state of exasperation if they haven't completely lost their minds and turned suicidal.Having disgorged this diarrhetic stream of unremitting despair and despondency, it comes as little surprise that Sartre had earlier written a first novel fittingly titled NAUSEA. The big surprise is learning that he was chosen for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964; what WERE they thinking? Naturally, Sartre turned it down -- how truly French to disdain a Nobel Prize.I approached this book optimistically, on the assumption that a philosopher of Sartre's stature would have some interesting philosophical insights to render in a fictional form. Regretably, I find it impossible to offer any good reason to read THE AGE OF REASON. I'll take Malcolm Lowry's UNDER THE VOLCANO or Paul Bowles any time over this. One star for the story, a second star in recognition of Sartre's intellectual reputation and his forwardness in 1947 to write frankly about abortions, prostitution, homosexuality, and drugs (even as he was horribly stereotyping blacks and Jews - hey, nobody's perfect)."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Civilization","review":"Einstein was not the Person of the 20th Century. Not by a long shot. Albert Schweitzer wins that distinction hands down. In the 20th and 21st century, too much emphasis has been placed on the relationship between technological advances and the corresponding impact on society. Schweitzer simply transcended achievement by weaving a legacy of the most accomplished Renaissance Man in the last 200 years. Combining intellectual brilliance and an amazing thirst for humanitarian service, Schweitzer simply made the world a much better place. He accomplished more in one life time than anyone I can think of.The Philosophy of Civilization is a monument. This was Schweitzer's labor of love, and predictably, he produced yet another masterpiece. Reading Schweitzer should be required reading in philosophy, humanities, and religious studies at all universities and colleges in America. He should be the standard by which all GLOBAL thought is measured."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Civilization","review":"This book should be more widely known.

We are located near Plymouth and I read this as a prelude to our class trip to Plimoth Plantation.It was interesting and gave some good insights into life in Plymouth in 1626. However, there were a couple of glaring errors. The boy in the story spoke of a visit from Squanto. This would have been impossible since Squanto died in 1622. Also, the author refers to the Pilgrims as Puritans in two or three different places in the story. The Pilgrims who came here for religious reasons refered to themselves as &quot;Saints.&quot; The Puritans came to Massachusetts in 1630. The author should also explain, in the story, why March 25th was considered to be &quot;New Year's Day.&quot; On March 25th, the date in the journal changed from 1626 to 1627.The artwork was very interesting, presented in the form of woodcuts. This was tied into the story as the boy telling the story was making these woodcuts.It's an interesting story and very informative. I would recommend this book to anyoe who would like to see what life was like in &quot;Olde Plimoth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Stranded at Plimoth Plantation 1626","review":"Superbly illustrated with masterful woodcuts, Stranded at Plimouth Plantation is a thoroughly researched account of everyday life on the Plimouth Plantation.The journal of Christopher Sears, a 13-year-old orphan who is stranded after a shipwreck, is the starting point for this story of courage and excitement.An apt lesson in history for young readers."},{"Title":"Stranded at Plimoth Plantation 1626","review":"I gave this to my 7 year old neice, MacKenzie Catherine. She told me that in first grade they had studied George Washington and The American Revolution. I asked her if the names John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, or Sam Adams meant anything to her. She replied no, but I have heard their names before. In my opinion to truly appreciate the sacrifices early Americans made in the development of the United States, you must go back at least to the Pilgrims and their initial landing at Plymouth Rock. How they lived and literally survived on a shoe string writes volumes about our founders and what they held true. It was worship and the seperation of state from religion.

The startling revelations made by Mustafa Khar's wife, Tehmina, are almost too horrifying to believe. However, surprisingly, this battered wife who claims to have suffered so much pain does not evoke any sympathy from me which I believe she tried to seek. The story is about a pakistani politician who brutally abused his wives, who wrongfully used Islamic law to his advantage and at the same time committed sins such as adultary, and even conducted an affair with his wife's sister. However, Tehmina herself got involved with Mustafa Khar while she was still married and she also broke up Mustafa Khar's marriage with his former wife. The book does not arouse as much curiosity as it should, and towards the end begins to command even less attention from the reader. The book does not deserve more than a 5"},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"When I read this book, at first, and really through the end, I kept thinking of how long she could use the &quot;childhood trauma&quot; excuse for her actions. There comes a time when you (and according to her book, she did) question yourself about why you are doing these things to your children, why you let it happen to you. These upper elite members of Pakistan have paved the way downhill for this country. What many don't realize is that many many politicians ruling pakistan come from this fuedal background. Basically red neck hill billies trying to run the nation. Is it so surprising Pakistan doesn't get far?To add to it, the line continues. Mustaffa Khar has a son mentioned in this book, Bilal Khar, who is the most vile piece of trash next to his father on earth. Just put his name into google.com and you'll see his article and &quot;medals of achievement&quot;. He married a woman, whom he threw acid on her face and ruined her for life. And now he is actively one of the ruling parties of Pakistan. Go figure that one out.Its a damn shame that the men don't get a clue. Its even more of a shame that Islam has been so twisted. Its a far cry from the Islam that was brought to this world where women where professionals, regarded as equals. Its not enough to read translations of the Quran, you have to research the arabic used in that era. That's where you'll find the truth that is hidden from a male dominated society.I don't have any sympathy for a woman who can subject her children to such treatment, especially with child in her womb and still go back to this monster. I know the hold is great, but she did manage to break free, didn't she? Maybe she should have earlier.Too many messed up kids make messed up lives, marry messed up people, and they have messed up kids..and somehow all of these people are in the Pakistani government. What a shame.So how much good is Tehmina doing now a days for her &quot;cause&quot;? Does she have a grassroots organization? Or is she just writing books, getting the publicity and living off the money. Sound familiar? The book has alot of drama in it, suspense too, but you have to realize it was crafted that way. Its an eye opening read, and good for discussion but I don't know how much good it does the women of this world to buy this book. Rent it from the library and donate the money you would have used to buy it to an organization that helps women like LearningPartership.org."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"I thought &quot;My Feudal Lord&quot; was about a woman trying to divorce her abusive husband in a strict Muslim society. That's what the cover had me believe and that's what I wanted to read about. Instead I got poorly written babble - so poorly written that I didn't finish this book. Tehmina left a kind husband and her daughter for Mustafa - and she expects me to feel sympathetic when Mustafa forces her new family into excile in England! She turns her eldest daughter away THREE times - and then moans about travelling every day to visit her husband in prison. She had THREE chances to leave her abusive husband, and each time she returned. I wanted to shake some sense into this woman who, the 3rd time, returned to her husband because their 'political destinies were so closely linked'. I think her political aspirations and need to be associated with a powerful man overshadowed the physical damage her husband did to her. I won't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"Yes, the &quot;horrific&quot; Mustafa Khar is indeed a scoundrel, as the book depicts him to be. But within her shallow attempt to galvanize reader support, Tehmina fails to convince us that she deserves anything more than a medal for B grade tabloid literature. Ms. Durrani screams for pity, forgetting that her reputation and conduct too, have been to date, questionable. To the western readers' delight, I can imagine how a &quot;Pakistani woman's plight&quot; might simultaneously incite and propel an anti-feudal mentality, however a few things have gone unaccounted for...such as any real message between the covers. The novel is nothing more than an account of a failed marriage, between a terrible husband and an ungifted author. In any case, it has done little to further destroy two already shatterred reputuation."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"This book was the first recommended to me by a male friend in Pakistan when I visited there last year. Although not a new bestseller, it provides context for understanding Pakistan. Beware--it is not upbeat, but I found it thoroughly enlightening and helpful."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"This book is about Tehmina Durrani's life as an oppressed wife of a feudal lord, and politician in Pakistan. My Feudal Lord covers her adult life from 1974 to 1994. Tehmina's unique writing style of nothing but the truth, even if it is hard to bare, is what makes this book such an amazing read. The abuse and the pain that Tehmina went through for thirteen years is unbelievable, she truly is a women of great strength and bravery. This story unravels many complicated issues that Tehmina had to deal with, and it revealed the true character of Mustafa Khar. Tehmina Durrani wrote this book to break the \\"traditional silence\\" that is expected of divorced women in Pakistan. She is the first women in Pakistan to write the truth about Pakistan's parliament, feudal system, Islamic beliefs, and women's rights. This book caused further problems with her family, whom she has decided to disown and disinherit, along with the Pakistani peoples belief about their political leaders. Women's rights is a major problem in many countries, Pakistan being one of them, hopefully this book will make people more aware of this constant problem... like it has done for me."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"Yes, this book is dramatic and soap opera-like. It does not do much for the image of Pakistan and its government.However, I found this book to be an inspiring and eye opening account of what women can be forced to endure - all for the sake of culture and/or religion. Many seem to be disappointed with Tehmina's lack of action and regrettable actions prior to her marriage to Khar. However the book is an autobiographical account and should be accepted as the life experience of this woman. I can only imagine how hard it was for Ms. Durrani to put into words her pain.My only problem was the non-chronological order of the book. That was very confusing...but in no way diminishes the message and gravity of what was brought to light in this novel. I have recommended this book to all my close friends and family. As a woman, it was fantasticallly liberating to read about Ms. Durrani's extraordinary experiences and growth during her lifetime. If this book were not out of print, I would gift it to many more friends."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"The events of Tehmina Durrani's life only confirms, but to a much worse degree, what we talked in class and read about family violence, especially spousal abuse. It is one of the most potential threat(s?) to the survival of mankind. In Pakistan, the violence can over spill in the form of family feuds.In my view, the best way to combat against this violence is for the battered to take stand and for the society to support him or her. Society as a whole resents such violence. Another important thing we need to do is educate ourselves more about the needs and desires of our partners in the family context. Only through good understanding can we eliminate this immoral behavior.The second issue I would like to touch upon is how women are treated in Pakistan. This behavior has its roots in history. There was a time when society considered the birth of a girl a crime by her mother. The signs of this treatment are felt in an Eastern expression, &quot;You are a true father only when you have a daughter.&quot; Instead of considering her a blessing from God just like boys, she is considered a burden the father has to carry for the rest of his life, even after she is married.If a girl is born in poverty, she is destined to become a servant one day, that of her mother or her husband. In educated households, girls are better off but never considered equal to boys. Therefore, the treatment they receive is often unfair: they rarely have the same opportunities when it comes to education, employment or marriage.In the rural areas of Pakistan, where the feudal system still prevails, this situation is ten times worse. Even educated feudal lords do not allow education to enter the flourishing minds of their daughters for fear of rebellion, or the nourishment of new, threatening ideas. They are not allowed to express their feelings or leave the walls of their homes. As a result, they rarely develop complete personalities or individual identities. The lords treat village women with contempt. They are taught ! about male dominance from their birth. They are not to leave the side of their husband except when he is in a coffin. Even then, widows are not respected by the society.Contrary to the popular belief, another type of feudal lord exists. He is an honest, caring and loving man. His family is respected for its dignity, not its fear. He hold liberal views, therefore he tries to provide equal opportunities to all his people. This is the model other lords should adopt. Sadly, he is on the list of endangered species. If only other lords would realize that people in villages are educated now. They respect when respected. They would make a very positive impact on the culture if they changed for the good. The common man's \`izaat (respect)' would be safe and he would be happy to serve his so-called masters. The oppressors must remember that this domination will not last forever. Rebellion is second nature to the oppressed. Although might crush it, it is contagious.My advice would be to educate our people not only in the dealings of the world, but that of our great religion Islam too. Islam talks in great detail about how we should treat women with utmost respect. We must learn from our past experiences as well as Islam so that we can improve ourselves.The book &quot;My Feudal Lord&quot; is a milestone for the cause of women in Pakistan. It should be recognized as a stepping stone for building a better society for women, who are our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. If these women practice patience, this should not lead to their exploitation. To quote Asma Jhangir form the Forward of the book, &quot;Freedom of expression is guaranteed by law to all - yet traditions and customs conspire to silence them (iii).&quot;"},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"I read this book during my flight from WA to Orlando,FL.

People who have felt this book was internally inconsistent and were confused by Tehmina's willingness to repeatedly reconcile with Khar, obviously don't understand the traumatic effects of physical spousal abuse or the social stigma divorce carries in a country like Pakistan. This book is not about extra-marrital affairs or adultory as some reviewers contemptuously try to paint it. It is about the struggle and eventual triumph of a victim against astonishing odds. Tehmina's tale will be a source of inspiration to many victims of spousal abuse in the world.

Even well educated, highly placed, powerful men do not care about the fate of women. They are treated as objects of pleasure and of having no intrinsic value as human beings.If this is what is happening in contemparory Pakistan, amongst educated classes and the ruling elite, what chance do ordinary common women have for living a decent life.Another human aspect, which is not unique to muslims, is the jealosy of a mother for her daughter. The younger sister having an illicit affair with Tehmina's husband. The mother hates Tehmina so much that she becomes blind to this atrocity, of one sister breaking up the marriage of her elder sister.The book as awhole is a powerful commentary on the politics and life in Pakistan and in general, in most Islamic Republics."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"Tehmina Durrani has received both acclaim and flak for writing this book.

As a result there may be an inherent bias in this review.But that's not what this book is about, this is about a woman who was stuck in an abusive marriage. There is no doubt that Tehmina Durrani suffered at the hands of Mustafa Khar, her second husband, and no woman should live in fear of domestic violence. However, I couldn't get past the fact that she cheated on her first husband and left him and her children for Khar who was a known philanderer - his marriage to Durrani would be his sixth.What made her think he would change his ways? What did she find attractive in a monster like Khar? Why did she leave her first husband?The answers to these questions can be found within the book but I didn't find them very satisfying. As a result, I found it hard to reconcile the Tehmina of the second half of the book with the Tehmina we are introduced to at the start.This is a sad and shocking story. It's not well-written but the first half is definitely a page-turner. Some people have said that parts of it may have been exaggerated but domestic abuse is domestic abuse: it's wrong, no matter how far it goes.The problem here is why should I feel sorry for her when she knew this guy was sick and twisted? All the warning signs were there but she ignored them. She even befriended Khar's wife and witnessed the kind of life she was living but that wasn't enough either. The whole first half I felt like screaming, \\"Don't do it! Please, don't do it!\\", so when she does I found it hard to sympathise with her.Don't get me wrong, I'm not condoning Khar's behaviour. The point I'm trying to make is that she let herself fall for him. No matter what the circumstances were, if she was a self-respecting woman she would not have gotten involved with a misogynistic sadist like that man. This wasn't a teenager or a young woman, she had a husband, children, a family that supported her. There were no good reasons to go for Khar.Many Pakistani women have held her up as a hero. I too think her work at exposing abuse has been both noble and necessary in a culture that encourages women to conceal their hurt to protect their husbands.My other concern with this book is the political angle. We are introduced to a lot of prominent Pakistani politicians in the book and we see the circles they move in. These people are so far removed from the average Pakistani it makes me furious to think that they've stayed in power this long.By keeping the public uninformed in the right territories, they can keep repeating the lies and no one remembers or cares."},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","review":"It was a very captivating book.

It is indeed very courageous of the author to come out honestly and admit a lot of things which even men in the West would have a hard time to do. My main critique to the book is that it is unsubstantiated by evidence when allegations are made.

She claimed to be miserable living with him, and yet she went back to her tormentor time and again.I couldn't stand reading about him abusing her - it made me sick to the stomach that she endured it in silence. I understand that Pakistani society had constraints, but how Tehmina managed to keep up the facade is beyond me.By the time she finally divorced her husband the novelty of leaving Mustafa had worn out.

Second, take with a big cynical grain of salt the other two-star reviewer, who claims this subject's been exhausted.Really? When a radical right compound with guns and explosives was uncovered near Tyler, Texas, less than two years ago? When, in his epilogue, Levitas documents radical rightists cheering the 9/11 result, if not the actors? When Border Patrol wannabes of the Minuteman Project appear to be not too many steps away from radical rightists? Levitas could easily have written another 200 pages and not exhausted this subject.As long as there is a highly armed radical right in America, with a core of anti-Semitism above all else, as long as conspiracy theorists can get the ear of Congress or even still occasionally get elected to it, this subject will NEVER be exhausted.That said, I was on the 4/5 borderline for this book, but went with a 5-star rating in part to offset those other two.This book does NOT, to me, require huge amounts of previous knowledge. That said, a few things could have been explained better, such as the creation and use of Fractional Reserve Checks, and what exactly triggered DePugh to start the Minutemen.That said, Levitas does do a good job of longitudinally tracking the rise of many modern rightist movements, whether various state militias, Christian Identity groups, the remnants of the Posse Comitatus movement, their interlinking, and how their growth has been triggered by social problems.Contrary to the right-wing troll reviewer, Levitas DOES give a sympathetic portrait of how many people -- notably Midwestern farmers -- got hit by a variety of problems in the mid-70s and '80s. BUT, BUT, BUT, as Levitas also shows, progressive farmers eventually recognized that the majority of the American Agricultural Movement was buying racist/conspiracy theory bilge hook, line and sinker, and the then shows how PROGRESSIVE-minded farmers allied with unions also hurt by the farm crisis, and even Jesse Jackson, in an attempt to find progressive, NON-VIOLENT answers to their problems.In short, contrary to the troll reviewer, nobody FORCED these farmers to swallow anti-Semitic bilge; nobody FORCED them to believe that \\"Fractional Reserve Checks\\" would actually work; nobody FORCED them to not pay their taxes; or anything else. Those farmers that chose to do these things exactly did that -- they CHOSE to follow in the footsteps of the radical right.That, again shows that this subject has not been exhausted. Levitas predicts that beyond the anti-Semitic core, the radical right will morph and morph as it finds necessary.Give this book a careful read. And see how large chunks of America are, sadly, not that enlightened."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.

He has sources that I've never seen cited before, and in every sense of the word primary resources. Sometimes I wonder exactly how he got them. Just joking, but more seriously, his book may provide insight rare to the topic. However, his writing can be boring at times. On the other hand, he is a nice author and will probably send you a scanned copy of his sources as he did with me upon request. Bottom line is it's worth getting, but beware it reads like a dry history book at some points."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"Examine the review by \\"dixiedivine\\", which shows a much surer understanding than the author of this book ever will that \\"hate\\" derives and grows from genuine issues. The author essentially attempts to link, lump AND BLAME: 1) rural residents who have seen their livelihoods destroyed by international free trade, corporatism, incredible rates of combined federal, state and local income, property and sales taxes (50%+ for the middle class) and government regulation; 2) strong Christians who still read in their Bibles that homosexuals should be put to death; 3) urban white men driven to near-madness by an inability to defend their women and children from crime in the streets and in the schools; 4) urban (and now suburban) families who cannot afford to send their kids to decent private schools; 5) people \\"full of hate\\" for being denied a job, college placement, or a scholarship because they were a member of the \\"privileged\\" white race, etc.C'mon, folks! A little common sense! There are millions on the left who \\"hate\\" their government whenever it is lead by anyone other than a social program Democrat - aren't they as much \\"terrorists\\" as someone who mistrusts their government from a populist perspective? There are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of Europeans that frankly \\"hate\\" the government of the U.S. Are they all terrorists? Wouldn't one admit that perhaps 20-25% of African-Americans despise their government's police forces? That's 5 million potential terrorists, I guess! And doesn't the mass media show a genuine contempt, i.e., hatred, for strongly assertive Christianity? Doesn't that make the media terroristic? I guess hatred of \\"those that hate\\" is fundamentally O.K. - if not a social good, and no one sees the inherent contradiction in it being \\"good\\" to hate the haters!The utter and complete failure of the left (here represented by the author) to understand that not only the \\"right-wing haters\\" but TENS OF MILLIONS of their compatriots, sympathizers, empathizers, whatever you call them, regard: 1) excessive (by at least half!) taxation of the middle class; 2) much of popular culture as sold by the mass media; 3) court-mandated tolerance of \\"every diversity of perversity\\"; 4) essentially court-mandated inferior public schools, etc., to ALL represent terrorist acts committed on a daily basis against the American nuclear family...turns their analysis of our nation's future into pure drivel."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"I realize there are mixed reviews here, but my aim was to learn more about domestic terrorism.

Of course, I balance the perspective with many other books/blogs/sources, but I did find this book to be helpful to my research."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"The Terrorist Next Door is an outstanding book and I can personally vouch for some of the information presented by Mr. Levitas. His sources are all cited and the book presents a lot of information and events that many people have never heard of.I grew up in Nebraska during the 1980's in the middle of the farming crisis. My father was heavily involved in the Sheriff's Posse Comitatus movement and he was also a sovereign citizen. I remember the Rulo torture murders and the Arthur Kirk shootout. I remember when the Treasury Department moved in and seized a my father's friend's farm and tractor dealership in Columbus, Nebraska in 1985.This book is spot on regarding the patriot movement and how it is full of bigotry and antisemitism. I remember traveling to Missouri and Kansas to see James Wickstrom speak and so my father and his friends could attend the George Gordon school of common law in Isabella, Missouri. Now in 2013 I find that the patriot movement is back on the rise and people in the Midwest are falling prey to these snake oil salesmen who are peddling books and seminars that will supposedly teach a student how to circumvent the law and their obligation to pay taxes. These groups are anything but patriotic and are very dangerous. The recent mass shooting at the Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, the killing of an abortion doctor in Wichita, Kansas, and the murders of law enforcement officers in West Memphis Arkansas and St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana are just some recent examples of acts of terrorisim that were carried out by the radical right and sovereign citizen movement."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"While the book deals wth a timely topic, it is marred by a couple glaring faults. First, the title completely misleads the reader into thinking it is going to discuss the largely-1990s phenomenon on the so-called militiat movement. In reality, the militia movement is dealt with only sparingly at the end of the book and in too few chapters. This is primarily a book about the rise of the \\"radical right.\\" The author could have done a better job explaining and elaborating upon that theme.That leads to the second major criticism: that the work too often reads like an insiders' case study rather than a work easily accessible to the general public or academia. The author assumes that the reader will be instantly familiar with all the terms and tactics of the hate groups mentioned in this book. Many aren't, and a lot of the background \\"big picture\\" history is either left out or treated cursorily.Nevertheless, looking past these faults one can find a great wealth of information on the phenomenon of the far-right and its place in late 20th century American society."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"This entire book (any most like it) is based on lies and stereotypes. I am a member of a citizens militia. I am not a right winger or a terrorist. The author of this book is spreading fear and hoping to profit from it.Sure, many in militias are right leaning Republicans but not all. I am a Socialist and a self confessed hippie. My idea of a great leader is Hugo Chavez. So you can see I am nothing like the crazies this author is trying to scare you with.Anyone who has seen the loss of freedoms and the rise of fear that has resulted from eight years of Bush knows that the government, no matter who is in office, is not on your side. In fact, with the Patriot Act Two it is in every citizens best interest to do two things. Question your government and learn how to defend yourself and family from enemies both foreign and domestic. That is what a militia is about. Militia members care about the constitution and they care about ensuring their freedom.It is not paranoia to be prepared for defense and survival. Look around the world and realize how fast a nation can go from normal to fascist, or at peace with it's citizens to genocide. If you aren't ready to defend your country and your family then go ahead, live in fear. But rest assured it isn't your local militia you have to fear.The Terrorist Next Door and other books like it are written by people with an agenda. If you don't fit into their idea of acceptable then they want you to be labeled, feared and punished without so much as a chance to defend your point of view. Now ask yourself, doesn't that sound like a terrorism?"},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"To the ignorant, this author may seem credible. To those of us who understand the resistance to expansion of government, the 80's farm crisis, oppressive taxation, the murder of Gordon Kahl, violation of our Constitutional liberties, etc., know Levitas is promoting the lie which would have you believe any American, especially those white ones who are opposed to tyranny, are comprised of Nazis. Research this author before you read his book. You might be surprised about his history. Then again, maybe not."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"The Terrorist Next Door is an invaluable resource for people who have been previously exposed to information about the militia movement. This is not a book for first-time readers who are curious about the domestic terrorist subculture. The Terrorist Next Door suffers somewhat by poor editing. When reading the book, I was under the impression that substantive parts were cut out of the manuscript. The book ends up being a series of case studies, but the writer does not discuss possible relationships between the case studies. For example, did the massacre at Rulo, Nebraska somehow influence the federal government's activities at Waco? Also, Levitas' discussion of the Arizona Patriots needs a great deal more elaboration, because -- as pointed out in other books about the Oklahoma City Bombing -- McVeigh and Fortier spent a great deal of time with this group. So again, is there a substantive relationship between the Arizona Patriots and the Oklahoma City Bombing? Despite the aforementioned editing difficulties and the lack of cohesion among case studies, The Terrorist Next Door provides excellent depictions of Gordon Kahl, Richard Wayne Snell, and the effects of the farm crisis. However, I would have preferred more information on McVeigh and The Order. In addition, a previous reviewer wrote that Levitas attempted to tie the militia movement to the Sept. 11 attacks, and therefore, accuses Levitas of academic dishonesty. This reviewer needs to reread the last chapter in the book. Levitas states that many members of the militia movement were exulted by the Sept. 11 attacks -- perhaps most notably, Billy Roper -- but the book does not suggest that the milita movement was responsibile for the World Trade Center attacks."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world.this stuff would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.

This book reminds us, in often disturbing detail, that the greater threat to American democracy comes within, from white 'Christian' men. At its core, this book forces us to realize that bigotry - in all its forms - is the most dangerous form of terrorism.The Terrorist Next Door provides the reader with the \\"who\\", \\"what\\", \\"where\\", and the all-important \\"why\\" of the militia movement. Where most other books on the subject gloss-over the importance of race and religion in the evolution of the militia movement, this book tackles the issue head-on. In it, Levitas proves that he is not only an amazing researcher, but a skilled analyst and writer. This is one of those refreshing books that not only provides insight and analysis but provides you with the information to back it up.It should come as no suprise that this book has been nominated for both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"This totally engrossing and historically accurate book is a must read for anyone interested in American history, in terrorism and in the home-grown sources of the Militia movement. It is full of interesting stories about the people who make up the radical right, those who battle them, and the role of ideology (as well as economics) in generating and supporting our home-grown right wing terrorists. As a teacher, I would find it useful for high school and college courses and there is a wonderful time line at the end of the text (not to mention copious and fascinating footnotes)which clearly explicates the relationship between these groups and such events in the larger society as reconstruction,school desegregation, and more recently, the farm crisis and end of the cold war. It is guaranteed to give you a new perspective on American history and what you probably never learned in school.A broad canvas filled with intimate details -- not the least of which is the dramatic -- and surprising -- story of William Potter Gale -- the seminal figure in the militiamovement who became a hate-monger despite his Russian Jewish ancestry."},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","review":"So full of lies, generalities, propaganda and fear mongering that I'm sure this will be a must read while detained at your local FEMA re-education camp.

However, it is well worth reading if one is seriously interested in cryptology or the history of cryptology.Most of the machine ciphers of World War II, and many of the machine ciphers used for a very long time thereafter, derived in one way or another from the ciphers invented by Hebern and Hegelin. For example, the German Enigma was derived from Hebern's approach by Willi Korn, and the American M-209 from Hegelin's approach. The list of machines and designers using one or the other of these two methods would be very long indeed. Alan Konheim's excellent 1981 book &quot;Cryptography: A Primer&quot; deals only very briefly with ciphers of these imortant and widespread types; Deavours and Kruh fill this gap.&quot;Machine Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis&quot; offers a great deal of information on the strengths and weaknesses of these machines, and on the cryptanalytic methods used for attacking such ciphers. It does not discuss a number of other techniques of cryptography, such as NDES and public key ciphers. But what it does discuss is very valuable. Anyone who studies it carefully will wind up equipped to break a wide variety of widely used ciphers.I would give this book an even more enthusiastic review if it weren't for a problem the authors allude to in the introduction: &quot;The book is incomplete, as it must be. The totality of what happened is buried in a thousand classified documents which will never be made public.&quot; Well, that's true, but what's also true is that this book fails to discuss some important stuff on its topic that can be found in unclassified but unpublished documents, at least some of which I feel confident that Deavours was familiar with in 1985, when this book was written. One has to stop somewhere when writing a book; Deavours and Kruh probably made a wise choice about what not to include. But I hope that some day in the near future Deavours (or somebody) will be able to update this book by adding some of what Deavours and Kruh left out."},{"Title":"The Struggle For Power in Syrian: Politics and Society Under Asad and the Ba'th Party","review":"The author gives a brief but well-balanced account of the rise of the Alawites in Syrian politics. It focuses on the continuous discussion of sectarian interests this involves both in their own ranks and among their opponents. I understood many aspects of recent Middle-East history much better than after reading only such general overviews as Mansfield's.The style of the book does not contribute to the pleasure of reading it. There are many small signs of it being translated from Dutch. To my taste, the text is somewhat overloaded with names, which might appeal more to specialists than to general readers."},{"Title":"The Struggle For Power in Syrian: Politics and Society Under Asad and the Ba'th Party","review":"REVIEWED BY JOSHUA LANDIS, Department of Near East Studies, Princeton UniversityInternational Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Aug., 1998), pp. 447-449Published by: Cambridge University PressOnly a handful of important books have been written on modern Syria; and Nikolaos Van Dam's The Struggle for Power in Syria is one of them. When it first appeared in 1979 with the subtitle, Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics, 1961-1978, it rapidly set the terms for future debate on Syrian politics. With the recent publication of a revised edition, Van Dam, who has served as the Dutch ambassador to Syria, Egypt, and Turkey, has conscientiously updated his book. He has re-worked the original six chapters and the footnotes, and added three new chapters covering the last twenty years of Assad's rule. The bibliography is the best of its kind and should be the starting point for any student wishing to research Syrian politics. Although the book is twice the length of the original, it contains only a merciful 140 pages of text, making it ideal for serious undergraduate classes and indispensable to any Middle East collection.The passage of eighteen years has only confirmed the intelligence of Van Dam's original thesis. He has demonstrated elegantly and simply that the coups and factionalism in Syrian politics of the 1960s must be understood in terms of identity politics rather than of class. At that time, Bacthist regimes were trumpeting their elimination of sectarianism and tribalism as meaningful social referents in Syria.Arab nationalists, inclined to accept such claims, theorized about Arab unity and socialism as if an age of liberation were at hand. Ac-ademics, too, were swept up by the post-revolutionary optimism. Many deployed such Marxist categories as the \\"rural middle class,\\" \\"Bonapartist state,\\" and \\"bureaucratic authoritarianism\\" as if to suggest that the military dictatorships that had become so commonplace in the Middle Eastern landscape were not as bad as they seemed. Some even argued that they were a pre-requisite to economic development and offered a way out of the destructive embrace of inter-national capitalism. Van Dam took a more sober view.For Van Dam, dictatorship in Syria was not as much a product of economic necessity as of social fragmentation. Culturally, Syria was too divided to support a pluralistic state. \\"A clear relationship existed,\\" Van Dam writes, \\"between political stability and the degree of sectarian, regional and tribal factionalism in the political elite\\" (p. 139). When the power centers of the state, such as the upper ranks of the security forces and the military, have been divided among diverse sectarian and regional factions, as they were in the 1960s, Syria has been unstable. When \\"one all-powerful political faction\\" dominates, as has been the case since Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970, Syria has experienced stability (p. 137). Almost all of Assad's closest lieutenants are not only 'Alawis, they are also members of his family or tribe, or they come from his hometown of Qardahah. Relying on primordial ties for political loyalty has been a simple necessity of power politics in Syria-and the root of Assad's success. That is to say, it takes a village to rule Syria.The original chapters in The Struggle for Power in Syria remain the most compelling, for they explain how a complete re-shuffling of Syria's social and political hierarchy followed the cAlawi-led Bathist coup of March 1963. 'Alawi officers, with the assistance of other minority officers from the Syrian countryside, broke the political monopoly held by the Sunnis in a series of purges that led up to the second Bathist coup of 1966. The minority factions could not preserve their alliance following the downfall of the Sunnis. Neither their shared Bathist ideology nor their common background of rural poverty was enough to stem the tide of sectarian distrust sweeping through Syrian politics.In 1966, the \`Alawis purged Druze officers following a dramatic standoff, which was re-solved only after Assad surrounded the Jabal Druze with artillery and threatened to level the region. Next, the Ismailis were swept from senior military positions. By 1970, most senior non-'Alawi officers had been dismissed or arrested for having supported abortive coup at-tempts. As Van Dam points out, \\"this did not mean that hardly any\\" non-\`Alawi officers were left in the army; rather, \\"it meant the end of their role as significant power groups\\" that could threaten the 'Alawi domination of the state (p. 61). The last episode in this decade of upheaval was a battle between two cAlawi factions, one led by Assad and one by Salah Jadid. Assad's superior ability to cultivate regional and tribal loyalties within the military secured his victory. In these chapters, Van Dam demonstrates to the satisfaction of this reviewer that sectarian politics and primordial loyalties are the keys to understanding the major stages in the devel-opment of the contemporary Syrian state.That said, it should be noted that a number of fine academics remain unconvinced, most notably Raymond Hinnebusch. He insists that \\"class provides the crucial key that drives change\\" in Syria, and that sectarian politics are secondary, surfacing only \\"when class conflict recedes\\" (p. 141).The three new chapters continue the story of Syria's sectarian struggles up to the present. Two of the chapters deal with the rise of Syria's Sunni Islamic opposition, and its demise following the fateful Hama massacre of 1982. The final chapter, titled \\"The Power Elite under Hafiz al-Asad,\\" touches on a number of topics, not the least of which is the question of what will happen when Assad dies.Little of this material will be new to those who have read Patrick Seale's biography of Assad. Many episodes of Syrian history under Assad are not discussed in any detail, in particular those relating to public and foreign policy such as the 1973 war and Syria's involvement in Lebanon. The reason for these omissions, Van Dam explains, is that \\"Syrian policies as such had nothing to do with the sectarian composition of the power elite\\" (p. 137). What is included is prescribed by Van Dam's original thesis.In his analysis of the Hama massacre, for example, Van Dam explains that the troops who destroyed the Sunni city were largely cAlawi in composition and that their commanding of-ficers were CAlawi almost to the man. He notes that the choice of Hama for the regime's bloody showdown with its opponents was not coincidental, for Hamawis had been responsible for much of the past mistreatment of 'Alawis. Revenge provided the motive for some of the ex-cesses of Hama. If Hama is the yardstick by which scholars and statesmen continue to measure the brutality of Assad's regime, it seems that Van Dam is critical but understanding. He does not try to clear up the controversy over the number killed, but repeats that somewhere be-tween 5,000 and 25,000 perished. If the Muslim Brotherhood had toppled the regime, or if Syria had slipped into civil war as Lebanon did, Van Dam suggests, matters might have been much worse. He points out that the majority of Syrians may well have supported Assad, even if grudgingly, in light of these bleak alternatives. Assad succeeded in breaking the back of the opposition at Hama, we are told, even if he may have \\"sown the seeds of future strife and revenge.\\" It is clear that like many Western and Israeli statesmen, Van Dam respects Assad for his ability to survive and for his mastery of Syrian politics.All the same, Van Dam is not optimistic about the prospects for meaningful economic re-form in Syria, or about the possibility of a Velvet Revolution in the future. He points out that Assad's anti-corruption campaigns have been ineffectual because the president refuses to dis-cipline his security chiefs, many of whom are the worst offenders. He doubts that the country can make a peaceful transition to a post-Assad government, because Assad has allowed his re-gime to become ossified. No purges have been carried out, and few top personnel have been changed in the last twenty-five years. Consequently, no new generation has been groomed for power or schooled in the art of government.Only the president's son, Bashar, seems to be in line to inherit authority from his father. Other members of Assad's inner circle have likewise been grooming their sons to succeed them. He notes that the Sunni majority has not given up its \\"negative attitude towards 'Alawi religion and 'Alawis in general,\\" and adds that he finds it \\"very difficult to imagine a scenario in which the present narrowly based, totalitarian regime .. . can be peacefully transformed into a more widely based democracy.\\" The key to Assad's success has been his ability to rule through his metaphorical village. Whether the dynastic principle that Assad and his men have been pushing will catch on in Syria is an open question. Van Dam gives us little reason to believe that Syria is developing the political institutions or broader national identity that may someday replace the parochial loyalties and narrow prejudices that now define politics in Syria."},{"Title":"The Morning After (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"I loved this book.

She then changed to frozen yogurt, saving hundreds of calories a day, and then finally after some months, switched to 50-calorie jello and didn't end up missing her full-fat ice cream) She talks about her past and how she was offered free pizza for life at the age of twelve if she would \\"spend just one night\\" with the man who owned the place. (She was thin until her 30's) She talks about incidents that happened when she was fat that might hit close to home for some people! Overall her story is really motivational, interesting, helpful, and just fun to read."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"Its smart, funny, and full of great and helpful information. I love this author's style of storytelling. When I was done reading I felt like Jami and I were good pals. So I read it again and loved it just as much. I hope to see more from this author."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"No, the famed film critic, Jami Bernard, has not taken it all off for the centerfold of Playboy magazine. However, in \\"The Incredible Shrinking Critic,\\" she does something equally daring; Bernard exposes her inner struggles with brutal candor. It's all here: her emotional insecurity stemming from childhood, her failed romances, her successful but frightening battle with breast cancer, and her contentious relationship with food. Any female who has grappled with issues of weight and body image will identify with Bernard's angst. Who among us has not gazed at the mirror with horror and self-loathing? \\"Every extra pound tells a story. It's a story of anger, frustration, old wounds, and carelessness.\\"The first half of the book is a confessional in which Bernard ruthlessly exposes her top weight (230) along with pictures, her penchant for sneaking food, her aversion to gyms (\\"a laminated health-club membership pass makes a good coaster for a big martini\\"), and her eventual decision to lose weight in public. Bernard reported her progress in the New York Daily News, knowing that her success or failure to regain her formerly normal-sized figure would become public knowledge. Although she has slipped up now and then, Bernard has stayed the course and learned a great deal about herself during her journey back to health and fitness.Throughout \\"The Incredible Shrinking Critic,\\" Bernard delivers the same message that all sensible diet books repeat over and over like a mantra: there is no quick fix; losing a pound a week is the way to go; be willing to cook healthful and delicious food for yourself; exercise sensibly and regularly; watch out for the dreaded maintenance phase, when the compliments taper off and the pounds creep back on and cling stubbornly. Losing weight is a state of mind, a product of one's desire to feel energetic, to look one's best, and to take control of one's destiny.Bernard has a delightfully snarky and hilarious writing style. She is often self-deprecating and has unkind words for diet saboteurs, fad diets (it took Jami two and a half years to lose 75 pounds the slow and boring way), and celebrities who lie about their weight and set a bad example for the rest of us. A wry sense of humor goes a long way towards making this painfully honest book palatable. In addition to her wit, Bernard has courage in spades. It took guts to overcome breast cancer, it took guts to chart her weight loss in a newspaper read by millions, and it took guts for her to decide that she's mad as heck and she's not going to eat crappy food anymore (or at least not as much as she used to). Recipes and a helpful index are included in this wise, entertaining, and informative book."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I love this book! It is not a \\"how to\\" book on losing weight, but still this book inspired me to start the journey toward a healthy weight. Ms. Bernard's book is boldly honest about society's attitude toward overweight people. I especially like Ms. Bernard's comments on physical hunger vs. mouth hunger--I knew this already but Jami gave me a simple question I can ask myself to immediately tell the difference between true physical hunger and just wanting to eat--\\"Am I willing to eat a cold boiled potato?\\" The ONE thing I did not like about this book is Ms. Bernard's opinion of the Atkin's Diet. Ms. Bernard greatly exaggerates/distorts what the Atkin's Diet recommends, writing that Atkin's dieters eat bacon dipped in butter all day. BUT this is not a diet review book so I guess Ms. Bernard has the liberty to exaggerate/distort. I would definetly buy this book gain and will definitely recommend to friends. Love it! Really made me think! Funny, sad, compelling, interesting."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I was able to obtain this book through a bookswap. I read through it quickly in one sitting and am about to pass it along after spending a short time with it.I found Ms. Bernard's personal history boring and tedious and the tips that are contained in the last half of the book much better presented in other weight loss books.If you are serious about losing weight, I would suggest that one work through a program that combines a sensible diet, exercise, and mindfulness. The Beck Diet Solution: Train Your Brain to Think Like a Thin Person by Judith S. Beck is an invaluable book that integrates all critical components for weight loss success and healthy living."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I am sure that writing was very cathartic for Ms. Bernard, but I was hoping for a little inspiration. What I got was a feeling of DUH!! You mean, I have to eat right and exercise to lose weight? Of course we all know this. I don't know what inspiration I was hoping to gleam from the book, but I got little out of it.Overall, it was a fun read...but hardly helpful."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I had trouble finishing the book. I did not find the inspiration I was hoping for as I have with other books. Writing down one's journey through weight loss is a daring move yet not all are worthwhile for everyone to read. I am in my late twenties and feel maybe this book is better for someone in their 30s or so given the age of the writer."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"An entertaining book on weight loss and a quick read. My hope is that readers will reach out and truly address techniques that lead to healthy weight. There is no magic formula but if a reader can truly be willing to address the full spectrum of elements that go into being and staying healthy with your eating style then you have true diet power. A wonderful companion book isNot Your Mother's Diet: The CURE for your EATING ISSUES"},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"This book is the first book in months that I've picked up and not been able to put down till I finished it. I am so glad that I came across it before spending another nickel on some weight loss scheme or how-to book. I was once so tiny I could fit into a size 2, but after years of self indulgence woke up one day and looked into my full length mirror to find a size 22 staring back at me. Ms Bernard writes of a similar experience, and how it placed her in a position of self knowledge - no longer could she imagine herself as the svelte, seductive siren of her 20's. She had been on a roller coaster ride of eating plans, self indulgent food choices, in a mire of marketing methods encouraging her to eat, eat, eat. She discusses the influences of men, friends, and family dynamics on her perception of herself as a young girl and adult. She shares herself unstintingly, and in the end, it is her matured vision of herself that wins out.Self knowledge being what it is, you are left with a couple of choices. Either you intentionally delude yourself and continue on a self destructive, unhealthy life path, or you wake up and start taking care of yourself one step at a time. Jami Bernard writes of her awakening with great compassion, humor, and skill. I consumed her book instead of food, licking my lips with satisfaction and feeling like I'd just been to the best seminar ever on growing up and facing yourself in the present. I found priceless truth in the pages, perhaps a kindred spirit. Ms Bernard reveals to me what I already suspected - that I can choose to live a healthy lifestyle involving exercise, nutritious foods, and supportive friends, or I can continue on my self destructive and excuse-ridden, painful descent into a life of infirmities. I already have been through more than enough trendy diet plans, yo-yo dieting, and the consequences - sleep apnea, plantar fasciitis, painful joints, etc.I would love to share this book with everyone living in the purgatory of the overweight. I would love to see anyone searching for a way out of excessive eating stop being a victim and become empowered. Reading this delightful book was a key to my empowerment, now it rests with me to follow through."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Unlike a lot of books about weight loss and eating and exercise - this book is honest and funny and sensible. Bernard doesn't try to sell a particular method, diet, or path. Instead she offers up her story in a funny and honest way that really resonated for me. She provides lots of useful tips throughout the book as well but overall the book is more inspiration than roadmap. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"This is the best book on weight loss I've ever read! I laughed all the way through it and could relate to almost every piece of it. I found myself smiling and nodding in agreement repeatedly...sometimes cheering! If you've stuggled with weight issues for a good part of your life do yourself a favor and buy this book. A week after I bought it I picked up a copy for a good friend and she finished it before me. I will go back for a second read through very soon. Jami gives sound advice and combines personal experience with research and facts. I can't say enough about this book."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I bought this book when it was plugged to me as a recommendation at a bargain price. I read half of it the first night, and parts of it were laugh out load hilarious. I do think it is worth the read. However, it was hard for me to finish for a few reasons. Mainly, not all of us are as well cultured, well traveled, and well off as the author. It was hard to feel sorry for her and especially to relate to her when she can go to spas, have expensive massages, go to the best gyms and have the best food (some of which I had no idea what it was since it appeared to be written in French).I did like her approach and style of writing. I just felt like the book was written for somebody other than me, and the reviews had me believing otherwise."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I have read a lot of diet books, or should I say, I have started a lot of diet books. I know the fundamentals of weight loss and nutrition. I know what needs to be done to lose weight, yet, I seem totally unable to motivate myself. I keep thinking that if I can just read the \\"right\\" book, the one that makes sense to me, the switch in my brain will turn on. For ME (but maybe not you) this book is it. I feel like Jami exists in my head and I can totally relate to everything she writes.It annoys me when people say \\"This book changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" Obviously, I am the only person that can change my life. The steps and processes (in the weight loss journey) I have been going through (albeit very slowly, just like Jami) are more \\"real\\" and more of a \\"success\\" becuase I can identify that they are a step in the right direction. This book has allowed to be able to identify that I have made progress and will continue on if I stay in the right mindset.On a side note, I enjoy reading Martha Beck's columns and have read portions of some of her books. I started reading her new diet book, \\"The 4 Day win.\\" The 4 Day win is way too out there for me. I am a logical analytical person. I am a lawyer. Performing little tasks where I write questions with one hand and answer them with the other hand seems absolutely ridiuclous to me. I just don't see the connection between these types of psychologist games and weight loss. If you are turned off by this type of mumbo-jumbo, I highly recommend \\"The Incredible Shrinking Critic.\\" There are no gimmicky tests and Q & A. It's obvious that Jami had done some soul-searching to see how her history led to her poor eating habits. Something that anyone can accomplish without resorting to chanting to induce deep relaxation while simulatneously writing random questions with your left hand and answering them with your right.All in all, I highly recommend this book. I got a lot out of it and I didn't feel as it were written solely as a hyped-up marketing tool purely to make the publisher a few dollars."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"I got the book today and am through the first 100 pages, and I love it. I find myself laughing out loud at her familiar stories of being overweight . .I would cry if I didn't laugh. I think she has the most realistic approach to weight loss that I have come across in a long time. Fad diets don't work. And how uncomfortable it can be to be overweight and working with/socializing with the thin, fabulous and sometimes famous. Her discomfort with her sexuality during her teens also strikes a cord. She is simply spot on with all her remarks. I advise this book if you are thinking about dieting or actually dieting, or even if you just know someone who struggles with overweight."},{"Title":"The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss","review":"This book is definitely worth your while. it is laugh out loud funny, yet poignant at times as Jami recalls her life long experience without, with, and without again, the extra pounds.

The emotional conflicts of the characters and how they are expressed are very real. Excellent!"},{"Title":"DEATH OF A RUSSIAN PRIEST","review":"Tony Hillerman says, \\"Never miss a Kaminsky book, and be especially sure not to miss \`Death of a Russian Priest.'\\" With a recommendation like that, who needs to wait!Stuart Kaminsky, himself an Edgar Award winner, proves once again that his Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series in not one to miss. Set in Russia amid the rumblings and eventual fall of the Iron Curtain, the series captures convincingly the Russian atmosphere, politically, socially, criminally, and with such conviction, especially for an American writer who has not devoted his life to Russian studies.In \\"Death of a Russian Priest,\\" Inspector Rostnikov, accompanied by one of the few individuals he can fully trust, journeys to Arkush to investigate the murder of a local priest, an outspoken cleric and one whose death has shocked the local community.Of course, as with all the Rostnikov books, nothing is as it seems and it takes the cunning, the skill, and the intellect of his team to bring all this together. He and Karpo, known as \\"the Vampire,\\" are busy solving this murder while meanwhile back in Moscow, Sasha Tkach, Rostinok's handsome and randy and very married assistant, is involved in another investigation. Tkach has a new partner, Elena Timofeyeva (which opens up other complications!), and they are trying to find a missing girl and a cold-blooded killer. Kaminsky manages to tie these assignments together and quite satsifactorily by the book's conclusion. He, once again, has managed to provide humanity in an area where little is often found! Kaminsky's Russian tales are absorbing, and it is nail-biting waiting for the next episode.Billyjhobbs@tyler.net"},{"Title":"DEATH OF A RUSSIAN PRIEST","review":"Porfiry Rostnikov is about the best fictional detective out there and this is one of his better cases.

Not only does he write the Rostnikov series, he also does Toby Peters, Abe Lieberman, Lew Fonesca, and a couple of original Jim Rockford mysteries. He has won the Edgar Award for his fourth Rostnikov novel, A COLD, RED SUNSHINE.Kaminsky dedicates this rendition of the Rostnikov series to Evan Hunter (Ed McBain) whose 87th Precinct novels he seems to emulate. Like the 87th precinct procedurals, each book is built around several cases. This one is an exception in that Karpo and Rostnikov are working together on the murder of a Russian orthodox priest, Vasili Merhum, and Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva are looking for an Arab girl who has gone missing.Neither plot is all that compelling, but that's usually not the point in this original series. Kaminsky spends much more time on character development than on plot. In this one, Sasha Tkach is teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown; his wife is expecting a new baby he can't afford and he must learn to work with a new partner, plus put up with his meddling mother who has come to live with them while his wife is confined to bed. There also appears to be more than a little sexual tension between Sasha and Elena. Karpo, the fanatical communist, must learn to live without an ideology to slavishly follow, and he is drawn to the Russian Orthodox church. Rostinikov is being hounded by the remnants of the Russian KGB.Rostnikov is one of my all-time favorite characters; the \\"Washtub\\" as he is affectionately called, works off stress by solving plumbing problems or by weightlifting while listening to Dinah Washington. Absolutely nothing seems to rattle the man, not even the ax-wielding psychopath who killed Vasili Merhum.It's been almost four years since the last in the series, MURDER ON THE TRANS-SIBERIAN EXPRESS. In the bio I read, Kaminsky says he spends much more time researching his Rostnikov novels than the others, so maybe that's the reason. I think Putin has given him lots of ammunition; it's time to put those other guys on the shelf and take another trip to Moscow."},{"Title":"DEATH OF A RUSSIAN PRIEST","review":"A friend recommended Stuart Kaminsky's Porfiry Rostnikov series, and after reading one book, I am smitten. This series pushes all my buttons: a serious mystery, a Russian theme, great characters, and an exciting plot woven around current events.The book begins right after the fall of communism. Lines are long, tempers are short, and Russian's are having a difficult time adjusting to the new regime. Living conditions are Spartan and most people share an apartment with a friend or relative. The Russian Orthodox Church is experiencing a resurgence. The KGB is not what it once was, and many that were once at the top now find themselves on the bottom. And the police, who were once feared and respected, are merely tolerated.Inspector Rostnikov and his staff are faced with two separate murders. In the small village of Arkush, an outspoken priest is brutally murdered. In Moscow, a young Jewish student is murdered, and his Syrian girlfriend (daughter of an important oil minister) has mysteriously disappeared. Rostnikov and his partner, Karpo head for Arkush. At the same time, their associates, Tkach and Timofeyeva investigate the Moscow murder. Throughout their investigations, they are constantly tailed by the KGB, which can be comical at times.But where Kaminsky really shines is his characters. All suffer pain and pathos, and all carry a heavy heart. Rostnikov suffers from a severe leg injury obtained in World War II. His beautiful wife, Sarah, is recuperating from a brain tumor. Their son Iosef, a former soldier who fought in Afghanistan, has just written a play that disturbs his parents because of its angst. Karpo, who was practiced communism with a religious zeal, now finds himself rudderless. And so it goes. But despite the hardships and pitfalls of living in Russia, they try to find some solace and comfort in simple things: a beautiful smile, a short line, a half a chicken, family, and friendship.My only regret with the Rostnikov series is that I started with book eight in the series, instead of book one. But the good news is that I still have a good number of Rostnikov books to enjoy. I already look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"DEATH OF A RUSSIAN PRIEST","review":"Stuart M. Kaminsky is the prolific author of three distinctive mystery series (Chandler-esque vintage Hollywood private eye Toby Peters: _Murder on the Yellow Brick Road_, Chicago cop Abe Lieberman, and here, the McBain-esque Moscovite Office of Special Operations.)In the Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov series, Kaminsky has deftly transplanted the Ed McBain police procedural to Russia: individual detectives, each having his/her own serial back stories, investigating different cases. And through the time span of the series, the reader also watches as the Soviet Union disintegrates.This time, there is the mysterious disappearance of a Syrian Oil Minister's daughter and the murders of a Russian Orthodox Priest and Nun.\`With faith in his mission, Father Merhum [the eponymous dead Russian Orthodox Priest] had stood up to commissars, the leaders of his own church, the KGB, and state leaders from Stalin to Gorbachev.

The first study (Hebrews 11) jumps right into historical characters in the bible (Abraham, Noah, Enoch) and explores their faith. Following chapters focus on Christ's words, Paul's life, David's actions and Abraham's willingness to sacrifice.

Although my parents have never been divorced and I don't have an older brother and younger sister as Karen, the narrator of Judy's story, does, it is the type of book you can sympathize with.Karen is a sixth grader who must deal with the constant arguments between her parents. She is not completely unaware of the fighting that gets worse and yet thinks she can somehow fix it. Well, as it is, her parents do get a divorce, and Karen's life goes down from there: she's worried she'll never see her dad, the one boy she likes has moved, and her teacher is a \\"witch\\" (yes, those are the words; not what you'd think.) She, however, tries her hardest to make her parents love each other and learns the hard way it can't.To quote Karen's use of rating her days with letter grades, this book is a B+ - a little out-dated, but you're sure to love it.

I have purchased this for my 14 year old daughter - I guess I'm sharing the magic."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"Judy Blume was highly controversial in her day, allegedly for bringing to light the perils and trials that mid-twentieth century children had to cope with. Critics, however, missed the larger significance: Blume was often an apologist for the inflictors of these perils and trials and an usher of the Brave New World.That's a shame, because the subject matter of this book, a young girl caught off-guard by the sudden news of her parents' divorce, could be quite interesting. Karen's reactions to the news, and those of her siblings, were basically realistic, but Blume has never been particularly successful at fully capturing the heightened emotions of children's inner battles. A girl at an age as tender and transitional as Karen's (eleven or twelve, sixth year of primary school after Kindergarten) would, unless she were particularly strong or heroic, be devastated by this... and Karen is not. Yet there is nothing that suggests Karen is a particularly strong or heroic girl.Neither, however, is anyone else in the book. The mother must have been nursing a tranq addiction. The book asks us to believe that neither parent was cheating, but I don't know what else it could have been: they weren't alcoholics, they weren't in any apparent financial trouble... why were they constantly at each other's throats? The baby sister is an annoying brat. Karen's older brother is still in mid-adolescence and scarcely stable enough to demonstrate any sort of heroism. The mother clearly needs to get away from her more mature older sister, on whom she has always leaned.Karen's friends come closest to playing hero, but Debbie is only a sideline comforter and Val is postmodern nonsense: she serves nothing except to resign Karen to the fact that the divorce will happen and it's nothing to worry about. And the end, when Karen loses any sort of familiar place due to her parents' petty selfishness... is there any sort of humanity in this entire world?Karen's world was indeed ending, and it is difficult to respect a little girl who seems not to care. Her parents must have been far worse than even this book suggests! But Blume is a typical postmodern writer, incapable of seeing the good in humanity and opposing tragic destruction with acts of redemption: the ending celebrates the evil of the perpetrators not for itself, but for the new opportunities it opens up for a Brave New World! Even \\"War of the Roses,\\" which depicted humans destroying themselves by their own seedy nature, made it a point to depict the oscillating and often unexpectedly-located line between good and evil.Yes, real humans are cruel, but there are real good people and there are real heros. Children need that sort of inspiration. Conservatives who complained about the sexual content of \\"Deenie\\" or other select Blume books have totally missed the point: the real danger posed to children, by Blume's entire corpus, lies not in the frank treatment of difficult issues, but rather in the fact that literature is supposed to reflect the ideals of our culture, and such self-celebration of mediocrity sets incredibly low standards."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"If you arn'd a hige fan of judy blume, I would not recommend this book.

Although my parents are still together, there are children, even as adults, dealing with divorce. Karen Newman, the main character of the book, is coping with the unexpected events that are going on during her parents separation. She meets another girl that lives in the same building as her father whose parents are divorced. However, her reaction to her parents' breakup is much different from Karen's. She already knew from an early age that her father's role in her life was a small part. She accepts her mother being a single parent and going back out into the dating scene. Karen eventually gets through and comes to the conclusion that her parents aren't getting back. This is an interesting read not only for children, but for adults as well."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"Karen is an ordinary girl who's parents are going through a very hard time.

It really helped me get through that troubling time and if nothing else showed me that I was not alone and this had happened to many children my age. Although I truly did feel this was 'the end of the world' this book enlightened me, obviously by the title, that it was not. Well, now I have received word that my Goddaughter's (niece) parents are going to be splitting up, so I have taken on the responsiblity, like that of my Godmother, to purchase this great book for my niece. I am quite confident that it will help ease this terrible time for my beautiful niece.

This book is so real. Sometimes divorce is the BEST thing that can happen to a family. At the time, divorce might be upsetting &amp; Karen's family goes through a &quot;mourning period&quot; as families need to when the parents' marriage ends. But what this book excellently illustrates &amp; that Karen comes to realize, is that divorce does NOT mean the end of a family or a &quot;broken home.&quot; She realizes that her mother is much happier &amp; more relaxed, even though her mom cries when she remembers the marriage. One good message I got from the book was that it is better for a kid to grow up in a peaceful single-parent home than a tense two-parent home filled with fighting. Parts of the book are sad, but without being depressing. This book is very uplifting &amp; inspiring the way Karen &amp; her family pick up the pieces, rebuild &amp; by the end, you know they're still a family &amp; will go on."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"I've read many of Judy Blumes books, and I must admite this is one of my favorites.

The reason their parent's are getting the divorce is because Karen's parents always fought and cause they didn't love each other anymore. But they both still loved there children. She doesn't want her parents to get the divorce, so she tries to stop them from getting the divorce. She tries all different things to stop it. She met a new friend whose parents got a divorced already and she tries to tell her that there is nothing to do but she doesn't believe her. Also the grandpa didn't want them to get the divorce because no one in the family has got a divorce. Doe the parent's get the divorce or do they stay together? Also does her friend tell her the truth that there is nothing you can do? What do you think? Well if you want to know if she stopped the divorce read the book to find out. I also think people who like books by Judy Blume would like this book. If you read the book called Are you there god? It's Me Margaret; you would like this because it is just like it. Also if your parents are getting a divorce you would like it because it will tell you there isn't much you can do about it. So I think that you should really read this book.

Karen is very mad at them. She tries really hard to get them back together.Jeff runs away, and her parents get very mad at each other, and she gets madder at them. Finally she realizes she can not stop them from getting divorced.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books that are funny, serious and a teeny bit sad all at the same time. It was funny when Karen tried to get sick so her parents would take care of her and not get divorced, and serious because it is just a regular girl&#65533;s life, and sad when her parents get divorced.I liked Debbie, Karen&#65533;s best friend, because she was very funny, and she was kind to Karen while her parents were getting divorced. She did this by paying more attention to her than usual, when she would be flirting with Jeff."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"This book is about an 11 year old girl who's parents are going through a divorce.

It lets kids know that the divorce is not their fault, and it also teaches that there's nothing a kid can do to get his parents back together. Anybody who wants to know more about the breakup of a family should read this book."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"This book was witten in the early 70s, back when there were no cell phones and divorce laws were different. But, everything the family goes through holds true to today because feelings are timeless.Karen Newman, the main character of the book is in sixth grade when her parents separate, and eventually divorce. She goes through a whole range of emotions from anger to sadness and hate to love, high hopes and hopelessness, as most families experience during a divorce. She also desperately wants to do whatever she can to get her parents back together.Being so true to life, at least for me, is what makes this book so good. Karen is a very believable character, as well as the conflicts in this book. Judy Blume wasn't afraid to show how strong the emotions can get, even to the point of parents acting no better than a two year old. I would like to think that divorced parents can all be calm, and make things good for their children. But, knowing first hand from my own parents, I know that it's just not always so.Karen's brother Jeff is also very true-to-life to me, and seems like a very real 14-year old boy.I don't want to give away anything more about the book, so suffice to say I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to young and older alike. It would help anyone who has or who is going through divorce, as well as anyone who would like to read a story about a character who prevails."},{"Title":"Its Not The End Of The World","review":"I read this book as a young preteen whose own parents were going through a divorce.

Thea Carson wife of handsome rocker Toby Carson is struggling with her emotions and life after \`celebritism' takes a toll on her relationship. She casts doubts on her marriage and the constant absence of Toby. Maybe being a celebrity's wife was not cracked up to be.Pattison was a writer for UK gossip magazine OK! For four years before becoming a novelist. She has only written two fiction novels Wow! and Fame Game. Although her collection of writings is not big, she has been dubbed as giving future writers a \`bad impression' because of her attitude towards the profession. She has not produced any new work since 2002.Fame Game is about a wife who can not stop playing by the rules. Thea has a soft spot for her rocker husband, but unfortunately it is starting to wear thin and what once kept her happy is no longer working. Shopping and gossiping with her closest friend Kim is no longer a thrill, especially since Toby is starting to stray and become more than a faithful husband. The stereotype of rockers being players is evident in this tale.Pattison is describes as a writer of \`Chick lit' and started a bidding war between two rival agents for her first book.Fame Game is acceptable within society due to its resemblance to the David Beckham scandal that has seen broadcasted across the globe. His private life with wife Victoria has become a feast for paparazzi and gossip journalists. Thea juggles the same problems as Victoria does with her marriage and public scrutiny.The plots are enjoyable and are related quite easily. The events flow smoothly. It is hard not to tie yourself into the emotional battle that Thea is dealing with, especially the frustration and the feeling of loneliness.However enjoyable the plot can be, it is hard not to dislike or analyze celebrities a little more thoroughly. Analyzing the opposite sex also comes into play; it does wake up the realization that most males are what they are known to commonly be. Overall, it was a captivating piece of literature. It is a shame there is no other pieces from Pattison, it was delightful.\`Fame Game' by Claudia Pattison, (Pan Publishers, $15.95) September 2002, 320 page paperback"},{"Title":"A Web of Salvage","review":"Expertly researched and written maritime thriller in the solid tradition of Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes. Terrific atmosphere aboard a tug that salvages wrecked ships -- and with much knowledge to impart about the little-known salvage business. Strong plotting, lots of gritty action, including a nuclear device -- but a bit too much death and bloodshed for my tastes. Callison seems to enjoy bumping off major characters, often in a somewhat grisly way, and this happened a few too many times to conform to the traditional thriller plot (a al Innes) where the bad guys &quot;get theirs&quot; and the good guys win. Not a bad, book, though, for those who've run out of MacLean novels to read."},{"Title":"Berlitz Romanian Phrase Book & Dictionary (Berlitz Phrase Book & Dictionary: Vietnamese)","review":"The ROMANIAN PHRASE BOOK & DICTIONARY from Berlitz is a standard entry in this line from the publisher. It features phrases for every situation a tourist could imagine themselves in, colour-coded for quick access, with both the Romanian text and a phonetic transcription for English speakers. At the end one can find a small dictionary, and a brief grammar. Romanian is an exceedingly easy language, and someone with previous knowledge of a Romance language could pick it up in two weeks, but if for whatever reason you'll be dependent on a phrase book during your time there, this is certainly the best phrase book around.However, the phrase book does have some weaknesses. The information on Romanian culture often discusses matters limited to one particular region of this very diverse country without warning the reader that the words or concepts discussed aren't applicable for other parts of the country. The phonetic transcription is for speakers of British English, and were an American to unwittingly read from the transcription, being understood may be difficult. Editions of the book prior to the 2006 inexplicably continued to use the Communist-era orthography long after it was revised by a 1993 language reform. Finally, there are a few misprints, though I should think that these are not serious enough to deter communication.Nonetheless, in spite of these quirks the Berlitz is the phrase book to get for Romanian--certainly avoid at all costs the Hippocrene ones."},{"Title":"Berlitz Romanian Phrase Book & Dictionary (Berlitz Phrase Book & Dictionary: Vietnamese)","review":"I got the book within several days and it was in excellent condition.

Also highly recommend her poems such as found in _The Nursery Collection_. Wonderful, rich illustrations; warm, loving families."},{"Title":"Tales of Trotter Street","review":"Shirley Hughes's books are generally terrific. This is a great way to buy, since a collection is cheaper than the individual books, though the price is quite high in US $, being a British edition."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"I am now living in Japan, and am fluent in Japanese(among other languages), a holder of a degree in linguistics, and a professional language teacher, and tutor of Japanese. I think that this text is a great place to start your japanese studies, whether or not you prefer to use only Romaji, or authentic Japanese scripts (or a combination of the two, like myself.) This feature is what sets this book apart from similar priced texts like Hugo's and Teach Yourself, or the Berlitz Essential Japanese books.Having succeded in learning in Japanese, I think people who 'demonize' romaji as a crutch, or useless are seriously misguided. Understanding new grammar rules, and sentence patterns can be mastered much faster, and with more confidence if the student isnt concerned about reading new characters correctly as well. Also, I dare anyone to look at japanese only text and not be a little intimidated. I think romaji is important for providing the beginner with the sense of achievement that is so often needed to overcome the inevitable frustrations that come with learning a new language. Viewed in this context it can be a valuable tool.That said, even if spoken japanese is your only goal, if you plan to live or visit Japan (where japanese is spoken) kanji is a necessity if you realize it or not. It takes a lot of work, and is best started sooner than later.I like the approach in this book because it presents the option of studying Kanji right from the first chapter, and avoids the common mistake of only teaching kanji individually, out of context like so many other 'kanji' specific texts.---When helping others study, I often suggest that they work through the first few chapters, working primarily with the romaji grammar transcriptions first, and learning to transcribe them into Katakana* and Hiragana without looking. Once they begin to deal with the basics I have them go back and start to tackle the beginning chapters again without the romaji. This command of the meaning makes working through the japanese scripts less frustrating.--Another issue I should address here is, that like many reviewers have noted is that vocabulary is not repeated very often within the chapters. I find this to be annoying, but ultimately it is the job of the student to practice, and practice the words on their own.-- if the book provided more chances for the revision of vacabulary, it probably wouldnt cover as much material overall.The reason I give this book a four is that I find the mixed romaji-japanese script thing to be more annoying than its worth. Also, there are some typos, and that is just lazy editing.*Katakana has more bang for buck in terms of practicality in Japan--- many foreign words are actually written in Katakana, if you can read it, or write it, its really written that way in Japan.-- Hiragana on the other hand is used for grammatical functions, and small words, while the bulk is written in Kanji--Hiragana is also sometimes used as tiny transcriptions which apear above kanji which tell japanese people how to pronounce them. (only for kids, or rarer Kanji, or odd pronunciations-- most Kanji are NOT accompanied by hiragana transcriptions) Its better than nothing to write gakusei, in hiragana, and kind of 'cute' for japanese friends, but when you read something real, its in Kanji. Which is why katakana is just more useful in the real world."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"As opposed to another reveiw I'm past the 5th chapter and I've yet to find more than one instance where the vocabluary wasn't comprehensive. Then the word was still available in the glossery in back. In the forward the author does say that in later chapters they will deliberatly not include a comprehensive vocabulary because part of learning the language is learning to utilize the appropriate reference materials. But I haven't reached that point yet. Though, even then, the glossary in the back is comprehensive.There are however a number of typos throughout. Most are rather obvious because they are nearly all in the vocabulary sections where romaji and kana are in parallel text. Thus, the romaji will nearly always be correct and kana characters will either be missing or misplaced. I'm sticking with a 5 though because I find these typos obvious and they didn't confuse me.The rest of the book is great. I've found each chapter leads into the next very well with comprhensibile explanations and each section just the right size. Kana and Kanji are introduced from the beginning slowly and reinforced each chapter.Unfortunatly, it makes everything so comprehensible that many will press on before fully learning each chapter. So I recomend going back to the beginning and reviewing everything at least once every other day until the book is complete. I'm doing this and every time I see some detail I missed all the other times. So it may feel tedious but it does pay off. Also, It's a good idea to keep each study period under 30 minutes so you don't burn out. Review, review, review.My favorite feature about this book is it is not a \\"japanese for business\\" book. If your interest in learning japanese is more for leisure purposes then this is a really good self study course. It is also one of the very few courses that teaches Kanji from day one. So it is at least in the top 3 courses for those who feel learning to read japanese is a high priority.My only real gripe is the CD is sold separatly. It isn't in any of the bookstores I go to, so I must order it."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"This book is fantastic, I love the way it eases you into the different scripts and the realistic dialogs in each chapter. Unlike some other books it's also easy to follow and learn from. It teaches you some very usefull sentence structures right off the bat and then eases you into different grammatical concepts.Of course Anyone using this book would find having a japanese dictionary, grammer reference and kanji dictionary very helpfull to fill in any gaps that pop up. (I really like the Oxford starter japanese dictionary, Oxford Japanese grammer & verbs and Kodansha Kanji learner's dictionary). This book does a way better job than my $100 university text and 2 other self study guides I have had the misfortune of wasting my money on but there are still a few topics that could use more in depth explainations.I've had a year of formal Japanese instruction in university so I didn't have any problems grasping the early dialogs. Allthough It doesn't look like the author intends complete beginners to understand every word since there are some fairly advanced grammer in them. I guess some people will find this an interesting prelude and others will find it annoying. I personally liked it because it kept things interesting.The only real complaint I have is there are quite a few obvious spelling errors throughout the book, hopefully they get corrected in a future edition."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"In contrast most other reviewers, I have finished the whole book. I was initially drawn to this book because unlike many introductory Japanese books, hiragana, katakana, and kanji are introduced right away. I continue to believe that learning kanji is essential to learning Japanese as the building blocks of vocabulary, not something to tack on after learning the spoken language. For this reason, I think this book's concept is head and shoulders above the competition. However, it is very poorly executed. Especially in the later chapters, long lists of kanji appear at the end of each chapter, but most of them were not ever used in the chapter. Each chapter has one or two dialogues, concepts introduced, exercises, and vocabulary, however, there is virtually no overlap of vocabulary in the chapter. This means that you will see each word/character once or twice, but there will be around 50 new words. Somehow, the reader is supposed to be able to effectively learn 50 new words with little repetition. As one progresses, there can be some repetition (a word you saw once in chapter 8 reappears once in chapter 14), and so I can say that I have learned some vocabulary, but not very effectively. Same problem with the grammar--it is introduced in one small section of one chapter, and if you are lucky it will reappear in a sentence in a later chapter. A much much better way to learn would be to stick to a set list of words and one major concept per chapter and repeat these same words and concept in the dialogue, exercises, vocabulary, etc. I have used Random House Living Language books for French and German (they use this approach) and in 6 months was told by a German professor that I sounded like someone with 2 years study. (Unfortunately, the beginning Japanese in their series appears to be just romanji.) With Japanese, I feel like I barely grasped everything, and this overload of information forces more of a passive learning style--just try to get through the immense amount of material that passes by you just once. Since this book was so intense, I thought that I must have learned more that if I had used a seemingly easy book, for example Berlitz Essential Japanese. I was surprised that I could easily read everything in the last chapter and understand it, but that it included the same grammar concepts as in the Routlege book, but without the pain and overkill. Although the book looks like it would be too simple, I think that getting 100% of less material is better than getting 10% of much more material."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"For the money, you cant go wrong with this one. The books and tapes cover material at fast but easy to follow pace. The method really helps the means of retention. It's a great buy for any beginner."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"I am only up to the 5th unit in this book (of 15), and I have several complaints to make about it.The book includes many conversations (which are included on the CD as spoken by native Japanese speakers). Each unit introduces at least one new conversation and with that a new vocabulary list. The vocabulary list follows the conversation transcription in the book for you to practice. I have begun to found that many vocabulary lists do not include the full set of words required to understand the preceding conversation - true for not only the initial conversation for each unit, but other activities within the book. This leaves me somewhat frustrated and confused and second guessing my learning ability.In contrast, the book introduces a fairly efficient way of introducing new characters and kanji in a way that helps you to recognise, remember, and utilize them easily. Initially very few words are written with kana nor kanji. Slowly, romaji is subsituted for kana, and kana for kanji, and their use is sparodic. One same syllable may be in the same text romanized and written using kana or kanji, which I found personally to be a clever way of introducing new characters.I don't think that the book provides enough activities and thorough explanations for you to fully grasp the concepts introduced.I do think that the CD included is very useful. I believe that listening to them and repeating these tracks is crucial in understanding spoken Japanese. You may know structure, grammar, and have an extensive vocabulary, but without hearing native Japanese speakers converse, it's quite useless."},{"Title":"Colloquial Japanese","review":"*i have bought teachyourself, barrons and pimsleur but if you want to teach your self how to read japanese, this is on que with teachyourself-maybe better. if i may offer some advice to any would-be language enthusiast, pimsleur is just spoken word(no booklet)so i recommend it for getting 'the bare bones'-so to speak-of how the language sounds and its basic structure. listen to it when you go to sleep, over and over and you will soon develop a very basic understanding of japanese. teachyourself is also good but it has way too much romanji so you cannot learn how to read japanese(i'm talking about the regular course,i haven't tried the \\"complete japanese\\" course), but for a fast basic course that will take you beyond pimsleur. besides it is better having a booklet right there for easy access rather than going through the separate DVD lessons hopelessly trying to find what you want to review. barrons is VERY good for the word order and colloquial is best for learning all three. why? because it has the dialogs written in japanese, then in ramonji, then in english so you can figure out what one syllabary sounds like and what sequence of syllabaries mean what word in english. it also covers hiragana, katakana, and kanji so your set for all three.

It seems that every page has at least one peculiar typographical error.If the reader can ignore the atrocious editing, he will be captivated by this memoir of a Virginia lady's experience during the \\"War of Yankee Aggression.\\" Mrs. Pryor was obviously a well-bred, highly-educated woman and a skillful writer. This is not a history of the War, per se. The process of secession and the great campaigns of the War have been abundantly chronicled by historians. Instead, Pryor gives a thoroughly personal picture of her life during the days leading to War and during the War itself.The book (first published in 1905) begins with the story of Mrs. Pryor's life as the wife of a Virginia politician in pre-war Washington. Flavored with name-dropping, here we find tedious accounts of social events and of precisely what every prominent lady wore to each event.After the Pryors bid a somber farewell to Washington (Mr. Pryor would become a brevet general in the CSA Army), we are shown what life was like for ordinary citizens in wartime Virginia. Mrs. Pryor's account of those times is fascinating to this amateur Civil War buff.Sara Agnes Rice Pryor wrote near the end:\\"It is not easy to write about the dreadful war between the North and the South. We press our breasts against a thorn when we recall the anguish of those days of death and disaster. It is often said that it is still too early to write the story of our Civil War. It will soon be too late. Some of us still live who saw those days. We should not shrink from recording what we know to be true. Thus only will a full history of American courage and fidelity be preserved, -- for all were Americans.\\"Reminiscences of Peace and War adds light, sound, color and fragrance to all those many sepia versions of the most important event of American history.I enjoyed the book.Sunday, October 14, 2012"},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"Mindy Lewis is a brave woman and was even a braver adolescent. Her bravery as a teenager is the powerful foundation of her ability to survive, endure and thrive. I have been touched by her words and in her memoir Life Inside I learned a great deal about this courageous young woman. I am certain that by bearing her soul to me and to everyone who read this book, I was able to feel her strength and power.Certainly there are many who have either been misdiagnosed or who have been mistreated while being wards of a state or as an inpatient on a psyche ward. But those stories are not always told or known. Mindy's is the voice for all of these souls. Her goals are pure and her intentions honorable by telling her story and showing me and her fans and readers of Life Inside how her strength and endurance and understanding can have a profound impact on so many lives.Mindy is an alum of SUNY Empire State College where I am a matriculated student, and her kindness has been extended to me when her response to a letter from me has continued to encourage me to complete my own memoir Good Self/Bad Self: The Individuation of My Selves. I hope that my project is soon available on Amazon and elsewhere and I invite readers of Mindy's book to let me share my story with them, as well.I am confident that Mindy Lewis would not see herself or her work as being heroic but to me and I know to many, her story illustrates her hero-like status and it is my strongest recommendation that her memoir be shared with as many readers as possible.F. Paul Muccigrosso IILancaster, New York"},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"Once I started reading Life Inside, I could not put it down. The vivid, intimate writing transported me completely.Mindy Lewis' memoir paints a clear picture of everyday life on the fifth-floor ward of the NY State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. Life Inside also dramatizes a sensitive teenage girl's coming of age during the turbulent 1960s. The second half of the memoir, \\"Life After,\\" discusses the particular challenges of adjusting to life outside, after twenty-eight months of hospitalization.Throughout Life Inside, Mindy Lewis faces painful memories openly and honestly, and I admire her courage. She is a strong, hopeful and determined individual, and her memoir offers much inspiration. It also raises important questions about the nature of human emotions and the dangers of unchecked institutional authority. Ultimately, Life Inside celebrates the healing powers of art, music and literature, of self-reflection and friendship."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"This is a fascinating, beautifully written memoir about a grave personal injustice, but it also sheds light on societal attitudes toward non-conformity, and is a window into the sixties and the struggles which were prevalent at that time."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"It was the 60's. Political and social upheaval uprooted even the most grounded of families. Mindy Lewis had just transferred to a prestigious art school but due to her difficulty and impaired ability to cope with her parents' separation, she skips class, experiments with drugs, and tries to substitute the love she felt was absent at home with flirtation with other boys. Her mother could no longer tolerate this behavior and had her court remanded to New York State Psychiatric Institute.In the 60's, prior to deinstitutionalization, State hospitals were at their highest populations. The length of stay 40 years ago is not the same as it is today. Now in private hospitals insurance closely monitors expenses, aiming for quick stabilization and medication management, but in the 60's if you were placed in a state hospital involuntarily you gave them a continuous source of income without the worry of insurance companies. If you didn't show great improvements, they had every reason to throw out the key.During her stay at NYSPI she was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic, as schizophrenia was a very common diagnosis. She was a guinea pig for the latest neuroleptics and the latest resident psychiatrists. Inside she lashes out and becomes defiant, manages to escalate to promiscuity with the other male patients, and made suicide gestures because she is faced with the choice of complying with the rules and she might eventually go home to the mother who is suffocating her or stay inside but maintain some semblance of freedom until she is 18.Mindy Lewis writes the way we process, as if our internal dialogue was being documented on paper. She shares what it's like to become institutionalized, then to recover. Life Inside chronicles Mindy Lewis' friendships and tragedies and the consequences of 28 months in a state hospital."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"Mindy Lewis cuts to the quick with chillingly direct no-nonsense descriptions of an adolescent finely tuned to the chaos of her day.A must-read."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"mindy lewis is absolutely amazing. i was particular hooked on the first part of the book (there are 2 parts) which tells of her 'life inside' mental hospitals. completely spine chilling and a definite must read."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"Mindy Lewis was hospitalized in a teaching hospital for mentally ill adolescents and young adults, from the time she was 15 3/4 until she was a little past 18. This \\"memoir\\" describes her family situation, her friends and the staff in the hospital, and her nutty behavior at times (drinks silicone grout on the spur of the moment). Ms. Lewis blames everyone but herself for being put in the hospital. Prior to being admitted, she refused to go to school, took drugs, was promiscuous, and her mother could not control her. Her parents were divorced. Her mom worked and wanted a clean house. Her stepfather walked around in his undershorts. All of this is pretty \\"normal\\", she finds out, for teens in the 60's. Once Ms. Lewis is finally released, she goes through years and years of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, refusing to take any prescribed drugs for these sometimes debilitating conditions. Years later, she seems to have finished going through her phases. She tries to call a few psychiatrists on the carpet about wasting two years of her life in the hospital. But they don't seem to have too much remorse.Ms. Lewis has a way with prose, but the book is extremely disorganized and confusing. She goes back and forth without letting the reader know that's what she's doing (in the end she justifies this by saying it was necessary for the book to \\"flow\\"). Her best friend Marjee, somehow goes from age 13 to 17 (but most of the time she's age 13), while Ms Lewis goes from almost 16 to 18 in the same exact time period. She also somehow manages to graduate from high school by only taking an English class - and that only when she feels like it. I also don't buy the case notes of the staff as being genuine. Another difficult story to believe was when she was in her twenties and had taken two jobs which started the same day, thinking she would considerately decide which one she wanted, on the morning she was to begin. She has an anxiety attack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's). The cops take her to Bellevue, but she talks her way out of that. And where did she get the photo of her topless self on the cover? Did staff or another patient take it?I'm sorry this happened to Ms. Lewis, but I guess I've just read about adolescents who've had it a lot worse. I've even known people who been through much worse. So Ms. Lewis's constant whining and feeling sorry for herself doesn't grab me and make me go \\"Wow - this is amazing, what this woman has gone through.\\" It probably would have helped the book if she had included some of her much talked-about artwork, as well as photographs of her family."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"For some reason I am very curious about the care of the metally ill in the 1960's. If Mindy was sent away in the 1970's up unitl today she would have been in a group home and not treated so much as a mental patient. I can relate to how she felt the need to hide her illness from others. I love the line \\"...sitting on an egg waiting for it to hacth\\" and how it relates to my life and dealing with my illness.

More importantly, this book made me pause and think deeply about the issues Lewis raises regarding the lines between sanity and insanity, the uses and misuses of various therapies and medications by the psychiatric community, and the long-term implications of a scarred adolescence. The author is not only an excellent writer, she is an incredibly brave person to have written such a book. Blows away Susanna Kaysen's &quot;Girl, Interrrupted&quot; with its vivid portrayal of daily life inside a mental institution and its equally important depiction of what happens once you escape such a place (something Kaysen's book did not cover). Lewis's self-portayal is honest and full, her characters are vividly drawn, and you really get a sense of what drove her mother, her doctors, her attendents, her feloow inmates, and herself to behave the way they did -- creating a difficult situation and then enduring it. I'm giving this book to all my friends -- even those who don't normally read memoirs -- because Lewis' book is so much more than that."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"I'm a memoir junkie, and this is one of the most rewarding, carefully written memoirs I have ever read. Lewis insightfully describes each stage of her rich transition from searingly painful adolescence to self-actualized adulthood. I marvel at her narrative's double-voice: she accurately conveys both adolescent self-doubt and emotionally-attuned adult wisdom.Readers who will particularly appreciate this book include lovers of well-wrought prose, and people who feel impaired by something in their past, and cautiously optimistic about their chances of getting over it and/or growing from it."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"This remarkable work describes the harrowing, yet in some ways winsome experience of a remarkable child of the 60s raised in the home of divorced parents and forever rebelling against her 'perfect mother.' At the outset, Mindy is on her way to the institution that is to be her home for 2 1/2 years and most of this memoir is devoted to those times - a life inside with the others inside, those that are patients, those that are employees, and those that are the professionals. Mindy has gone through her medical records of those days and peppered herhistorical descriptions with the views of her psychiatrists as outlined in those records. The life inside is intimately and thoroughly described and one feels not only the horror, the bondings, and the feeling of abandonment, but the eventual resignation. Mindy will come to terms with her issues, her parents and herself as described in the life outside that is the book's second portion. She comes to see 'the other side'. The memoir is written with remarkable sensitivity and emotional candor."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"I think there is a place in literature for a story like Ms. Lewis tells. I thank goodness that for all the mysteries that surround mental illness still, we have come very far from where we were in the '60s.Ms. Lewis does not really address the 'why' - why she was hospitalized in the first place. To hear her tell it, she was just a little rambunctious (and so were all her hospitalized peers). I have to believe that it was much worse than she lets on. Even so, I have a bit of a hard time feeling bad for her when she is hospitalized, because as badly as she wanted out, she refused to toe the line and do what it took to be released. She was constantly causing trouble and getting herself restricted, and she wasn't a stupid, innocent girl by any stretch of the imagination, and undoubtedly this obstinate behavior caused her very lengthy stay.Ms. Lewis critiques her adult behavior with a fine-toothed comb, and speculates how her adult choices are affected by her hospitalization, and by her upbringing.I really felt for her mother, who had the weight of the world on her single-parent shoulders. Ms. Lewis characterizes her as extremely dysfunctional, and blames most of her problems on her.Certainly she was not schizophrenic as she was diagnosed in the hospital, but from her many lengthy descriptions, I saw evidence of possible bi-polar disorder. Unfortunately it seems like she never explored an alternative diagnosis that might have been treated successfully."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"In this insightful and beautifully-written memoir, Mindy Lewis lets us in on her innermost feelings and thoughts while an adolescent inpatient in a psychiatric hospital in the 1960's--and afterward. She candidly recounts her experiences regarding her family, her problems, and what life was like inside a ward at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. A panorama of patients is displayed in a crisp, no-nonsense style, with beautiful imagery and insights delicately woven throughout. The book is extremely well-constructed. Surely anyone under mental or emotional duress will find \\"Life Inside\\" enlightening--let alone encouraging and helpful. And for those somewhat more balanced, it offers much drama and insight too. Mindy Lewis opens her heart and mind as rarely shown and this book surely fills a gap in accounts of those who were \\"there\\" and back. All in all, this warm and poignant recollection is a testament to Mindy Lewis' unwavering search for meaning, truth and understanding, and her coming to terms; it is a bulwark of hope and perhaps redemption. Read it: you'll be touched for today and many tomorrows."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"In this heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking account, Mindy Lewis describes her life journey, framed by her experiences as a teenage patient in a mental ward. Her story is honest and open. As a reader, I could identify with her pain and her experience, even though it is quite different from my own. Many of the feelings she describes are universal, which leads me to question society and its definition of insanity. Throughout her account, Mindy feels \\"different\\" and \\"individualistic\\", most likely as a result of her creativity and ability to visualize and approach life in a less constrained manner. As someone who does not have a similar life experience, I can still relate to those feelings.The book is extremely well-written and vivid, with great attention to physical and emotional detail. The story moves quickly (over 30 years in 350 pages), with its main focus how the 27-months in the institution affected Mindy's life. However, the book also details Mindy's journey to understand her life, the world around her, her family, and how to create meaning from experience, going beyond &quot;life inside&quot;.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"Life Inside has become one of my favorite books.The story of Mindy Lewis, an almost typical teenager of the late sixties in a culture that much of society didn't know how to deal with. (Many \\"normal\\" teenagers found themselves in psych wards then as they do now.) Experimenting with drugs and boys and throwing much caution to the wind forced her mother to make a difficult decision in sending her to P.I.The details used to paint a bleak picture of her two and a half years inside were painful and beautiful at the same time. Mindy is joined by a cast of other teenagers like herself, trapped in a world that they can only escape within themselves. She and the other youths are all in the same boat, \\"Am I sane or insane?\\"The memoir doesn't end there on the inside but also life outside. Mindy's self-doubt about her mother and her family and a lot of reflections on what landed her at a psych hospital in the first place. The luncheon that she has with her mother where they finally have an open dialouge about her mother's decision to send her there is heartwenching. We know Mindy's side. Upon hearing her mother's side you really sympathise and wonder what else could she have done?A loving package of memoir, storytelling, and period piece."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"The story is about a young girl committed to a mental institution in the late 1960's for truancy, using drugs and being mean tempered toward her mother. She spends months in the institution which would never happen now. She writes honestly about her feelings, which can be hard to take, but keep in mind she is an adolescent female being held against her will in a place few of us could stomach. If you are interested in what life was like in institutions for the mentally ill before de-institutionalization, you would be interested in this book."},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"This memoir is a rare gem. Told with complete honesty, lyrical description, and striking imagery, it grabbed me from the first page and never let go. I was fascinated to learn about the mental health system in the 60s and 70s, and how many (though, tragically, not all) were able to persevere after being released from the mental hospital. Mindy has a unique story to tell, and the family story that preceded her being institutionalized was equally compelling. This author is a true talent, and one that I'll certainly be looking out for!"},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","review":"I am intrigued by old hospitals and institutions and bought this book based on the author's stay in such a place. About two-thirds through the book, the location shifted to life on the outside. Now yes, this is all in all a good thing for our character, but up my alley.

He also discusses His unique point of view on death as a process we all should take personal responsibility to prepare for by studying the literature that is available from many different sources, not just His own communications.If you are an ego merely seeking another form of &quot;consolation&quot; this book is definitely NOT for you. But if you have become CONVINCED that there is no ULTIMATE fulfillment to be gained through conditional/dualistic experience, either &quot;worldly&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; and you are ready to begin the real process of &quot;self-transcendance&quot; and Perfect Real-God Realization, or you are intellectually and emotionally prepared to fully CONSIDER a &quot;radical&quot; perspective, then Avatar Adi Da and His Wisdom Teachings as revealed in THE HEART'S SHOUT are here for you."},{"Title":"Enchanted Realms: Tales by Masters of Fantasy","review":"When I heard that James Richey was editing a new anthlogy of fantasy I knew that I had to have it. I was not disappointed. The stories in this book are original and very compelling. I have heard that there are no new plots just old ones being recycled. I think this book proves that wrong. I found the stories, plots and characters original and refreshing. Most of the stories are the first published works of their authors. Long may they write!

It was very easy to discover why and where my pain was coming from, and what to tell the doctor. I have suffered with back pain for 8 years, and have discovered this to be a very useful tool in dealing with the doctors. It is written so well that everyone can understand it without having to have a medical degree. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who suffers from back pain, and would like to find a better understanding of their pain and symptoms. This will be my handbook for any future reference, as symptoms do change. I gained confidence in dealing with my doctor by having a better understanding about the origins of my pain and symptoms.

The authors do a good job of explaining the pysiology of the problem, something many doctors fail to do.

Two books stand out as the best: John Dover Wilson's &quot;What Happens in Hamlet?&quot; and Caroline Spurgeon's &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery.&quot; If I could only keep two Shakespeare books in my library, I would choose these. Dr. Spurgeon spent ten years sifting through the entire Shakespeare canon and pulling out every metaphor and simile she could find. Then, she organized them into like groups. This offered her, and us through her writing, an insight into Shakespeare's creative genius. With evidence in hand, Dr. Spurgeon explored how Shakepeare's mind actually worked; she uncovered his patterns of creative thinking. His abundant use of garden and household images and his relatively few uses of classical or scholarly images show us a writer more in touch with the real everyday world. His childhood homelife, the images one tends to carry throughout one's life, become crystal clear when set side by side in this fashion. In Spurgeon's book, we clearly see that the works of Shakespeare had to have been written by Shakespeare, who was born in small town Stratford, and not the works of a university trained dramatist or a member of Queen Elizabeth's court. It is fascinating to see Shakespeare's images compared and contrasted to those of Marlowe, Dekker, and Johnson. Each writer thought and created images in a unique manner. Seeing and understanding the differences, as expertly explained by Dr. Spurgeon, gives one a deeper insight into and appreciation of one of the greatest minds of all time. If you love Shakespeare then do not miss reading this book."},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"Caroline Spurgeon's &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us&quot; is one of the books you'll most definitely find on the Shakespeare students' bookshelf, and for good reason: nobody outlines the visual images, themes, and motifs in Shakespeare's plays as well as Spurgeon does.Furthermore, Spurgeon doesn't outline themes on a play-by-play basis; instead, she takes a particular image and tells us about ALL of the ways it appears in ANY of the plays. Example: she outlines dream imagery in Richard II, Winter's Tale, Henry VIII, and Romeo and Juliet. This may sound a little confusing, and indeed can be, but it allows a real glimpse into Shakespeare's mind, and allows the reader to see common threads in all of the plays.Also intriguing are the detailed charts in the back of the book that give a visual reference of how prevalent certain images are in Shakespeare's plays: for instance, one chart shows how prevalent sickness, disease, and medicine are in each of the plays.Spurgeon did an amazing amount of work in order to complete this book, and it shows--it's one of the most thorough references available, and it is invaluable to the Shakespeare student, teacher, or scholar. Spurgeon didn't cover EVERYTHING--who could?--and a true scholar might find himself noting what's absent at times. Also, the reading can be a bit boring at times, but it always picks back up quickly, and it really highlights the machinations of Shakespeare's mind. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"This is an innocent book, no scholarly posing (though she is, no doubt, a scholar)... It's a very readable book as well... In fact it's a devourable book... Plays are obviously short on description and description is the most edible part of imaginative writing, so to have all of Shakespeare's imagery for metaphor and symbol and so forth all together right in front of you is very attractive and appetite, if not lust, inducing... She also creatively categorizes everything and compares it all in different ways including comparisons with contemporaries like Marlowe and Jonson and Bacon... A very interesting and delightful Shakespeare (and language) book..."},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"First the author shows that an author's choice of metaphor reflects his life experience. Then she masterfully and convincingly developes what shakespeare's imagery tells us about HIM. Perhaps the most penetrating analysis of this man of genius we will ever have. Charming and moving."},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"This is to my mind, as another reviewer has said, one of the best books about the kind of man Shakespeare must have been. It's entirely grounded in the imagery and metaphor that pervades Shakespeare's works. For good reason it's been in print since 1935. Interestingly--to me at least who takes the authorship question seriously--though Spurgeon connected that kind of man with Shakespeare of Stratford, it applies with more evidence to Edward de Vere. My main reason for saying so has to do with Spurgeon's conclusion that the most central of all imagery in Shakespeare is that of the garden and gardener, (especially, though I don't think she says so, the carefully tended flower garden). So, not by coincidence I think, we find that when de Vere at age twelve was sent to London to live in the household of Lord Burghley (William Cecil) for the next nine years, he was entering an estate \\"the grounds of which must have covered many acres, and were more extensive than those of any of the other private homes in Westminster. John Gerard, well known as the author of Herbal, or General History of Plants (1597), was for twenty years Sir William Cecil's gardener; and Sir William himself evidently took a great pride in his garden ... Cecil imbued his sons and the royal wards under his charge with his own keenness in horticulture.\\" (Ward, The Seventeenth Earl of Oxford 1550-1604 from contemporary documents, 1928). You can follow this line of thinking further with materials on Hank Whittemore's Shakespeare blog.But however you may view the authorship dispute, Spurgeon's book is a treasure."},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"Spurgeon has created an unusual work of literary criticism with charts showing the usage of various imagery in Shakespeare's plays. Fascinating."},{"Title":"SHAKESPEARE'S IMAGERY AND WHAT IT TELLS US","review":"An interesting take on Shakespeare's imagery, although the writing itself can be dull and many of the examples used are cliched.

Starting with an excellent potted history of the wars the book move through strategy and tactics, organisation and then moves in some detail into the worlds of campaigns related topics. Finance, recruitment, hospitals and supply are tackledin amazing detail - ever wondered how much fodder a Hussar suadron got through in a week ? If you did the answer is here and fully explained ! Advice on buying, painting and basing your armies is a little dated in some respects but really only in terms of materials - the advice is still sound. Finally comes a set of very detailed rules so typical of 70s gaming. They are easily adapted and being the 2nd edition of the rules produced in the well know Airfix guide to Napoleonic Wargaming most mechanisms will be familiar to older hands. Overall a unique book in that one really could start from scratch and wargame the Napoleonic wars from this one book.

It will turn you into a cheese snob and ruin any appreciation you currently have for cheese sold in most USA environments. Since reading this very informational 'French Cheese' book, I have yet to find a good 'live' cheese within an one hour drive plus an hour ferry ride of my home. This commute has driven my cheese costs through the roof. My wine costs are now at new heights too, as the suggestions for compatible wines are so interesting. Now my typical day is to get up very early, catch the morning bus (or drive) to the ferry terminal; take the ferry to the city; then walk a distance to a farmer's market area where I can find cheese and wine within a respectable distance from each other. I find a cheese that is still 'alive', look it up in the book, see what wine the 'French Cheese' book recommends, then go to one of the wine shops in the area and try to find that wine. If I cannot find the wine, back to the cheese shop to see what else they have that matches up with one of the cheese / wine recommendations in the 'French Cheese' book. By the time I get all this done it is time for lunch. I go to the one of the local bakeries nearby and get some 'appropriate bread' to go with some of the cheese and wine I purchased, sit down somewhere and have lunch. Then it is time to head for home. It will take me another couple of hours to get home, so it is just in time to start a dinner of some kind, (which is usually based upon one of 'French Cheese' book's cooking with cheese recommendations). I am also afraid that my travel expenses to Europe (France in particular) are going to increase dramatically since most of the cheeses in the 'French Cheese' book are not exported, (and there are so many cheeses to try). I would write more, but I am running late for the ferry. I wish I had never read this damn book."},{"Title":"French Cheese (Eyewitness Companions)","review":"For those who enjoy cheese from time to time, this is an enjoyable little volume. Its focus is on French cheese (I just read and reviewed a book on olive oil, and this is a similar type of work).The book begins with some introductory elements. Among these: the interrelationship among cheese, bread and wine; nutritional value of cheese; French cheese today; the labeling of cheese (a fascinating subject as related here, by the way!); buying, storing, and tasting cheese (one useful hint: let cheese warm up about 1/2 hour before eating, to bring out fuller flavor).But the real heart of this book is the coverage of cheeses. There are over 200 pages of this, so I'll provide a few examples to give a sense of what is covered.Brie: One of my favorite French cheeses (I used to think that it had an odd odor and taste, but with maturity, I have changed my mind!). The region where it is made is just east of Paris. Different kinds of brie are described. The discussion provides the rules that allow one to label the cheese as meeting key standards.Camembert: Another of my favorites. This discussion includes the 32 steps from milking cows to eating a slice of this cheese! Fascinating reading. Again, as with brie, there are many categories of camembert, and it is intriguing to read about the variations.Emmental: Another French cheese that I enjoy immensely. The discussion describes how one type of this cheese (Emmental grand cru) is made.Roquefort: Not a cheese that I eat much. But it is one that is well known. A variety of aspects of this cheese is covered, such as appearance and flavor, legal protection, production, the cheese's \\"home,\\" the blue mold so characteristic of this cheese, and so on.In short, this is a lot of fun! It gives the reader a good sense of the different French cheeses and provides greater context for the next time one sits down to eat some good French cheese!"},{"Title":"French Cheese (Eyewitness Companions)","review":"DK Publishing does it again!

Sober, scholarly, important and controversial, it tells some uncomfortable truths, truths which have unleashed strong emotions disguised as scholarly disagreement.When I first read this book, I was desperate, the mother of three young children, working through the nights to complete an article begging for better family work balance. The irony was not lost on me then or now. I was working in Denmark and I knew the Scandinavian welfare model--which the book discusses--at first hand, both as a researcher and as someone who had lived, worked and borne children there. From my own work, I knew both Popenoe and many of his critics. I interviewed several of them, including one who wrote an influential negative review in the major American sociological journal. I still admire and respect that critic enormously.Yet Popenoe is right. The criticism of Disturbing the Nest is, at best, misplaced, the book's true message misread and misunderstood. Popenoe is accused of wanting to restore the \\"traditional\\" family. As the Scandinavians like to say, he supposedly wants to \\"send the mother back to the stew pots\\". This is not true.What he wants is worse.Popenoe speaks not for a traditional division of labour between parents. He speaks for three things which are far more difficult and demanding: a simple principle, a simple proposition and a simple prescription.Principle: when you have a child--whether you are a person or a society--you need to put the child--not career, not self realization, not political idealogy, but the child--first.Proposition: children come first when they are surrounded by and raised in a loving family, because that is what ENSURES that they thrive.Prescription: \\"coming first\\" involves neither permissive indulgence nor authoritarian repression but the kind of loving, authoritative parenting in which adults take responsibility for outcomes and when the outcome desired is the successful transition from dependence through independence all the way to interdependence, i.e. the emergence of an adult that not only able to support himself and hold down a job, but to nurture a third generation which, in turn, can love and parent, too.In consequence, Popenoe pleads for two things. First, he pleads for authoritative parenting. It is the parenting in which children get to be children because the adults are adults. It is the parenting that stays home and changes the diapers on the toddler when drinking beer with friends would be more fun; the parenting that leaves the vital sales report undone at midnight to drag the 13 year old daughter out of an impromptu schoolnight party to universal contempt; the parenting that, at long last, endures the empty nest and helps the very same daughter to fly free when she is grown.The second thing which Popenoe pleads for, the thing which has gotten most attention, is raising children in stable, devoted families. Despite his critics' accusations, Popenoe does not oppose daycare or divorce per se. He does not oppose single parenthood, blended, same sex or any other alternative family or child care arrangement as such. They can work--sometimes.What he opposes--fiercely--is picking a child rearing setting or a family structure--any structure--for reasons of adult convenience. Devotion to a child means picking what is best for the child and hoping it works for you. It is not choosing the child rearing arrangment that gratifies you and hoping it works for the child.For that reason, Popenoe supports the bourgeois family. As Peter Berger, a famous sociologist, pointed out, the bourgeois family is what emerged when a particular social group--the bourgeoisie--needed and wanted to produce children who could not only survive but thrive and reproduce in a highly competitive economy. Such children require a huge long term investment and a very great deal of love. In other words, they require authoritative parenting in a setting which is both emotionally and financially secure.Now this is actually very, very hard to do, but it is exactly what the bourgeois family is for. No other family forms fits the bill as well. But it takes a huge investment and a huge sacrifice to make it work. It takes putting the child first. It is for this reason that Disturbing the Nest has struck a nerve with both critics and supporters. It is saying that you cannot have it all.It certainly struck a nerve with me. It made me cry. It also relieved my heart and opened my eyes.And today? During the current financial crisis, when the welfare state is rapidly unravelling and Scandinavian day care is losing its luster, the message of Disturbing the Nest is not less relevant than when it came out, but more.Fabulous."},{"Title":"Ralph Compton: Blood and Gold: A Ralph Compton Novel","review":"We're told that Ralph Compton was a tall man who stood 6 feet 8 inches without his boots on.

The very first strip in the book sets the tone. In the middle of the night Calvin wakes up and says he's thirsty. Calvin then goes for a drink of water. Hobbes jumps off the bed and pounces on Calvin as he makes his way back to bed. He parents find him in the hall with Hobbes on top of him, mumbling \\"homicidal psycho jungle cat.\\"While the opening strip is humorous, there are even better strips. Another of my favorites is one of Calvin's infamous \\"show and tell\\" strips. Calvin says he has nothing for show and tell, but he tells everyone that during the daytime his mom puts on a patriotic leotard, a cape and knee-high, high-heeled boots to fight crime. The teacher sends a note home with Calvin that his parent's look over together. His father's comment? \\"Wow, show me that outfit sometime.\\"The breadth of strips is consistent with other Calvin and Hobbes books, but for some reason these strips gave me more laughs than many of my other Calvin and Hobbes Books. However, the funniest strips often seem to be the cruelest. For example, Suzy follows a series of signs regarding an \\"important message,\\" ending in a sign that says, \\"Important message: Look Out!\\" We then see Calvin sitting on a branch dropping a snowball, saying, \\"It's like shooting fish in a barrel.\\"I enjoy Calvin and Hobbes a lot. Of all the illustrated books I have, Calvin and Hobbes are among the funniest, and the most consistent.

Even through his retirement, he has made great books of past comics featuring his Calvin and Hobbes characters. I laugh and laugh at these comics he creates and I sometimes wonder how he comes up with such brilliant ideas sometimes with the storylines of some of the strips.Calvin, one of his best known characters, is the trouble-making kid in the school. He is funny and imaginative and likes to make funa and games with his &quot;real&quot; pet friend Hobbes. Through the comics, you can see the relationship between a stuffed animal and a human.In this comic though, Hobbes &quot;comes to life&quot; in Calvins eyes. The things that Calvin can sometimes get involved in is so hilarious and sometimes out of this world.I guarantee that anyone that loves comics will fall in love with this one and should definitely buy this book to start their collection of classic comics.All of Bill Waterson's comic books are very well done and very professional.

Bullied at school. Clearly a genius level intellect, he's unchallenged and stifled since nobody, not his parents, and not even his teacher, recognizes this. A father who's always too busy to spend any time with his son. A father who's often seen, get this, reading --*reading* -- rather than paying his only son some attention! A mother, who literally, in strip after strip, throws him out the door. Throws, as in \\"child flying through the air\\". A child, and a small child at that, allowed repeatedly to wander alone through the woods! A child denied even a pet. His only friend -- a stuffed tiger.Makes the \\"Peanuts\\" look like \\"The Family Circus\\"."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"The \\"President of the United States\\" Sunday strip may be the essential Calvin and Hobbs.

A little worn, yes, but nothing that made me shake my head in disappointment. Yet besides the good quality of the product's appearance, the content itself is legendary all the more. Calvin and Hobbes are classic in every way, from their innocent (often rude) depictions about life situations to Calvin's take on who Hobbes really is, it's hard to not relate to these two and see yourself in Calvin's six-year-old shoes. Although I wouldn't recommend letting your own children read these, as it may inspire them to act just like Calvin (who is a brat but in a funny, charming way) Ask me how I know, lol. Repeating one of Calvin's rude remarks to some relatives of mine got me in trouble big time as a little 10 year-old, so yeah, don't let Calvin be your child's role model. But, from a mature standpoint, Calvin and Hobbes are loveable characters all the same. There is no swearing or blood or sex in these comics, which is a huge plus, so if you're looking for something dirty like 'Family Guy' then you may be disappointed. But if you want something that'll put a warm smile on your face, then I strongly suggest checking out C & H.

He drives his parents, teachers and neighbors crazy as he lives in his self-centered world of imagination and resents the intrusion of reality and necessity. If it were not for his best friend, the stuffed tiger Hobbes, he most likely would be completely unable to cope.Calvin and Hobbes have always made me laugh and reminisce about my childhood, for I needed few toys, more than happy to play what my brother called \\"pretend.\\" I would stay in the kitchen for hours acting out various scenarios and oblivious to everything else. It annoyed other people, but kept my mind active and was far more interesting than anything that I could have seen on television.

It's hilarious while also being insightful, poignant, and bitingly satirical. As most readers know, since Watterson has written it elsewhere, Calvin is named after John Calvin &quot;a sixteenth century theologian who beleived in predestination&quot;. Hobbes also has a famous historical namesake in Thomas Hobbes, the seventeeth century author of &quot;Leviathan&quot; whose most famous saying is that life in a state of nature would be &quot;Nasty, brutish, and short&quot;. From such a foundation, readers can expect more than a wacky strip full of slapstick, puns and sitcom-type pet or baby humor. There is much more, because Calvin and Hobbes, like all of the great comic strips, has depth. Reading just a handful of strips reveals this.This collection from 1994 includes a great satire on conceptual art (Calvin tries to sell Hobbes a landscape in a Sunday strip); a great satire on corporate philosophy (Calvin ends up telling his mother that he needs to be subsidized); Hobbes sends Calvin anonymous insults in the mail (&quot;Most people have secret admirers, you have a secret detractor&quot;); &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; invades Calvin's class to take an exam in Calvin's place (he still flunks); one of the best is a single panel strip in which Calvin asks his parents &quot;What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?&quot;; There are also loads of Watterson's great Sunday strips. Watterson is definitely one of the last cartoonist artists that fully appreciated the boundaries (or lack of them) of the color Sunday strip. Calvin's imagined dinosaurs, aliens, parodies of &quot;Judge Parker&quot; type strips, and multicolor tiger battles are amazing works of cartoon art. It's difficult to find anything that even comes close on today's incredibly shrinking Sunday comics page.Bill Watterson remains heavily elusive. What has he been doing since he voluntarily quit Calvin and Hobbes? Internet searches (at least cursory ones) don't elucidate much (one mentions that he is an intensely private individual - no doubt). Hopefully he's planning another amazing strip. Whether we hear from him again or not, in the end, we can be happy that he took up cartoonist's pen and graced the newspapers with at least one more great strip."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This collection of Calvin and Hobbes strips is just a bit more twisted than many of the other collections. The very first strip in the book sets the tone. In the middle of the night Calvin wakes up and says he's thirsty. Calvin then goes for a drink of water. Hobbes jumps off the bed and pounces on Calvin as he makes his way back to bed. He parents find him in the hall with Hobbes on top of him, mumbling \\"homicidal psycho jungle cat.\\"While the opening strip is humorous, there are even better strips. Another favorite is one of Calvin's infamous \\"show and tell\\" strips. Calvin says he has nothing for show and tell, but he tells everyone that during the daytime his mom puts on a patriotic leotard, a cape and knee-high, high-heeled boots to fight crime. The teacher sends a note home with Calvin that his parent's look over together. His father's comment? \\"Wow, show me that outfit sometime.\\"The breadth of strips is consistent with other Calvin and Hobbes books, but for some reason these strips gave me more laughs than many of my other Calvin and Hobbes Books. However, the funniest strips often seem to be the cruelest. For example, Suzy follows a series of signs regarding an \\"important message,\\" ending in a sign that says, \\"Important message: Look Out!\\" We then see Calvin sitting on a branch dropping a snowball, saying, \\"It's like shooting fish in a barrel.\\"I enjoy Calvin and Hobbes a lot. Of all the illustrated books I have, Calvin and Hobbes are among the funniest, and the most consistent. This particular collection is particularly funny, though a bit more bizarre than many of the other collections. However, it is the twisted nature of some of the strips that make them so interesting and funny. If you are a Calvin and Hobbes fan or just looking for a smile, here is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This collection has a few of my favorites in it (especially the girls/bugs analogy - priceless!) Great for any age - I read C&H starting around age 7 and I still read it today! I enjoy it just as much, though I see it from a unique perspective now. Every kid should grow up with this."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"I think that this is the funniest collection yet by Bill Waterson of his world famous \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\".This is the book that I think has the funniest stupendous man comics when Calvin turns into stupendous man, takes a test, and still flunks!!!It also has some funny ones when Calvin and Hobbes ride off such giant snow mountains such as \\"Gizzard Gulch\\". I think has to be the coolest collection yet I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"Some parents tell me that \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" isn't a comic, it's a documentary.Calvin is the small boy with a vivid life of mind, or over-active imagination, or clear break from consensual reality, choose your words. Hobbes is a mysterious being. With Calvin, he's a charming, philosophical, debonair spirit of the natural world. When Calvin's parents appear, he becomes something completely different - if you don't already know, I won't spoil the surprise.Calvin travels to distant planets, he battles dinosaurs or becomes them, he commands travel through time, and he is plagued by his evil robot alter-ego. His parents and teachers disagree, of course. Through it all, he remains blindly and merrily the star of his own show. There really is something seductive about his little world, and the way it spins only around himself. If there's a tragedy in growing up, Calvin leaves it for you to define for yourself.This is a wonderful collection of C&H; strips. It's too bad that Watterson shut the comic strips down long ago, but he didn't want C&H; to lose their freshness. Maybe he need not have worried - ten years later, these haven't lost anything.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"\\"From now on,\\" says Calvin, \`I'll connect the dots in my OWN way.\\" In the strips featured in HOMICIDAL PSYCHO JUNGLE CAT, Calvin and cartoonist Bill Watterson do just that: they connect dots by looking at the world through the very old eyes of a young boy, and the results are both hilarious and thought-provoking.A decade ago, Calvin and his buddy Hobbes the tiger romped through the daily comics in a ground-breaking strip. The humor was often dark, the artwork (especially in the Sunday versions) was unique, and Calvin's self-absorbed observations were sometimes too close to my own private thoughts for comfort.This volume, published in 1994, is Calvin at his best. The book includes daily and full-color Sunday strips for about a year. We see Calvin in a four-season cycle from the trademark snowmen of winter to the tormenting of Susie-next-door in high summer. All of the characters that made the strip great are included. This collection is an excellent way to become reacquainted with Calvin or to discover him for the first time."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This is by far the best Calvin and Hobbes book ever written. It contains Calvin as Stupendous Man trying to pass his test, mean letters from Hobbes, and a best poster contest. Spaceman Spiff will leave you laughing and so will the dinosaour ones. Heck the whole book will leave you laughing. You're going to want to read more and more of it."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This book is called Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. This book is great. It's very entertaining and funny. This book could be read by adults and children. Some words are difficult. It's a comic strip. The characters are Calvin and Hobbes.

And the strip on page 60 is my personal favorite for this collection."},{"Title":"Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat, a Calvin and Hobbes Collection","review":"This book is so hilarious.

If they were well mannered all the time, (Yawn) Then this comic strip would be boring.I'm rating this book five stars. It's a great book, and I recommend this to other Calvin and Hobbes fans.

By reading through the whole thing in an hour or so, it made me remember why I was crazy about these books when I was around 11 or 12 years old. The jokes in this book still make me laugh, and the more serious comics still make me think. Unlike most comics, Calvin and Hobbes isn't just for little kids, it can be understood by about anyone. I like how there are many story lines in this, from Calvins troubles at school, to his imaginary adventures of Spaceman Spiff, to Stupendous Man, to Moe the Bully...and there are so many more, including how Hobbes &quot;comes alive&quot;.

In his Introduction, a thoughtful essay on Yiddish, he asserts that although he born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1934, he grew up in a one hundred percent Yiddish-speaking world (&quot;I didn't know that anybody in this country spoke English until I was old enough to go to the movies.&quot;) His family moved back to New York before he was five.This little book contains a wealth of Masonisms. Jackie Mason used to have run-ins with censors and others. He reserves the right to be both self-deprecating and insulting. Jews, gentiles, politics, marriage, family, ethnicity, money, power, and God himself - all are up for grabs. There are a lot of funny stories. In addition, he has an understanding of the Yiddish language that he is happy to share. (Harry Truman was haimish - accessible, natural - FDR was not. Colorful explanation is provided.) He offers a theory of chicken soup that links it -successfully - to most of the world's cuisines. He is never dull. Mason: &quot;It seems that in English that you have to prove that you're not emotional in order to have class.&quot; He posits his sociolinguistic theory (which you've heard if you've seen or heard his stage show) that the more emotional the speech - content and structure - the more &quot;low class&quot; the speaker. He defends emotionality. He loves Yiddish, and in fact the language (black English, specifically) of any people engaged in a battle of wits to survive.A funny and endearing book."},{"Title":"How to Talk Jewish","review":"Only a meshuggener would not find this book entertaining and informative.

WinokurThis 138 page 8 by 11\\" soft bound volume is a unique contribution to the literature of pyrotechnics. In addition to the two primary authors there are eight other contributors listed including Ettore Contestabile who is listed as a senior editor and contributor. I am in an unusual position in that I am among those listed as contributors, but have also been asked to write this review. My contribution was mainly as a proof reader, although I submitted a number of additional entries and suggestions.The content of this volume is eclectic in the extreme. It contains entries on all aspects of fireworks, from regulatory definitions to Italian and Japanese shell making. It also contains a large variety of terms used in rocketry which are not normally seen in the fireworks literature. In addition there are many terms taken from high explosive science and technology, and some from stage and movie special effects. To illustrate the eclectic nature of this volume one only has to open the pages at random. For example, on pages 74 and 75 we find \\"M-80\\" defined: \\"One type of small but powerful exploding device...\\". In the next entry we find \\"Mach Diamonds\\": Diamond shaped features exhibited by the exhaust plume of rocket motors and engines\\"... Several entries later we find \\"Magnesium, Magnalium, Magnesium carbonate and Magnus Force\\". Terms are sometimes grouped together based on their being closely related in definition rather than strictly alphabetically. For example, the terms \\"Color Purity\\", \\"Color Species\\" and \\"Color Spectrum\\" come before \\"Colored Heart\\" and \\"Colored Smoke\\". Although this is unusual in a dictionary, it is an extremely functional aspect of the volume.The entries are usually considerably more than brief definitions. On average an entry is composed of a short paragraph or more, and often includes one or more illustrations in the form of diagrams, drawings and graphs. In some instances a series of closely related entries may take up several pages. For example, if one searches for the term \\"Mortar\\", the following entries are found: Mortar (fireworks), Mortar (special effects), Mortar Burst, Mortar Length, Mortar Organization, Mortar Placement, Mortar Plug, Mortar Racks, Mortar Racks - Dense-Pack, Mortar Strength, and Mortar Trough. These eleven entries take about 2 pages and contain a wealth of information on structure, physical properties, composition, safety, and functions of mortars.Virtually all commonly, and many not so commonly, used pyrotechnic chemicals are included. The chemical entries are necessarily brief but usually contain sufficient information to equip a reader with a fundamental understanding of the chemical. The entries on a chemical provide its physical appearance (e.g., \\"a white powder\\" or \\"a silvery metal\\") and the major ways the chemical is used.There exists an entire set of devices and terms that are used in the movie special effects industry that are not adequately addressed in this volume. Although common devices such as \\"bullet hit\\" are defined, many other commonly used devices and materials are not included, for example, \\"silver match\\" and \\"mortar hit\\". However, in this regard there is a major problem in writing a dictionary of this type. How should the names of commercial devices be treated? The authors have made almost no attempt to address this issue (and generally for good reasons). Their solution has been to exclude nearly everything that is strictly or primarily the name of a consumer device. (Although there are a few notable exceptions to this, especially in the explosive technology area such as \\"Nomatch\\" and \\"Igniter Cord\\", which are included.)The fact that there may be multiple terms used to refer to the same phenomena, device or material is fully recognized in this dictionary, and there are often parenthetical synonyms found after an entry. Somewhat less fully recognized is the fact that there are sometimes multiple uses of the same term. When this is recognized there is a parenthetical comment indicating that the term is about to be defined in a certain context - say either \\"fireworks\\" or \\"rocketry\\" or \\"special effects\\" or \\"explosives\\". It is rare when a term is fully recognized to have more than one meaning within a broad context. A good example of this is the term \\"prime\\". At the term \\"prime\\", the dictionary directs one to \\"See Pyrotechnic Prime\\". At \\"Pyrotechnic Prime\\" a reasonable definition is provided. \\"Priming\\" however, is defined in a completely separate entry as a \\"process performed to help insure ignition or initiation\\" (emphasis mine). If the following sentence were to confuse you, I'm afraid that the dictionary would not immediately come to the rescue. \\"The prime turned out to be hygroscopic and a week later we were forced to prime all the fuses again with a newly formulated prime.\\" It seems to me that the term \\"prime\\" is both a verb and a noun and it should be unnecessary to skip about the dictionary to discover this fact.Reading this dictionary is an education in itself. I learned much that I found interesting, especially about explosive technology. I suspect purchasers will find that they will wish to use the volume not only when a question comes to mind, but will pour through it as any avid \\"pyro\\" does with all new sources of information. And since the Kosanke's preface makes it clear that this is the first of a series of efforts, and that readers are requested to submit suggestions for \\"additional terms to be included\\", I believe that the dictionary will become increasingly encyclopedic in scope and thus increasingly useful. This volume has no parallel and it belongs on the bookshelf of every person claiming to be interested in pyrotechnics. I will end this review with a suggestion for a new entry: \\"Pyro\\" - Slang for any individual with a strong interest and involvement in pyrotechnics, sometimes prefaced with \\"true\\" to distinguish dilettantes from the \\"real thing\\".

This book is good if you are intrested in Pirotecnics, but not to serious with it. If you are just learning how to blow stuff up, and if you aren't doing anything big then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"The title of this little book is somewhat misleading in that you might assume that it contains fairy tales. Actually, it contains 25 illustrations of fairy tales and on each facing page it has a very short stanza or two of some famous fairy poem or story. You will find Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, The Little Mermaid, La Belle Dame sans Merci as well as two other poems about fairies. The book is a very thin little volume only 4&quot; x 6&quot;, rather poorly laid out with many of the pictures showing uneven borders of white at top and bottom, while others have no borders and still others are printed sideways so that you have to turn the book to get a good look at them. The illustrations for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; section of this book are cropped from larger prints that accompany a much better book by Hans Christian Andersen and Wulfing entitled &quot;The Little Mermaid.&quot; This book is rather too highly priced for the quality. Having shared my disappointments let me say that this book is still very much worth having if you enjoy the exquisite work of this enigmatic artist. This book features many prints of lovely otherwordly looking girls with beautiful and intricate knights in shining armour. Fabulous unearthly flowers grace the pictures in tangles of vines and branches, ribbons and knotwork. Flowing veils, robes, cloaks and tresses add softness and mystery to the work. The people seem to exude a soft light. If you are not familiar with Wulfing you may want to seek out a calendar or the larger books like &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; or &quot;Miracle of Tears&quot; or perhaps one of her several oracle decks of cards. If you are a fan of Sulamith Wulfing then do not let any of my criticisms get in the way of enjoying the prints in this book. My complaints are about the book not the art or this incredible artist."},{"Title":"Fairy tales","review":"This will be short. The art was wonderful.

The author does a first class job in introducing the reader to the field of algebraic geometry, using a wealth of examples and with the goal of building intuition and understanding. It is great that a mathematician of the author's caliber would take the time to write these lectures here put into book form. It is rare to find a book on algebraic geometry that attempts to make the subject concrete and understandable, and yet points the way to more modern &quot;scheme-theoretic&quot; formulations.In lecture 1, the author introduces affine and projective varieties over algebraically closed fields. Linear subspaces of n-dimensional projective space P(n) are shown to be varieties, along with any finite subset of P(n). He delays giving rigorous definitions of degree and dimension, emphasizing instead concrete examples of varieties. The twisted cubic is given as the first example of a concrete variety that is not a hypersurface, along with their generalizations, the rational normal curves.The Zariski topology, considered by the newcomer to the subject as being a rather &quot;strange&quot; topology, is introduced in lecture 2. The author does a great job though explaining its properties, and introduces the regular functions on affine and projective varieties. The Nullstellensatz theorem, needed to prove that the ring of regular functions is the coordinate ring, is deferred to a later lecture. Rational normal curves are further generalized to Veronese maps in this lecture, and the properties of the corresponding Veronese varieties discussed in some detail. Also, the very interesting Segre varieties are discussed here. With these two examples of varieties, the reader already can develop a good geometric intution of the behavior of typical varieties. The Veronese and Segre maps are then combined to give another example of a variety: the rational normal scroll. More concrete examples of varieties are given in the next two lectures, including cones, quadrics, and projections. A &quot;fiber bundle&quot; approach to forming families of varieties parametrized by a given variety is outlined here also.The author finally gets down to more algebraic matters in lecture 5, with the Nullstellensatz proven in great detail. He also discusses the origins of schemes in algebraic geometry, giving the reader a better appreciation of just where these objects arise, namely the association to an arbitrary ideal, instead of merely a radical ideal.Grassmannian varieties are then introduced in lecture 6, along with some of its subvarieties, such as the Fano varieties. The join operation, widely used in geometric topology, is here defined for two varieties.More connections with the modern viewpoint are made in lecture 7, where rational functions and rational maps are discussed. The author takes great care in explaining in what sense rational maps can be thought of as maps in the &quot;ordinary&quot; sense, namely they must be thought of as equivalence classes of pairs, instead of acting on points. The very important concept of a birational isomorphism is discussed also, along with blow-ups and blow-downs of varieties.Many more concrete examples of varieties are given in lectures 8 and 9, such as secant varieties, flag manifolds, and determinantal varieties. In addition, algebraic groups on varieties are discussed in lecture 10, allowing one to discuss a kind of glueing operation on varieties, just as in geometric topology, namely by taking the quotient of varieties via finite groups.The author then moves on to giving a more rigorous formulation of dimension, giving several different definitions, all of these conforming to intuitive ideas on what the dimension of an algebraic variety should be, and also one compatible with a purely algebraic context. Again, several concrete examples are given to illustrate the actual calculation of the dimension of a variety, both in this lecture and the next one.The next lecture is very interesting and discusses an important problem in algebraic geometry, namely the determination of how many hypersurfaces of each degree contain a projective variety in P(n). The solution is given in terms of the famous Hilbert polynomial, which is determined for rational normal curves, Veronese varieties, and plane curves in this lecture. The author also explains the utility of using graded modules in the determination of the Hilbert polynomial, something that is usually glossed over in most books on this topic. This discussion leads to the Hilbert syzygy theorem.Some analogs of basic contructions in differential geometry are defined for varieties in the next four lectures, based on an appropriate notion of smoothness. The tangent spaces, the Gauss map, and duals discussed here.Then in lecture 18 the author makes good on his promise in earlier lectures of making the notion of the degree of a projective variety more rigorous. The well-known Bezout's theorem is proven, after introducting a notion of transversal intersection for varieties. As usual in the book, several examples are given for the calculation of the degree, including Veronese and Segre varieties, in this lecture and the next.The behavior of a variety at a singular point is studied in lecture 20 using tangent cones. The author proves the resolution of singularities for curves here also.Lecture 21 is very important, especially for the physicist reader working in string and M-theories, as the author introduces the concept of a moduli space. Most results are left unproven, but the intuition gained from reading this lecture is invaluable. The all-important Chow and Hilbert varieties are discussed here. The book the ends with a fairly lengthy overview of quadric hypersurfaces."},{"Title":"Algebraic Geometry: A First Course (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) (v. 133)","review":"Last year we used this title as a main reference for the first two quarters of a year-long introductory sequence on algebraic geometry, at the beginning graduate student level (2nd year). Our professor --who was himself a former student of Harris, and a specialist in the Mori program-- backed up the presentation with personal lecture notes, moving mostly in parallel to the book's topics. In the third quarter of the sequence, we moved up to cover the theory of sheaves and schemes from Robin Hartshorne's advanced treatise. Prior to this point, my only exposure to the subject was from the corresponding chapter in Dummit and Foote's algebra, and also from a recent introductory text, \\"An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry\\" by Karen Smith et al. At this stage of my studies I was mainly testing the waters; my ineterest on the one hand was driven by a curiosity for the subject itself, which has a reputation for being difficult and hard to grasp, and on the other hand, from its pivotal role in the formulation of new physical theories of mirror symmetry and string theory (for more in this direction, see the 1999 AMS title by A. Cox and S. Katz).Back to the present text, as the editorial notes correctly point out, this Harris book emphasizes the classical algebraic geometry from the 19th & early 20th centuries prior to the introduction of highly abstract machinery, due to the work of A. Groethendieck in the 50's and 60's. Therefore it's quite natural to base the treatment mostly on the examples and concrete constructions, which were the guiding principles of the abstract development in the first place. This approach also makes the subject accessible for the newcomers who may not have an advanced background in commutative algebra or category theory, and who may not be intending to specialize in the area but merely wish to gain a general understanding of the ideas involved. I found my experience with the subject very fulfilling, and enjoyed many aspects of the presentation. I only suspect many of you could have a similar rewarding experience embarking upon this journey! For the application-oriented readers, I should recommend the Springer-Verlag title \\"Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms\\" by Cox et al. which has separate chapters on the Groebner bases, invariant theory, and the robotics."},{"Title":"Algebraic Geometry: A First Course (Graduate Texts in Mathematics) (v. 133)","review":"This book is not a good first text for a person trying to learn algebraic geometry.

This is a good book for such a purpose, it covers much. (This review is on the third edition).Unit I has 5 chapters covering the fundamentals of musical theory. Sound, time, pitch, structure, form and style. Unit II is a 4-chapter overview of early music, starting with the Middle Ages. Unit III covers the 18th century in 6 chapters, starting with Late Baroque. Unit IV focuses on the 19th century, starting with Beethoven and finishing with the Late Romantics in 5 chapters.Unit V: The Twentieth Century, was my favourite section. The prelude chapter discusses the concepts of music and modernism. The next chapter covers the early 20th century, then there is a chapter on alternatives to modernism, and the fourth chapter covers the late 20the century. Chapter 24 focuses on music in America: Jazz.The book is organised around listening samples. These are available on a set of a 6 accompanying CDs. I liked the samples chosen. The late 20th century chapter, for example, discussed works by Ligeti, Berio, Varese, Cage, Crumb, Leon, Gubaidulina and Reich.An alternative to \\"Listen\\" is Music: An appreciation\\" by Roger Kamien. It seems to me to have a bit more on artistic context, whilst at the same time covering more topics at slightly more depth.However, \\"Listen\\" is well organised (always a good sign), and richly illustrated. Historical events are touched upon, and there is some reference to other art forms in context with the music of the time.

The charts compare hundreds of the major differences, separated into where entire verses are omitted, where key words are omitted, and other differences that substantially affect the meaning of a verse. Other books are necessary to thoroughly understand the history of textual criticism (The King James Version Defendedis the best I've read) and Gordon Clark'sLogical Criticisms of Textual Criticismgoes into in depth analysis of the particular differences in the verses. This book tends more to show you the differences than explain them.In all, it matters what version of the Bible you read. I think the story of the adulterous woman in John 8 belongs in the Bible!

I've been in five major guerrilla wars (Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Lebanon), and alt. I had previous experience with all kinds of land-warfare weapons, sometimes you need a gun and can not get one, even in a land in War. Old warriors never die (they only go to Hell to regroup), and I even ask some \\"insiders\\" on contrating me to work in Iraq, earlier this year, as a \\"security advisor\\", but they find me too fat & unfit to be of use in there... a close friend, former Royal Marine and veteran of Northern Ireland and Malvinas/Falklands, who lived in another big town here, go there, and now is doing what he was trained for... and alt. in all wars we once fought we can get any ammount of firearms, ammo, support weapons, you name it, there was a lack of combat weapons to the common citizens there, who are not a \\"Soldiers-of-Fortune\\" like I was. If I had this amazing book with me on \\"my wars\\" back in the '80's, I could have helped hundreds of indigenous guys survive \\"their\\" Wars,and so I could have done things in a better, faster, more funny way, if you can get what I'm talking about. I love the idea of making weapons with simple, common, cheap tools & parts, weapons that can be a life-saving tool in dark times. Be sure that these cheap guns are as capable in short-time combat as the most expensive military guns ever avaiable and they are at anyone's reach - even without any experience in this field. If you want real weapons, this is the book for you. This book tells all the \\"secrets\\" in a way it CAN be put into practice. It's author is a Paladin of Freedom. Buy this book - you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"I have my doubts about the longevity in use of a gun constructed from this book, but the book is more professionally written and more thorough than I have come to expect in this genre. There is certainly a lot of ingenuity shown here, and it is believable that the plans could result in a workable gun. This book is definitely worth study. One minor complaint would be the author's odd mixing of inch and metric dimensions, often in the same sentence. Maybe that's how it is in Great Britain these days?

To see a 5x increase in some gun prices in four months was clearly panic buying knowing democrats will one day target guns and those who practice those freedoms as problem and will one day move against them again has become a reality.

More specifically it shows in great detail how to make a crude but very functional 9mm sub machine gun out of steel tubing and common springs. using nothing but simple hand tools. No welding, no lathe, no milling machine. You don't even need an electric drill.This isn't a theoretical exercise. Luty has done it and got in trouble with the English police when he showed it off. It is a cookbook, complete with templates and very complete instructions. If you wanted to do it -- and don't mind spending some time in jail, as Luty did -- you can easily fabricate your very own submachine gun.It is, of course, highly illegal, in England, the United States and most other countries. I'm also skeptical of the safety and reliability of the design. But if you follow the instructions carefully you should get at least a couple of magazines worth of shooting out of the result.As a practical matter, the main value of this book is demonstrating just how easy it is to make a modern gun. Nor is the point merely theoretical. There is a booming garage industry in making guns like this in Chechnya, Nigeria and other places. It would be a lot easier to do it in the United States."},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"Very impressive, I don't believe Mr. Luty is a threat to the public, but judging from what the British government has had to say about him, he is still a threat, I would say a mortal threat, to the status quo, vis-a-vis British gun laws. I have read Bill Holmes. I have read Metral. Luty's book is the only one that I came away from with the impression that I might actually be able to build the gun the author showed how to make, no machine tools required. The lack of a rifled barrel makes that possible. The instructions did require a thorough reading and re-reading, in my case, before I really \\"got it\\", but aside from a few minor spelling and grammatical errors, they were very clear, step-by-step, and concise, while of sufficient detail to properly demonstrate the concepts involved. The author provides cutting templates, and all the needed specifications for the the necessary materials. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject of improvised firearms.I will not be building this firearm, nor would I advocate that to anyone else. The BATF has no more sense of humor than the British constabulary on this subject. But I think such books are vitally important because they make it clear to politicians that such things are possible and keep them all just that little bit fearful of what the general populace might do if they ever go too far. I think a little bit of that sort of fear in the back of the minds of those in power is a healthy thing for a free society interested in remaining free. So long as it is there, the instructions in Mr. Luty's book will probably not need to be followed."},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"Very informative book.

The only annoyances are a few listings of metric measurements when referring to aome material that is a standard (i.e. 2&quot; x 1&quot;) American size, and a typo or two. Normally I am a stickler for these things, but due to the fact tht this book delivers on its claims warrants a high rating.

However, a person is prohibited from assembling a non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.[18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and 479.105]So it is NOT ILLEGAL for someone to make the gun in this or any other book as long as it is built as a sporting semi-auto weapon. Making it a full auto weapon would be illegal not as a semi-auto.

ABC"},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"First off, let me just say much respect to Mr. Luty. The fact that he went to prison over this book tells us more than we think. This is a good book and is probably better than most, if not all, \\"do it yourself\\" gun guides on the market (but I haven't read many). It doesn't require a whole machinist workshop, it doesn't require a lot of money, and the weapon could be produced in bulk if necessary. I haven't built it yet, so some of that could prove untrue. I don't think Mr. Luty has lied to us though. If you want details on durability, accuracy, etc., you're going to have to ask someone who has built it. I would assume that any problems with the gun Mr. Luty did not cover could be easily solved.Now, this book is not really a laymen's guide to building a submachine gun, but as I said, it does not require a lot. If you have some good experience with tools, you will have no problems. Geez, if you had Shop in high school, you probably won't struggle much. Me? Nah, the ATF can breathe one more sigh of relief. I'd probably drill holes in my fingers before I got anywhere near the lower receiver! Don't get me wrong, anyone can do this but I suggest you have someone with a decent amount of workshop experience around if you're not familiar with the tools or materials. I opened the book, looked at the tools and on a few, I just went \\"huh?\\" Coming from a family of carpenters, I suspect they would be ashamed. Meh, maybe they would just be ashamed to know I had the book. It's a moot point though.So if you have some experience with building things, specifically out of steel tubes, you can probably build this. If you know what a countersink tool is... ehhh... you're ahead of me. The bottom line is that if you think you can build the thing, you probably can (for display only and with the proper licenses, of course).Oh, and thankfully there IS a picture of the finished product and it DOES look pretty cool, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"This book is a good read from the start it shows you how to build a submachine gun in 9mm from common garage tools using tubing everyone should have this nolege execept gangs and criminals but everyday citizen strongly recommend BE WARNED ANY CONSTRUCTION LISTED IN THIS BOOK CAN'T BE BUILT WITHOUT THE CORRECT PROMISION FROM THE ATF !!!!"},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"The instructions are quite good and clear and simple.If you want to learn how to make your own 9mm submachine gun this is the book for you!

It explains how to make a 9mm SMG with only a few tools and pieces of metal.

The end product described has a smooth-bore barrel. I think the hardest part would be finding small quantities of the different size and shapes of metal tubing and finding and modifying the right sized reamer for making the chamber.

Read the book, but don't act on it!\\"The prisoner was convicted in Leeds Crown Court on 24th.April 1998 of the manufacture of a prohibited weapon...............he was sentenced to a total of four years imprisonment. Mr.Luty admitted a long term interest in guns and gun making (3) ...At the time of interview he expressed strong views about the stringent gun laws in this country and on issues related to the individual and the state. To an extent he appears to have embraced the views promulgated by much of the \\"Right to keep and bear arms\\" lobby in the United States. I understand police seized a number of publications making reference to these views ....Whilst there is no evidence to suggest Mr.Luty has established any contact with militia or other extreme groups in the United States , his apparent sympathy for their views is of ongoing concern (4) ...............of special concern , I understand Mr.Luty's brother attempted to send him an article from the internet by an organization called \\"Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership\\" (JPFO) (5). This appears to be yet another \\"Right to keep and bear arms\\" group. Since his imprisonment, Mr.Luty's mother has died and I understand his father remains chronically ill............The prisoner's attitude to the role of the state and the possession and use of firearms gives rise to serious concern. This ,taken together with...the anti-authority stance exhibited during this sentence, adds to the concern that he could represent a very great danger to members of the public in future. The fact that his mother has died since imprisonment and that he appears to have developed an embittered view of his treatment in prison may reinforce his anti-social and anti- authority attitudes, making the likelihood of grave crimes being committed in the future even more likely. (6)In all the circumstances, in my opinion, the presumption must be that he is potentially dangerous and the case must be managed accordingly. The prisoner has not shown any progress in understanding the concerns highlighted in his case and, if anything, appears even more intransigent in his views than before conviction. Therefore, in my view, he is not a suitable candidate for early release on parole. His future supervision on licence will have to be undertaken with a view to managing risk to the public as an overriding priority."},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"Ok this book takes you step by step through making the 9mm youl love it so easy to make that i all ready had all the parts at home buy this book if you want a effective close range machinegun and no it is not hard to make as other reviewers have said they just are mentaly defective they were proberly born with downsindrome. poor fat little mental patients.buy this book and learn to make your first machinegun enjoy."},{"Title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"As this book clearly states: 'This material is presented for academic study only.'

When I say real, I mean that you'd have more confidence it wouldn't blow up.Having said that, the academic interest in this gun is just to see how simple it is to build a gun, and in turn, how impossible it is to prevent the manufacture of weapons by simply passing a law.The particular gun described here is the simplest I've ever seen. It's constructed from commonly available steel tubing. (I didn't realize that so many standard tubing sizes were so close to what was needed for gun building.) Strangely enough, you don't even need a lathe or milling machine for this gun. Everything is made using hand tools such as hacksaw and file. Normally accepted things such as rifling in the barrel and sights are simply eliminated.One final comment. He uses a series of 'steel collars' in his design. I presume that's a British term.

He succeeds entirely in describing how to build a simple machine gun using basic and commonly available tools and materials, and this makes for a great academic source for understanding the realities of what a \\"firearm\\" really is & how counterproductive extreme firearms laws can be. Would this book exist if the UK laws weren't so ridiculously excessive? Not according to the author.The project is clearly minimalist & therefore won't entirely satisfy those who want a paint-by-numbers approach to a beautifully finished weapon, but that's nothing that a little imagination, Gun-Kote finish & some wood or resin grips wouldn't resolve.My sympathies to the author for the harsh price he is paying for completing this book. He was jailed for being in possession of the gun that he built, & after his release he published the www.thehomegunsmith.com website (presently offline) for which he is currently being charged with \\"conspiracy to supply firearms\\" by the police (as of Feb 2005; see http://www.ncc-1776.com/tle2005/tle313-20050403-02.html).I'm sure we used to have the right to free speech over here in England because I read it somewhere.

Written while imprisoned in Bedford gaol for nonconformity, these two treatises show Christians the beauty, power, and awe of true prayer. In the first, Bunyan describes prayer as being &quot;in the Spirit&quot;, and &quot;with understanding&quot; (1 Cor. 14:15). In the second, the theme is the Christian's privilege of approaching &quot;the Throne of Grace&quot; (Heb. 4:16).Beware! says Bunyan. &quot;You are not a Christian if you are not a praying person. The promise is that every one that is righteous shall pray (Ps. 32:6). You then are a wicked wretch if you do not.&quot; Surely this is a serious call to prayer!But he also gives an encouragement: &quot;If [God] had said, I will commune with thee from my throne of judgment, then indeed you might have trembled and fled from the face of the great and glorious Majesty. But when he says he will hear and commune with souls upon the throne of grace, or from the mercy-seat, this should encourage you, and cause you to hope, nay, to 'come boldly unto the throne of grace, that you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'&quot; Surely this is a wonderful word for Christian and non-Christian alike - God is on his Throne of Grace, and He can be approached through prayer!Read this book, and learn of the true biblical understanding of prayer from one of the greatest writers in all history!"},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"The Banner of Truth Trust's Prayer collects two of John Bunyan's works in one volume. Praying in the Spirit (1662) provides instruction and encouragement for Christians to pray personally and spontaneously to God, without the use of written forms of supplication. The Throne of Grace, published posthumously in 1692, is actually not so much about prayer as Christ's office as high priest, which enables Christians to confidently bring their prayers to him.Praying in the Spirit provides much practical teaching on prayer that will prove beneficial to many Christians. The only drawback lies in Bunyan's total rejection of liturgical forms of prayer, which he sees as antithetical to heart prayers inspired by the Holy Spirit. Given the year this work was published, it's hard not to conclude that it's partially a polemic against the Church of England's then-new 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Still, even Christians who disagree with Bunyan on this matter (and I am one of them) can only wince as he attacks those who persecuted him and put him in prison for opposing such prayers. (Praying in the Spirit was written in the same prison where Bunyan later received the dream that inspired his best-known work, The Pilgrim's Progress.)The Throne of Grace, in contrast, contains very little practical instruction on prayer. Rather, it is a far-reaching, lofty meditation on Christ's role as high priest and how his work benefits the Christian. If you tend to contrast the Puritans with the medieval Christian mystics, as I have been prone to do, this work may shake your view a little. As Bunyan meditates on the throne of grace and all that surrounds it in Heaven, and argues that Christ is both several of the objects seen there and separate from those objects, it's hard not to apply the word \\"mystical\\" to Bunyan's musings. (\\"Mystical,\\" by the way, is not a dirty word per se. While some Christians consider mysticism to be unbiblical, many Christian mystics in church history held a very high view of Scripture.) The author himself, judging by his introduction to the work, evidently believed that the Holy Spirit inspired this work.While there is much to commend in both works, the reader should be aware that neither one of them is an easy read (although Praying in the Spirit is much less difficult than The Throne of Grace). Bunyan writes long sentences and packs much content in each one. There are also occasional instances of obsolete words or obsolete meanings of words, but the publisher/editor helpfully provides definitions in footnotes. Prayer is a valuable and worthy read, but potential readers are advised to get acclimated to Puritans and their writings before tackling this one. (I myself found this a very difficult read over six years ago, but did not have the same problem in my just-completed second run-through.)"},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"This book is actually composed of two separate books. The first, Praying in the Spirit, was written in 1662 from a prison cell. As you could imagine, it is intensely practical. It is not known when the second book, The Throne of Grace, was written, nor from where. Its manuscript was discovered after Bunyan's death. It is more mystical (by Puritan standards) and is less practical.To say that Bunyan pastored and served in a difficult time is to be guilty of an understatement. In the late 1600's the Church of England began strictly regulating what their pastors were allowed to teach. Bunyan found himself alone and isolated; many like-minded pastors had been expelled or had fled to either the Netherlands or the United States on their own accord. Bunyan, who did not have a degree and thus was not allowed to preach, was imprisoned. While his congregation was deprived of a talented pastor, his family was deprived of their provider. Bunyon's time in prison left his wife to raise their daughter who was born blind. The constable reminded Bunyan continually that a simple promise not to preach would spring the jail door open. While the temptation to renounce his call must have been staggering, he remained in jail and chose to write.In addition to The Pilgrim's Progress and The Holy War, his time in jail produced Praying in the Spirit. It is regarded as one of the definitive Puritan works on prayer. He carefully walks believers through the process of prayer. He warns of hindrances, marks out obstacles, and lovingly encourages his readers to have a deep and intense prayer life. My what a contrast to our own day! His advice does not consist of \\"take a 10 minute walk with Jesus\\" or even \\"Pray, \`Father expand my boundaries'.\\" He instead counsels, \\"Take heed that your heart go to God as well as your mouth. Let not your mouth go any further than you strive to draw your heart along with it\\" (p. 53). The tone of the book is pastoral. It gives the impression that Bunyan is writing to his flock because he cannot preach to them. It is shocking that while he is in prison he is not focused on his own woes, but rather upon the prayer needs of his congregation.Praying in the Spirit is as biblical as it is practical. It surely must be one of the best expositions ever on 1 Corinthians 14:15. For Bunyan, \\"praying in the spirit\\" is not a sort of quasi-spiritual mystical experience. It is pleading passionitly before God. It is coming before the throne of Grace with boldness. Primarily it is praying within the will of God. He describes it as having his soul \\"cleaving to the dust\\" and asking for God to rescue it (p. 20).The second part of this work on prayer is The Throne of Grace, an exposition of Hebrews 4:16. This work explains how to pray boldly, and it gives a very powerful description of the splendor of God. While it may not have been his chief intent, the main result of the pages spent describing the throne room of God is a fuller understanding of the earnestness with which we should pray. After passionately painting a picture of the throne of God, Bunyan describes Christ at the throne, constantly making intercession for us. The majesty of God is made plain, and the importance of prayer is accentuated.Biblically, this section seems to go beyond what is written. Bunyan makes several assertions that would today be questioned. He says that God has more than one throne (throne of grace, throne of judgment, etc.), and he assigns spiritual elements to much that is unnecessary. For Bunyon, the fat of the levitical offering is a symbol for Christ's prayer, and the rainbow relates to Solomon's temple. A careful Bible student might be alarmed about some of his statements, but one also must remember that this work was possibly not meant for publication. Instead it may have been Bunyan's own study in preparation for preaching, if that opportunity would ever fall to him again.Bunyan's writings call the reader back to a different age- an age where prayer was passionate and bold. Who better to write to a congregation on the importance of prayer than a pastor confined to prison? Prayer reflects the cell and the age from which it was written, and it is a reflection that our generation is dire need of seeing."},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"In the two discourses combined in this book, Bunyan labors, sucessfully, to show the Christian that honest prayers do not come from a book and they are not regurgitations of some memorized text. Prayer is an outpouring of one's heart to God. Bunyan suffered persecution and imprisonment for this cause. His passion for the subject of prayer is obvious in this book. It's a passion I think all Christians could use a little more of."},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"Prayer is divided into two parts: an exposition of what true prayer is and how praying is an appeal to Jesus on his throne of grace. To be frank, this is not Bunyan at his best. He's written better stuff (see Pilgrim's Progress). The material is pretty dry and half the time, he's battling high church Anglicanism. The few diamonds here are his descriptions of prayer being from the heart, not an formulistic external exercise.The backdrop of where the book was written (Bunyan was imprisioned for his Puritan beliefs after Cromwell died and England reverted back to monarchy) is very interesting and I suggest all to familiarize themselves with that interesting period."},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"How anyone could call this book dry is beyond me. It is one of the best, if not the best book I have read on prayer. Once you have read the Puritans on any subject, you will never be satisfied with the cutesy fluff that satisfies modern Christian appetites. Do yourself a favor, buy and read this book, carefully, prayerfully; you will find it a refreshing fountain of spiritual blessing."},{"Title":"Prayer (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"My copy of this book is a, \\"The Banner of Truth Trust\\" paperback edition bought from an Australian Christian book store called Koorong long before Amazon existed.John Bunyan is an English Puritan (approx 1650s) most famous for his book ,\\"Pilgrim's Progress\\". Unknown to many he also wrote some other books and a book on Prayer is one of them. This is a short book running for about 60 A5 sized pages, give or take, depending on the printing. Although Christianity is strictly speaking a, \\"mystery\\" religion, none the less, Puritan writings are more structured with subject matter divided into logical points. Some of these writers exhibit quite ornate sub-structures as well i.e. Thomas Manton. Being a, \\"Born Again\\" I have loved reading Puritan writings since I was introduced to them by a Christian friend in my late teens and I'm now retired, so for a long time in human terms.I think that much of the modern Church would do well to acquaint themselves with these writers as IMO they were some of the most God fearing men to walk the earth and many ended up in an English jail for their efforts. This little book by John Bunyan starts with a wonderful definition of prayer;\\"Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart or soul to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Holy Spirit, for such things as God has promised, or according to His Word, for the good of the Church, with submission in faith to the will of God.\\"Now with such a fantastic definition of Christian Prayer he then goes on in Puritan style (point by point) to explain what he means. One allowance that does need to be made, is that, just as we are victims of our age, so John Bunyan was of his and his expressions are \\"Olde English\\" in style.This is a rewarding read and is a contrast to much of what goes on for prayer in our modern Churches that falls short of this ideal.If you are interested in the continuum of Church across time to validate current experience with older writings and theological dispositions check out, \\"Light from the Christian East\\", I've written a review on that one too.Suggestion when reading reviews; click on \\"newest first\\" to get the more up-to-date reviews."},{"Title":"Brand","review":"This is unmistakeably Hill's _Brand_: the technical grace of his Englishing of Ibsen shows an acute awareness of the responsibility of the translator to both the original text and the language into which it is to be translated. Hill's translation enriches not only the English language but the ability of English (and non-Norwegian) speakers to appreciate Ibsen's brooding, symbolically charged drama of the challenge of faith in the midst of common life. Is Brand's fidelity to his &quot;dear Christ hurt with thorns&quot; obdurate or obstinate? In this play, the repudiation of social morality in the name of higher things is put to the question: what if devotion to such &quot;higher things&quot; also leads to, or becomes a mask for, moral isolation, the cauterization of social feeling? Uncompromising and yet compromised, Brand is a caution, and _Brand_ a cautionary tale..."},{"Title":"Brand","review":"This book captures the essence of humanity. I recommend to anyone who wants to find themself."},{"Title":"Brand","review":"Brand is the flip side of Peer Gynt. Ibsen may well have intended to write heroism into Brand, a charismatic dissenting priest, but could not breathe any life into his protagonist at all. Brand is cold, righteous, merciless, uncompromising. The play is dated, dull, static, but of historical interest to Ibsen scholars, since he may have learned plenty by writing Brand. The rather rigid Norwegian state/church of his time loved it, granted Henrik a permanent poet stipend for Brand. Modern gentle readers may roll their eyes."},{"Title":"Reasoning Skills Success in 20 Minutes a Day","review":"This book is very easy to read and understand.There is a test before starting the book and one at the end.It's a good choice for anyone who wants to improve the reasoning skills and avoid to fall in the traps of thinking, what is common in conversations, relationships, negotiation, etc. If you want to invest low money with a good pay back, this book is the one."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"Very good collection, mostly fantasy, yet treading the dark edge of horror, rather than adventure or whimsey. Mostly worth it for the title novella and \\"Thorn,\\" but no outright clunkers. In detail:* \\"The Bone Forest\\"--This is a prequel novella to Holdstock's Mythago Wood and Lavondyss, I believe. It stands alone fine. This reminded me of Jonathan Carroll--what his writing would be like if he allowed himself to lose himself within the fantasy rather than playing on the dividing line between fantasy and \\"reality\\" (I read recently that Nabokov recommends always enclosing the word \\"reality\\" in quote marks). The mythago idea is a powerful one, and provides plenty of material that Holdstock could work through for years. Yet, he seems to shy away from the epic, instead concentrating on individual stories--mano a mano with the wood. I have to admit that I think that I admire him for that.* \\"Thorn\\"--Another powerful story, this time about a man led into a belief then believed betrayed. And, yet, was he? There's a sense of both here. That what the man was being led to was right; that what was being done to him was wrong. But was it wrong, or just different? It reminds me of some of the cultural anthropology that I've been reading recently--what is one group's delicacy is another's abomination. What is moral in one group is highly irregular, if not immoral, in another. Excellent story to bring that out.* \\"The Shapechanger\\"--Nice, yet not as good as the others. First, the good things. Excellent use of pagan magic and relationship between the old shaman and young, inexperienced and somewhat reluctant apprentice. Sense of danger high and yet not silly. But then, as we learn more of the daemon--the child haunting the past from the future--the idea goes downhill. Not necessarily Holdstock's fault; battered children are, unfortunately, an overused element in today's fantasy and horror fiction. While this might have been fresh at the time it was written, it appears old hat to us now. Still, the writing and pacing are excellent, and worth reading.* \\"The Boy Who Jumped the Rapids\\"--Didn't like this one so much...I think because it didn't seem to complete itself. The elements are all there and fine--conflict, action, meaning--yet it seemed less cohesive than it should. The central mystery, the horned stranger, is resolved, but the secondary mystery, Caylon's ability to ford the river, seems like it is resolved yet again doesn't. Maybe it's the interplay of the two, and trying to figure out what one theme does to the other.* \\"Time of the Tree\\"--Very Borgesian. What it means, I don't know, but the style, the description, are interesting. The world on man? The Earth as man? Strange--also reminiscent of Garcia Marquez' story about the beached giant.* \\"Magic Man\\"--Well done pre-history story. I tend not to like Clan of the Cave Bear stories, so it had to get over that bias of mine. Good description, good conflict, and nice twist at the end.* \\"Scarrowfell\\"--Like \\"Thorn,\\" a pagan fantasy/horror, playing with the modern reader's normal Christian assumptions, then removing the veil to show the true meaning. Much of Holdstock's work dabbles in the pagan--Mythago Wood makes a point that what we perceive as history is just the last link in a long chain of myths. It certainly differentiates his fantasies from those of others.* \\"The Time Beyond Age\\"--This is science fiction; the rest of the book has been fantasy. Yet there's a similarity here with the fantasy. Again, the focus is on obsession and the need to study something and understand it (as with the title novella), but the very act of studying drives the observer into contact with the phenomena and, ultimately, ruins any chances for objective advancement of knowledge. Basically, it's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle made fictive."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"The Bone Forest is a collection of eight short stories by Robert Holdstock, the first and eponymous one of which is a Mythago Wood narrative from the point of view of George Huxley, about how he came to involve his sons Steven and Christian.The six next (Thorn, The Shapechanger, The Boy Who Jumped the Rapids, Time of the Tree, Magic Man, and Scarrowfell), although not sharing the same settings, are very similar in style and atmosphere.The last one (The Time Beyond Age) tells of a scientific experiment where two children are artificially grown old in a disease-proof environment.As a whole, I like the way Robert Holdstock builds enchanting worlds for us to explore, but I'm always disappointed by the abrupt, sometimes far-fetched endings."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"Why oh why is this book out of print? Shame on you publishers for denying the public the truly haunting 'Bone Forest' Story and the others which are all excellent. Go ahead and print all the other crap books by second-rate authors but this one is a classic of the genre."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"I got this book on time. I got it on the near-to-fast rate. It was easy to track. I would recommend that rate. I do have the rest of the Mythago Wood series and this helps to complete the collection. The first story is good and helps to fill in those blanks. However, the other stories do tend to go off and in the end story, Holdstock does tend to babble."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"This book starts with a novella titled The Bone Forest, which is a prequel to Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn, which is itself a prequel to the award winning novel, Mythago Wood. The Bone Forest is essential reading for fans of Mythago Wood because it provides an intriguing and dark back story that elaborates on the character of George Huxley (whose research in Ryhope Wood casts a shadow over all the Mythago novels). The events in The Bone Forest underscore the dangerous nature of Mythagos that are generated from Ryhope Wood and cleverly introduce the possibility of a \\"double twist\\" in the subsequent novel Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn. Overall, The Bone Forest novella is a solid read if you have previously read Mythago Wood, otherwise it is a nice introduction to the key Mythago Wood characters.Five of the seven short stories that follow the main novella are excellent. That leaves two that are not excellent. To me Time of the Tree and The Time Beyond Age are experimental in topic and/or form and fall short of being highly engaging stories. The other five stories are all wonderful and span a variety of highly evocative settings. In each of these stories powerful mythic forces play havoc with personal perceptions and individual decisions.The short stories themselves do not take place in Mythago Wood, but share the same general mystique as the Ryhope wood cycle. It is very likely, but not certain, that the story The Boy who Jumped the Rapids takes place in Broceliande, the mythic forest in Brittany that is the setting for Merlin's Wood, one of the books in the Ryhope Wood cycle.Overall this is a great selection of fantasy short stories coupled with a novella detailing a back story and character development that both tie in nicely with the Rhyhope wood cycle."},{"Title":"The Bone Forest","review":"I took this book out of the library when it was first published years ago. Now every time I artwork similar to the cover art, i think back to this book. The bone forest story was so thought provoking, and different, that to this day i always give a bit more thought to strollin around alone in a dark forest, or somewhere that i don't know my way. The book has great imagery, and is not very long. I recommend it highly, especially for a fantasy lover teen like I was."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques","review":"This is a great classic reference book for knitters. It has over 300 explanatory drawings and 22 color photographs. It offers special hints and tips on professional methods. In addition, it gives suggestions for how to get the best out of a commercial pattern, as well as how to draft a pattern for your own design.I especially liked the use of both English and American knitting terms, as well as a lot of the historical information about knitting. The book also provides interesting and useful information about the different types of fibers (angora, mohair, etc.)used to make the more exotic yarns."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques","review":"I first came across this book back in 1996 in my library, and having been using pages from it ever since, so I finally figured I should buy the whole book :-) I have found it very useful over the years.This book is laid out in alphabetical order, as the title 'encyclopaedia' suggests. This makes it fabulous for looking up techniques quickly. It is a techniques and information book, not a how-to book, as it is not listed in order of categories of techniques or order of difficulty.The look is old-fashioned, and there are not many pictures, but this makes it able to have more information for the same size of book. It is great for checking which paired decrease you need, how to do short rows, altering existing garments and more.I would highly recommend this book as a reference book for your shelf, perhaps paired with a book with more photos (I have bought it paired with Finishing Techniques for Hand Knitters, which I have also reviewed)."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques","review":"Information is clear and very well done. It is layed out like an encyclopedae, so you wouldn't think that it needs an index, but it does- or it needs some common terms listed with a &#34;See: ????&#34; noted. Example: I wanted to look up M1. That would be under I for Increases- which is not something someone that is looking this up would have necessarily known."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos","review":"This book, like many in series SF, can not be read independently of the rest in the series. Its main fault is that it is frequently chaotic and can be difficult to follow, especially if it has been awhile since you read the previous stories. The protagonist, Merlin, continues his sparring with Luke, Jasra,and the Mask, and his girlfriend, Julia is back in the story, unknown to Merlin at first. Merlin's brother, Jurt, also is involved, along with multiple other extended family members.Zelazny fans will like this, but the Amber premise is noticably tiring in this story."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos","review":"In the Sign of Chaos, Zelazny turns the magic of his sorcerous Logrus initiates loose in a big way, including a very entertaining sequence where Merlin, his very interesting half brother Mandor, and a surprising third ally make an assault on the Keep of the Four Winds. Spells and fur fly, and in the end Merlin finally gets a handle on who all the players may be in his troubles through these books, if possibly not a clear picture of all their motivations. We also see more interaction with the Ghostwheel.As with both five book Amber series, Sign of Chaos does not stand on its own. It is, fittingly, just the middle of this very intricate series of mysteries and adventures.Zelazny's writing continued to entertain in a way separate from the plot itself. For example, he gives Merlin very clever and amusing names for his spells. Merlin continues to be a fascinating combination of spunky and naive, taking great pains to follow his own agenda despite what those around him might prefer. Many of Zelazny's characters from the first Amber series play interesting roles, along with new, vibrant characters introduced here with Merlin's story.I'm having a terrific time reading these books again. As I write this review I'm halfway done with the final book, and I'll be a bit sad to be done with them."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos","review":"Merlin is trapped in a crazy version of Wonderland, which is actually, of course, just a Shadow. Some complex sorcerous shenanigans by various members of his family, ensue, as well as contact with Fiona, and stunts similar to Brand's, in the first series."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos","review":"Sign of Chaos is the critical moment when the story line (of which this is the eighth) blurs out for a while. It's not a bad book by any means, but Merlin's story is one of an ever-increasing number of people who want to either kill him or run his life for him. This book is that critical mass when there are so many characters to keep track of that small minds like this reviewer's tend to shut down.Fittingly enough, the book starts out with Merlin and Luke trapped in the Mad Hatter's Tea Party Bar, where the previous volume left them off. A psychedelic Mickey has turned Luke into a hallucination machine and it takes both ingenuity and chemistry for Merlin to take his leave. He makes it back to Amber only to discover that he has a new, and beautiful aunt. Who just as promptly disappears, leaving Merlin once again in the clutches of an old friend.Along the way Merlin picks up Mandor, his older brother on the Chaos side, and Jasra, who is now a 'friendly' enemy instead of a coat rack. This is about where characters and plot get so intricate that you may wish you had been keeping score from the beginning. Zelazny is merciless, captivating his readers at the same time he is confusing them.By way of personal history, I took a several year break from the series at this point, picking up the last two volumes when the appeared in paperback. You may feel like doing the same thing, but there are only two more quick volumes to go and you will be a member of the I Love Amber club, a very exclusive group of folks."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos","review":"This book held interesting turns!

It is used at my university in test preparation workshops and ESL classes.The book explains how the test is scored and what the rating criteria are. I believe this is very helpful, as many students worry that their answers must be linguistically perfect to get a good score. It also provides descriptions of each question type, time limits, and strategies to use for answering questions well.The book includes practice questions that students can use to get familiar with the format of the test. This is very important, because one of the most difficult things about taking the test is getting used to the format and kind of questions asked. Once you are comfortable with answering these kinds of questions, you can let your true speaking skills show.The book is not perfect. Some of the questions are better written than others, and there are a few typos. However, for the price, this is a very useful book.

In this book she's introduced as a police detective in her forties (a nice change of pace) who gets chosen to head up the investigation into a city councilwoman's husband's death. It is a powderkeg, and unfortunately for Savannah, she does her job too well, much to the dismay of the powers-that-be. The price she pays for her tenacity is the loss of her job on a trumped-up rules violation. Needless to say, when she is asked to continue investigating the case by the person who is the prime suspect, Savannah agrees. On top of all this, her very naive yet stubborn teenage sister arrives unexpectedly from Georgia, announces that she is going to stay with Savannah permanently, and promptly becomes involved with an older man well-known to the local police dept.Savannah is interesting, independent character. She seems to be comfortable with herself, and isn't afraid to go after what she wants. Ms. McKevett has also created a nice assortment of secondary characters with their own quirks and flaws. The mystery had some nice twists and turns. I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Just Desserts","review":"Savannah Reid is an intelligent, witty detective who will appeal to readers who enjoy realistic women protagonists in their novels. She is tough, but sensitive, and has a caustic sense of humor about her body and her life. The plot revolves around a murder of the estranged husband of a highly visible local politician. The ways in which Savannah solves the murder as well as the other dilemmas facing her in her life are original and satisfying. I highly recommend this book.

Still, there are enjoyable characters and the pacing is quick. Great airplane or doctor's office reading, however. It will hold your attention and not require intense concentration.The plot involves the murder of a designer who is married to a well-loved politician. Savannah Reid, California police detective, is assigned to this politically sensitive case, and from the beginning, gets put under pressure by her superiors to find the \\"right\\" solution without ruffling feathers. A subplot involves a visit from a strong-willed but naive teenage sister.This is the first book I've read in the series, and I liked it enough that I intend to read more. However, I would also add that this probably isn't a book you'd send your grandmother or your pastor, although the sex and language issues are very minor."},{"Title":"Just Desserts","review":"I think this is first in the series. The great attraction is the character of Savannah Reid who is forty plus and gets fired from the local police force for being overweight and sets up as a private eye. She is overtly heterosexual. Many varieties of sex are hinted at but the main carnal pleasure described is food, and there is some excellent food description.On the negative side: The murder mystery gets solved by a new character being introduced who tells Savannah who did it. A few sentences like &quot;Savannah had only one cognitive thought after she hit the floor&quot; and an unlikely confession by the murderer."},{"Title":"Just Desserts","review":"Now I am not sure if this series falls under the traditional Cozy genre since there isn't the warm fuzzy feel, but there is a small town, there are cats, and of course a woman on the tail of a killer.

Not having a badge or a police issued weapon doesn't stop her, she has a job to do and with her southern charm and wit she is going to find out who killed Jonathan Winston even if it does take her ex-partner and a rather dashing ex-CIA agent Ryan Stone, who with his partner, John Gibson, add quite a bit of splash to a rather dull life.This first in a series book definitely makes you want to read the rest.

This books sets up all the secondary characters who will become part of her future private investigation business. It was was fast read. The first part of the book went fast. I felt it slowed somewhat in the middle as the mystery part seemed secondary to her teenage sister Atlanta arriving to stay with her. After getting Atlanta back somewhat on a straight path, the mystery part became primary again. Many times, one knows who the murderer is early on in the book. Not so in \\"Just Desserts\\" as I did not have the murderer and reason for the crime figured out until the end of the the book. Some have labeled this book as a cozy mystery but for me it doesn't quite fit in this genre of a mystery.Will continue on with the series. I have \\"Bitter Sweets\\" to read and am looking forward to enjoyable reads through the series."},{"Title":"Just Desserts","review":"I have purchased later books in this series but wanted to read the first book to get to know the characters. The book was enjoyable and I love all the characters. I plan to read the entire (16 books to date) series. Fun reading."},{"Title":"The Castles and the Crown: Spain 1451 - 1555","review":"I recently read the new book, Sister Queens. After finishing the book, I read the bibliography and discovered a title that I had read in 1963. So I ordered the book through interlibrary loan from my public library network. The copy that arrived at my current local library was the copy that I had read in 1963 at my then local public library! Sadly, it was in deplorable condition. So I decided to try Amazon and order a personal copy of this book to keep in my collection. I found a copy offered by the Friends of Los Gatos Library in CA. It was listed on Amazon as a paperback, but I ordered it since the price was right ($15.00). Imagine my surprise when it arrived early and in excellent condition. The best part was that the copy I received was a hardcover - sweet. I have always had a fascination with Queen Juana since reading this book. She is definitely portrayed quite differently in these two books and I am now looking for more books about Queen Juana."},{"Title":"The Castles and the Crown: Spain 1451 - 1555","review":"We are traveling to Spain in May and a friend suggested I read this classic to give us some understanding of the country. I am followint this book, which was great historical background, with Giles Tremlett's \\"Ghosts of Spain\\" and think we'll have a clear understanding of the country we are about to visit."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"If you are an adult Potter fan like me, and if you can afford this volume (I found mine in a bargain bin for two bucks) you might like it even more than I did. Meant for readers with a bit of an academic bent and an interest in moral philosophy, its various essayists, or most of them, still try to have a bit of fun since they are explicating the behaviors of fictional characters. The weakness of the work stems from the passage of time...it came out in 2004, only halfway through the series of Potter books. I think the contributors, however, got most of the characters' characters right, but to see the same authors comment now on the entire Potter world and how it worked out would be even better. I don't regret my price, or the hours I spent in these pages. I kind of regret that we may never get a new Harry Potter adventure. I'm the type of fan who thought the early films better than the books on which each was based, and the later books a bit better than the movies that condensed them. And I reject that Harry and his fellow wizards could be harmful to kids, or are anti-Christian, or will lead young folk to dabble in the occult. I have known people who did over- dabble in the worlds of metaphysical religions and psychic phenomena and witchcraft and such, and without exception, they all came to those odd practices in mid-life or later, after suffering emotional disappointments in the more traditional forms of religion and morality. I think Harry Potter's literary and cinematic adventures to be one of the big cultural positives of the past decade, and find more harm in some of the TV \\"reality shows\\" than in his imagined world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"This read can be a gentle yet captivating intro to philosophy or a vibrant deepening of the subject within an upbeat and modern setting. Either way, excellently written, clearly presented and pertinent analysis awaits the reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"This book actually adds to Joannes already superbly developed characters. The authors of each essay included in this book have taken time to avoid making wrong character judgements. The editors have placed the essay in an order making it easier to understand the characters in the context of all the other characters. Snape is extremely complex and well defined here.Timbus ViolettProfessor Emeritus The University of The Grind"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"For a Harry Potter and a Philosophy fan, I was pleased and excited to find this book. It took me less than a day to read and I was fully amazed. This is a set of essays that are wrote so well.Some of the things I agreed with and had thought of, others others i never thought of, but now puzzle me. I still get into conversations about Harry Potter based on that book, and it's amazing.This book has truly been the light shining over Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"I'll preface this with the warning that I have a bit of background in philosophy, so this book wasn't my \\"introduction\\" to philosophical material. Yet even when I attempt to be impartial I am left feeling ambivalent about this volume.The most glaring failure of the series is its inability to fulfill its own goal, stated in the Introduction, of being a \\"happy convergence of [the] worlds\\" of Potter and philosophy. Trying to tackle both realms at once, it conquers neither. These two good topics are sadly immiscible, becoming confusing and unappealing when combined. The essays in this volume vary widely in quality--both of writing and of topic--but they almost universally fail to actually link the topics at hand. Instead, they resort to brief (and often opinionated) snippets of philosophy injected liberally with formulaic metaphors from the Harry Potter series. Are there \\"diverse\\" opinions about something? Compare them to Bertie Bott's beans. Need to make a reference selfishly slaughtering innocents? Invoke Voldemort's thirst for unicorn blood, etc. This technique does no favors for philosophy or Potter.I think the source of this book's identity crisis is its unclear purpose. Some essays try to justify Rowling's plot decisions (e.g., including Slytherin at Hogwarts) based on ancient theories. Others question the plausibility of alternate worlds, apparating, etc. given what we know about physics. Still others read like character analyses that the essayists desperately mash with some--any!--philosophical topic. I'd guess that each essayist constructed his or her piece with only one direction: \\"Write about something philosophical...and be sure to mention Harry Potter. As much as possible.\\" The overall result is a formless tangle of writing.Though its description is misleading, this book is not a complete waste of time, depending on what you're looking for. It's sometimes entertaining, (especially, I imagine if you are absolutely in love with all things Harry Potter). An as introduction--or, more aptly, an \\"appetizer\\"--to many topics in philosophy, the book succeeds. (If you want a more serious and thorough introduction that nevertheless isn't as dry as a textbook, try Gaarder's books, especially \\"Sophie's World\\".) Again, some essays are better and more interesting than others--quality is spotty--and it would be misleading to denigrate every single one. But on the whole, I can't help but feel that the book is nothing more than a gimmick that is vaulting on Potter's popularity. It's the obviousness of this strategy, all the way down to the forced similes in nearly every essay, that makes this book a disappointing underachievement."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"I was pretty excited when I got this book on sale. I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and I love applying different readings to my favorite texts. Not only is the text extremely basic, but the factual references, despite the over-quotation, are incorrect! Reading some of the essays, I questioned whether the authors ever read the Harry Potter books, much less any Philosophy.This isn't a discussion of philosophy in Harry Potter so much as a basic account of philosophy with some characters from the Harry Potter series thrown in for good measure.And the facts! One of the essays says that Winky is Dobby's sister. Since when? Another essay says that \\"Voldemort\\" means, and I quote: \\"...a horrifying name that means something like 'Will to Death.' This title itself is a lie, because he doesn't have a death wish\\" (140). Well of course it's a lie- that's not what \\"Voldemort\\" means. JK Rowling got it from the French \\"vol de mort\\" which means, literally, flight from/of death."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"This book contains a lot of great wonderings about the philosphy in Harry Potter.I would greatly reccomend it!it has some really good morales."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"This book was quite an interesting read. I loved how the various philosophers tackled different issues that I had never considered. It definately added to my love for the series and gave new depth to Rowling's writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"After finishing book 7, but before rereading all of the HP books, I wanted to read something that was about the HP books, to see what other people had to say.This book, consisting of 16 essays, is not about the Harry Potter books. Rather, it uses the characters and events in the Harry Potter books to illustrate the philosophical arguments that are studied at University level in Philosophy 101. For the most part, it won't add to you knowledge of Harry Potter, but it will make you glad you don't have to take Philosophy 101 again (or for the first time).The essay \\"Magic, Science, and the Ethics of Technology\\" is an exception to the overall quality of the book. This is an outstanding essay, that focuses on magic in the HP books and its relationship to science and technology. The authors have thought out the issues very clearly, and this essay does shed significant light on the HP books. In brief, magic is seen as a proto-science, roughly comparable to the field of 'Natural Philosophy' as was studied in Europe just before the dawn of the scientific age. Magic has natural laws that are followed, and the students at Hogwarts have to learn these laws. It's not just waving a wand and having any desire 'magically' brought about. And they also have to learn the ethical principles involved in using magic. A brilliant, wonderful essay here.The good essay is \\"Feminism and Equal Opportunity: Hermione and the Women of Hogwarts\\". In brief, this essay discusses how the Wizarding world is one in which there is pretty much full equality between the sexes, and everyone in the books just assumes it. As but one example, several of the players on the Irish Quidditch World Cup team are women, but this is only mentioned in passing, since it's no big deal that women are on the same world championship team with men.The rest of the essays are a complete waste of time. They are nothing but empty philosophical concepts, basically empty words chasing other empty words in circles. (In the philosophical debate on whether ethics and metaphysics are worth studying or are the results of linguistic errors, I come down on the side of the Ordinary Language Philosophers like Wittgenstein.) As examples, taking several pages to discuss the real-world possibility of apparating as traveling through 'real' worm-holes, and discussing the paradoxes of time travel misses the point of Harry Potter.If you want to know more about HP, read 'Unlocking Harry Potter' by John Granger.Without the essay on Magic and Science, I would have given the book a 1. But I don't think one excellent essay out of 16 can raise the rating to a 3. So I'll leave it at 2."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"Philosophy can seem intimidating as it deals in more abstract notions, but this book relates it to the times and people of Hogwarts and really opens your eyes.

It taught me so much about philosophy. I learned about what Aristotle says about friendship, about the relationship between good and evil, how I can build courage, how science in our world parallels magic in Harry's, why ambition can be good, reasons why criticisms of the Potter books are so often misguided, and so much more! I've loved Harry Potter for a long time, and could tell the authors did too, but I never realized how so many interesting points can be raised by the books. I especially enjoyed the essays dealing with space, time, different realities, and free will and foreknowledge. This book made me laugh and it made me excited about philosophy by making so many issues understandable with examples from the Harry Potter books. I highly recommend it, what great fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"I very much enjoyed reading \\"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts\\". As one who reads the Potter books mostly for the escapism, it was interesting to have the help of professional philosophers help me delve into the deeper meanings contained in the books. This book also helped me to appreciate JKR's talent even more. I believe she must have more than a cursery knowledge of philosophy herself. My favorite essays were \\"Feminism and Equal Opportunity:Herminone and the Women of Hogwarts\\", \\"Heaven, Hell and Harry Potter\\" \\"Magic,Muggles and Moral Imagination\\" and \\"The Prophecy-Driven Life: Foreknowledge and Freedom at Hogwarts\\" All of the essays had at least one \\"ah HA\\" moment where the brain went into high gear and really started purring. The essay \\"Space, Time and Magic\\" caused the usual brain cramp that all time travel conundrums do and I enjoyed it as much as I always enjoy such discussions with the addition that new concepts were introduced of which I had previously been unaware. I was not aquainted with the terms \\"tensed\\" and \\"tenseless\\" time. This book is probably not for the expert philosopher as these concepts will be basics but for someone of my experience (almost none) studying philosophy,it was a great read. Just like a good movie, don't leave before the credits are done; the bios at the end are amusing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"I read this book not expecting any great new philosophies or insights into old ones. I was pleasantly surprised. As a person that has read many of the older philosophical texts, I know how hard it is to sometimes understand the reasonings and logic presented. I think this book presents its ideas in a very clear way that even the youngest audiences of Harry Potter would be able to have a good introduction to philosophical thought."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"This series of books, popular culture and philosophy is fantastic. It seems that any popular movie, or TV series immediately generates a backlash. Two recent examples include the Harry Potter books and movies, and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. In the case of Harry Potter, fundamentalist Christians have lamented that the books are teaching witchcraft. In Passion, the movie is being charged as being anti-Semite.In this series of books, prominent philosophers are being asked to comment on these charges and on the story contained in the movie. In contrast to the shrill, loud, emotionally loaded comments being made primarily to get attention to the commenter, here are thoughtful, reasoned essays that challenge the reader to think about and decide for himself about these charges.These books make for absolutely delightful reading. It is a way to bring philosophy to the public in connection with a story that is familiar to a broad range of people."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"As a Harry Potter fan, I pick up almost anything with Harry in the title. Often, I put it back down after a cursory glance. Not this time!This book is a collection of essays on philosophical questions raised in the Harry Potter series. It would be a good adjunct for anyone taking a college level philosophy course, to see a practical application of using philosophy to aid in understanding literature - or the use of literature to understand philosophy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"Harry Potter's put the spell on millions of readers, and many have debated the 'deeper meaning' of the stories. In Harry Potter And Philosophy, seventeen philosophical experts unlock some of Hogwart's secrets, revealing connections between the particular characters and how they link to modern philosophy. There's more than a healthy dose of humor, such in an analysis of how Aristotle would've run a school for wizard. Harry Potter And Philosophy is \\"must\\" reading for dedicated fans of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels and films presenting Harry Potter's detailed and complicated world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"To begin with, the subtitle should read:If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts he wouldn't change a thing.These Philosophers praise J.K. Rowlings for her character development of both the good and bad people in the books. They recognise, describe and praise her treatment of them and find her ideas mirrored in other philosphers. It's a fun read most of the time but to me the praise of that most uncommon of all qualities 'Common Sense' found in Rowlings was a pleasure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"As soon as I saw this book I had to get it. Having been impressed with other books in this series (The Simpsons, The Matrix and Seinfeld) I knew this would be a great way to apply the things I learned in Philosophy to today's culture. If you're a student of Philosophy, like me, then this book may help you to clear up things that your professor can not. Since they take things like Time-travel and apply them to the Harry Potter world, you can grasp a better understanding while not losing the essence of what is being discussed. Even if you're not a student of philosophy this book is a great read. It'll provide hours of entertainment and give you great insight into how Philosophy can be applied to situations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"I'll admit that I am strictly an amateur philosopher and a sucker for anything related to the Harry Potter series and this book did not disappoint either of these sensibilities. As a collection of essays using the Harry Potter characters and settings to illustrate classical themes and concepts in philosophy, this book makes every reader an intellectual. I especially like that the authors don't assume the reader is in kindergarten or has never heard of Aristotle or Plato before. I thought every chapter was thorough but understandable to the lay person. I walked away knowing a lot more about philosophy but also appreciating the depth and care of the Harry Potter series as well.I wouldn't recommend this to a non-\\"Potter fan\\" as it would be annoying. My one beef: there are some of the corniest references to Potter that could ever be written on a page. I almost got the feeling, at some points, that these philosophy professionals were so excited people cared, they went over-board and tried a little too hard.All in all, an excellent read. One of the reviews on the cover said that this book made philosophy and intellectual discussion a daily dinner event. I am happy to report I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts","review":"The value of this series is that it places philosophical concepts in the context of a story. Often people are intimidated by philosophy because the language is so abstract and the context coceptual. Because these essays connect to a story, the writers remain much more concrete. The reader is able better visualize the conceptual and discover new ways of thinking about the world and relationships that make it work."},{"Title":"Barbie, the First 30 Years: 1959 Through 1989 and Beyond: Identification and Value Guide (Barbie, the First 30 Years: 1959 Through 1989 & Beyond: An Identification & Value Guide)","review":"This book is a good starting point for collectors.

Dolls are listed by year, making a particular Barbie or Friend fairly easy to find.This book is not as in depth as some other Barbie doll books on the market, you will not be able to find specific markings for each doll as well as a complete list of accessories - exactly what booklet, shoes, wrist tag, box (and so on) each doll came with. Also some of the photographs are fairly small, but that said, this is still a good book.I would also like to add that this book features many foreign dolls and accessories, Not sold in the US.
