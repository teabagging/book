Wellman's astonishing Ohio-like world has been tagged by some theatergoers and critics as \\"Macland\\", a world peopled by cantankerous, wistful, confused, and frightened people who have lost parts of their body, their minds, and their souls to the perpetual machine of the American dream. In Annie Salem, young Jack Scan hangs out in the local woods near the Anger River valley, where he witnesses strange goings-on and discovers the rare \\"blue monkeys\\" of the semi-wilds. Meanwhile, back in town he is in love with Annie Salem and shares some of his riverside adventures with her. But like all true Romeos, he must first undergo his own voyage into manhood, which he achieves through a fantastic adventure to Mars and beyond - a voyage that, upon his return, enables him to settle into the strange everyday world of Northern Ohio as if it were Grovers Corners of Thornton Wilder's Our Town.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CHNbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Annie+Salem+(New+American+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moltke on the Art of War: Selected Writings","description":"Field Marshal Helmuth Graf von Moltke is best known for his direction of the German/Prussian campaigns against Austria in 1866 and France in 1870-71, yet it was during his service as chief of the General Staff that he laid the foundation for the German way of war which would continue through 1945. Professor Daniel Hughes of the Air War College, in addition to editing and assisting with the translation of this selection of Moltke s thoughts and theories on the art of war, has written an insightful commentary on  Moltke the Elder  that places him in the broader context of Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz s sometimes abstract philosophical ideas. The book also contains an extensive bibliographic and historiographic commentary that includes references to Moltke and his theories in the current literature in Germany, England, and the United States a valuable aid to anyone doing research on the subject. This volume, in addition to its appeal to scholars, serves as an introduction to the theory of the German army, as well as a summary of Moltke s enduring theoretical legacy. Praise for Moltke on the Art of War  Moltke molded the Prussian and ultimately the German army at a time of technological and economic change. For that reason . . . this book deserves a much wider audience than those interested in nineteenth-century military history. Readers will be particularly grateful for the editor s careful explanation of terms that are easily mistranslated in English, and for concise and useful footnotes and bibliography. A model of fine editing.  Foreign Affairs Magazine  This valuable work ably compiles the selected writings on the art of war of one of military history s greatest geniuses. [Moltke s] impact on American military thinking persists, especially in various military staff college curricula. Strongly recommended.

In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world. In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study.

All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces.  The word  love  is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,  writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society s failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question  What is love?  her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the  100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.  All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A5ZDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pattern of conquest,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f7UfnwEACAAJ&dq=Pattern+of+conquest,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The end of the affair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BaN3cgAACAAJ&dq=The+end+of+the+affair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tank Aces","description":"With speed, violence, and deadly power, heavily armored tanks spearheaded the German blitzkrieg that stormed across Europe in 1939.

Douglas Adams s  six-part trilogy,  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy grew from a blip of a notion into an ever-expanding multimedia universe that amassed an unprecedented cult of followers and became an international sensation. As a young journalist, Neil Gaiman was given complete access to Adams s life, times, gossip, unpublished outtakes, and files (and became privy to his writing process, insecurities, disillusionments, challenges, and triumphs). The resulting volume illuminates the unique, funny, dramatic, and improbable chronicle of an idea, an incredibly tall man, and a mind-boggling success story. In Don t Panic, Gaiman celebrates everything Hitchhiker: the original radio play, the books, comics, video and computer games, films, television series, record albums, stage musicals, one-man shows, the Great One himself, and towels. And as Douglas Adams himself attested:  It s all absolutely devastatingly true except the bits that are lies.  Updated several times in the thirty years since its original publication, Don t Panic is available for the first time in digital form. Part biography, part tell-all parody, part pop-culture history, part guide to a guide, Don t Panic  deserves as much cult success as the Hitchhiker s books themselves  (Time Out).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FidxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landscaping for Wildlife","description":"A beautifully illustrated and practical guide for landscaping for wildlife.

They were old friends and close colleagues, and they had revolutionized atomic physics in the 1920s with their work together on quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle. But now the world had changed, and the two men were on opposite sides in a world war. The meeting was fraught with danger and embarrassment; it ended in disaster.\\" \\"Why Heisenberg went to Copenhagen and what he wanted to say to Bohr are questions that have exercised historians ever since. In Michael Frayn's new play, an ambitious, fiercely intelligent, and daring dramatic sensation, Heisenberg meets Bohr and his wife, Margrethe, once again to look for the answers and to work out - just as they had worked out the internal functioning of the atom - how we can ever know why we do what we do.\\" --Book Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=232xk19oBgcC&dq=Copenhagen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism: Ordinary Women in the Antislavery Movement","description":"By focusing on male leaders of the abolitionist movement, historians have often overlooked the great grassroots army of women who also fought to eliminate slavery. Here, Julie Roy Jeffrey explores the involvement of ordinary women--black and white--in the most significant reform movement prior to the Civil War. She offers a complex and compelling portrait of antebellum women's activism, tracing its changing contours over time. For more than three decades, women raised money, carried petitions, created propaganda, sponsored lecture series, circulated newspapers, supported third-party movements, became public lecturers, and assisted fugitive slaves. Indeed, Jeffrey says, theirs was the day-to-day work that helped to keep abolitionism alive. Drawing from letters, diaries, and institutional records, she uses the words of ordinary women to illuminate the meaning of abolitionism in their lives, the rewards and challenges that their commitment provided, and the anguished personal and public steps that abolitionism sometimes demanded they take. Whatever their position on women's rights, argues Jeffrey, their abolitionist activism was a radical step--one that challenged the political and social status quo as well as conventional gender norms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9_JECQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children's Program Kit: Supportive Education for Children of Addicted Parents","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sZaayQEACAAJ&dq=Children%27s+Program+Kit:+Supportive+Education+for+Children+of+Addicted+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Kiss in the Dark (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1199)","description":"A Kiss In The Dark by Jenna Mills released on Dec 25, 2002 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y3EcPDwtlTgC&dq=A+Kiss+in+the+Dark+(Silhouette+Intimate+Moments+No.+1199)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Student Athlete's Guide to College (Princeton Review Series)","description":"Offers advice on choosing a NCAA division, showcasing athletic skills for coaches and scouts, scholarships and financial aid, and handling the recruitment process","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=abk1AQAACAAJ&dq=Student+Athlete%27s+Guide+to+College+(Princeton+Review+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rooms in Bloom: Contemporary Florals for the Home","description":"Written for people who are interested in home decorating and crafts, this guide to incorporating florals into interior design covers a wide variety of styles and presents dozens of ideas for easy-to-complete projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LOVEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Rooms+in+Bloom:+Contemporary+Florals+for+the+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return of the Goddess","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YfA9AAAAIAAJ&dq=Return+of+the+Goddess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead Fairies a Psychological Drama in Letter Form","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R0RDywAACAAJ&dq=The+Dead+Fairies+a+Psychological+Drama+in+Letter+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Millennium","description":"In the skies over Oakland, California, a DC-10 and a 747 are about to collide.

In this fascinating New York Times bestseller, the author of The Best and the Brightest, The Fifties, and other acclaimed histories turns his investigative eye to the rise of the American media in the twentieth century. Focusing on the successes and failures of CBS Television, Time magazine, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times, David Halberstam paints a portrait of the era when large, powerful mainstream media sources emerged as a force, showing how they shifted from simply reporting the news to becoming a part of it. By examining landmark events such as Franklin D. Roosevelt s masterful use of the radio and the unprecedented coverage of the Watergate break-in, Halberstam demonstrates how print and broadcast media as a whole became a player in society and helped shape public policy. Drawn from hundreds of exhaustive interviews with insiders at each company, and hailed by the Seattle Times as  a monumental X-ray study of power,  The Powers That Be reveals the tugs-of-war between political ambition and the quest for truth in a page-turning read.

Examinations of Swinburne's aesthetic principles, too, are generally based upon interpretations of his poetry, though these may be as misleading as the discrepancies between other artists' principles and practices. Believing that a solid and consistent core of poetic theory underlay all of Swinburne's critical essays, casual pieces, and letters, Professor Connolly has attempted to reconstruct the theory from a careful analysis of this body of writing. In this book he sets forth his findings as general principles and as they apply to lyric and dramatic poetry. \\"Swinburne was a far sounder and more consistent critic than he is usually given credit for being,\\" Professor Connolly concludes, \\"and the various critical principles that can be discovered in his essays hang together in a more integrated theory of poetry than is usually imagined. He had, as other critics had, a number of basic principles and themes that he used with astonishing versatility in his criticism. The successful poet who is also a critic usually has a valuable contribution to make to the general understanding and appreciation of poetry.

But the New World was also a place that attracted a special breed men with a thirst for adventure and discovery. Robert Cavelier de La Salle, whose energy and single-minded ambition made him one of the greatest explorers of the time, was such a man. At the age of twenty-four, La Salle crossed the Atlantic to America. Like Columbus before him, he was obsessed with finding a western passage to China. But the New World so intrigued him and inflamed his imagination that he abandoned the Far East for the mysteries of the still uncharted regions of North America. La Salle s explorations took him all over the continent, and finally, in 1682, he followed the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, where he claimed the territory he had traveled through for France, and named it Louisiana in honor of the Sun King, Louis XIV. Throughout his adventurous years, he never lost sight of this grand strategic goal, which was to link the Great Lakes to warm water ports on the Gulf of Mexico. The author combines impeccable scholarship with a novelist s narrative power and eye for stunning detail in this portrayal of La Salle s life and explorations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CbD9DQAAQBAJ&dq=La+Salle:+Explorer+of+the+North+American+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skullcrack (Young Adult Fiction)","description":"Jonah, a troubled boy who escapes from his dreary life with an alcoholic father by surfing on the coast of Ireland, discovers that he has a twin sister with whom he has an unusual mental link.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tDAPTTDpdZsC&dq=Skullcrack+(Young+Adult+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hamilton","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U2gSAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gerhard Richter 1998","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUE3OwAACAAJ&dq=Gerhard+Richter+1998&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discrete Random Signals and Statistical Signal Processing/Book and Disk (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bB-aQgAACAAJ&dq=Discrete+Random+Signals+and+Statistical+Signal+Processing/Book+and+Disk+(Prentice-Hall+Signal+Processing+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King (Dark Sun)","description":"The much-feared sorcerer-king of Urik, Hamanu joins a plot to force a transmutation that will allow him to avoid his own corruption but that will destroy all of Urik in the process.

The gargoyles of Dublin, Ireland, have a sacred duty to perform. Formerly God s avenging angels, for centuries they have been entrusted with guarding the churches and cathedrals of the Irish capital while avoiding all contact with human beings. But once a month these loyal stone sentries must leave their posts to attend a conclave of their kind, and it is during one such absence that a sacrilege occurs. The guardian of St. Patrick s Cathedral, the gargoyle Padraig, called  Paddy,  has returned to find violence and vandalism committed at his church and two silver artifacts stolen. Taking to Dublin s night streets in search of a culprit, Paddy inadvertently reveals himself to an aged chauffeur in an ancient Rolls Royce, thereby dooming Francis Templeton to an impending premature death. But the grim reaper will have to wait, because old man Templeton is a member of the Knights of Malta, a secret order of defenders of the faith dating back to the Crusades, and as such is an ideal partner for the onetime angel in his quest for justice and revenge. Their hunt is about to take some sinister turns, however, leading the gargoyle and the knight to Clontarf Castle, where a major demon, an emissary of Satan, is preparing to make his reentrance into the world. An acclaimed and much beloved fantasist best known for her popular Adept and Knights Templar series and her chronicles of the magical Deryni, Katherine Kurtz now displays another side of her extraordinary talent and succeeds magnificently. St. Patrick s Gargoyle is a delightful feast of the imagination, rich in Celtic lore and religious arcana, and brimming with wit and heart, wonder and magic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G3csDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Desert Hawks (The Wells Fargo Trail Books)","description":"Out of the Great American West, Book 5 in THE WELLS FARGO TRAIL Set in the 1870s in the desert of northern Arizona, The Desert Hawks opens with an action-filled story guaranteed to hold the interest of any Western buff.

The tales they tell reveal their own characters and serve in turn to supply dramatic settings for other tales told in response. In the chronicle of their self-revelations and of their reactions to one another, a thematic design may be traced. Chaucer s art of high comedy has behind it a literary tradition of which it is the fulfillment. Briefly this is the thesis of Professor Bernard F. Hupp? s A Reading of the Canterbury Tales. The book itself is the direct result of more than fifteen years of lecturing on the Canterbury Tales, during which time Professor Hupp? s views on the dramatic structure of the tales have been modified, clarified, and sharpened through discussion with students and colleagues, and through his study of Chaucer s literary tradition. A Reading of the Canterbury Tales retains the freshness and immediacy of a lecture series.

This may lead to the appearance of lateral interactions between particles at interfaces, or between inclusions in phospholipid membranes, followed eventually by the formation of two-dimensional ordered arrays. The book is devoted to the description of such processes, their consecutive stages, and to the investigation of the underlying physico-chemical mechanisms. The first six chapters give a concise but informative introduction to the basic knowledge in surface and colloid science, which includes both traditional concepts and some recent results. Chapters 1 and 2 are devoted to the basic theory of capillarity, kinetics of surfactant adsorption, shapes of axisymmetric fluid interfaces, contact angles and line tension. Chapters 3 and 4 present a generalization of the theory of capillarity to the case, in which the variation of the interfacial (membrane) curvature contributes to the total energy of the system. The generalized Laplace equation is applied to determine the configurations of free and adherent biological cells. Chapters 5 and 6 are focused on the role of thin liquid films and hydrodynamic factors in the attachment of solid and fluid particles to an interface. Surface forces of various physical nature are presented and their relative importance is discussed. Hydrodynamic interactions of a colloidal particle with an interface (or another particle) are also considered. Chapters 7 to 10 are devoted to the theoretical foundation of various kinds of capillary forces. When two particles are attached to the same interface (membrane), capillary interactions, mediated by the interface or membrane, appear between them. Two major kinds of capillary interactions are described: (i) capillary immersion force related to the surface wettability (Chapter 7), (ii) capillary flotation force originating from interfacial deformations due to particle weight (Chapter 8). Special attention is paid to the theory of capillary immersion forces between particles entrapped in spherical liquid films (Chapter 9). A generalization of the theory of immersion forces allows one to describe membrane-mediated interactions between protein inclusions into a lipid bilayer (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 is devoted to the theory of the capillary bridges and the capillary-bridge forces, whose importance has been recognized in phenomena like consolidation of granules and soils, wetting of powders, capillary condensation, long-range hydrophobic attraction, etc. The nucleation of capillary bridges is also examined. Chapter 12 considers solid particles, which have an irregular wetting perimeter upon attachment to a fluid interface. The undulated contact line induces interfacial deformations, which engender a special lateral capillary force between the particles. The latter contributes to the dilatational and shear elastic moduli of particulate adsorption monolayers. Chapter 13 describes how lateral capillary forces, facilitated by convective flows and some specific and non-specific interactions, can lead to the aggregation and ordering of various particles at fluid interfaces or in thin liquid films. Recent results on fabricating two-dimensional (2D) arrays from micrometer and sub-micrometer latex particles, as well as 2D crystals from proteins and protein complexes, are reviewed. Chapter 14 presents applied aspects of the particle-surface interaction in antifoaming and defoaming. The mechanisms of antifoaming action involve as a necessary step the entering of an antifoam particle at the air-water interface. The considered mechanisms indicate the factors for control of foaminess.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lsvn5zl7gvsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bonsai In Your Home: An Indoor Grower's Guide","description":" Offers instructions on care, including light, humidity, temperature, watering, and feeding requirements...creating groupings, propagating plants from seed and cuttings, trimming leaves, and pruning roots...[this] profusely illustrated and informative guide is in color.

Spiritual disciplines are simply ways to open ourselves to God. They help us become aware of the many ways God speaks to us and provide us with ways to respond to God. This book explores and explains how the historical disciplines and perspectives of the Christian faith can deepen both our walk with God and our community with others. Reading the Bible is something that most of us are familiar with. Some even do it regularly. But do we really think about how we read and respond to Scripture? How deeply do we allow ourselves to be impacted by it? Contemplative Bible reading (or lectio divina, as it is often called) is an ancient method of approaching Scripture. Consisting of four parts, this method begins with the selected biblical passage and moves to meditating, praying, and contemplating what God is revealing through the Bible. Many of us tend to think of meditation as something done individually, but reflecting on Scripture in a small group invites us to act and encourages us to share with others how God is calling us to respond. Contemplative Bible Reading examines this spiritual discipline and invites your small group to approach Scripture in a new and challenging way. By exploring different passages and learning to hear God's voice in them, this guide will help you meditate and act on the truth of the Bible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QFA-CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Is Tomorrow?","description":"Provides answers to a child's question \\"When is tomorrow?\\" through a vacation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TA9YwdMDGwUC&dq=When+Is+Tomorrow%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harold's fairy tale;: Further adventures with the purple crayon","description":"With his purple crayon, Harold draws his way into an enchanted garden troubled by a giant witch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IlIlAQAAIAAJ&dq=Harold%27s+fairy+tale%3B:+Further+adventures+with+the+purple+crayon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lonely Men","description":"In order to seek revenge on the Sackett family whom she believes destroyed her father, Laura Pritts Sackett dupes her brother-in-law Tell into undertaking a deadly mission through Apache territory to search for her kidnapped son.

The first London edition of the Memoirs in 1894 did not include \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", although all twelve stories had appeared in the Strand Magazine. The first U.S. edition did include the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle's request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources[specify] state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public. As a result, this story was not republished in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to His Last Bow. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Additionally, when the story was removed from the Memoirs, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\". In some later U.S. editions of the Memoirs, which still omit \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", this transfer still appears. reference : Wikipedia, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=12ZLDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cuban American Writers: Los Atrevidos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mEOxAAAAIAAJ&dq=Cuban+American+Writers:+Los+Atrevidos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Live From the Gates of Hell : An Insider's Look at the Anti-Abortion Movement","description":"Something big, something really big is coming, the leader of extremist group Rescue America warns reporter Jerry Reiter. It is the first hint of new terror to come in Pensacola, Florida-already ground zero for the nation's Culture War. As Reiter goes there to cover the murder trial of the first doctor slain in the holy war over abortion, he meets radicals from the Ku Klux Klan, Operation Rescue, and a militia man with duffel bags filled with semiautomatic weapons. Each person Reiter interviews offers up a different part of a frightening puzzle pointing to a plot with the potential to be the nation's worst act of domestic terrorism.Reiter is told by future assassin Paul Hill, You are about to see an IRA-type reign of terror. Twists and turns in the real-life plot pull the reader along into a strange subculture where terrorism is seen as a sacred virtue, and the irony of pro-life killing is lost on a fanatical national network of zealots. Reiter is given a string of hints that lead him to suspect a nightmarishly violent attack will take place at a candlelight vigil on the anniversary of the doctor's death as hundreds of abortion providers and feminist leaders from around the nation will be gathered to remember their fallen colleague. Standing in the dark of an open grassy area, they will not be able to see the armed men who wish them harm until it is too late.The hints are tantalizing, but Reiter is not sure if he has enough evidence to lead to arrests and the foiling of the potential plot. And the situation is personally ironic for Reiter; two years earlier he had put his broadcasting career on the line for the sake of Operation Rescue, working out of the state headquarters of the Christian Coalition of New York as a media coordinator in a national protest. Now he faces the prospect of either putting his very life on the line for abortion providers or allowing a cold-blooded mass murder plot to take place.The trail of blood that Reiter uncovers both takes him back to the mysterious circumstances of the first slaying, and down a road that will eventually lead him to become a reluctant informant for the FBI. With help from the FBI he will later witness a merger between militias and militant antiabortionists that will send chills down your spine. Reiter's own life is changed forever by his experiences in the nation's culture war and his subsequent role as a leader in a movement called The Common Ground Network for Life and Choice. Where he comes out at the end of the journey will surprise both pro-life and pro-choice people.Reiter, a founding member and activist in the Christian Coalition, shows that there are shockingly close (albeit indirect) ties between radicals and respectable conservatives, including such national figures as Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan and the compassionate conservative philosophy of George W. Bush. For instance, the legal defense for anti-abortion assassin Paul Hill is provided by an attorney working full-time in Robertson's legal machine, the ACLJ, the religious right's version of the ACLU. And by the end of the book, the reader will know where the religious right went wrong.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qDb3zkg4gBUC&dq=Live+From+the+Gates+of+Hell+:+An+Insider%27s+Look+at+the+Anti-Abortion+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Mother Is a Daughter: The Neverending Quest for Success, Inner Peace, and a Really Clean Kitchen","description":"Mothers and daughters go through so muchyet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down collectively to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal collaborators as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful, if sometimes fraught, ways their lives have overlapped. Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother s: Both have full-time careers (Perri is a pediatrician; Sheila is recently retired from a long career as a college English professor but goes on teaching); both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read, and to pass books back and forth. They also love to travelin fact, they often take trips together (and live to tell the tale). But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more Perri and Sheila acknowledge their profound differences in circumstance and temperament. A child of the Depression, Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by Orthodox Jewish parents who considered education an unnecessary luxury for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she s ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged and rebellious in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, fanatically frugal, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at enticing her mother into even the tiniest self-indulgence. Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and resentment, the petty irritations and abiding respect, that have always bound them together. Sheila recounts the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing anthropological fieldwork. Perri confesses that she can t tame her domestic chaos even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Sheila rhapsodizes about the bliss of becoming a grandmother. Perri marvels at her mother s fearless navigation of the New York City subways. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, confess long-hidden sorrows, relish precious memoriesand even offer family recipes and knitting patterns. Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, zest, and mutual admiration. A memoir in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet that resonates with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w6Xr39pHwOsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Columbella","description":"A governess becomes entangled with a dysfunctional and dangerous family in this novel by a New York Timesbestselling  master of suspense  (Mary Higgins Clark).

First, Bryan attempts to determine what kind of text Mark would have been seen to be, both by its author and by others who encountered it near the time of its writing. He examines whether Mark should be seen as an example of any particular literary type, and if so which. He concludes that a comparison of Mark with other texts of the period leads inevitably to the conclusion that Mark's contemporaries would broadly have characterized his work as a \\"life.\\" Second, Bryan looks at the evidence that exists to indicate whether Mark, like so much else of its period, was written to be read aloud. He points out ways in which Mark's narrative would have worked particularly well as rhetoric. The first examination of Mark as a whole in the light of contemporary studies of orality and oral transmission, A Preface to Mark not only shows us Mark in its original setting, but also suggests ways in which our own encounter with Mark's text may be significantly enriched. Its accessible style will serve as a good introduction to the Gospel for students as well as the general reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aFeCmch4xHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Flesh: Undressing for Success","description":"An autobiography of the poet, model, artist, songwriter, and porn star covers his thirty years in the Los Angeles gay community and the memorable men in his life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-H5aAAAAMAAJ&dq=In+the+Flesh:+Undressing+for+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Architecture of Europe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SihJuwEACAAJ&dq=The+Architecture+of+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microcosmos: The Invisible World of Insects","description":"Uses macrophotography and macrocinematography to reveal the behavior and characteristics of a variety of common insects","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OOxMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Microcosmos:+The+Invisible+World+of+Insects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Girl Among the Anarchists (Bison Book)","description":"Isabel Meredith is the narrator of A Girl among the Anarchists and the pseudonym of Helen and Olivia Rossetti, daughters of William Michael Rossetti and nieces of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

Young Isabel s description of her upbringing echoes the eccentricities of the Rosetti household. Isolated, restless, she feels a strong desire to \\"free\\" herself from \\"all the ideas, customs, and prejudices\\" of her class and to throw herself \\"into the life and work of the masses.\\" She becomes immersed in a subversive community that was seldom seen by bourgeois women in late Victorian England. In picaresque fashion she recounts outlandish vignettes of the anarchist life-style. But in growing from a girl to a woman Isabel undergoes more than physical change.

Then, one winter day, he mentioned to his doctor during a routine exam that he had been stumbling into forgetfulness, making his work difficult. After that fateful visit, and a subsequent battery of tests over several months, DeBaggio joined the legion of twelve million others afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. But under such a curse, DeBaggio was also given one of the greatest gifts: the ability to chart the ups and downs of his own failing mind. Losing My Mind is an extraordinary first-person account of early onset Alzheimer's -- the form of the disease that ravages younger, more alert minds. DeBaggio started writing on the first day of his diagnosis and has continued despite his slipping grasp on one of life's greatest treasures, memory. In an inspiring and detailed account, DeBaggio paints a vivid picture of the splendor of memory and the pain that comes from its loss. Whether describing the happy days of a youth spent in a much more innocent time or evaluating how his disease has affected those around him, DeBaggio poignantly depicts one of the most important parts of our lives -- remembrance -- and how we often take it for granted. But to DeBaggio, memory is more than just an account of a time long past, it is one's ability to function, to think, and ultimately, to survive. As his life becomes reduced to moments of clarity, the true power of thought and his ability to connect to the world shine through, and in DeBaggio's case, it is as much in the lack of functioning as it is in the ability to function that one finds love, hope and the relaxing golden years of peace. At once an autobiography, a medical history and a testament to the beauty of memory, Losing My Mind is more than just a story of Alzheimer's, it is the captivating tale of one man's battle to stay connected with the world and his own life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5NqTZTVwgMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The remarkable return of Winston Potter Crisply: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ca0XAAAACAAJ&dq=The+remarkable+return+of+Winston+Potter+Crisply:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Love Books of Ovid","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I_tFBCGMwxcC&dq=The+Love+Books+of+Ovid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mad Maria (French Edition)","description":"A Regency classic from NYT bestselling author Patricia Rice: Tainted by the gossip regarding her mad mother, Daphne Templeton surprises family and society by spurning Lord Griffin, the only gentleman interested in courting her.

Nature In the 1980s and 1990s, in places where no one thought it possible, scientists found organisms they called extremophiles: lovers of extremes. There were bacteria in volcanic hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, single-celled algae in Antarctic ice floes, and fungi in the cooling pools of nuclear reactors. But might there be life stranger than the most extreme extremophile? Might there be, somewhere, another kind of life entirely? In fact, scientists have hypothesized life that uses ammonia instead of water, life based not in carbon but in silicon, life driven by nuclear chemistry, and life whose very atoms are unlike those in life we know. In recent years some scientists have begun to look for the tamer versions of such life on rock surfaces in the American Southwest, in a  shadow biosphere  that might impinge on the known biosphere, and even deep within human tissue. They have also hypothesized more radical versions that might survive in Martian permafrost, in the cold ethylene lakes on Saturn s moon Titan, and in the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of giant planets in other solar systems. And they have imagined it in places off those worlds: the exotic ices in comets, the vast spaces between the stars, and strangest of all parallel universes. Distilling complex science in clear and lively prose, David Toomey illuminates the research of the biological avant-garde and describes the workings of weird organisms in riveting detail. His chapters feature an unforgettable cast of brilliant scientists and cover everything from problems with our definitions of life to the possibility of intelligent weird life. With wit and understanding that will delight scientists and lay readers alike, Toomey reveals how our current knowledge of life forms may account for only a tiny fraction of what s really out there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OecbjuHsBooC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Base Ten Invents Mathematics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mCMYAAAACAAJ&dq=Mr.+Base+Ten+Invents+Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Runaway Quilt: An Elm Creek Quilts Novel","description":"The fourth book in the popular Elm Creek Quilts series explores a question that has long captured the imagination of quilters and historians alike: Did stationmasters of the Underground Railroad use quilts to signal to fugitive slaves? In her first novel, The Quilter's Apprentice, Jennifer Chiaverini wove quilting lore with tales from the World War II home front. Now, following Round Robin and The Cross-Country Quilters, Chiaverini revisits the legends of Elm Creek Manor, as Sylvia Compson discovers evidence of her ancestors' courageous involvement in the Underground Railroad. Alerted to the possibility that her family had ties to the slaveholding South, Sylvia scours her attic and finds three quilts and a memoir written by Gerda, the spinster sister of clan patriarch Hans Bergstrom. The memoir describes the founding of Elm Creek Manor and how, using quilts as markers, Hans, his wife, Anneke, and Gerda came to beckon fugitive slaves to safety within its walls. When a runaway named Joanna arrives from a South Carolina plantation pregnant with her master's child, the Bergstroms shelter her through a long, dangerous winter -- imagining neither the impact of her presence nor the betrayal that awaits them. The memoir raises new questions for every one it answers, leading Sylvia ever deeper into the tangle of the Bergstrom legacy. Aided by the Elm Creek Quilters, as well as by descendants of others named in Gerda's tale, Sylvia dares to face the demons of her family's past and at the same time reaffirm her own moral center. A spellbinding fugue on the mysteries of heritage, The Runaway Quilt unfolds with all the drama and suspense of a classic in the making.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ef-LFscKLcAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dog Logic: Companion Obedience, Rapport-Based Training (Howell Reference Books)","description":"To train your dog effectively, you must establish more than authority and obedience.

Yet most companies view change as a threat, and survival as the goal. This book transforms all that. It contains a simple yet revolutionary idea: we can evolve our companies the same way nature evolves a species. Evolution is a fundamental force of nature, and Seth Godin demonstrates how it can be put to work in any organisation. The first step is to eliminate the anti-change reflex that's genetically coded into all of us. Once a company learns to 'zoom' (to change without panicking), it is much more likely to evolve. And a company that evolves can become ever more profitable. For the last five years, bestselling author Seth Godin has repeatedly demonstrated the power of his books by living their advice. He used the tactics in PERMISSION MARKETING to drive the book up the bestseller list. He followed the advice of UNLEASHING THE IDEA VIRUS to turn his treatise into a living example of an ideavirus. Now, as a committed zoomer, he shows his legions of fans how to turn their company into one that can zoom from one change to another. It's a formula for success whether the market is up or down, whether technology is hot or not, in all industries, from retail to tech to services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KY0zPQAACAAJ&dq=Survival+Is+Not+Enough:+Zooming,+Evolution,+and+the+Future+of+Your+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lynne Truss Treasury: Columns and Three Comic Novels","description":"Lynne Truss debuted in America as a guffaw-inducing grammarian, but her British audience has known her for years as a critically acclaimed novelist and columnist. Her previous works are now available stateside in one volume, complete with a new preface. With One Lousy Free Packet of Seed, a raucous comedy of errors, follows the exploits of Osborne Lonsdale, who writes a weekly column called \\"Me and My Shed\\" for a floundering gardening magazine. When the publication is taken over by a gung-ho management team, Lonsdale must learn to cope with his new coworkers. In Tennyson's Gift and Going Loco, Truss turns a fiendishly clever eye to the literary world. Tennyson's Gift is an imaginative cocktail of Victorian seriousness and farce that re-imagines the world of the nineteenth-century English poet laureate, placing him in the midst of eccentric company that includes dodgy Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll). Going Loco features a critic trying to write a definitive account of the doppelg?nger in gothic fiction, amidst the chaos of her domestic life, including paranoia that her cleaning lady is taking over her life. Making the Cat Laugh is a riotous collection of columns about single life. Truss comments on dating, secondhand smoking, shopping, holidays, and people who ask, \\"How's the novel going?\\" All the while, she continues an eighteen-year quest to make her cat laugh. Reportedly, the feline remains unimpressed.

Yet, despite the book?s continued relevancy, Harbour is once again stepping ahead of the curve to fully update his little yellow book. In addition to adding the wisdom of lessons learned over the past decade, he adds two new chapters to this second edition. One of these chapters discusses units of measurement. The other introduces ways to better interpret what has been measured and then translate those measurement-related interpretations into actionable knowledge. Harbour provides a six-step method for developing a performance measurement system. He shows how to design performance measurement families and how to build hierarchies tailored to different levels within an organization. He also covers collection and distribution, as well as the value of performance measure displays. When you finish this book, you will be able to undertake performance measurement with new confidence.

The New York Times Book Review From the author of The Unidentified, an intellectual feast for fans of offbeat history that takes readers on a road trip through some of the country s most infamously haunted places and deep into the dark side of our history. Colin Dickey is on the trail of America s ghosts. Crammed into old houses and hotels, abandoned prisons and empty hospitals, the spirits that linger continue to capture our collective imagination, but why? His own fascination piqued by a house hunt in Los Angeles that revealed derelict foreclosures and  zombie homes,  Dickey embarks on a journey across the continental United States to decode and unpack the American history repressed in our most famous haunted places. Some have established reputations as  the most haunted mansion in America,  or  the most haunted prison ; others, like the haunted Indian burial grounds in West Virginia, evoke memories from the past our collective nation tries to forget. With boundless curiosity, Dickey conjures the dead by focusing on questions of the living how do we, the living, deal with stories about ghosts, and how do we inhabit and move through spaces that have been deemed, for whatever reason, haunted? Paying attention not only to the true facts behind a ghost story, but also to the ways in which changes to those facts are made and why those changes are made Dickey paints a version of American history left out of the textbooks, one of things left undone, crimes left unsolved. Spellbinding, scary, and wickedly insightful, Ghostland discovers the past we re most afraid to speak of aloud in the bright light of day is the same past that tends to linger in the ghost stories we whisper in the dark.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J9gzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Haunted+Past&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walk Across America","description":"Twenty-five years ago, a disillusioned young man set out on a walk across America.

His experiences remain as sharp and telling today as they were twenty-five years ago -- from the timeless secrets of life, learned from a mountain-dwelling hermit, to the stir he caused by staying with a black family in North Carolina, to his hours of intense labor in Southern mills.

In 1967, a young E. Michael Helms boarded a bus to the legendary grounds of Parris Island, where mere boys were forged into hardened Marines and sent to the jungles of Vietnam. It was the first stop on a journey that would forever change him and by its end, he would be awarded the Purple Heart Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Citation, and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. From the brutality and endurance-straining ordeals of boot camp to the endless horror of combat, Helms paints a vivid, unflinchingly realistic depiction of the lives of Marines in training and under fire. As powerful and compelling a battlefield memoir as any ever written, Helms's  grunt's-eye  view of the Vietnam War, the men who fought it, and the mindless chaos that surrounded it, is truly a modern military classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QXbjOSnltIEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting the message: Eugene Peterson's contemporary translation of the Bible has enjoyed immediate acclaim.: An article from: Presbyterian Record","description":"Since Eugene Peterson first wrote this spiritual formation classic nearly forty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Christians have been inspired by Peterson's prophetic and pastoral wisdom and the call to deeper discipleship found in the Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134).

The clash between fellow Virginians (and second cousins) Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall remains the most decisive confrontation between a president and a chief justice in American history. Fought in private as well as in full public view, their struggle defined basic constitutional relationships in the early days of the republic and resonates still in debates over the role of the federal government vis- -vis the states and the authority of the Supreme Court to interpret laws. Jefferson was a strong advocate of states' rights who distrusted the power of the federal government. He believed that the Constitution defined federal authority narrowly and left most governmental powers to the states. He was suspicious of the Federalist-dominated Supreme Court, whose members he viewed as partisan promoters of their political views at the expense of Jefferson's Republicans. When he became president, Jefferson attempted to correct the Court's bias by appointing Republicans to the Court. He also supported an unsuccessful impeachment of Federalist Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. Marshall believed in a strong federal government and was convinced that an independent judiciary offered the best protection for the Constitution and the nation. After he was appointed by Federalist President John Adams to be chief justice in 1801 (only a few weeks before Jefferson succeeded Adams), he issued one far-reaching opinion after another. Beginning with the landmark decision Marbury v. Madison in 1803, and through many cases involving states' rights, impeachment, treason, and executive privilege, Marshall established the Court as the final arbiter of the Constitution and the authoritative voice for the constitutional supremacy of the federal government over the states. As Marshall's views prevailed, Jefferson became increasingly bitter, certain that the Court was suffocating the popular will. But Marshall's carefully reasoned rulings endowed the Court with constitutional authority even as they expanded the power of the federal government, paving the way for later Court decisions sanctioning many pivotal laws of the modern era, such as those of the New Deal, the Great Society, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a fascinating description of the treason trial of Jefferson's former vice president, Aaron Burr, James F. Simon shows how Marshall rebuffed President Jefferson's claim of executive privilege. That decision served as precedent for a modern Supreme Court ruling rejecting President Nixon's claim that he did not have to hand over the Watergate tapes. More than 150 years after Jefferson's and Marshall's deaths, their words and achievements still reverberate in constitutional debate and political battle. What Kind of Nation is a dramatic rendering of a bitter struggle between two shrewd politicians and powerful statesmen that helped create a United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pcm-Poj-LYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows of Yesterday","description":"A young mother stranded on a Texas highway is rescued by a handsome hero in a pickup truck . . . and now, she must face the fears of the past or risk losing the greatest love she's ever known.

Building on the body of work done on mitigation in English, the book begins by discussing how it has been conceptualized in the literature, drawing on politeness theory among other perspectives from pragmatics, and highlighting increasing research on these topics in native and bilingual Spanish speakers and learners of Spanish. The volume explores examples from a variety of discursive contexts, including institutions, courts, and classrooms, to unpack mitigation as it occurs in spontaneous speech through different lenses, looking both at the actual units of discourse but also taking a broader view by examining differences across dialects as well. The book also looks at the ways in which conclusions drawn from this research might be applied pedagogically in language learning classrooms. This volume will serve as a jumping-off point for broader discussion in the field of mitigation and will be of particular interest to graduate students and researchers in pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and discourse analysis, in addition to learners and pre-service teachers of Spanish.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D6nODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graceful Simplicity: Toward a Philosophy and Politics of Simple Living","description":"Argues that Americans have found that economic abundance is not fulfilling in itself, and suggests ways to change how we think about money and the simple life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y6WFQgAACAAJ&dq=Graceful+Simplicity:+Toward+a+Philosophy+and+Politics+of+Simple+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Don't Have to Be a Kid to Pull a Rabbit Out of a Hat: Magic for Adults","description":"Takes magic out of the realm of children's birthday parties and shows how to infuse added fun into your daily life.

It's a look at food and sex and how they go together in our daily lives much more often than we realize. There are so many ways that hunger and desire act on each other, and so many things that can influence our preferences. Not only are people moved by the taste, texture, and the shapes of the food they eat, but even the names of some dishes can kindle hunger of both kinds in some. As the author writes, \\"Sometimes cooking is foreplay, eating is making love, and doing the dishes is the morning after.\\" The many things Bunny Crumpacker shares with the readers of her fascinating book almost could have inspired her to write a novel, sending Adam and Eve (with their apple) traveling through history as the icons of our passions. Instead, she has gone far beyond the obvious to bring us unexpected and tantalizing knowledge of how much and in how many surprising ways we assuage our hunger for both food and sex and how where there's one, there is often the other. The result is a continued delight. There's history and humor, obvious connections and truly amazing ones. The author enlightens us on a myriad of topics, including food in fairy tales, what politicians eat, comfort food, and manners at the table. But enough! There's too much to say.

The use of that text also gave these researchers the opportunity to raise questions, and express additional needs for materials on techniques poorly covered in the literature. For example, when designing an inter-rater reliability study, many researchers wanted to know how to determine the optimal number of raters and the optimal number of subjects that should participate in the experiment. Also, very little space in the literature has been devoted to the notion of intra-rater reliability, particularly for quantitative measurements. The fourth edition of this text addresses those needs, in addition to further refining the presentation of the material already covered in the third edition. Features of the Fourth Edition include: New material on sample size calculations for chance-corrected agreement coefficients, as well as for intraclass correlation coefficients. The researcher will be able to determine the optimal number raters, subjects, and trials per subject.The chapter entitled  Benchmarking Inter-Rater Reliability Coefficients  has been entirely rewritten.The introductory chapter has been substantially expanded to explore possible definitions of the notion of inter-rater reliability.All chapters have been revised to a large extent to improve their readability.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fac9BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Build the Perfect Beast: The Quest to Design the Coolest Car Ever Made","description":"Mark Christensen grew up with a simple dream-to build a 600 horsepower suicide machine able to accelerate from zero to sixty in less time than it takes to read this sentence. When a friend offers him $100,000 to realize that dream, Christensen enlists Nick Pugh, the best young auto designer in the country. An idealistic, charismatic, twenty-two year old star student from the celebrated Art Center for Design in Pasadena, Pugh shows Christensen his sketches of the Xeno I-drawings that are stunningly original and strangely familiar-\\"as if they were the best ideas I never had.\\" Thus inspired, the author sets out to assemble a \\"best of the best\\" group of engineers, mechanics and fabricators. But the dream becomes grander and the designs of the Xeno evolve spectacularly after the endlessly hard working utopian Pugh develops an ingenious method for automobiles to triple their driving range. And as new and wilder Xenos fly from Pugh's monster imagination, nothing seems impossible. That is until the author discovers that $100,000 may not even pay for the hubcaps that Pugh has envisioned. Build the Perfect Beast is a window into 21st century technology and cutting edge design at its most relevant and bizarre-an epic odyssey about craft, cars, opportunity and ambition that sizzles like American Graffiti on acid.

Diagnosed with a lower limb disability at birth, Ronan Tynan had his legs amputated below the knee when he was twenty years old. Eight weeks later, he was climbing the stairs of his college dorm, and within a year, he was winning races in the Paralympic Games, amassing eighteen gold medals and fourteen world records. After becoming the first disabled person ever admitted to the National College of Physical Education, he served a short stint in the prosthetics industry and began a new career in medicine. He continued his studies at Trinity College, where he specialized in orthopedic sports injuries. After earning his medical degree, Ronan chose music for the next act in his life. Less than one year after he began studying voice, he won both the John McCormick Cup for Tenor Voice and the BBC talent show Go for It. He went on to win the prestigious International Operatic Singing Competition in France, and in 1998 his debut Sony album, My Life Belongs to You, became a top-five hit in England within just two weeks and eventually went platinum. Later that year, he was invited to join The Irish Tenors, furthering a journey that started in a small Irish village and has brought him to the world's grandest stages. In Halfway Home, Tynan movingly describes his life story, which Barbara Walters called \\"so amazing you may find it hard to believe.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QVI55mUdX90C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jessica'a First Prayer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-6tBQgAACAAJ&dq=Jessica%27a+First+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Start a Business in South Carolina","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0QqaMQEACAAJ&dq=How+to+Start+a+Business+in+South+Carolina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil and Other Stories (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"'It is impossible to explain why Yevgeny chose Liza Annenskaya, as it is always impossible to explain why a man chooses this and not that woman.' This collection of eleven stories spans virtually the whole of Tolstoy's creative life. While each is unique in form, as a group they are representative of his style, and touch on the central themes that surface in War and Peace and Anna Karenina. Stories as different as 'The Snowstorm', 'Lucerne', 'The Diary of a Madman', and 'The Devil' are grounded in autobiographical experience. They deal with journeys of self-discovery and the moral and religious questioning that characterizes Tolstoy's works of criticism and philosophy. 'Strider' and 'Father Sergy', as well as reflecting Tolstoy's own experiences, also reveal profound psychological insights. These stories range over much of the Russian world of the nineteenth century, from the nobility to the peasantry, the military to the clergy, from merchants and cobblers to a horse and a tree. Together they present a fascinating picture of Tolstoy's skill and artistry. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZolrpEZ8tn8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steve Austin (Pro Wrestling Legends)","description":"CHBiographies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YslbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Steve+Austin+(Pro+Wrestling+Legends)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protestant Catholic Jew","description":"A study of the structure and development of three religions in America from a sociological viewpoint","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-STjdtc075gC&dq=Protestant+Catholic+Jew&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sisterhood (Macmillan UK Audio Books)","description":"Paula Grey 'witnesses' the murder of Norbert Engel, key German Statesman.

Others challenged racism in ways more solitary but no less life changing. These twenty-three stories give a voice to the nameless, ordinary citizens without whom the movement would have failed. From bloody melees at public lunch counters to anxious musings at the family dinner table, the diverse experiences depicted in this anthology make the civil rights movement as real and immediate as the best histories and memoirs. Each story focuses on a particular, sometimes private, moment in the historic struggle for social justice in America. Events have a permanent effect on characters, like the white girl in \\"Spring Is Now\\" who must sort through her feelings about the only black boy in her school, or the black preacher in \\"The Convert\\" who tells a friend, \\"This thing of being a man . . . The Supreme Court can't make you a man. The NAACP can't do it. God Almighty can do a lot, but even He can't do it. Ain't nobody can do it but you.\\" If a character survives--and some do not--the event can become a turning point, a vision for a better world. The sections into which the stories are grouped parallel the news headlines of the day: School Desegregation (1954 on), Sit-ins (1960 on), Marches and Demonstrations (1963 on), and Acts of Violence. In the last section, Retrospective, characters look back on their personal involvement with the movement. Twenty writers--eleven black and nine white--are represented in the collection. Ten stories were written during the 1960s. That the others were written long after the movement's heyday suggests the potency of that time as a continuing source of creative inspiration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qjm6B4xirD0C&dq=Short+Stories+of+the+Civil+Rights+Movement:+An+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A desperado in Arizona, 1858-1860;: Or, The life, trial, death, and confession of Samuel H.

It's time to enter into the transforming light of your Creator who invites you to live from the still center of his undying love.

With the approach of the year 2000, such millennial visions seem once again to be increasing in popularity. Stephen O'Leary sheds new light on the age-old phenomenon of the End of the Age by proposing a rhetorical explanation for the appeal of millennialism.

The book concludes with a critical review of the recent appearances of doomsday scenarios in our politics and culture, and a meditation on the significance of the Apocalypse in the nuclear age.

Twelve Stories of Russia: A Novel, I guess is about an American who moves to Moscow in 1991 - just before the fall of the Iron Curtain - to help Russians understand the difference between the and a. In his quest he is witness to an unsuccessful coup, an even-less-successful rebellion, rampant inflation, unprecedented social, economic and political change, Mafia infighting, and a host of other phenomena that characterize this period. But, alas, the book pays almost no attention to any of this. In Russia such cataclysms are a given, and the narrator, in his discussions with Russian friends, is forced to address much more pressing issues of cross-cultural relations: \\"Why is it,\\" a friend asks, \\"that you Americans smile so much?\\"\\" \\"What is the structure of the novel? The book is four hundred forty-eight pages with a total word count of one hundred thirty-seven thousand words. It is divided into twelve chapters called \\"books,\\" which represent semi-independent stories, each with its own style. The chapters are connected both chronologically and by unifying themes: the main character's quest for the \\"eleven Russian words that are not just words\\"; his futile attempt to love vodka; his long-distance relationship with the aunt he has abandoned in his search for \\"danger.\\"\\" \\"Who is the audience? Any foreigner who has been to Russia and can compare the book with his own experiences. Russians who know English and are interested in seeing a fresh, thoughtful perspective on their culture. Intelligent readers who understand that America is not the only country in the world.

To establish these links, Crowther deploys a mode of analytic philosophy influenced by Cassirer. This approach recontextualizes precisely those aspects of postmodernism which appear, superficially, to be fuel for the relativist fire. This method also enables him to illuminate some of the great practical dangers of the postmodern era - most notably the widespread inability or unwillingness to distinguish between signs and reality. Crowther renews analytic philosophy as a searching form of conceptual and cultural critique that pushes beyond the limits of postmodern thought. Essential reading for advanced students and academics interested in Twentieth Century Philosophy, Philosophy After Postmodernism will also be of value to scholars working in the fields of Cultural Studies and Sociology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JQV_AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ohio State Buckeyes Football Calendar","description":"Do you think you're the ultimate superfan of the Ohio State Buckeyes?Do you have a friend who bleeds scarlet and gray?Do you want to learn about the history of your favorite Big Ten school's football program?Even if those questions don't apply to you, The Ultimate Ohio State Buckeyes Trivia Book is the best book for learning about the Buckeyes and their history.

While some marvel at these changes, envisioning consciousness downloaded into a computer or humans \\"beamed\\" Star Trek-style, others view them with horror, seeing monsters brooding in the machines. In How We Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles separates hype from fact, investigating the fate of embodiment in an information age. Hayles relates three interwoven stories: how information lost its body, that is, how it came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material forms that carry it; the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg; and the dismantling of the liberal humanist \\"subject\\" in cybernetic discourse, along with the emergence of the \\"posthuman.\\" Ranging widely across the history of technology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Hayles shows what had to be erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. Thus she moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel Limbo by cybernetics aficionado Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems. Although becoming posthuman can be nightmarish, Hayles shows how it can also be liberating. From the birth of cybernetics to artificial life, How We Became Posthuman provides an indispensable account of how we arrived in our virtual age, and of where we might go from here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lQPQfHKcYSAC&dq=How+We+Became+Posthuman:+Virtual+Bodies+in+Cybernetics,+Literature,+and+Informatics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing Matisse: A Year in France Living My Dream","description":"Who hasn't had the fanthasy of leaving his or her old life behind to start over? What would happen if you gave up your job, city, state, and routine to move to another part of the world? Critically acclaimed writer and aspiring painter James Morgan does just that. Risking everything, he and his wife shed their old, settled life in a lovingly restored house in Little Rock, Arkansas, to travel in the footsteps of Morgan's hero, the painter Henri Matisse, and to find inspiration in Matisse's fierce struggle to live the life he knew he had to live. Part memoir, part travelogue, and part biography of Matisse, Chasing Matisse proves that you don't have to be wealthy to live the life you want; you just have to want it enough. Morgan's riveting journey of self-discovery takes him, and us, from the earthy, brooding Picardy of Matisse's youth all the way to the luminous Nice of the painter's final years. In between, Morgan confronts, with the notebook of a journalist and the sketchpad of an artist, the places that Matisse himself saw and painted: bustling, romantic Paris; windswept Belle-?le off the Brittany coast; Corsica, with its blazing southern light; the Pyr nees village of Collouire, where color became explosive in Matisse's hands; exotic Morocco, land of the secret interior life; and across the sybaritic French Riviera to spiritual Vence and the hillside Villa Le R ve -- the Dream -- where the mature artist created so many of his masterpieces. A journey from darkness to light, Chasing Matisse shows us how we can learn to see ourselves, others, and the world with fresh eyes. We look with Morgan out of some of the same windows through which Matisse himself found his subjects and take great heart from Matisse's indomitable, life-affirming spirit. For Matisse, living was an art, and he never stopped striving, never stopped creating, never stopped growing, never stopped reinventing himself. \\"The artist,\\" he said, \\"must look at everything as though he were seeing it for the first time.\\" That's the inspiring message of renewal that comes through on every page of Chasing Matisse. Funny, sad, and defiantly hopeful, this is a book that restores our faith in the possibility of dreams.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qOmbAEpskH4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adolf Loos, 1870-1933: Architect, Cultural Critic, Dandy (Taschen Basic Architecture)","description":"WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPHETS OF MODERN ARCHITECTURE, ADOLF LOOS (1870-1933) WAS A STAR IN HIS OWN TIME, KNOWN THROUGHOUT VIENNA AS AN OUTSPOKEN, AUDACIOUS DANDY AND MORALIST WHO DEFIED THE ESTABLISHMENT.

Ten years later I would fall in love for the first time. At twenty-one I would turn the tables and confront my kidnapper. Seven years after that I married my soul mate. In 2001, we would separate, driven apart by our individual battles to discover ourselves. At thirty I began writing a long letter to my wife. The letter, which I never sent, marked the first steps on a journey to the center of my soul.In tracing my roots I inadvertently became the bearer of my grandparents' tales of survival in the Nazi death camps. My grandfather was sent to the camps because he was Jewish: my grandmother because she was a seventeen-year-old Christian girl working with the Greek underground. At seventeen she was captured, interrogated, and tortured for six months. She never broke. Had she, an entire village would have been slaughtered. Three years later, in 1945, she walked out of Ravensbruck. I looked back to understand that I was empowered by Faith, motivated by Hope, held together by my Greek family, and emboldened by my grandmother's undaunted spirit and her timeless anecdotes.

Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because we ve overpaid for it in the past? Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldn t spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store? We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal finance s most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices. Exploring a wide range of everyday topics from the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday sales Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether it s the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits. The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s5QzMQAACAAJ&dq=Dollar%24ense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serious golf for duffers: 40 tips to improve your game and lower your score","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e3v5GwAACAAJ&dq=Serious+golf+for+duffers:+40+tips+to+improve+your+game+and+lower+your+score&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Import Handbook: A Compliance and Planning Guide","description":"With the passage of GATT and NAFTA, there has been a corresponding increase in imports and therefore an increase in the balance of trade.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Girl's Life: Boys, Weddings and Luck","description":"Gingher's childhood memoirs are a celebration of the last era in America, the 1950's and 60's.

It is a story of ghosts and phantoms and strange mental aberrations; of an invisible world that surrounds us and occasionally engulfs us; of prophets and prophecies, and gods and demons. It is a world of illusion and hallucination where the unreal seems very real, and where reality itself is distorted by strange forces which can seemingly manipulate space, time, and physical matter?forces that are almost entirely beyond our powers of comprehension.\\" John A.

The book shredded the then trendy nuts-and-bolts extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs in favor of one that linked UFOs to a variety of paranormal and supernatural phenomena that have taken place throughout history.

The politics, drivers of emergence, and diversity of these myriad forms of state power are explored in light of the positionality of emerging markets within the network of space and power relations that characterises contemporary global finance. The book develops a multi-disciplinary perspective and combines insights from Marxist political economy, post-Keynesian economics, economic geography, and postcolonial and feminist International Political Economy. Alami comprehensively reviews the theories, histories, and geographies of cross-border finance management, and develops a conceptual framework which allows unpacking the complex entanglement of constraint and opportunities, of growing integration and tight discipline, that cross-border finance represents for emerging markets. Extensive fieldwork research provides an in-depth comparative critical interrogation of the policies and regulations deployed in Brazil and South Africa. This volume will be especially useful to those researching and working in the areas of international political economy, contemporary geographies of money and finance, and critical development studies.

The long introduction begins with a catalogue of manuscripts; and this leads to an investigation into the manuscript tradition and the history of the poem's transmission. Dr Hall then surveys the most important printed editions of the poem. He examines various theories of dating and discusses the sources of the story. He concludes the introduction with a brief critical assessment of the form and style of the poem. Dr Hall establishes his text after an examination of all the extant manuscripts. The apparatus, though very full, is selective in that it records readings of younger manuscripts only when they offer something new. It also ignores trifling corruptions. The commentary is similarly selective. In general, it discusses everything relevant to the establishing of the text and ignores points of purely mythological and literary interest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NewKxhZSxpEC&dq=Claudian:+De+Raptu+Proserpinae+(Cambridge+Classical+Texts+and+Commentaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swanny's Ways (New American Fiction)","description":"The life of a street gang member turned student.

At times, as in the early days of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and in the Falklands conflict, carriers alone could deploy high-performance aircraft to the battlefield. In other operations, such as enforcing the no-fly zones and the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, only carriers could provide the bases needed for sustained combat and support operations. This second volume of Norman Polmar's landmark study details the role of carriers in the unification of the U.S. armed forces and strategic deterrence, fiscally constrained Great Britain, the development of British Commonwealth and ex-colonial navies, and the efforts of France and the Netherlands to rebuild their fleets. The role of the modern carrier-nine nations currently possess them-is discussed, as are the issues confronting nations that might acquire them. Chapters on the Soviet Union's effort to produce carriers are included for the first time. The development of both carrier planes and the many \\"oddball\\" aircraft that have flown from carriers-such as the U-2 spy plane-are also examined. Appendixes include comprehensive data on all carriers built and converted through 2006. This volume is a valuable companion to the critically acclaimed Volume I, which covers aircraft carrier development and operations from 1909 to 1945.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6z7quhWS-BoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eminent Victorians","description":"Eminent Victorians is a book by Lytton Strachey.

Soon after the end of the terrible Great War, Mrs. Grey brings her five young children to the French countryside for the summer in hopes of instilling in them a sense of history and humility. But when she is struck down by a sudden illness and hospitalized, the siblings are left to fend for themselves at the lovely, bullet-scarred hotel Les Oeillets, under the suspicious, watchful eyes of its owner, Mademoiselle Zizi. The young ones find a willing guide, companion, and protector in charming Englishman Eliot, a longtime resident at Les Oeillets and Mlle. Zizi s apparent paramour. But as these warm days of freedom, discovery, and adolescent adventure unfold, Eliot s interest becomes more and more focused on the eldest of the Grey children, sixteen-year-old daughter Joss. The older man s obsession with the innocent, alluring, heartbreakingly beautiful woman-child soon threatens to overstep all bounds of propriety. And as Eliot s fascination increases, so does the jealousy of his disrespected lover, adding fuel to a dangerously smoldering fire that could erupt into unexpected violence at any moment.

Is the word \\"Satan\\" merely a synonym for wickedness, or does it stand for a concrete entity? In cultured circles it has become the custom to return a negative answer to these questions, and to flatly deny the existence of the Tempter. Among such people it is regarded as a mark of intellectual superiority to repudiate the personality of the Devil. By many, Satan is now looked upon as a product of priestcraft, a relic of superstition, the myth of a bygone age. With others, Satan is simply an abstraction, a mere negation, the opposite of good. \\"All the Devil there is, is the devil within you,\\" is the last word of \\"modern thought.\\" The words which Goethe puts into the mouth of Mephistopholes\\"I am the Spirit of Negation\\"is accepted as a good workable definition of the Devil. He is regarded as a mere abstract principle of evil. As someone has quaintly put it, \\"They spell Devil without a 'd', as they spell God with two 'o's'. Good and evil is their scheme.\\" Totally based on the scriptures.

Born in 1791, Mary Telfair grew up in Savannah, Georgia, where she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant-planter and three-term governor of Georgia. Although reared in the South, she bore no kinship to the plantation mistress living in isolation -- alienated by paternalism and male domination. Rather she belonged to an elite circle of urban Southerners who felt as much at home in the drawing rooms of Philadelphia and New York as in the parlours of Charleston and Savannah. As Johnson writes, \\"Mary Telfair was her own woman, but she affirmed her identity within the framework of good manners, decorum, and taste demanded of women of her station.\\" Many of the countrys leading figures passed through the lives of the Telfairs, and the Telfairs were related to, or close friends with, most of the prominent families in Savannah and the Georgia upcountry -- relationships fully explored in this work. Johnsons legal training played a significant role in enabling him to unravel the climactic event in Mary Telfairs story -- the great Telfair will contest, one of the epic legal battles of the nineteenth century. Drawing on a stunning amount of research, Charles Johnson reveals the choices and originality of a woman of vision. The result is an unforgettable portrait -- a \\"must-read\\" for anyone interested in nineteenth-century Southern history and womens studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lvXfYgEACAAJ&dq=Mary+Telfair:+The+Life+and+Legacy+of+a+Nineteenth-Century+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweeney Squadron : A Novel about fighter command in WW II","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tkAPAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working Relationships: Spirituality in Human Service and Organisational Life (Practical Theology Series)","description":"In this illuminating and thoughtful text, Neil Pembroke shows how relationships form the heart of chaplaincy, nursing and social care practice.

In August of 1942 the first American marines charged Guadalcanal, igniting a six-month battle for two thousand square miles of jungle and sand. In that gruesome stretch sixty thousand Americans made the jump from boat to beach, and one in nine did not return. James Jones fought in that battle, and The Thin Red Line is his haunting portrait of men and war. The soldiers of C-for-Charlie Company are not cast from the heroic mold. The unit s captain is too intelligent and sensitive for the job, his first sergeant is half mad, and the enlisted men begin the campaign gripped by cowardice. Jones s moving portrayal of the Pacific combat experience stands among the great literature of World War II.

Now, in the follow-up to his bestselling 1000 Years for Revenge, he returns with devastating new evidence that the government has been covering up its own counterterror failures since the mid-1990s -- and continues today. In Cover Up, Lance shows how the government chose again and again to sacrifice America's national security for personal motives and political convenience. In its first half, he unveils shattering new evidence that terror mastermind Ramzi Yousef ordered the bombing of TWA 800 from his prison cell in order to effect a mistrial in his own terror bombing case. Astonishingly, the FBI was alerted to Yousef's plans in advance by a prison informant who even passed along his detailed sketch of a bomb-trigger device -- a document seen here for the first time. And Lance reveals the shocking reason the Justice Department suddenly ruled the crash anaccident despite overwhelming evidence of the bombing -- throwing away its best chance to penetrate the cell that was already planning 9/11. And the outrage doesn't stop there. In Part II, Lance offers an unofficial \\"minority report\\" on the 9/11 Commission, critiquing it as the incomplete, highly politicized \\"Warren Commission of our time.\\" He explores potential conflicts of interest among its members, from the staff director who wrote a book with Condoleezza Rice, to the former Clinton deputy attorney general who participated in a critical meeting that upended the TWA probe. He exposes the report's false contention that the 9/11 plan was conceived in 1996, when the FBI had knowledge that the plot was in motion as early as 1994. And, in a heart-stopping, minute-by-minute chronicle of the attacks, he asks dozens of unanswered questions about the defense failures of that day -- from why fighter jets weren't scrambled for almost an hour after the hijackings, to why the president and several of his top military advisers remained virtually incommunicado for more than half an hour after it was clear that America was under attack. At a time when America feels no safer than ever, Cover Up will lend new eyes to readers who want the full story behind the 9/11 attacks -- and inspire us all to keep demanding the truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EavDeM5NIaEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kingdom of the dwarfs","description":"A lavishly illustrated journey into the world of legend's most elusive people in the tradition of J.R.R.

With both compassion and a sharp sense of reality, anthropologist William Lewis suggests alternative perspectives and reviews existing social theories as he reports on the diverse world of the ganja-smoking Rastafari culture. He carefully examines this culture in its confrontations with the law, its growing ambivalence about itself as well as the continued conflict between many Rasta and contemporary middle-class values. Characterized by rich ethnographic detail, an engaging writing style, and thoughtful commentary, Soul Rebels uncovers the complex inner workings of the Rasta movement and offers a critical analysis of the meaning of Rastafari commitment and struggles. Soul Rebels offers a solid historical overview of the movement, an excellent picture of diversity within the faith, fair and accurate discussions of sexism among the Rasta, engaging life history material, and rich descriptions of what actually goes on in a reasoning session. Lewiss treatment of Rastafari populations in a Jamaican fishing village, an Ethiopian market town, and an urban neighborhood in the northeastern United States sets his ethnography in the cross-cultural and comparative framework central to anthropological analysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UeIYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Physicians Current Procedural Terminology: CPT 1998 (Cpt / Current Procedural Terminology (Standard Edition))","description":"CPT(R) 2019 Professional Edition is the definitive AMA-authored resource to help health care professionals correctly report and bill medical procedures and services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XRCbtQEACAAJ&dq=Physicians+Current+Procedural+Terminology:+CPT+1998+(Cpt+/+Current+Procedural+Terminology+(Standard+Edition))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scatterpath: A Novel","description":"Alan Wilcox, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, investigates a freak airline crash and comes to believe that sabotage was involved","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5WBSxOuv1ugC&dq=Scatterpath:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toujours Provence","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER Taking up where his beloved A Year in Provence leaves off, Peter Mayle offers us another funny, beautifully (and deliciously) evocative book about life in Provence.

It was among the top 10 best sellers in the U.S. in 1916. The story is presented in a series of letters written by Sallie McBride, Judy Abbott's classmate and best friend in Daddy-Long-Legs. Among the recipients of the letters are Judy; Jervis Pendleton, Judy's husband and the president of the orphanage where Sallie is filling in until a new superintendent can be installed; Gordon Hallock, a wealthy Congressman and Sallie's later fianc ; and the orphanage's doctor, embittered Scotsman Robin 'Sandy' MacRae (to whom Sallie addresses her letters: \\"Dear Enemy\\"). Webster employs the epistolary structure to good effect; Sallie's choices of what to recount to each of her correspondents reveal a lot about her relationships with them. The novel is set in rural Dutchess County, New York, early in the 20th century. It examines a number of social issues: how to care for orphans (and for children in general), divorce, and the value of women's work. (The latter is a natural extension of the theme of women's education in Daddy-Long-Legs.) While volunteer work by women is widely accepted, women working in responsible positions for pay is still viewed with some hostility by some characters, such as Gordon Hallock, Sallie's friend and later fianc , and the Honorable Cyrus Wykoff, a trustee of the John Grier Home. The Hon. Cy (as Sallie calls him) objects to the JGH paying a salary to Betsy, Sallie's assistant: \\"She's a woman, and her family ought to support her.\\" Though the Hon. Cy makes it clear that he thinks Sallie is frivolous and unsuited to superintend an orphanage, Sallie is so devoted to the orphan's well-being that she turns even her social life-explicitly criticized by the Hon. Cy-into an opportunity to further her cause, recruiting volunteers, benefactors, and foster parents at dinner parties and afternoon teas. Webster also deals with women's life choices in a more subtle fashion. She contrasts the miserable marriage of Sallie's friend Helen with Sallie's fruitful life as she devotes herself to the demanding and strenuous task of running an orphanage. Sallie considers Judy Abbott, who married soon after completing college, an anomaly for her remarkably successful marriage with Jervis. Divorced from her unsuitable husband, Helen ultimately finds happiness in joining Sallie's cause at the orphanage, applying herself to work for the public good. Socialism applied to charitable causes is an underlying theme; the John Grier Home couldn't survive without the beneficence of the trustees and community. The novel also deals with the evolving ideas about how best to care for orphans at the turn of the century, with the institution-style establishments falling out of favor, in light of the modern 'cottage' approach. Care for the children's emotional and spiritual needs is considered paramount, as Sallie works with Dr. MacRae, Judy, and Jervis to enact her reforms. The reasons these are necessary at the John Grier Home is clearly outlined in the first novel, in Judy's miserable recollections of her old home. Concerns with the hereditary origins of 'feeble-mindedness' and alcoholism are expressed by Dr. MacRae and by Sallie. The doctor's anxieties prove to have an underlying basis in his experience, which is revealed towards the end of the novel. Although the themes are intense, the author generally deals with them in an amusing and light-hearted fashion.

Robert G. Ingersoll (1833-1899) was one of the best-known intellectuals of the 19th century. He rose to national prominence through his gift for oratory, which he publicly displayed on numerous lecture circuit tours. For almost twenty years this dedicated popularizer of progressive thinking and staunch critic of superstition would regularly address huge audiences, opening their minds to ideas that often provoked guarded whispers in private. Ingersoll was a man far ahead of his time, who advocated agnosticism, birth control, voting rights for women, the advancement of science, and civil rights for all races. Though eloquent on a wide variety of topics, he became most famous, and notorious, for his provocative lectures questioning the traditional, Bible-based Christian worldview of the age.In this volume are collected his best-known lectures on religion, the Bible, and related subjects. Included are Why I Am an Agnostic; The Truth; What Is Religion?; Superstition; What Infidels Have Done; What Should You Substitute for the Bible as a Moral Guide?; Crumbling Creeds; The Liberty of Man, Woman, and Child; and Love.This outstanding collection is indispensable for freethinkers, humanists, and open-minded people of all persuasions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GsUo_eHncPcC&dq=Superstition+and+Other+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of childhood and youth,","description":"In this charming autobiographical essay, Albert Schwenzer tells of his first nineteen years in Upper Alsace and his youthful discoveries of religion, music, and the inspiration of friendship. Even in his boyhood there were traces of what was to become his \\"reverence for life\\": as a boy, he writes, he managed to dissuade several companions from going fishing because of the pain he felt the deed gave to both the worm and the fish. In poignant vignettes, Schweitzer also describes his unhappiness at discovering that he had better food or better clothing than chose around him. Memoirs of Childhood and Youth offers wonderful insights on Dr. Schweitzer's childhood journey that eventually led him to dedicate himself to medical service in African colonies.

Times have changed. Have God s answers expired over time? Is God s design for women the same as it was years ago? Has God changed His definition of virtue? How does the detailed description of godly virtue in Proverbs 31 apply to the twenty-first century? Woman of Virtue is a detailed exposition of Proverbs 31; it is designed to unfold the scriptures that clearly answer these questions as well as help us apply them to our everyday lives. In a world where the destructive influences of the feminist movement are creeping into the church, Christian women need to be aware of what God teaches concerning His good design for them. Contrary to popular belief and, sadly, even some opinions within Christendom, feminism has not helped or improved God s original design for women. In fact, feminism and God s truth are diametrically opposed they are polar opposites! Feminism is Satan s cheap counterfeit of God s good intention for women. God is not silent throughout scripture concerning His plan for women, marriage, and the family. He holds each of us accountable to learn, trust, and apply what He has ordained. God s design for women still applies to us today just as much as it did when He created us uniquely for our role in the world. God wants believers to know what a virtuous, God-fearing, honest, modest, righteous, and hard-working woman is right now in the twenty-first century!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2hmtBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chains and Images of Psychological Slavery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bVR2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Chains+and+Images+of+Psychological+Slavery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 606burgundy) - Regular Size NASB - Genuine Leather","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The stragglers (Ace book 78927)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BkMhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cult Proofing Your Kids","description":"The first comprehensive psychological, social, and evangelical treatment of the growing and insidious cult problem.

Is it possible to make model decision problems to fit these circumstances? Once constructed, can these models be solved? In Uncertain Programming, Baoding Liu answers both of these questions in the affirmative and goes on to lay a solid foundation for optimization in generally uncertain environments. Uncertain Programming describes the basic concepts of mathematical programming, provides a genetic algorithm for optimization problems, and introduces the techniques of stochastic and fuzzy simulation. After examining some basic results of expected value models, the book moves on to explore chance-constrained programming with stochastic parameters and illustrate applications of chance-constrained programming models. Dr. Liu discusses dependent-chance programming in stochastic environments and extends both chance-constrained and dependent-chance programming from stochastic to fuzzy environments. He then constructs a theoretical framework for fuzzy programming with fuzzy rather than crisp decisions. This remarkable and revolutionary book: * Lays a foundation for optimization theory in uncertain environments * Provides a unifying principle for dealing with stochastic and fuzzy programming * Incorporates the most recent developments in the field * Emphasizes modeling ideas, evolutionary computation, and applications of uncertain programming Uncertain Programming is a reliable, authoritative, and eye-opening guide for researchers and engineers in operations research, management science, business management, information and systems science, and computer science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rZRQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Uncertain+Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trail of Cthulhu","description":"No one but August Derleth could continue the Cthulhu Mythos cycle after the death of its creator, his friend H.P.

Moore's contribution to the collection -- brings together twenty-one of the finest modern writers who claim Louisiana as home, having lived all or some part of their lives in the Pelican State. Each author shares the knack of telling a good story, a Louisiana tradition that dates back two hundred years to the tales told by African American griots and the stories swapped among Mississippi river workers on boats, in taverns, and around campfires. Though united by talent and place, these writers speak with inflections that vary by gender, race, education, religion, and time spent elsewhere. Their stories are also richly diverse, ranging from Ernest Gaines's humorous portrait of black culture in rural Louisiana to Tim Parrish's aching depiction of white working-class family life in Baton Rouge, from Ellen Gilchrist's acerbically funny rendering of wealthy New Orleans bankers to Richard Ford's flinty unfolding of a father-son relationship in the marshy netherworld south of the Crescent City. The pieces span the full swath of Louisiana experience, be it the life of a Vietnamese refugee in Lake Charles or the miraculous appearance of the image of Jesus on a refrigerator in Holly Springs. In addition to their Louisiana-rooted inspiration and highest regard for craft, the stories in Wide Awake in the Pelican State share a deep humanity. These are stories about people -- noble and nefarious, some living high and others down on their luck -- as they fathom the tragic depths and comic heights of love, betrayal, family, change, and life writ large. Contributors to Wide Awake in the Pelican State: John Biguenet, James Lee Burke, Robert Olen Butler, Kelly Cherry, Moira Crone, Albert Belisle Davis, Charles deGravelles, John Dufresne, Richard Ford, Ernest J.

Because emotional pain is often the root cause of many physical diseases, ERT can likewise alleviate painful conditions and speed recovery from disease. A blending of energy and faith healing, ERT heals by helping us re-access our lost connection to God.

But is this claim true? As historian Bart D. Ehrman shows in this informative and witty book, The Da Vinci Code is filled with numerous historical mistakes. Did the ancient church engage in a cover-up to make the man Jesus into a divine figure? Did Emperor Constantine select for the New Testament--from some 80 contending Gospels--the only four Gospels that stressed that Jesus was divine? Was Jesus Christ married to Mary Magdalene? Did the Church suppress Gospels that told the secret of their marriage? Bart Ehrman thoroughly debunks all of these claims. But the book is not merely a laundry list of Brown's misreading of history. Throughout, Ehrman offers a wealth of fascinating background information--all historically accurate--on early Christianity. He describes, for instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls ; outlines in simple terms how scholars of early Christianity determine which sources are most reliable; and explores the many other Gospels that have been found in the last half century. In his engaging book, Ehrman separates fact from fiction, the historical realities from the flights of literary fancy. Anyone who would like to know the truth about the beginnings of Christianity and the real truth behind The Da Vinci Code will find this book riveting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QpNKcdZKYvoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective C++: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Design (2nd Edition) (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing)","description":"Effective C++ has been updated to reflect the latest ANSI/ISO standards.

To Muslims, Russians and westerners, he is a murderer of millions, a brutal oppressor. Yet in his homeland of Mongolia he is the revered father of the nation, and the Chinese honor him as the founder of a dynasty. In his so-called Mausoleum in Inner Mongolia, worshippers seek the blessing of his spirit. In a supreme paradox, the world's most ruthless conqueror has become a force for peace and reconciliation. As a teenager, Genghis was a fugitive, hiding from enemies on a remote mountainside. Yet he went on to found the world's greatest land empire and change the course of world history. Brilliant and original as well as ruthless, he ruled an empire twice the size of Rome's until his death in 1227 placed all at risk. To secure his conquests and then extend them, his heirs kept his death a secret, and secrecy has surrounded him ever since. His undiscovered grave, with its imagined treasures, remains the subject of intrigue and speculation. This is more than just a gripping account of Genghis' rise and conquests. John Man uses first-hand experiences in China and Mongolia to reveal the khan's enduring influence. He has traveled the length of the empire. He spotlights the tension between Mongols and Chinese, who both claim Genghis' spirit. He is the first writer to explore the hidden valley where Genghis is believed to have died, and one of the few westerners to climb the mountain where he was likely buried. This stunning narrative paints a vivid picture of the man himself, the places where he lived and fought, and the passions that surround him still. For in legend, ritual and intense controversy, Genghis lives on.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0eEKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Unpatriotic Acts","description":"Within six weeks of 9/11, in a nation gripped by fear and hatred, Congress overwhelmingly approved the USA PATRIOT Act, drafted in secret by the Department of Justice.

The creation of the United States of America is the central event of the past four hundred years,\\" states Walter McDougall in his preface to Freedom Just Around the Corner. With this statement begins McDougall's most ambitious, original, and uncompromising of histories. McDougall marshals the latest scholarship and writes in a style redolent with passion, pathos, and humour in pursuit of truths often obscured in books burdened with political slants. With an insightful approach to the nearly 250 years spanning America's beginnings, McDougall offers his readers an understanding of the uniqueness of the \\"American character\\" and how this character has shaped the wide ranging course of historical events. McDougall explains that Americans have always been in a unique position of enjoying \\"more opportunity to pursue their ambitions?an any other people in history.\\" Throughout Freedom Just Around the Corner the character of the American people shines, a character built out of a freedom to indulge in the whole panoply of human behaviour. The genius behind the success of the United States is founded on the complex, irrepressible American spirit. A grand narrative rich with new details and insights about colonial and early national history, Freedom Just Around the Corner is the first instalment of a trilogy that will eventually bring the story of America up to the present day, a story epic, bemusing, and brooding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U8NVt2ax7mgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Envelope","description":"A splendid, violent spring suddenly grips Bucharest in the 1980s after a brutal winter.

Beginning in the 1890s, she spoke publicly on a range of civil rights which black Americans and black women were deprived. Throughout these efforts, Terrell helped coordinate a series of local movements which campaigned for suffrage and enfranchisement for the black population. Mary Church Terrell began a trend in the civil rights movement; her language bursting with eloquence and reason, she argued for a better intellectual, social and economic life for black Americans. Black women, who lacked even the right to vote, were compelled to join the cause, which they did in their thousands. Living to the age of 90, Terrell was a bridge between the Reconstruction era and the modern civil rights movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z5WpvAEACAAJ&dq=A+Colored+Woman+in+a+White+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southwest Style : A Home-Lover's Guide to Architecture and Design","description":"From adobe casitas to log cabins to straw bale homes, this book includes honest, ingenious, and easily adaptable ideas from the heart of the Southwest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fe5EAAAAYAAJ&dq=Southwest+Style+:+A+Home-Lover%27s+Guide+to+Architecture+and+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thyroid Balance: Traditional and Alternative Methods for Treating Thyroid Disorders","description":"Thyroid Disorders: Types, Symptoms, Treatment, Causes Common Thyroid Gland Diseases and Problems to Watch For What are the symptoms of thyroid problems in females?

They had pulled themselves together from the ruin of war, built at breakneck speed a formidable array of export champions, and emerged as the world's number-two economy and largest net creditor nation. And they did it by flouting every rule of economic orthodoxy. But today only the puzzlement remains at Japan's inability to arrest its economic decline, at its festering banking crisis, and at the dithering of its policymakers. Why can't the Japanese government find the political will to fix the country's problems? Japan's Policy Trap offers a provocative new analysis of the country's protracted economic stagnation. Japanese insider Akio Mikuni and long-term Japan resident R. Taggart Murphy contend that the country has landed in a policy trap that defies easy solution. The authors, who have together spent decades at the heart of Japanese finance, expose the deep-rooted political arrangements that have distorted Japan's monetary policy in a deflationary direction. They link Japan's economic difficulties to the Achilles' heel of the U.S. economy: the U.S. trade and current accounts deficits. For the last twenty years, Japan's dollar-denominated trade surplus has outstripped official reserves and currency in circulation. These huge accumulated surpluses have long exercised a growing and perverse influence on monetary policy, forcing Japan's authorities to support a build-up of deflationary dollars. Mikuni and Murphy trace the origins of Japan's policy trap far back into history, in the measures taken by Japan's officials to preserve their economic independence in what they saw as a hostile world. Mobilizing every resource to accumulate precious dollars, the authorities eventually found themselves coping with a hoard they could neither use nor exchange. To counteract the deflationary impact, Japanese authorities resorted to the creation of yen liabilities unrelated to production via the largest financial bubble in history. The bursting of that bubble was followed by massive public works spending that has resulted in an explosion in public sector debt. Japan's Policy Trap points to the likelihood that Japan will run out of ways to support its vast pile of dollar claims. Should the day come when those claims can no longer be supported, the world could see a horrific deflationary spiral in Japan, a crash in the global value of the dollar, or both. The effects would reach far beyond Japan's borders. Mikuni and Murphy suggest that a reduction in Japan's surplus must be accompanied by a reduction in deficits somewhere else most obviously through far-reaching shifts in the American economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kIpDzujtu5oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SOS Help for Emotions: Managing Anxiety, Anger, and Depression","description":"We all have feelings, it's what we do with them that counts.

Its underlying premise is that God will always have a people, that Christians will always come together to worship and to do God's work in the world. Denison argues that the future of the church lies not in just replacing the WWII generation with GenXers or younger people within its present structure. Mainline congregations must envision their part in a new church, one that calls forth new mission leaders to model the incarnational style of Jesus. God is not unpopular among younger generations, with 90 percent of Americans professing a belief in God. In this rousing call to hope, Denison lays out a plan for connecting that 90 percent with God through Jesus as he sets forth a positive agenda for communicating the relevance of the mainline tradition's message.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qhrnwAEACAAJ&dq=Mainline+Manifesto:+The+Inevitable+New+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Leavens name including Levings;: An account of the posterity descending from emigrant John Levins, 1632-1903","description":"Excerpt from The Leavens Name, Including Levings: An Account of the Posterity Descending From Emigrant John Levins, 1632-1903 The Massachusetts Company had been formed in 1628, and a party.

In recent years, because of the availability of new experimental and theoretical tools, a second stage of the physics of polymers has evolved. In this book, a noted physicist explains the radical changes that have taken place in this exciting and rapidly developing field. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes points out the three developments that have been essential for recent advances in the study of large-scale conformations and motions of flexible polymers in solutions and melts. They are the advent of neutron-scattering experiments on selectively deuterated molecules; the availability of inelastic scattering of laser light, which allows us to study the cooperative motions of the chains; and the discovery of an important relationship between polymer statistics and critical phenomena, leading to many simple scaling laws. Until now, information relating to these advances has not been readily accessible to physical chemists and polymer scientists because of the difficulties in the new theoretical language that has come into use. Professor de Gennes bridges this gap by presenting scaling concepts in terms that will be understandable to students in chemistry and engineering as well as in physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ApzfJ2LYwGUC&dq=Scaling+Concepts+in+Polymer+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quenched","description":"Based on breakthrough new science in the field of hydration, Quench debunks many popular myths about \\"getting enough water\\" and offers a revolutionary five-day jump start plan that shows how better hydration can reduce or eliminate ailments like chronic headaches, weight gain, gut pain, and even autoimmune conditions. Chronic headaches, brain fog, fatigue, weight gain, insomnia, gut pain, autoimmune conditions. We may think these and other all-too-common modern maladies are due to gluten intake or too much sugar or too little exercise. But there is another missing piece to the health puzzle: Proper hydration. Yes, even in this era of Poland Spring many of us are dehydrated due to moisture-lacking diets, artificial environments, medications, and over-dependence on water as our only source of hydration. For this reason, that new diet or exercise plan may fail because our body doesn't have enough moisture to support it. Quench presents a wellness routine that can reverse all of that, based on breakthrough new science in the field of hydration. Readers will be surprised to learn that drinking too much water can flush out vital nutrients and electrolytes. Here is where \\"gel water\\" comes in: the water from plants (like cucumber, berries, aloe), which our bodies are designed to truly absorb right down to the cellular level. In fact, Ms. Bria's work as an anthropologist led her to the realization that desert people stay hydrated almost exclusively from what they eat, including gel plants like cactus. Based on groundbreaking science from the University of Washington's Pollack Water Lab and other research, Quench offers a five-day jump start plan: hydrating meal plans and the heart of the program, smoothies and elixirs using the most hydrating and nutrient-packed plants. Another unique feature of their approach is micro-movements -- small, simple movements you can make a few times a day that will move water through your fascia, the connective tissue responsible for hydrating our bodies. You will experience more energy, focus, and better digestion within five days . . . then move onto the lifetime plan for continued improvements, even elimination of symptoms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oCc4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives","description":"As Reviewed by Eugene N. Anderson, University of California, Riverside in The Journal of California Anthropology, Vol. 2, No. 2 (WINTER 1975), pp. 241-244:A child born in December is \\"like a baby in an ecstatic condition, but he leaves this condition\\" (p. 102). The Chumash, reduced by the 20th century from one of the richest and most populous groups in California to a pitiful remnant, had almost lost their strage and ecstatic mental world by the time John Peabody Harrington set out to collect what was still remembered of their language and oral literature. Working with a handful of ancient informants, Harrington recorded all he could--then, in bitter rejection of the world, kept it hidden and unpublished. After his death there began a great quest for his scattered notes, and these notes are now being published at last. Thomas Blackburn, among the first and most assiduous of the seekers through Harrington's materials, has published her the main body of oral literature that Harrington collected from the Chumash of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Blackburn has done much more: he has added to the 111 stories a commentary and analysis, almost book-length in its own right, and a glossary of the Chumash and Californian-Spanish terms that Harrington was prone to leave untranslated in the texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p6wwDwAAQBAJ&dq=December%27s+Child:+A+Book+of+Chumash+Oral+Narratives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Musical Lives of Young Children","description":"This annotated anthology documents historical trends and basic findings regarding music in early childhood education, development, and care.

Vacationing at a luxurious Tuscan island resort, Nicolas Duhamel is hopeful that the ghosts of his past have finally been put to rest... Now a bestselling author, when he was twenty-four years old, he stumbled upon a troubling secret about his family-a secret that was carefully concealed. In shock, Nicolas embarked on a journey to uncover the truth that took him from the Basque coast to St. Petersburg-but the answers wouldn't come easily. In the process of digging into his past, something else happened. Nicolas began writing a novel that was met with phenomenal success, skyrocketing him to literary fame whether he was ready for it or not - and convincing him that he had put his family's history firmly behind him. But now, years later, Nicolas must reexamine everything he thought he knew, as he learns that, however deeply buried, the secrets of the past always find a way out. \\"The tension of Nicholas's unsustainable half-truths and the gradual parceling out of his father's secrets will keep readers in de Rosnay's thrall, hoping redemption will come.

Well researched and illustrated, it sheds new light on what an Eastern infantry unit can do: (1) alternate between guerrilla, mobile, and positional warfare; (2) use \\"ordinary forces\\" to engage and \\"extraordinary forces\\" to beat an opponent, and (3) dodge any counterstroke. By identifying pronounced trends in the small-unit technique of every foe since WWI, this book reveals how future adversaries will fight. This will be the first generation of U.S. infantrymen to be told. Just knowing should double their chances of survival. While what occurred in history does not change, one's perception of it does , as he comes to better understand a highly deceptive former adversary. To see what may have occurred at Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, Hue City, and other Vietnam battlefields, one must come to appreciate the \\"false face\\" and art of delay. An Oriental unit will tactically withdraw to undermine the opposition?s resolve and save its own soldiers' lives. By revealing how Asian soldiers hold their own without resupply, tanks, or air support, Phantom Soldier shows what U.S. infantrymen must do to survive the more lethal weaponry of the 21st century. This is must-reading for combat leader and concerned citizen alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l86VNAAACAAJ&dq=Phantom+Soldier:+The+Enemy%27s+Answer+to+U.S.+Firepower&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A TOWN LIKE ALICE","description":"\\"A tale of love and war, follows its enterprising heroine from Malayan jungle during World War II to the rugged Australian outback.\\" -- Cover, p.4.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6VGPDQAAQBAJ&dq=A+TOWN+LIKE+ALICE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"...y no se lo trag la tierra / ...And the Earth Did Not Devour Him","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bvKAZNDck2gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Est Playing the Game The New Way","description":"Here is the EST training in words, such a perfect duplication that original founder Werner Erhard sued in Federal Court to stop this book.

Grant and Robert E. Lee. But less than two decades before they faced each other as enemies at Appomattox, they had been brothers--both West Point graduates, both wearing blue, and both fighting in the same cadre in the Mexican War. They were not alone: Sherman, Davis, Jackson-nearly all of the Civil War's greatest soldiers had been forged in the heat of Vera Cruz and Monterrey. The Mexican War has faded from our national memory, but it was a struggle of enormous significance: the first U.S. war waged on foreign soil; and it nearly doubled our nation. At this fascinating juncture of American history, a group of young men came together to fight as friends, only years later to fight as enemies. This is their story. Full of dramatic battles, daring rescues, secret missions, soaring triumphs and tragic losses, THE TRAINING GROUND is history at its finest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F3hobLNULV0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploding the Israel Deception","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ez6etwAACAAJ&dq=Exploding+the+Israel+Deception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The intelligent traveller's guide to historic Britain (United States Army in World War II: The war in the Pacific)","description":"This book is part of the Army historical community's commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of World War II. American victory in that conflict was brought about not only by the valor of our fighting men and the immensity of our productive capacity, but also by the availability of superb military intelligence. Much of this intelligence came from the ability of our armed forces to intercept and decipher the most secret communications of their adversaries. For many years security considerations prevented any public mention of these successes in the official histories. Now much of the story can be told. To preserve the memory of the Army's role in this intelligence war, the U. S. Army Center of Military History has joined with the History Office, U. S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), to publish this collection of documents on Army signals intelligence in World War II. INSCOM carries on the heritage of the Army's World War II Signal Security Agency, which by breaking the Japanese diplomatic ciphers and military codes helped speed the way of our forces to victory. The book is intended both for an Army audience and for the general public - including those World War II veterans who participated in the signals intelligence war and who for so many years were constrained to keep their contributions secret. The security barriers have now been lifted, and the Army is proud to acknowledge those contributions. Harold W. NelsonCharles F.

Not temperamentally suited to be a wartime President, Madison nonetheless confronted issues such as public morale, internal security, relations with Congress, and the independence of the military.

Rather than herald the singular achievements of the 1848 Seneca Falls convention, she examines the confluence of events and ideas--before and after 1848--that, in her view, marked the real birth of feminism. Drawing on a wide range of sources, she demonstrates that women's rights activists of the antebellum era crafted a coherent feminist critique of church, state, and family. In addition, Isenberg shows, they developed a rich theoretical tradition that influenced not only subsequent strains of feminist thought but also ideas about the nature of citizenship and rights more generally. By focusing on rights discourse and political theory, Isenberg moves beyond a narrow focus on suffrage. Democracy was in the process of being redefined in antebellum America by controversies over such volatile topics as fugitive slave laws, temperance, Sabbath laws, capital punishment, prostitution, the Mexican War, married women's property rights, and labor reform--all of which raised significant legal and constitutional questions. These pressing concerns, debated in women's rights conventions and the popular press, were inseparable from the gendered meaning of nineteenth-century citizenship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zF3MCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants: Krusty Krab Adventures/Friends Forever/Tales From Bikini Bottom/Crime and Funishment","description":"A crime wave hits Bikini Bottom and Spongebob is right in the middle of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=epESY39VEwoC&dq=Spongebob+Squarepants:+Krusty+Krab+Adventures/Friends+Forever/Tales+From+Bikini+Bottom/Crime+and+Funishment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portajohnny: The Best of Angry Youth Comix: The Early Years","description":"A MAD magazine for MTV's Jackass set, ready to tap your inner idiot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RdE2AQAAIAAJ&dq=Portajohnny:+The+Best+of+Angry+Youth+Comix:+The+Early+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Am Not But I Know I Am: Welcome to the Story of God","description":"The founder of Choice Resources provides a new look at success, drawn from the teachings of John the Baptist, that instructs readers how to live a more rewarding and fulfilling life without focusing on being smarter, bigger, and the center of attention, which should be God's role in our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vHQQpNYtFaIC&dq=I+Am+Not+But+I+Know+I+Am:+Welcome+to+the+Story+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Mirror (Bridei Trilogy)","description":"THE DARK MIRROR is the first book in Juliet Marillier's Bridei Chronicles.

My father's parents, my Nanna and Nonno came to America from Italy, arriving at Ellis Island at about 1900. My dad would often say \\"I'm glad my dad didn't miss the boat!\\" My parents loved America, loved life and loved their family. They tried to pass on their love and wisdom to their children. This book may make you laugh a little, cry a little, and hopefully enrich your life a little. If so, in writting it, I have achieved my goal. The idea of this book came about as our family would gather and remember stories and anecdotes from my parents after their passing. I wanted to write a book to honor their legacy, and I wanted share my memories with their children and grandchildren. As I began to reflect more on my parents' lives, I saw parallels in their lives and the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. In particular, as I looked back on 'my father's wisdom and my mother's love,' I began to realize that they were both both filled with the love of God the Father and the wisdom of the Holy Spirit. My parents were not particularly religious people, although, they raised their children Roman Catholic and saw to it that we had the opportunity to attend Catholic schools. Beyond this religious foundation given us, the lessons taught us, and the experiences they shared, were very much in line with the lessons taught by Jesus. So, I thought, why not write this book with a broader appeal for people everywhere who would benefit from 'My Father's Wisdom and My Mother's Love.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5OPnwAEACAAJ&dq=Manna+from+Heaven:+Delicious+Low-Fat+Recipes+Inspired+by+Great+Bible+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Supra-Renal Capsules","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8hpPwAACAAJ&dq=On+the+Constitutional+and+Local+Effects+of+Disease+of+the+Supra-Renal+Capsules&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical File System Design with the Be File System","description":"This is the new guide to the design and implementation of file systems in general, and the Be File System (BFS) in particular.

The struggles to redefine gender roles and identities in our own time are inevitably reflected in our interpretations and retellings of these classical myths. Using the new lenses provided by gender studies and diverse forms of feminism, Lillian Doherty re-examines some of the major approaches to myth interpretation in the twentieth century: psychological, ritualist, 'charter', structuralist and folklorist. She also explores 'popular' uses of classical mythology - from television and comic books to the evocation of goddesses in Jungian psychology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OhF0BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Diary of a Real Boy","description":"Presents the diary of an exuberant and mischievous eleven-year-old boy growing up in the town of Exeter, New Hampshire, in the 1860s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HOaCEX-vCw4C&dq=The+Real+Diary+of+a+Real+Boy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hungarian with Ease with Cassette(s) and Workbook (Assimil Method Books) (Hungarian Edition)","description":"\\"M thode d'apprentissage du fran?ais pour anglophones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kXSzngEACAAJ&dq=Hungarian+with+Ease+with+Cassette(s)+and+Workbook+(Assimil+Method+Books)+(Hungarian+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dave's Haircut","description":"Fearful of his appointment with the local barber, Dave worries about all the different types of bad haircuts he could possibly get, and so decides to do something drastic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-0RaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Dave%27s+Haircut&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Student's Guide to the MELAB: (Michigan English Language Assessment Battery)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XsVQNAEACAAJ&dq=A+Student%27s+Guide+to+the+MELAB:+(Michigan+English+Language+Assessment+Battery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Pharmaceutical Association Practical Guide to Natural Medicines","description":"The nation's largest and most respected organization of pharmacists presents the first guide to herbal and natural remedies based on rigorous scientific studies, describing three hundred substances and their administration, effectiveness, and side effects. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C8aDljHlc8UC&dq=The+American+Pharmaceutical+Association+Practical+Guide+to+Natural+Medicines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holt Handbook","description":"The goal for the sixth edition of THE HOLT HANDBOOK is the same as it was for the first edition: To create a writer's handbook that serves as a classroom tool, a comprehensive reference, and a writer's companion.

Who have been the 'market wizards' during this tumultuous financial period? How did some traders manage to significantly outperform a stockmarket that during its heyday moved virtually straight up? This book will feature interviews with a variety of traders who achieved phenomenal financial success during the glory days of the Internet boom. In contrast with the first two Market Wizard books, which included traders from a broad financial spectrum stocks, bonds, currencies and futures this volume will focus on traders in the stockmarket.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0DE0dBXG15AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chitosan (Woodland Health)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TBMZAQAACAAJ&dq=Chitosan+(Woodland+Health)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law and the life insurance contract; (The Irwin series in risk and insurance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fDPxAAAAIAAJ&dq=Law+and+the+life+insurance+contract%3B+(The+Irwin+series+in+risk+and+insurance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arm of the Starfish","description":"Characters from Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet and Austin Family Chronicles cross paths in this story that explore the timeless themes of love, chance, and destiny.

Dominating the glorious, raw beauty of the little island is the majestic Killakeet Lighthouse, which for generations has been the responsibility of one family, the Thurlows. However, Josh Thurlow, the Keeper's son, has forsworn his heritage to become the commander of the Maudie Jane, a small Coast Guard patrol boat operating off Killakeet. Josh is still tortured by guilt, seventeen years after losing his baby brother at sea. Then his life is complicated by the arrival of the beautiful Dosie Crossan, who has journeyed to lonely Killakeet to escape the outside world and perhaps find a purpose in life. While Josh's heart is stirred by the often-vexing Dosie, he continues his search for his brother, even after a wolfpack of German U-boats arrives to soak the island's beaches with blood and oil. One of the U-boats is captained by Otto Krebs, a famed and ruthless undersea warrior. Krebs, a man also scarred by lost love, comes to Killakeet, however, with more than torpedoes and plans for war: He may also have the answer to the mystery that haunts Josh Thurlow.

By the beginning of 1945, facing imminent invasion, Japan turned to its most idealistic young men and demanded of them the greatest sacrifice. On May 11, 1945, days after Germany's surrender, the USS Bunker Hill--with thousands of crewmen and the most sophisticated naval technology available--was 70 miles off the coast of Okinawa when pilot Kiyoshi Ogawa flew his plane into the ship, killing 393 Americans in the worst suicide attack against America until September 11.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SAbIZK2hJLwC&dq=Danger%27s+Hour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Harmonica: Quick and Easy Instruction for the Beginner","description":"(Book).

More than a dozen French-speaking immigrant groups have been identified there, Cajuns and white Creoles being the most famous. In this guide to the amazing social, cultural, and linguistic variation within Louisiana's French-speaking region, Carl A. Brasseaux presents an overview of the origins and evolution of all the Francophone communities. Brasseaux examines the impact of French immigration on Louisiana over the past three centuries. He shows how this once-undesirable outpost of the French empire became colonized by individuals ranging from criminals to entrepreneurs who went on to form a multifaceted society -- one that, unlike other American melting pots, rests upon a French cultural foundation. A prolific author and expert on the region, Brasseaux offers readers an entertaining history of how these diverse peoples created south Louisiana's famous vibrant culture, interacting with African Americans, Spaniards, and Protestant Anglos and encountering influences from southern plantation life and the Caribbean. He explores in detail three still cohesive components in the Francophone melting pot, each one famous for having retained a distinct identity: the Creole communities, both black and white; the Cajun people; and the state's largest concentration of French speakers -- the Houma tribe. A product of thirty years' research, French, Cajun, Creole, Houma provides a reliable and understandable guide to the ethnic roots of a region long popular as an international tourist attraction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XCBfDwAAQBAJ&dq=French,+Cajun,+Creole,+Houma:+A+Primer+on+Francophone+Louisiana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Weather: Hurricanes!

Examining the end of life in the light of current psychological understanding, religious wisdom, and compassionate medical science, The Grace of Dying offers a fresh, deeply comforting message of hope and courage as we contemplate the meaning of our mortality. While the prevailing Western medical tradition has seen death as an enemy to be fought and overcome, Singh offers a richer and more rewarding path of understanding. Combining extensive training and education in developmental psychology with profound spiritual insight, she balances expert analysis with moving accounts drawn from her experiences working with hundreds of dying patients at a large hospice. Singh moves beyond the five stages of dying revealed in K bler-Ross's classic On Death and Dying, and finds in the \\"nearing death experience\\" even more significant and forming stages of surrender and transcendence. These stages involve the qualities of grace: letting go, radiance, focusing inward, silence, a sense of the sacred, wisdom, intensity, and, in the end, a merging with Spirit. Through this intense process, we come to experience at last the reality of our true self, which transcends our finite ego and bodily existence, and our merging with the source of being from which we originated. Dying is safe. In clear, nontechnical language, Singh reveals the transformations that come with dying, using the vocabulary of growing Western, as well as Eastern, wisdom. Written for those aware that their life is coming to an end, those who care for the dying, and, ultimately, for all of us who inevitably face our owndeath and the deaths of the people we love, The Grace in Dying reveals that dying is the most transforming, powerful, and spiritually rich of life's experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9T0PAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penguin Dictionary of First Names (Penguin Reference Books)","description":"What's in a name?

And Other Essays","description":"What is a woman? And what does it mean to be a feminist today? In her first full-scale engagement with feminist theory since her internationally renowned Sexual/Textual Politics (1985), Toril Moi challenges the dominant trends in contemporary feminist and cultural thought, arguing for a feminism of freedom inspired by Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex. Written in a clear and engaging style What is a Woman? brings together two brand new book-length theoretical interventions, Moi's work on Freud and Bourdieu, and her studies of desire and knowledge in literature. In the controversial title-essay, Toril Moi radically rethinks current debates about sex, gender, and the body - challenging the commonly held belief that the sex/gender distinction is fundamental to all feminist theory. Moi rejects every attempt to define masculinity and femininity, including efforts to define femininity as that which 'cannot be defined. In the second new book-length essay, 'I am a Woman', Toril Moi reworks the relationship between the personal and the philosophical, pursuing ways to write theory that do not neglect the claims of the personal. Setting up an encounter between contemporary theory and Simone de Beauvoir, Moi radically rethinks the need, and difficulty, of finding one's own philosophical voice by placing it in new theoretical contexts. A sustained refusal to lay down theoretical or political requirements for femininity, and a powerful argument for a feminism of freedom, What is a Woman? is a deeply original contribution to feminist theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AtvC75-pk_UC&dq=What+is+a+Woman%3F+And+Other+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Longing: Narratives","description":"A fascinating analysis of the ways in which everyday objects are narrated to animate or realize certain versions of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DtLTTAYvBFkC&dq=On+Longing:+Narratives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fit for Motorsport","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures (Scienza E Salute Con Chiave Della Scritture): Bilingual Edition (Italian/English)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9jY_AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorian to Vamp: Women's Clothing 1900-1929","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ql8FAAAACAAJ&dq=Victorian+to+Vamp:+Women%27s+Clothing+1900-1929&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bauer: Classic American Pottery","description":"Bauer pottery-the brightly coloured pieces created by the renowned Bauer production studio until the 1960s-has become increasingly popular with enthusiasts of vintage ceramics.

Markides s newest book, Eastern Orthodox mysticism meets Western Christianity as the internationally renowned author takes readers on a deep journey back in time to unveil the very roots of authentic spirituality. In his previous book The Mountain of Silence, Markides introduced us to the essential spiritual nature of Eastern Orthodoxy in a series of lively conversations with Father Maximos, the widely revered charismatic Orthodox bishop and former abbot of the isolated monastery on Mount Athos. In Gifts of the Desert, Markides continues his examination of Easter Orthodox mystical teachings and practices and captures its living expression through visits to monasteries and hermitages in Greece and America and interviews with contemporary charismatic elders, both male and female. Markides s pursuit of a deeper understanding of Orthodoxy takes him to the deserts of Arizona and a stay at a new monastery in Sedona; to the island of Cyprus and a reunion with Father Maximos; on a pilgrimage to holy shrines aboard a cruise ship in the Aegean Sea; and finally to the legendary Mount Athos, home to more than two thousand Orthodox monks. Markides relates his journey and reflections in a captivating style while providing important background material and information on historical events to give readers a highly accessible, in-depth portrait of a tradition little known in the West. Gifts of the Desert will appeal to a wide range of people, from Christians seeking insights into their religion and its various expressions to scholars interested in learning more about the mystical way of life and wisdom that have been preserved on Mount Athos since the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the Great Schism that separated the Eastern and Western Churches. Perhaps most important, however, is the bridge it offers contemporary readers to a Christian life that is balanced between the worldly and the spiritual.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-3jfUKNjDXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not As A Stranger","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E5gFv6BmYiMC&dq=Not+As+A+Stranger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hydrogenation of Fats and Oils: Theory and Practice","description":"As in the first edition, discussion is not confined to vegetable oils, and the hydrogenation technique is considered in detail.

That war occurred on a cusp of military history - it had elements both ancient and modern, and it reflected the struggle of soldiers trying to reconcile the two. Civil War military institutions had their roots firmly planted in the traditions and doctrine of the past while they confronted modern problems. The story of the disconnection between linear tactics that would have been recognizable to either Alexander or Frederick the Great and deadly rifled muskets is familiar. The story of ill-trained and ill-prepared staffs trying to coordinate all the intricate details of a vast, semimodern army operating in a huge theater of war with doctrine and procedures that would soon be if they were not already outmoded is less familiar.

Ken Gelder investigates vampire narratives in literature and in film, from early vampire stories like Sheridan Le Fanu's \`lesbian vampire' tale Carmilla and Bram Stoker's Dracula, the most famous vampire narrative of all, to contemporary American vampire blockbusters by Stephen King and others, the vampire chronicles of Anne Rice, \`post-Ceausescu' vampire narratives, and films such as FW Murnau's Nosferatu and Bram Stoker's Dracula. Reading the Vampire embeds vampires in their cultural contexts, showing vampire narratives feeding off the anxieties and fascinations of their times: from the nineteenth century perils of tourism, issues of colonialism and national identity, and obsessions with sex and death, to the \`queer' identity of the vampire or current vampiric metaphors for dangerous exchanges of bodily fluids and AIDS.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Js2IAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss MacINTOSH, My Darling","description":"Miss MacIntosh herself, who hails from What Cheer, Iowa, and seems downright and normal, with an incorruptible sense of humor and the desire to put an end to phantoms; Catherine Cartwheel, the opium lady, a recluse who is shut away in a great New England seaside house and entertains imaginary guests; Mr. Spitzer, the lawyer, musical composer and mystical space traveler, a gentle man, wholly unsure of himself and of reality; his twin brother Peron, the gay and raffish gambler and virtuoso in the world of sports; Cousin Hannah, the horsewoman, balloonist, mountain-climber and militant Boston feminist, known as Al Hamad through all the seraglios of the East; Titus Bonebreaker of Chicago, wild man of God dreaming of a heavenly crown; the very efficient Christian hangman, Mr. Weed of the Wabash River Valley; a featherweight champion who meets his equal in a graveyard--these are a few who live with phantasmagorical vividness in the pages of Miss MacIntosh, My Darling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDoZMbrQVT0C&dq=Miss+MacINTOSH,+My+Darling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eligibility Specialist (Career Examination Series : C-2958)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oJZEngEACAAJ&dq=Eligibility+Specialist+(Career+Examination+Series+:+C-2958)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Carbs Vs.

Throughout, he demonstrates how activism and leadership can come from any experience at any age. Comprehensive and intimate, Stride Toward Freedom emphasizes the collective nature of the movement and includes King s experiences learning from other activists working on the boycott, including Mrs. Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin. It traces the phenomenal journey of a community and shows how the 28-year-old Dr. King, with his conviction for equality and nonviolence, helped transform the nation and the world.

Critics described city government as boss-ridden, expensive, and corrupt. African Americans challenged racial segregation, and public high schools were disaccredited. The St. Johns River and its tributaries were heavily polluted. Downtown development had succumbed to suburban sprawl.Consolidation, endorsed by an almost two-to-one majority in 1967, became the catalyst for change. The city's decision to consolidate with surrounding Duval County began the transformation of this conservative, Deep South, backwater city into a prosperous, mainstream metropolis. James B. Crooks introduces readers to preconsolidation Jacksonville and then focuses on three major issues that confronted the expanded city: racial relations, environmental pollution, and the revitalization of downtown. He shows the successes and setbacks of four mayors--Hans G. Tanzler, Jake Godbold, Tommy Hazouri, and Ed Austin--in responding to these issues. He also compares Jacksonville's experience with that of another Florida metropolis, Tampa, which in 1967 decided against consolidation with surrounding Hillsborough County. Consolidation has not been a panacea for all the city's ills, Crooks concludes. Yet the city emerges in the 21st century with increased support for art and education, new economic initiatives, substantial achievements in downtown renewal, and laudable efforts to improve race relations and address environmental problems. Readers familiar with Jacksonville over the last 40 years will recognize events like the St. Johns River cleanup, the building of the Jacksonville Landing, the ending of odor pollution, and the arrival of the Jaguars NFL franchise. During the administration of Mayor Hazouri from 1987 to 1991, Crooks was Jacksonville historian-in-residence at City Hall. Combining observations from this period with extensive interviews and documents (including a cache of files from the mezzanine of the old City Hall parking garage that contained 44 cabinets of letters, memos, and reports), he has written an urban history that will fascinate scholars of politics and governmental reform as well as residents of the First Coast city.A volume in the Florida History and Culture Series, edited by Raymond Arsenault and Gary R.

The original essays in this volume explore the implications of Ong's work across the diverse fields of cultural history, literary theory, theology, philosophy, and anthropology. These scholars maintain that Ong's view of orality not only changes our readings of ancient and medieval texts, but that it also changes our understanding of the differing epistemologies of oral and literate cultures and of the coexistence of the oral and literate within a given culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8X8HnODTChEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literature: Reading, Reacting, Writing (with Lit21 CD-ROM)","description":"Combining the broadest selection of literature available, with time-proven and class-tested writing instruction, and the extraordinary Lit21 CD-ROM, the new editions of LITERATURE: READING, REACTING, WRITING, Fifth Edition provide all the help that students need to make literature a part of their lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hz7mAQAACAAJ&dq=Literature:+Reading,+Reacting,+Writing+(with+Lit21+CD-ROM)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peckinpah: A Portrait in Montage","description":"It all began in the summer of 1973, when the author--then a young man fresh out of film school--traveled to Mexico in pursuit of the man behind a list of motion picture masterpieces that include \\"Ride the High Country\\", \\"Major Dundee\\", \\"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\\", \\"Straw Dogs\\", \\"Junior Bonner\\", \\"The Getaway\\", \\"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\\", and the classic western epic that revolutionalized the face of global cinema, \\"The Wild Bunch\\". Simmons' seminal 1982 biography of Sam Peckinpah, published by the University of Texas Press and updated in the 1998 Limelight Editions release, is central to this current edition. With more than 100 pages of additional material and photos from the author's private collection providing even greater in-depth analysis of the director's films, this edition looks back on \\"The Wild Bunch\\" five decades after its theatrical release to gauge its lasting impact on filmmakers who have followed in Peckinpah's footsteps. Beyond the creative analysis in this new edition, Simmons shares with the reader his personal reflections of the man, the myth, and the legend he came to know as mentor and friend. More than mere biography, more than a mere recitation of events in the life of extraordinary filmmaking talent, this book provides a deep understanding of Hollywood's movie-making process. As such, it serves as both inspiration and cautionary tale. One cannot presume to have an appreciation of American Film without reading what the author shares within these covers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aIjJxwEACAAJ&dq=Peckinpah:+A+Portrait+in+Montage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Photoshop","description":"Fancy designing your own classic and contemporary movie posters, books and magazine covers?

The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him. In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown... In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within... The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph. The Wheel of Time?

A lecture class taught by Wittgenstein, however, hardly resembled a lecture. He sat on a chair in the middle of the room, with some of the class sitting in chairs, some on the floor. He never used notes. He paused frequently, sometimes for several minutes, while he puzzled out a problem. He often asked his listeners questions and reacted to their replies. Many meetings were largely conversation. These lectures were attended by, among others, D. A. T. Gasking, J. N. Findlay, Stephen Toulmin, Alan Turing, G. H. von Wright, R. G. Bosanquet, Norman Malcolm, Rush Rhees, and Yorick Smythies. Notes taken by these last four are the basis for the thirty-one lectures in this book. The lectures covered such topics as the nature of mathematics, the distinctions between mathematical and everyday languages, the truth of mathematical propositions, consistency and contradiction in formal systems, the logicism of Frege and Russell, Platonism, identity, negation, and necessary truth. The mathematical examples used are nearly always elementary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xgpCCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Still Missing: Amelia Earhart and the Search for Modern Feminism","description":"An analysis of Amelia Earhart's life as part of the history of women and American feminism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xNuGWUdPvcYC&dq=Still+Missing:+Amelia+Earhart+and+the+Search+for+Modern+Feminism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis, Part II: God and His Family (Hearts Aflame, Chapters 12-50)","description":"A coherent, forceful, and compelling case for God and the Church founded by Jesus of Nazareth.

In this \\"baby-friendly\\" environment, is it any wonder that more and more people are considering becoming parents? Most people realize, however, that just wanting a baby doesn't mean you are physically, mentally, or emotionally prepared to have one. Nor does the desire to have a baby necessarily mean you will be a good parent. The Parenthood Decision will help potential parents resolve their conflicts about this major decision. Here, Beverly Engel helps readers find their own answers to questions such as: \\"Am I ready to be a parent?\\" \\"What should I do if I am ready and my partner is not?\\" \\"Will I be a better parent than my parents?\\" \\"How will having a baby affect my relationship?\\" \\"What are the mistakes I am most likely to make and how can I avoid them?\\" \\"Should I have a baby on my own?\\" By presenting important information, posing thought-provoking questions and providing exercises, Engel helps both those who are unclear whether this is the right time for them to become parents and those who are undecided about whether parenthood is right for them. Armed with the self-knowledge The Parenthood Decision provides, readers will finish the book confident in their potential-parenthood decision.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RKF0fybZEusC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tracked in the Whites","description":"Since its beginning, depth psychology has attempted to change the status quo of individual and cultural life by probing beneath surface appearances.

Although the sun was out, dark clouds appeared in the distance over the San Gabriel Valley. A soft wind blew. Rain was expected later in the day. All put together, it was a beautiful day. But in the city of South El Monte, there was a group of friends that were turning this beautiful day into a living nightmare in their lives, a nightmare from which they would not awake. Having just robbed the city bank on the east side of town, Rebecca and her four buddies, Steve, Ricardo, Mark and Mike, fled scared for the mountains. The youngest of the five, Mike, had been wounded in the robbery. Police sirens sounded all around. In a desperate measure to hide away from the law, they ascended the mountains and drove off the main road, into the wild forest. There, they would come to a valley hidden deep in the mountains, a valley hidden to the world, where some of their most horrific nightmares were about to come true. What happens in this place will blow their minds away, literately. This was a place where their darkest side would manifest in them, and their true friendship would be put to the test. This was a place where they would be given the chance to turn around and make things right in their lives. However, not even the monsters and demons in this forest would deter them from their dark purpose. They were willing to lose it all, even their lives, for the love of money. This was a place of magic and wonder, a place of horrors and witches. This was the place where they would meet Bruma.

Structured Equity Derivatives fills this gap in a remarkable way. The book introduces an approach to the structuring and practical application of derivatives that allows the reader to create his own derivatives solutions to an endless variety of problems. The approach is extremely natural - the only limit is the reader's own creativity. Since it clearly explains the reasons why derivatives exist and why there is such a large variety, this is the book that should be read before picking up any other book on the pricing and hedging of derivatives. As the book concentrates on product design instead of pricing, there are no complex pricing formulas or numerical procedures. The emphasis is on intuition and common sense rather than complex formal results, which makes the book accessible to people from many different backgrounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_HGAQgAACAAJ&dq=Structured+Equity+Derivatives:+The+Definitive+Guide+to+Exotic+Options+and+Structured+Notes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mirror Mirror on the Wall","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5qwSKDilUmkC&dq=Mirror+Mirror+on+the+Wall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Reader for Young Children (The Moore McGuffey Readers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_0PpAQAACAAJ&dq=First+Reader+for+Young+Children+(The+Moore+McGuffey+Readers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Political Theory for Mortals: Shades of Justice, Images of Death (Contestations: Cornell Studies in Political Theory)","description":"Despite an abundance of violence occurring in political contexts, no liberal political theorist since Thomas Hobbes has talked directly and coherently about death. John E. Seery does. He contends that liberalism desperately needs a theoretical framework in which to discuss pressing matters of human mortality. Among the contemporary political issues that cry out for theoretical articulation, Seery suggests, are abortion politics, ethnic cleansing, suicide assistance, national reparations, environmental degradation, and capital punishment. Seery offers a new conception of social contract theory as a framework for confronting death issues. He urges us to look to an older tradition of descent into an underworld, wherein classic theorists consulted poetically with the dead and acquired from them political insight and direction. In this lively book, Seery excavates the infernal tradition by rereading the politics of death in Platonism, early Christianity, and contemporary feminism. Building on those traditions, he proposes a new, constructive image of death that can serve democratic theory productively. Reconsidered from the \\"land of the shades,\\" social contractarian theory is sufficiently altered that, for example, a pro-life Christian and a pro-choice secularist might be able to strike common ground upon which to discuss abortion politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vi1zDwAAQBAJ&dq=Political+Theory+for+Mortals:+Shades+of+Justice,+Images+of+Death+(Contestations:+Cornell+Studies+in+Political+Theory)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English Rose","description":"When a new boy comes to their school, jealousy and envy cause problems for the five best friends known as the English Roses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ze7zAwAACAAJ&dq=The+English+Rose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vintage murder","description":"A police inspector finds trouble during a trip to New Zealand:  It s time to start comparing Christie to Marsh instead of the other way around.

Kinni Editor of The Business Reader Review, a free electronic newsletter of capsule reviews of new business books. Al Ries Voted one of the top 100 most influential public relations people in the 20th century by PR Week. Savvy business people and investors around the world are asking, what do we have to do today to prosper tomorrow, next month, next year? That s the question that started Al Ries and Theodore Kinni working on Future Focus, the book that answers the question: what will it take to succeed in business in the next century and new millennium? They found the answers among twenty-one focused, innovative, and protean companies. Future Focus explores each of these 21 companies in turn. Each company is introduced by a quote from one of its leaders, an Executive Snapshot that offers a fast insight into the strategic vision of the company. What can you learn from Future Focus? There are many practical business lessons in the book. They revolve around four major themes: 21st century success is focused. Almost all of the Future Focus 21 have flirted with diversification. Almost all have lost money on the outside ventures and are extremely focused as of today. Those that continue to operate outside their core businesses are usually in related businesses and are building a vertically integrated operation. The lesson: Get and stay focused. 21st century success is innovative. The Future Focus 21 are innovators. They are busy searching out original products and services or they are busy introducing existing products and services in markets that have never seen them before. Either way, they are innovators in the marketplace. The lesson: Be Innovative. 21st century success is global. With a single exception, each company in the Future Focus 21 is a global business and is trying to get more global. A well-focused company replaces the urge to diversify its businesses with the drive to diversify its markets. The lesson: Go global. 21st century success has speed bumps. There isn t a single, sustained upward ride in any of the Future Focus histories. Sooner or later, a competitor beats you to the next best thing or the bottom drops out of your customer s market or the whole economy heads south for a breather. The lesson: Be prepared for hard times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZTxmQgAACAAJ&dq=Future+Focus:+How+21+Companies+are+Capturing+21st+Century+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Guide to health and Nutrition","description":"The ultimate sourcebook from America's leading alternative health expert.

Frank Ludlam's broad background and illuminating style have combined to produce an integrated picture of atmospheric processes, tying together the many interrelated aspects of dynamical meteorology, synoptic meteorology, and cloud physics. This book presents a synthesis of cloud physics, ranging from the microphysics which control particle growth through the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere controlling air motion. The physical processes, from radiation to the interaction of cloud droplets, along with methods and interpretations of measurements, are discussed in a precise, compact style. The mathematical analysis is clear, and the exposition conveys a three-dimensional picture of airflow in an unusually lucid manner. Numerous line drawings, map analyses, and photographs aid the reader in visualizing the processes and phenomena discussed. This book is a reference and text for all atmospheric scientists and scholars in related fields as well as a guidebook for those who would like to understand something of the nature and the complexity of weather and climate. It will help the specialist put his specialty in perspective; it will help the forecaster relate weather to large-scale dynamics. And through his extraordinary style, Frank Ludlam was capable of conveying to all readers his joy in the beauty of a sunset.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DJgRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Clouds+and+Storms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bob Marley: In His Own Words (In Their Own Words)","description":"A compilation of the reggae musician's thoughts offers his views on such topics as success, sex, politics, race, violence, and stardom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mR8BAAAACAAJ&dq=Bob+Marley:+In+His+Own+Words+(In+Their+Own+Words)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tippy","description":"Tippy Lemmey, the neighborhood dog, is a nuisance and sworn enemy to the local children, but when Tippy gets in trouble, only Leanne, Paul, and Jeannie can help him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qfs9jsMYlGkC&dq=Tippy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Dream Again","description":"The inspiring story of Isaiah Austin, the man who captured our hearts when he was made the honorary NBA draft pick after a shocking diagnosis ended his professional basketball career before he could even step onto the court.  There are two choices in life: you make it your excuse or you make it your story.  Isaiah Austin s mother shared these words of wisdom with him as a child as he came to terms with a torn retina taking away the ability to see with his right eye. Faced with adversity at a young age, Isaiah had to choose let his disability define him or overcome the challenge and shine. Overcoming that challenge is exactly what Isaiah did as he made a name for himself on Baylor University s NCAA Division 1 basketball team. Everyone expected Isaiah to have a successful career in the NBA after college, but on June 21, 2014 just five days before the NBA draft Austin was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the body s connective tissue, putting him at risk of rupturing his heart if he continued to play basketball. In seconds, Austin s hopes for a career in the NBA became impossible. After hearing about Isaiah s diagnosis, NBA commissioner Adam Silver invited Austin to attend the 2014 draft as his personal guest. The League recognized Isaiah s courage, resilience, and determination in a bittersweet moment when he was made an Honorary Draft Pick. Rather than letting another challenge destroy his faith, Austin has once again strived to overcome adversity by becoming a spokesperson for The Marfan Foundation, raising awareness and understanding for the disease. He has also founded his own non-profit organization, The Isaiah Austin Foundation, to provide support and research for Marfan syndrome and those affected by it. Despite the many heartbreaking challenges he has faced, Isaiah s story is inspirational and full of hope as he encourages everyone to tower in the face of adversity and keep living out their dreams, no matter what life throws their way.

The unapologetic writings of W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey, the fervent fiction and poetry of Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes, the groundbreaking art of Aaron Douglas and William H. Johnson, and the triumphant music of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong gave voice and expression to the thoughts and emotions that Jim Crow segregation laws had long sought to stifle. In On the Shoulders of Giants, indomitable basketball star and bestselling author and historian Kareem Abdul-Jabbar invites the reader on an extraordinarily personal journey back to his birthplace, through one of the greatest political, cultural, literary, and artistic movements in our history, revealing the tremendous impact the Harlem Renaissance had on both American culture and his own life. Beginning with the rise of the Harlem Rens as pioneers of professional basketball, Kareem traces the many streams of historical influence that converged to create the man he is today -- the NBA's all-time leading scorer and a veritable African-American icon. Travel deep into the soul of the Renaissance -- to the night clubs, restaurants, basketball games, and fabulous parties that have made footprints in Harlem's history. Meet the athletes, jazz musicians, comedians, actors, politicians, entrepreneurs, and writers who not only inspired Kareem's rise to greatness but an entire nation's. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was born in the midst of a cultural reawakening, carried on the shoulders of athletes trying to prove there was a lot more at stake than a ball game, men and women who made music that could break your heart, and writers and intellectuals who gave voice to not just the ideals of a movement but the raw emotions. Kareem tells what it took to get these revolutionaries to Harlem and how they changed the world. A world that is still riding on the shoulders of giants.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IY5Xx2sjWA4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Publishing: A Leap from Mind to Mind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QzWBAAAACAAJ&dq=Publishing:+A+Leap+from+Mind+to+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"37th Hour, The","description":"A detective specializing in missing persons cases, Sarah Pribek becomes involved in a case that hits all too close to home, the mysterious disappearance of her own husband, a fellow police officer.

But the return of the Phoenix has added a frighteningly powerful third party to an already volatile situation, polarizing both human and atevi political factions, and making the possibility of all-out planetary war an even more likely threat.

But set adrift they were thousands of them, their communities destroyed, their homes demolished and burned. Such were the Sutherland Clearances, an extraordinary episode involving the deliberate depopulation of much of a Scottish Highlands county. What was done in the course of it was planned and carried out by a small group of men and one woman, seeking a more profitable use of the land. Most of those involved wrote a great deal about their actions, intentions, and feelings, and much of it has been preserved. There are no equivalent collections of material from those whose communities ceased to exist. Their feelings and fears are harder to access, but by no means irrecoverable. In this book, James Hunter tells the story of the Sutherland Clearances. His research took him to archives in Scotland, England, and Canada, to the now deserted valleys of Sutherland, to the frozen shores of Hudson Bay. The result is a story of a people s struggle for survival in the face of tragedy and disaster, covering experiences not featured in any previous such account.  Detailed and unsparing . . . .

Some of the most visible changes are new media technology; digital television; the internet; portable entertainment systems such as games, mobile phones, i-pods and so on. Television, the most popular medium with children for the last thirty years, is becoming less so. This book is intended to broaden the public debate about the role of popular media in children's lives. Its definition of 'media' is wide-ranging: not just television and the internet, but also still-popular forms such as fairy tales, children's literature - including the triumphantly successful Harry Potter series - and playground games. It sets these discussions within a framework of historical, sociological and psychological approaches to the study of children and childhood. At times of rapid technological change, public anxieties always arise about how children can be protected from new harmful influences. The book addresses the perennial controversies around media 'effects' from a range of academic perspectives. It examines critically the view that technology has dramatically changed modern children's lives, and looks at how technology has both changed, and sustained, children's cultural experiences in different times and places. Does new interactive technology give children a 'voice'? It can permit children to be their own authors and to engage in civil society, as well as to explore taboo and potentially dangerous areas. The book discusses how children can use technology to enhance their role as 'citizens in the making', as well its utilizing more playful applications. The book includes interviews with both producers and consumers  media workers, and children and their families, and has historical and contemporary illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uTR4t2YnFHYC&dq=Tom%27s+Midnight+Garden+(1979)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Smallest Towns","description":"\\"From Alabama to Wyoming, photographer Dennis Kitchen has roamed the lonesome highways to capture the quirky quintessence of Small Town, America.

After twenty court processes, involving two dozen lawyers and judges, our family lost everything. My little brother, Siggi, and I suffered severe illnesses, starvation and homelessness. When we were about five and seven, our mother forced us to scavenge pig's innards from a manure pile. With the ever-present wire whip that she usually kept pinned to her skirt, she enticed us to eat them. A judge evicted us from our home. On Christmas Eve Day. For one year we squatted in a stranger's attic without water, sewer, heat, power or hope. When we were fourteen and sixteen, our relatives invited us to America. We now thought that our lives would improve: Cowboys and Indians! But when we later arrived on their dairy farms, they enslaved us. I was not allowed to bathe but once a year. At the age of twenty-one, I still lived without water, heat, power, or outhouse. After we finally escaped, Siggi and I worked our way through college, became American citizens and world travelers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CG9eX_V8dsYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christina, Queen of Sweden : The Restless Life of a European Eccentric","description":"The groundbreaking biography of one of the most progressive, influential and entertaining women of the seventeenth century, Christina Alexandra, Queen of Sweden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9sgb8ER6rQMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of education in antiquity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gSfXxgEACAAJ&dq=A+history+of+education+in+antiquity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cygnet and the Firebird","description":"Following The Sorceress and the Cygnet, Patricia A.

It is interrupted by Arendt's emigration and Jaspers's \\"inner emigration, \\" and it is resumed immediately after World War II. The initial teacher-student relationship develops into a close friendship, in which Jasper's wife, Gertrud, is soon included and then Arendt's husband, Heinrich Blucher. These letters show not only the way both philosophers lived, thought, and worked but also how they experienced the postwar years. Since neither ever dreamed that this correspondence would be published, and each had absolute trust in the other, they reveal themselves here - for the first time - in a personal and spontaneous way. Brilliant, vulnerable, forthright, Arendt speaks about America, her adopted country. About American universities, American politics from McCarthyism to Kennedy, American urban decay. She speaks about Germany, the country she left: its anti-Semitism, its guilt for the Holocaust, its politics. And about Israel, which she always supported as a Jew but also criticized, especially in her controversial book about the trial and execution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In his dialogue with Arendt, the thoughtful, generous, concerned Jaspers considers the question of the German essence, and of the Jewish character. He speaks about philosophers past and present - Spinoza, Heidegger. About old age and retirement. Corrupt journalism. Suicide. Man's future on this planet. Here is a fascinating dialogue between a woman and a man, a Jew and a German, a questioner and a visionary, both uncompromising in their examination of our troubledcentury.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bidmMwAACAAJ&dq=Correspondence+1926-1969&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Securing Cisco Routers: Step-by-Step","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0-zZSAAACAAJ&dq=Securing+Cisco+Routers:+Step-by-Step&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Susan Haskell, Missionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OGm3SgAACAAJ&dq=Susan+Haskell,+Missionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thinking of the Master: Bataille between Hegel and Surrealism (Avant-Garde & Modernism Studies)","description":"Mastery of many sorts emerges in new configurations in Peter B rger's The Thinking of the Master as an idea developed by Hegel in the master/slave dialectic in his Phenomenology of Spirit as a quality embodied in the work of certain twentieth-century ma?tre-penseurs, or \\"master thinkers\\"; and, not least, in the expertise of B rger himself as he negotiates and clarified a critical intersection of contemporary French and German thought.

On another level, this book examines how a pro athlete comes to be famous, and what it means. It is a story about commercialism fed by adulation, about power and riches and the presumed and real virtues of the star players who acquire them. On yet another level it is about what Ken Dryden called simply  The Game.  Theoren Fleury received global recognition during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey by single-handedly winning two games for Canada and then by playing in his first All-Star Game in the following winter. Physically, Fleury is the smallest player in the NHL, yet, so intense is he, so quick, so skilled at faking and scoring, and so undaunted by the over 400 pounds of onrushing defencemen that routinely bar his way, that his coach and teammates have chosen him to be team captain. He is now a millionaire. He is also an intriguing combination of country boy, quick-witted city kid, ruthless pro athlete, father and family man, and reluctant, soft-spoken but sharp-tongued media hero. InFury, Andrew Malcolm follows Fleury through an entire hockey season. Yet this is more than a fan s inside look at a major hockey star: it is also an intriguing, revealing, funny, and exciting look at Canada s game by a gifted reporter and award-winning writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l56rKAAACAAJ&dq=Fury:+Inside+the+Life+of+Theoren+Fleury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of Hiawatha","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrkRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Balloons for Sarah","description":"\\"Jacqueline Laurent paints a picture with great detail, until you find you don't want to put the book down \\" -Barbara Morris, Author and Screenwriter When Sarah Klein was born, there was no one who told her how beautiful she was, how her blond hair already had the tiniest little curls, and how she crinkled her mouth as if she wanted to tell you something really important.

Then he studies the different situations in each country: the religious, social and political background.

Even in a formally democratic polity, political action occurs in a context of conflict and inequality; thus, the shared speech of citizenship differs significantly from the conversations of friendly associates. Bickford suggests that democratic politics requires a particular quality of attention, one not based on care or friendship. Analyzing specifically political listening is central to the development of democratic theory, she contends, and to envisioning democratic practices for contemporary society. Bickford's analysis draws on the work of Aristotle and of Hannah Arendt to establish the conflictual and contentious character of politics. To analyze the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, Bickford mobilizes contemporary feminist theory, including Gloria Anzaldua's work on the connection between identity and politics. She develops a conception of citizen interaction characterized by adversarial communication in a context of inequality. Such a conception posits public identity and hence public listening as active and creative, and grounded in particular social and political contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ri5zDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Dissonance+of+Democracy:+Listening,+Conflict,+and+Citizenship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Jew, a Novel Set During the inquisition of 1492 and Expulsion of Jews Fronm Spain","description":"In the year 1492, the Inquisition has all of Spain in its grip. After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew. On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story. In it, Noah Gordon utilizes his greatest strengths, and the result is remarkable and moving.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JwzHAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Die Rauber: Ein Schauspiel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eItMPwAACAAJ&dq=Die+Rauber:+Ein+Schauspiel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish-Mexican families of early California, 1769-1850","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gb0RAQAAIAAJ&dq=Spanish-Mexican+families+of+early+California,+1769-1850&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Step-by-Step Knitting: A Complete Introduction to the Craft of Knitting, Including Photographs in Full Color","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZIXAQAAMAAJ&dq=Step-by-Step+Knitting:+A+Complete+Introduction+to+the+Craft+of+Knitting,+Including+Photographs+in+Full+Color&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schizophrenia: A Scientific Delusion?","description":"First published in 2002.

Rowling's phenomenal bestsellers, a Christian minister illuminates the powerful, positive message Harry Potter and his magical world bring to readers of all ages. Potter fever has swept the world and shows no signs of abating. The books and the recent movie have attracted millions of followers and fans, all of them eagerly awaiting the next installments. Along with the widespread enjoyment and appreciation of Harry Potter and his friendships, however, criticism of the series has also emerged. The opposition has focused on two issues; the darkness of the novels and their apparent endorsement of witchcraft and the occult. In A Charmed Life, Francis Bridger, a theologian and pastor, argues that far from promoting the dark arts, the Potter books are firmly based in Christian values, and offer valuable insights into our characters, our relationships, our priorities, and our spirituality. Taking readers on an entertaining tour of Potterworld, Bridger shows that each adventure presents new ways of expressing and exploring key spiritual issues, from the meaning of justice, to the need to confront fears, to the debilitating effects of evil. As Harry and his friends deal with one another, face their enemies, cope with their variously dysfunctional families, and experience the common problems of growing up, Bridger demonstrates, it is their intrinsic human goodness, love, and friendship--not wizardry or magic--that allows them to triumph over evil.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O1-kEE3RBQwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living with Intention: Designing a Wildly Fulfilling Remarkably Successful Life","description":"God has decided to have a trial in Heaven to decide whether Mankind should continue to exist.

The Fourth of July is winding down, but in Santa Rita County the fireworks have just begun. A house in the well-to-do Mission Heights district has gone up in flames. Inside are the charred remains of Lawrence Lancaster, with a .22 caliber slug in his brain -- courtesy of his wife. Kathryn's convinced it's premeditated murder, but she's pitted against a high-profile, media-savvy attorney who's vowing to turn the trial into a referendum on Battered Women's Syndrome. Kathryn's greatest challenge will be focusing on the defendant's love life...and not on her own. Her colleague and lover, David Granz, has also been accused of a crime -- the brutal rape of a former girlfriend -- and the evidence seems airtight. With her personal and professional worlds on a collision course, Kathryn races to uncover the truth -- and becomes the next target in a spiral of rage, recrimination, and explosive violence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KeSCRdlKDmsC&dq=Until+the+Bough+Breaks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read My Lips: A Cultural History of Lipstick","description":"Chronicles the history of lipstick and offers stories of the many famous women who have worn it throughout history, with a review of its impact on fashion today and many fun lipstick facts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pNvfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Read+My+Lips:+A+Cultural+History+of+Lipstick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor's Honour, a (Medical Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2sHAAAACAAJ&dq=Doctor%27s+Honour,+a+(Medical+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victory Harvest: Diary of a Canadian in the Women's Land Army, 1940-1944","description":"Based on the diary of Canadian Marion Kelsey (now living in Nova Scotia in her 80s), which she kept while in the 6,000-strong (by 1940) Women's Land Army to harvest crops during World War II.

Experiencing Aural Architecture","description":"How we experience space by listening: the concepts of aural architecture, with examples ranging from Gothic cathedrals to surround sound home theater. We experience spaces not only by seeing but also by listening. We can navigate a room in the dark, and \\"hear\\" the emptiness of a house without furniture. Our experience of music in a concert hall depends on whether we sit in the front row or under the balcony. The unique acoustics of religious spaces acquire symbolic meaning. Social relationships are strongly influenced by the way that space changes sound. In Spaces Speak, Are You Listening?, Barry Blesser and Linda-Ruth Salter examine auditory spatial awareness: experiencing space by attentive listening. Every environment has an aural architecture.The audible attributes of physical space have always contributed to the fabric of human culture, as demonstrated by prehistoric multimedia cave paintings, classical Greek open-air theaters, Gothic cathedrals, acoustic geography of French villages, modern music reproduction, and virtual spaces in home theaters. Auditory spatial awareness is a prism that reveals a culture's attitudes toward hearing and space. Some listeners can learn to \\"see\\" objects with their ears, but even without training, we can all hear spatial geometry such as an open door or low ceiling. Integrating contributions from a wide range of disciplines including architecture, music, acoustics, evolution, anthropology, cognitive psychology, audio engineering, and many others Spaces Speak, Are You Listening? establishes the concepts and language of aural architecture. These concepts provide an interdisciplinary guide for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of how space enhances our well-being. Aural architecture is not the exclusive domain of specialists. Accidentally or intentionally, we all function as aural architects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YusCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Spaces+Speak,+Are+You+Listening%3F+Experiencing+Aural+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Babbitt","description":"In the fall of 1920, Sinclair Lewis began a novel set in a fast-growing city with the heart and mind of a small town. For the center of his cutting satire of American business he created the bustling, shallow, and myopic George F. Babbitt, the epitome of middle-class mediocrity. The novel cemented Lewis s prominence as a social commentator. Babbitt basks in his pedestrian success and the popularity it has brought him. He demands high moral standards from those around him while flirting with women, and he yearns to have rich friends while shunning those less fortunate than he. But Babbitt s secure complacency is shattered when his best friend is sent to prison, and he struggles to find meaning in his hollow life.

Young dot-coms with little experience and possessing few assets other than a concept, flourished boasting market values in the millions and even billions of dollars. Then reality settled in as the market crashed and over a hundred dot-coms perished. The highflying NASDAQ dropped over 60% and the longest economic expansion teetered on the brink of recession. Despite the disconcerting scenario, this was not the demise of the Web, but merely the conclusion of its innocent childhood or the first stage of meteoric growth. After all, the Web was only 10 years old. There were still trillions of dollars worth of opportunities, as the more rigorous applications waited to be accomplished. The Web is a revolutionary event, yet there is no evident vision of its future. This book projects the Web until the year 2020 and will interest anyone intrigued by the Web, but perplexed by its seemingly erratic course. The book clarifies the murky Web, showing how it will interconnect emerging digital technologies to revolutionize our home, work, and society. In short, 2020 Web Vision will relieve the future shock engendered by the Web. It will also be helpful to those interested in building new applications or investing in future technological enterprises.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uYj5WMJFIiUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emily Windsnap And Monster From The Deep","description":"\\"High-action adventure, a plucky protagonist, and whimsical illustrations enliven this sea fantasy, which will be most thoroughly appreciated by series followers.\\"   Booklist Picture an island set in a glittering blue sea, sparkling with white sand and palm trees, a secret place where humans and merfolk live together.

Vulnerable to storms that arise in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, Florida has been hit by far more hurricanes than any other state. In many ways, hurricanes have helped shape Florida's history. Early efforts by the French, Spanish, and English to claim the territory as their own were often thwarted by hurricanes. More recently, storms have affected such massive projects as Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad and efforts to manage water in South Florida. In this book, Jay Barnes offers a fascinating and informative look at Florida's hurricane history. Drawing on meteorological research, news reports, first-person accounts, maps, and historical photographs, he traces all of the notable hurricanes that have affected the state over the last four-and-a-half centuries, from the great storms of the early colonial period to the devastating hurricanes of 2004 and 2005--Charley, Frances, Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Katrina, and Wilma. In addition to providing a comprehensive chronology of more than one hundred individual storms, Florida's Hurricane History includes information on the basics of hurricane dynamics, formation, naming, and forecasting. It explores the origins of the U.S. Weather Bureau and government efforts to study and track hurricanes in Florida, home of the National Hurricane Center. But the book does more than examine how hurricanes have shaped Florida's past; it also looks toward the future, discussing the serious threat that hurricanes continue to pose to both lives and property in the state. Filled with more than 200 photographs and maps, the book also features a foreword by Steve Lyons, tropical weather expert for the Weather Channel. It will serve as both an essential reference on hurricanes in Florida and a remarkable source of the stories--of tragedy and destruction, rescue and survival--that foster our fascination with these powerful storms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e8E3CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bird study book","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n5EaAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Artificial White Man: Essays on Authenticity","description":"Another dance of the bull through the china shop of cliches, The Artificial White Man proves the correctness of Tom Wolfe's observation that Stanley Crouch is \\"the jazz virtuoso of the American essay.\\" This time out, Crouch focuses his attention on issues surrounding the often misdirected American hunger for \\"authenticity.\\" Though the essays range in topic from segregation in contemporary fiction to the racial politics of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, they are informed by a singular concern: our increasing difficulty in discerning the real from the counterfeit, the posture from the pose, in contemporary life.Crouch moves across literature, music, sports, film, race, sex, class, and religion with insights withering in one instance, celebratory and challenging in another. Long known as an independent thinker, Crouch takes further intellectual chances in this collection challenging us to live up to the potential of our social contract and our democratic arts.

Hilda, the older child, is both self-sacrificing and domineering, as puritanical as she is gorgeous; Eustace is a gentle, dreamy, pleasure-loving boy: the two siblings could hardly be more different, but they are also deeply devoted. And yet as Eustace and Hilda grow up and seek to go their separate ways in a world of power and position, money and love, their relationship is marked by increasing pain. L. P. Hartley's much-loved novel, the magnum opus of one of twentieth-century England's best writers, is a complex and spellbinding work: a comedy of upper-class manners; a study in the subtlest nuances of feeling; a poignant reckoning with the ironies of character and fate. Above all, it is about two people who cannot live together or apart, about the ties that bind and break.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=klAtu1XPITIC&dq=Eustace+and+Hilda:+A+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desperate men","description":"The goal of Kings and Desperate Men is to provide a picture of eighteenth-century England up to the French Revolution. Kronenberger's work lies much closer to a social chronicle than an orthodox history, and is more concerned with manners and tastes than with treaties and wars. Kings and Desperate Men reveals what life was like for both aristocrats and commoners: their family lives, experience of larger society, habits, diet, fashions, religion, and artistic tastes. In tracing these topics for both city and country dwellers, he artfully communicates the very real division between the vivacity of London and the regular, fixed, and monotonous character of country life. The division is vital to understanding the age and the transformations it would experience.Yet Kronenberger does not ignore the more traditional historical landmarks. Kroenberger treats the characters of the leading political actors: Walpole, Bolingbroke, Burke, Fox, and Pitt, while providing the reader with a sweeping account of the formation of political parties and constitutional shifts of power between the monarchy and parliament. Students of the period who despair at its political complexities will fi nd much to appreciate in Kronenberger's condensed and easy to understand formulations.As for philosophy, Kronenberger refers to thinkers and ideas as they influence English life; especially Locke and Hume. Their ideas and reputations are explained as part of the character of society. The same is true for economics. More attention is given to the social gains of middle-class shopkeepers and the eighteenth-century zeal for stock speculation than to formal schools of thought. Especially notable is Kronenberger's treatment of both the arts and the artists of the eighteenth century-theatre, opera, music, literature, architecture, and painting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zCExDwAAQBAJ&dq=Desperate+men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trial and Error: The Autobiography of Chaim Weizmann","description":"Chaim Weizmann s autobiography is a highly personal account of his life in the Zionist movement. Book One, completed in 1941, covers the years 1874-1917 and Book Two covers the years 1918-1948. Weizmann describes the Russian shtetl where he was born in 1874, his schooling in Pinsk and his university studies in Berlin, Geneva and Freiburg (Switzerland) where he received his PhD in chemistry in 1899 before moving to Manchester in 1904. He portrays many leading Zionists such as Theodor Herzl, Achad Ha-am, Max Nordau, Shmarya Levin, Ussishkin, Jabotinsky, Ruppin. He describes the opposition by assimilationist Jews (like Edwin Montagu) to Zionism, and internal debates within the Zionist movement, such as the defeat of Herzl s Uganda plan   bitterly opposed by Weizmann   at the 6th Zionist Congress (1903) and his frictions with the American Zionists led by Brandeis. Weizmann describes how, during World War I, his work on acetone brought him into contact with British political leaders such as Lloyd George, Arthur Balfour and Winston Churchill and facilitated the Balfour Declaration which, in 1917, paved the way for  the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people . Weizmann recounts his role in the creation of what would become Israel s leading scientific institutions, the Hebrew University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Technion, including his fundraising efforts in Europe and in the United States on their behalf and for other Zionist initiatives. He became the first President of Israel, and died in office in 1952.  ... one of the important historical documents of our time.    Orville Prescott, The New York Times (January 19, 1949)  [Trial and Error] is likely to be read for many years to come as an authoritative exposition of the Zionist movement ... records eye-witness accounts of so many crucial events and reflects so many deep insights that it is certain to become of permanent value to the scholar and a delight to the general reader.    Salo Baron, The New York Times (January 23, 1949)  There are four angles from which one can approach this book. One can take it as a history of Zionism during the last seventy years... a record of personal endeavour triumphant over obstacles and dissension... a sad commentary upon human achievement, when eventual triumph comes at a date, and in circumstances, which rob it of its full savour... the self-portrait of a most remarkable man.    Harold Nicolson, The Observer (March 27, 1949)  Notable in this intellectually candid record is the fact that [Weizmann] embraced and propagated Jewish nationalism because he regarded it as a positive good, not merely a negative escape from gentile persecution. This intensely human book, which in a sense is the story of modern Zionism, constitutes one of the indispensable sources for the history of our times.    Robert Gale Woolbert, Foreign Affairs (July 1949)  [Weizmann s] autobiography ... is an astonishingly objective and life-like narrative, without a trace of dramatization, exaggeration, vanity, self-pity, self-justification; it conveys his authentic, richly and evenly developed, autonomous, proud, firmly built, somewhat ironical nature, free from inner conflict, in deep, instinctive harmony with the forces of nature and society, and therefore possessed of natural wisdom, dignity and authority.    Sir Isaiah Berlin, Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory, Oxford University (November 19, 1957)  Ranks between Churchill s war memoirs and those of Nehru, Masaryk and Trotzky, among the founders  own stories ... above all a human book, the record of the experiences and reactions of a man who fought over issues that were important    Congress Bulletin (April 1949)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fl2mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color Your Own Abstract Art Masterpieces (Dover Art Coloring Book)","description":"Color 29 meticulously rendered drawings of great 20th-century abstract art: Frank Stella's Lac Laronge III, Ad Reinhardt's Number 30, Helen Frankenthaler's Indian Summer, many more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HHII7qHd56gC&dq=Color+Your+Own+Abstract+Art+Masterpieces+(Dover+Art+Coloring+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long is the Road to Freedom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xl6AAAAAIAAJ&dq=Long+is+the+Road+to+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metallica Visual Documentary","description":"Here it is - The Metallica story, from roots to superstardom.

The primary difference is that the modern gospel portrays a grace that is foreign to Scripture, a grace that is actually a license to sin. Whereas the gospel of the Bible reveals a grace from God that offers people a limited time to repent and a promise of freedom from sin. Jesus told the woman caught in adultery, \\"I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more\\" (John 8:11). You can be certain that if that woman continued in her sin, when she stood at Christ's judgment seat after her death, she did not hear the same words again. Likewise, God is graciously giving every person a limited opportunity to repent, so that each person will stand before Him forgiven and striving to follow Him to \\"enter through the narrow gate\\" (Matt. 7:13).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oAg-rgEACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Gospel+Deception:+Exposing+the+False+Promise+of+Heaven+Without+Holiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I","description":"If half of all cars bought in America each year broke down, there would be a national uproar.

There is no doubt that intracranial aneurysms have existed since the beginning of time. This terrifying disease of the brain arteries, with its dramatic consequences for the patient, has surely been observed in all human collectives, although clear definition and description in the literature began only 300 years ago. During the last century, clinical signs and symptoms have been carefully observed and analyzed, and 100 years ago, the first attempts were made for surgical treatment, such as the ligature of external and internal carotid and vertebral arteries. With the introduction of angiography, an entirely new dimension of diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the vascular diseases of CNS, was accomplished. In the years between 1945 and 1970, the neurosurgeon was increasingly stimulated to directly eliminate intracranial aneurysms. The most respected and avoided location, the aneurysms at the bifurcation of the basilar artery, remained as a \\"dark corner. \\" Several pioneers of neurosurgery attempted to explore the interpeduncular fossa, but finally retreated. Not so Charles Drake. His vision must have been stronger than his anxiety, after experiences of initial fatalities, to persevere more decisively in this desperate fight instead of to yield. Such steadfastness requires enormous courage. But what distin guishes courage! Surgical courage is not just a fearless or unscrupulous action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZLSvBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Like the Lion's Tooth","description":"A group of youngsters form a strange alliance at a special school for problem children as they struggle to cope in an adult world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ve1THAAACAAJ&dq=Like+the+Lion%27s+Tooth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Leadership","description":"In Part One of this title, Gayle Avery integrates a fragmented field into four broad paradigms or forms of leadership, helping to simplify and clarify the ill-defined field of leadership.

Here is a man capable of both great generosity toward needy peasants and harsh callousness toward lovers and family, a man who craved with equal passion the company of others and the solitude necessary to create his art.

Montague Series in Oil and Business History)","description":"Before OPEC took center stage, one state agency in Texas was widely believed to set oil prices for the world. The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) evolved from its founding in 1891 to a multi-divisional regulatory commission that oversaw not only railroads but also a number of other industries central to the modern American economy: petroleum production, natural gas utilities, and motor carriers (buses and trucks). William R. Childs s unprecedented study of the TRC from its founding until the mid-twentieth century extends our knowledge of commission-style regulation. It focuses on the interplay between business and regulators, between state and national regulatory commissions, and among the three branches of government through a process of  pragmatic federalism.  Drawing on extensive primary research, Childs demonstrates that the alleged power of regulatory commissions has been more constrained than most observers have recognized. As he shows, the myth of power was devised by the agency itself as part of building a civil religion of Texas oil. Together, the myth and the civil religion enabled the TRC to convince Texas oil operators to follow production controls and thus stabilized the American oil industry by the 1940s. The result of this fascinating study is a more nuanced understanding of federalism and of regulation, the forces shaping it, and its outcomes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bj6rqorklSkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradise Planters...The Story of Brook Farm..","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FxxOAAAACAAJ&dq=Paradise+Planters...The+Story+of+Brook+Farm..&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taos","description":"The author recounts why she left New York, the center of the avant-garde after World War I, and settled in Taos, New Mexico","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zLih07OrpiQC&dq=Taos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Private Presley: The Missing Years--Elvis in Germany","description":"Three hundred photographs highlight a detailed account of Elvis Presley's two years in Germany with the U.S. Army, in a biography that includes a CD of early Elvis performances and rare interviews. 100,000 first printing. $125,000 ad/promo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=te4hAAAACAAJ&dq=Private+Presley:+The+Missing+Years--Elvis+in+Germany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitewash II: The FBI-Secret Service cover-up","description":"A classic on the JFK cover-up by the author  often dubbed the dean of assassination researchers  (Los Angeles Times). Harold Weisberg s first volume in the Whitewash series dissected the Warren Report and its failure to confront evidence of conspiracy in the JFK assassination. Now, he shows how the agencies of the investigation the FBI, the Secret Service, the Dallas police, and the lawyers who worked for the Commission made this possible by often corrupting evidence and consistently avoiding pursuit of clear and critical evidence pointing to and defining a conspiracy. The author demonstrates that their failure was rooted not only in institutional inability but also in a deliberately twisted investigative structure. In the years since their original publication, the books in Weisberg s Whitewash series have become classics of assassination literature and have established the author as one of the premier investigators and researchers in his field. Decades later, the shocking revelations painstakingly detailed in his work have lost none of their impact, and the information uncovered beneath the government s whitewash is crucial to understanding the assassination of John F.

William Doyle shows how a movement which began with optimism and general enthusiasm soon became a tragedy, not only for the ruling orders, but for the millions of ordinary people all over Europe whose lives were disrupted by religious upheaval, and civil and international war. It was they who paid the price for the destruction of the old political order and the struggle to establish a new one, based on the ideals of liberty and revolution, in the face of widespread indifference and hostility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2DerOCz4HRIC&dq=The+Oxford+History+of+the+French+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy Magazine, June 1983","description":"Following on Well Played 1.0, this book is full of in-depth close readings of video games that parse out the various meanings to be found in the experience of playing a game.

He knew he needed to lose weight fast, but he had run out of diets - all had failed. After doing some reading on evolution (why weren't our forebears fat?), David cut sugar - specifically fructose - from his diet. He immediately started to lose weight, and kept it off. Slim, trim and fired up, David set out to look at the connection between sugar, our soaring obesity rates and some of the more worrying diseases of the twenty-first century, and discovered some startling facts in the process. Sugar was once such a rare resource that nature decided we didn't need an off-switch - in other words, we can keep eating sugar without feeling full. In the space of 150 years, we have gone from eating no added sugar to more than a kilogram a week. You would need to run 7km every day of your life just to not put on weight as a result of eating that much sugar. Two decades ago 1 in 14 adult Australians were obese; that figure is now 1 in 5. The 'natural' sugar in one glass of unsweetened fruit juice per day for a year is enough to add just over 2.5kg your waistline. The more sugar we eat, the more we want.

How this language itself served imperial purposes--and how it survives today in writing about the Third World--are the subject of David Spurr's book, a revealing account of the rhetorical strategies that have defined Western thinking about the non-Western world. Despite historical differences among British, French, and American versions of colonialism, their rhetoric had much in common. The Rhetoric of Empire identifies these shared features images, figures of speech, and characteristic lines of argument and explores them in a wide variety of sources. A former correspondent for the United Press International, the author is equally at home with journalism or critical theory, travel writing or official documents, and his discussion is remarkably comprehensive. Ranging from T. E. Lawrence and Isak Dineson to Hemingway and Naipaul, from Time and the New Yorker to the National Geographic and Le Monde, from journalists such as Didion and Sontag to colonial administrators such as Frederick Lugard and Albert Sarraut, this analysis suggests the degree to which certain rhetorical tactics penetrate the popular as well as official colonial and postcolonial discourse. Finally, Spurr considers the question: Can the language itself and with it, Western forms of interpretation--be freed of the exercise of colonial power? This ambitious book is an answer of sorts. By exposing the rhetoric of empire, Spurr begins to loosen its hold over discourse about and between different cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SxZaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Rhetoric+of+Empire:+Colonial+Discourse+in+Journalism,+Travel+Writing,+and+Imperial+Administration+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyewitness Travel 15-Minute Language Packs: 15-Minute French (15 Minutes)","description":"Whether you are planning to travel to Italy or just curious to learn a new language, this 15-minute language ebook is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to learn Italian fast. 15 Minute Italian has 12 themed chapters, spanning a range of practical themes, from socializing to doing business.

They were the closest of sisters and the best of friends. But when, in a quixotic twist of fate, their uncle Edward Vlll decided to abdicate the throne, the dynamic between Elizabeth and Margaret was dramatically altered. Forever more Margaret would have to curtsey to the sister she called 'Lillibet.' And bow to her wishes. Elizabeth would always look upon her younger sister's antics with a kind of stoical amusement, but Margaret's struggle to find a place and position inside the royal system-and her fraught relationship with its expectations-was often a source of tension. Famously, the Queen had to inform Margaret that the Church and government would not countenance her marrying a divorcee, Group Captain Peter Townsend, forcing Margaret to choose between keeping her title and royal allowances or her divorcee lover. From the idyll of their cloistered early life, through their hidden war-time lives, into the divergent paths they took following their father's death and Elizabeth's ascension to the throne, this book explores their relationship over the years. Andrew Morton's latest biography offers unique insight into these two drastically different sisters-one resigned to duty and responsibility, the other resistant to it-and the lasting impact they have had on the Crown, the royal family, and the ways it adapted to the changing mores of the 20thcentury.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CcSjzQEACAAJ&dq=Margaret+the+Queen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Occult World","description":"This volume presents students and scholars with a comprehensive overview of the fascinating world of the occult.

She left her high-profile job as a television producer after her son was born, while her husband continued to move up the corporate ladder. Like many of her stay-at-home-mom friends, Shine employed a housekeeper and baby-sitters so she could spend her time running to the salon, the club, and out to lunch. Then one day she was whining to her mother about how terrible her life was, and her mother yelled at her to wake up and stop being so selfish. It was just the wakeup call she needed! The desperate housewife craze of today is sending the wrong message to women and their children everywhere, says Shine. When did being a good mom and being proud to stay home with the kids go out of style? When did it become acceptable to cheat on your husband? When did mothers start dressing like their teenage daughters?

With a lineage stretching back as far as the first century AD, few families can lay claim to a history as illustrious and colorful as that of Flower, the tail end of the Tekelden line, for whom Dawnay wrote and illustrated this one-of-a-kind book,  in an almost certainly vain hope that the history of his ancestors will teach Flower to improve.  Starting with Rattila the Hund and his Sack of Rome in 463, Dawnay follows the lives of Rattila s dachshund descendants, both distinguished and notorious, celebrating their achievements through family portraits by notable artists of the day, from Van Dyck to Picasso.

Author David Rain focuses on the strategies and the stories of migrants in Maradi, a border town in southern Niger, against a contextual backdrop of demographic, ecological, and political-economic changes in the region. The author finds that instead of being desperate harbingers of future disorder, seasonal migrants are simply resourcefuland sometimes restlesspeople who realize the benefits of spreading interests and activities around. In the words of one migrant, some people just like it better going away. }In this illuminating new work on the geography of poverty, David Rain dispels the notion that relentless human mobility is a byproduct of Western technological advances like superhighways and airports. Instead, it is much older and more deeply ingrained in the human spirit. Every year after the rainy season ends in the arid West African Sahel, hundreds of thousands of men and women leave their villages to work in the informal economies of West African cities. The seasonal flux of peasants swells urban markets and neighborhoods, as it has for centuries. These migrants, called masu cin rani in Hausa, or those who eat the dry season, travel after their crops are harvested in order to conserve household food supplies and earn money which is funneled back to their villages of origin. These eaters come from all walks of life, though they are more commonly poor and living by their wits.This book focuses on the activities of the seasonal migrants, persisting as they have through colonial and postcolonial changes, and constituting an important response to uncertainty in the region. Based on a combination of survey-interviews and geographic analysis, the book regards the migrants as practical people who are simply making the best of what has been dealt to them. Contextual andpanoramic, and centered on the immediacy of daily and seasonal routines, Eaters of the Dry Season delves deeper than typical alarmist accounts of African drought and famine, which are all too common in current literature. It will challenge laypeople as well as scholars and policymakers to consider how actual people respond to global changes in the next century, especially for the billions who are labeled poor. Unraveling the dynamics behind population, environment, and poverty requires us to set our sights on the intersection of the human and the physical realms, and to enter the worlds inhabited by the poor. }","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=luFLDwAAQBAJ&dq=Eaters+Of+The+Dry+Season:+Circular+Labor+Migration+In+The+West+African+Sahel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All I Want For Christmas (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aeF3PwAACAAJ&dq=All+I+Want+For+Christmas+(Harlequin+Temptation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long Life: Essays and Other Writings","description":"Poets must read and study, but also they must learn to tilt and whisper, shout, or dance, each in his or her own way, or we might just as well copy the old books.

Among the major descendents of Whitman s Song of Myself, Tape occupies an essential imaginative space, showing us much about what is essential in the American poetic imagination.   Harold Bloom In the form of a journal covering the period December 6, 1963, through January 10, 1964, A. R. Ammons s long, thin poem was written on a roll of adding-machine tape, then transferred foot by foot to manuscript. He chose this method as a serious experiment in making a poem adapt to something outside itself. The tape determined both the length of the poem s lines and when it ends. Tape for the Turn of the Year is a poem of infinite variety, blessed by the rich resources of one of this century s greatest poets. By turns witty, serious, lyrical, and meditative, it is at once a superbly entertaining book and a significant literary achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5emDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attract Money & Wealth Subliminal CD","description":"Joseph Murphy (20th May 1898-16th Dec 1981), the author, says that \\"Wealth is a state of consciousness.

In The Traveller in the Evening, Morton Paley argues that this late phase involves attitudes, themes, and ideas that are either distinctively new or different in emphasis from what preceded them. After an introduction on Blake and his milieu during this period, Paley begins with a chapter on Blake's illustrations to Thornton's edition of Virgil. Paley relates these to Blake's complex view of pastoral, before proceeding to a history of the project, its near-abortion, and its fulfillment as one of Blake's greatest accomplishments as an illustrator. In Yah and His Two Sons the presentation of the divine, except where it is associated with art, is ambiguous where it is not negative. Paley takes up this separate plate in the context of artists's representations of the Laocoon that would have been known to Blake, and also of what Blake would have known of its history from classical antiquity to his own time. Blake's Dante water colours and engravings are the most ambitious accomplishment of the last years of his life, and Paley shows that the problematic nature of some of these pictures, with Beatrice Addressing Dante from the Car as a main example, arises from Blake's own divided and sharply polarized attitude toward Dante's Comedy. The closing chapter, called 'Blake's Bible', is on the Bible-related designs and writings of Blake's last years. Paley discusses The Death of Abel (addressed to Lord Byron 'in the Wilderness') as a response to its literary forerunners, especially Gessner's Death of Abel and Byron's Cain. For the Job engravings Paley shows how the border designs and the marginal texts set up a dialogue with the main illustrations unlike anything in Blake's Job water colours on the same subjects. Also included here are Blake's last pictorial work on a Biblical subject, The Genesis manuscript, and Blake's last writing on a Biblical text, his vitriolic comments on Thornton's translations of the Lord's Prayer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=awxREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of a Giant Fan","description":"This is a diary of a Giants fan's memories of watching over some 400 games.

For a long time, the study of macroeconomics has focused almost exclusively on a closed economy and downplayed the role of international transactions. Today, however, researchers recognize that one cannot fully understand domestic macroeconomic relationships without considering the global economy within which each country operates. Increasingly, economists are treating international transactions as an integral part of the macroeconomic system, and international macroeconomics has become an area of intensive research activity. International Macroeconomic Dynamics provides extensive applications of important macroeconomic dynamic models to the international economy. It adopts the main contemporary macroeconomic framework, the representative agent model, and develops a series of models of increasing complexity. The author considers both small and large economies and analyzes them in both deterministic and stochastic contexts. The emphasis is very much on the development of the analytical models; a novel feature is the extensive use of continuous-time stochastic methods. While the author applies the models to a range of important policy issues, particularly issues of fiscal policy, the reader is invited to view the analyses as blueprints for other applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8wQv3VOZW_YC&dq=International+Macroeconomic+Dynamics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ye stone missal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ePfxGwAACAAJ&dq=Ye+stone+missal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths of Light: Eastern Metaphors of the Eternal (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)","description":"Master mythologist Joseph Campbell had a genius for finding the unifying symbols and metaphors in apparently distinct cultures and traditions. In Myths of Light: Eastern Metaphors of the Eternal,Campbell explores, with his characteristic clarity and humor, the principle that underlies all the great religions of India and East Asia, from Jainism and Hinduism to Buddhism and Taoism: the transcendent World Soul. Joseph Campbell began his comparative study of the world s religions with a chance meeting with the renowned Indian theosophist Jeddu Krishnamurti on a trans-Atlantic steamer. Though Campbell was deeply fascinated by mythologies and religions from every continent, Asia s potent mix of theologies captured his imagination more than any other, and offered him paths to understanding the essence of myth. In Myths of Light, Campbell explores the core philosophies and mythologies of the East, comparing them through vivid examples and stories to each other and to those of the West. A worthy companion to Thou Art That and to Campbell s Asian Journals, this volume conveys complex insights through warm, accessible storytelling, revealing the intricacies and secrets of his subject with his typical enthusiasm.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tBgSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing the Jack","description":"In 1785 a runaway orphan joins a band of travelling players and, learning the tricks of their trade and of Madame Bonneville's child brothel, seeks the acceptance of the volatile, charming, mysterious showman, Jack","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Unb2AQAACAAJ&dq=Playing+the+Jack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Ground","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tsZPsHD6-74C&dq=Human+Ground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gargantua & Pantagruel;","description":"The dazzling and exuberant moral stories of Rabelais (c. 1471-1553) expose human follies with their mischievous and often obscene humour, while intertwining the realistic with carnivalesque fantasy to make us look afresh at the world.

It's a simple command to understand, but very difficult to obey. And in the local church, it sometimes seems impossible. Many of us belong to highly diverse Christian communities, where we encounter people radically different from ourselves. At the same time, controversies and difficulties often threaten to tear us apart. So how can we achieve unity within the body of Christ? Gerald Sittser examines the 'one another' statements from the New Testament, distilling much-needed biblical wisdom to help us love one another. Drawing on his own pastoral experience of the best and worst of church life, he shows us what the love Jesus commanded actually requires of us, and how to live it out in struggle and servanthood, compromise and sacrifice. This enjoyable book by a best-selling author will guide us in putting one of the most important biblical principles into practice, for the good of our local churches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0EI_NAEACAAJ&dq=Love+one+another&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yangtze valley and beyond: An account of journeys in China, chiefly in the province of Sze Chuan and among the Man-tze of the Somo territory","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

It was my idea then, with my students in mind, to compile a book of the most often played, most important and most interesting fiddle tunes from the various Celtic and North American traditions. The tunes were chosen by cataloging a large number of recordings by tune title. A tally was taken to find out which had been recorded most often. This established a foundation of material that could not be left out. To this list I added the names of other pieces which had not been recorded as frequently, but which I knew were played regularly and with respect. I admit to sprinkling the collection with a few lesser known tunes which happen to be personal favorites, but I am sure they will hold their own when placed next to the old war horses of the fiddler s repertoire. . . . Although I started out with my students in mind this book has turned out to be the book that I ve always wanted and I hope that it will serve the advanced player as well as the beginner.

Laurel Hunt walked into the office of David Sussman enveloped in a grave beauty that took his breath away. And then she announced that her husband, who was currently in a mental institution, was not crazy but in the grip of something monstrous. Dr. Sussman had ministered to his patients' fantasies, neuroses, and psychoses for a good number of years; he'd studied in India and Tibet; he'd seen and heard it all before. Or so he thought. This case would take him, against his will and in the face of every scientific law he held dear, into the realms of reincarnation and Buddhist myth. But these realms were not the bottom of this mystic enigma-only in the Tibetan Book of the Dead would David Sussman begin to find the answers he sought. As murder and madness stalk him, the evidence leads David to a conclusion his sanity refuses to accept . . . until the mists of Time and Space open to reveal the monstrosity that has come to claim him as its own-the Kunma.

Siva Vaidhyanathan enters this debate with a seminal insight: While we've been busy debating how to make cyberspace imitate the world, the world has been busy imitating cyberspace. More and more of our social, political, and religious activities are modeling themselves after the World Wide Web.Vaidhyanathan tells us the key information structure of our time, and the key import from cyberspace into the world, is the \\"peer-to-peer network.\\" Peer-to-peer networks have always existed -- but with the rise of electronic communication, they are suddenly coming into their own. And they are drawing the outlines of a battle for information that will determine much of the culture and politics of our century, affecting everything from society to terrorism, from religion to the latest social fads.

Based on the early Methodist class meetings, Covenant Discipleship Groups provide a way for Christians today to be accountable disciples of Jesus Christ. Q&A's Q: WHAT IS A COVENANT DISCIPLESHIP GROUP? A: Covenant Discipleship Groups consists of up to seven persons who meet together for one hour each week to hold themselves mutually accountable for their discipleship. They do this by means of a covenant that they have written. Q: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A COVENANT DISCIPLESHIP GROUP? A: Covenant Discipleship Groups are intended solely for mutual accountability and prayerful support for living as disciples in the world. They are not where our discipleship happens but where we make sure that it happens. Q: WHY DOES THE GROUP NEED A COVENANT? A: The covenants we make with one another help us keep our covenant with God. We make covenants with one another because we live in a world that has yet to accept God's salvation. We constantly face temptations to turn away from God, and we need some means of mutual support. John Wesley and the early Methodists understood this need and saw that nothing short of binding themselves to mutual accountability would suffice. By the grace of God, they agreed to watch over each other in love. Q: WHY JOIN A COVENANT DISCIPLESHIP GROUP? A: By joining with other Christians in a weekly meeting, members of Covenant Discipleship Groups learn to center their lives on Jesus Christ by following his teachings and supporting one another in living out the basics of Christian discipleship. Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IN A COVENANT DISCIPLESHIP GROUP? A: You will become more aware of God's grace in your life. You will find new ways of serving God and your neighbor. You will find your understanding of God's will greatly enhanced. Q: How WILL THIS BOOK HELP ME? A: This handbook is primarily a practical reference manual for starting, developing, sustaining, and incorporating Covenant Discipleship Groups into the mission and ministry of the church.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sgRNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alien Encounters","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=695PDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iridology Flashcards / Tarjetas de Iridologa","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scoliosis: Correction Without Braces or Surgery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=amtsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Scoliosis:+Correction+Without+Braces+or+Surgery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harold y el Lapiz Color Morado (Harold and the Purple Crayon)","description":"Una noche, Harold decide dar un paseo a la luz de la luna.

He is not afraid to tackle the tough question: Does the image of God sacrificing Jesus on the cross contribute to abusive parent-child relationships?...If pastors and church officials read this book the church will change.\\" --Karen Lebacqz, Pacific School of Religion \\"For the exploitation of women and children to stop, men must be willing to break ranks with all forms of privilege that sanction male dominance. James Poling does so by deconstructing his own sense of male entitlement, by refusing to distance himself from perpetrators, by allowing survivors of sexual and domestic violence to speak with their own voices, by giving us profound words of hope, and by articulating a powerfully healing theology wrought through the depths of his own struggle with one of the worst evils in our society. His courageous and compassionate work reveals the love and hope that is born of solidarity across the boundaries of gender, sexual orientation, race, and economics....The psychological, political, spiritual, and theological power of this book is such that all educators, ministers, therapists, and Christians must read it.\\" --Rita Nakashima Brock, Hamline University Chapter titles are: 1.

Comprising a number of often secret but sometimes very influential religious groups in the West and in the Islamic world, it affected mainstream and radical politics in Europe and the development of the field of religious studies in the United States, touching the lives of many individuals. French writer Rene Guenon rejected modernity as a dark age and sought to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy - the central truths behind all the major world religions. Guenon stressed the urgent need for the West's remaining spiritual and intellectual elite to find personal and collective salvation in the surviving vestiges of ancient religious traditions. A number of disenchanted intellectuals responded to his call. In Europe, America, and the Islamic world, Traditionalists founded institutes, Sufi brotherhoods, Masonic lodges, and secret societies. Some attempted unsuccessfully to guide Fascism and Nazism along Traditionalist lines; others later participated in political terror in Italy. Traditionalist ideas were the ideological cement for the alliance of anti-democratic forces in post-Soviet Russia, and in the Islamic world entered the debate about the relationship between Islam and modernity. Although its appeal in the West was ultimately limited, Traditionalism has wielded enormous influence in religious studies, through the work of such Traditionalists as Ananda Coomaraswamy, Huston Smith, Mircea Eliade, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbARDAAAQBAJ&dq=Against+the+Modern+World:+Traditionalism+and+the+Secret+Intellectual+History+of+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The invisible Vazimba","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iDTYGwAACAAJ&dq=The+invisible+Vazimba&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Geology and Mineralogy","description":"Derived from the content of the respected McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, Sixth Edition, each title provides thousands of definitions of words and phrases encountered in a specific discipline.

When was it that the sense of trouble grew to fear, the fear to certainty? When she sat down to another solitary supper of bread and beer and picked cucumber? When she heard the second sounding of the geese? Or had she known that morning when she stepped outside and felt the wind? Might as well say she knew it when Edward took his first whaling trip to the Canada River, or when they married, or when, as a young girl, she stood on the beach and watched Edward bring about his father s boat in the Point of Rock Channel. Whatever its begetting, when Edward s cousin Shubael Hopkins and his wife Betsey came through the door, they brought her no new grief, but an old acquaintance.  When Lyddie Berry s husband is lost in a storm at sea, she finds that her status as a widow is vastly changed from that of respectable married woman. Now she is the  dependent  of her nearest male relative her son-in-law. Refusing to bow to societal pressure that demands she cede everything that she and her husband worked for, Lyddie becomes an outcast from family, friends, and neighbors yet ultimately discovers a deeper sense of self and, unexpectedly, love. Evocative and stunningly assured, The Widow s War is an unforgettable work of literary magic, a spellbinding tale from a gifted talent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=npML0LWlQd8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Kith--kin\\" of Samuel Burdine Dunahay and Angel Carothers: A short history and genealogy of this Scotch-Irish family and showing the migration of our ... on the 110th anniversary of their marriage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JUAkHAAACAAJ&dq=%22Kith--kin%22+of+Samuel+Burdine+Dunahay+and+Angel+Carothers:+A+short+history+and+genealogy+of+this+Scotch-Irish+family+and+showing+the+migration+of+our+...+on+the+110th+anniversary+of+their+marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salud: A Latina's Guide to Total Health","description":"Offers information and advice on the specific medical issues and concerns of Hispanic women, including the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cervical cancer, depression, and hypertension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JfbOj5vU0IsC&dq=Salud:+A+Latina%27s+Guide+to+Total+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Securing Linux: A Survival Guide for Linux Security","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-1DrjwEACAAJ&dq=Securing+Linux:+A+Survival+Guide+for+Linux+Security&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microwave Semiconductor Devices (The International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","description":"We have reached the double conclusion: that invention is choice, that this choice is imperatively governed by the sense of scientific beauty. Hadamard (1945), Princeton University Press, by permission. The great majority of all sources and amplifiers of microwave energy, and all devices for receiving or detecting microwaves, use a semiconductor active element. The development of microwave semiconductor devices, de scribed in this book, has proceeded from the simpler, two-terminal, devices such as GUNN or IMPATT devices, which originated in the 1960s, to the sophisticated monolithic circuit MESFET three-terminal active elements, of the 1980s and 1990s. The microwave field has experienced a renais sance in electrical engineering departments in the last few years, and much of this growth has been associated with microwave semiconductor devices. The University of Massachusetts has recently developed a well recognized program in microwave engineering. Much of the momentum for this pro gram has been provided by interaction with industrial companies, and the influx of a large number of industry-supported students. This program had a need for a course in microwave semiconductor devices, which covered the physical aspects, as well as the aspects of interest to the engineer who incorporates such devices in his designs. It was also felt that it would be im portant to introduce the most recently developed devices (HFETs, HBTs, and other advanced devices) as early as possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GS7nBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Novels and Short Stories of E.

Drawing on a wide range of international scholarship in feminist theory, women's and gender history, and cultural studies, Cecilia Morgan analyses political and religious languages in the Upper Canadian press, both secular and religious, and other material published in the colony from the 1790s to the 1850s. She examines constructs and concepts of gender in a wide number of areas: narratives of the War of 1812, political struggles over responsible government in the 1820s and 1830s, evangelical religious discourses throughout these decades, and related discussions of manners and moral behaviour. She also considers the relations between religion and politics in the 1840s, pointing to the continuous struggles of Upper Canadians to define and fix the meanings of public and private and their use of masculinity and femininity to signify these realms. She suggests as well that scholars of gender and colonial history need to consider a more nuanced way of understanding social formation in the colony through an examination of the representation of voluntary organizations. The book also examines relations of gender, class, and race as they affected the cultural development of the middle class.\\" \\"Morgan concludes that while seemingly hegemonic definitions of gender relations emerged over this period - with men and masculinity identified with politics and loyalty to the colonial state and imperial connection, and women and femininity linked to the home - the meanings of gender and gendered imagery differed according to their contexts. Colonial society's attempts to make sharp delineations between the public and the private were rarely successful and were marked by numerous tensions and contradictions.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In this intervention, Fredric Jameson perhaps the most influential and persuasive theorist of postmodernity excavates and explores these notions in a fresh and illuminating manner. The extraordinary revival of discussions of modernity, as well as of new theories of artistic modernism, demands attention in its own right. It seems clear that the (provisional) disappearance of alternatives to capitalism plays its part in the universal attempt to revive  modernity  as a social ideal. Yet the paradoxes of the concept illustrate its legitimate history and suggest some rules for avoiding its misuse as well. In this major interpretation of the problematic, Jameson concludes that both concepts are tainted, but nonetheless yield clues as to the nature of the phenomena they purported to theorize. His judicious and vigilant probing of both terms which can probably not be banished at this late date helps us clarify our present political and artistic situations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yb5NBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect Daughters","description":"This new edition of Perfect Daughters, a pivotal book in the ACoA movement, identifies what differentiates the adult daughters of alcoholics from other women.

Missing Links is the story of four middle class buddies who live outside of Boston and for years have been 1) utterly obsessed with golf and 2) a regular foursome at Ponkaquoque Municipal Course and Deli, not so fondly known as Ponky, the single worst golf course in America. Just adjacent to these municipal links lies the Mayflower Country Club, the most exclusive private course in all of Boston and a major needle in their collective sides. Frustrated by the Mayflower's finely manicured greens and snooty members, three of Ponky's finest and most courageous Two Down, Dannie, and Stick set up a bet: $1,000.00 apiece, and the first man to somehow finagle his way on to the Mayflower course takes all. Lying, cheating, and forgery are encouraged, to put it mildly, and with the constant heckling and rare aid of Chunkin' Charlie, Hoover, and Bluto--a few more of Ponky's elite--the games begin. One of the three will eventually play the Mayflower's course, but their friendships--and everything else--will change as various truths unravel and the old Ponky starts looking like the home they never should have left.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zDUXSWgy-YIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith Fox: A Novel","description":"A novel that s  brilliant on sex, brilliant on bereavement and death, brilliant on god, brilliant on dottiness  from the acclaimed author of Old Filth (A. N. Wilson, Evening Standard). The story of a motherless girl named Faith and her family and close friends, all of whom are determined to see her live a happy life. Faith s mother died in childbirth; her overworked father cannot raise his child alone; and her unconventional grandmother refuses to acknowledge the child whose birth took away the daughter she loved. And so a motley crew of family and friends converges to see that Faith is brought up correctly. The concerned parties include Faith s uncle, who runs a commune in northern England; the Tibetan refugees who have moved in with him; and the splendidly bickering paternal grandparents.

A man whose presidency was disgraced by impeachment -- yet who remains one of the most popular presidents of our time. A man whose autobiography, My Life, was panned by critics as a self-indulgent daily diary -- but rode the bestseller lists for months. A man whose policies changed America at the close of the twentieth century -- yet whose weakness left us vulnerable to terror at the dawn of the twenty-first. No one better understands the inner Bill Clinton, that creature of endless and vexing contradiction, than Dick Morris. From the Arkansas governor's races through the planning of the triumphant 1996 reelection, Morris was Clinton's most valued political adviser. Now, in the wake of Clinton's million-selling memoir My Life, Morris and his wife, Eileen McGann, set the record straight with Because He Could, a frank and perceptive deconstruction of the story Clinton tells -- and the many more revealing stories he leaves untold. With the same keen insight they brought to Hillary Clinton's life in their recent bestseller Rewriting History, Morris and McGann uncover the hidden sides of the complicated and sometimes dysfunctional former president. Whereas Hillary is anxious to mask who she really is, they show, Bill Clinton inadvertently reveals himself at every turn -- as both brilliant and undisciplined, charming yet often filled with rage, willing to take wild risks in his personal life but deeply reluctant to use the military to protect our national security. The Bill Clinton who emerges is familiar -- reflexively blaming every problem on right-wing persecutors or na?ve advisers -- but also surprising: passive, reactive, working desperately to solve a laundry list of social problems yet never truly grasping the real thrust of his own presidency. And while he courted danger in his personal life, the authors argue that Clinton's downfall has far less to do with his private demons than with his fear of the one person who controlled his future: his own first lady. Sharp and stylishly written, full of revealing insider anecdotes, Because He Could is a fresh and probing portrait of one of the most fascinating, and polarizing, figures of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kxsfBPZIv3AC&dq=Because+He+Could&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cult of the Virgin Mary: Psychological Origins","description":"Tracing devotion to Mary to psychological and historical processes that began in the fifth century, Michael Carroll answers intriguing questions: What explains the many reports of Marian apparitions over the centuries?

Today, under the leadership of George W. Bush, the main tool of foreign policy is military force, not diplomacy. America is going it alone, and paying the price, both abroad and at home.In this comprehensive critique of the Bush administration's handling of international relations, Craig R. Eisendrath and Melvin A. Goodman, both senior fellows at the Center for International Policy, demonstrate the folly and the dangers of abandoning diplomacy and relying on military force as the chief means of conducting U.S. foreign policy. The authors argue that a policy of bullying will sow seeds of resentment and mistrust among our potential allies and encourage nations hostile to our interests to seek nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction as a last-resort method of protecting themselves against a belligerent world power. Eisendrath and Goodman foresee the international community becoming dangerously unstable, not more secure, under a Pax Americana maintained by military might.On the domestic front, the authors warn that a policy emphasizing the power of the executive branch at the expense of Congress, and suspending long-standing civil rights under the pretext of national security, threatens the Constitution. Finally, the economic effect of huge military expenditures financed by deficit spending has the potential of eroding domestic tranquility for decades.This trenchant review by two experienced foreign policy analysts will serve as a wake-up call to the dangerous militarism at the heart of the Bush agenda.Craig Eisendrath (Philadelphia, PA), a former diplomat, is a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, D.C.; an adjunct professor a Temple University; the author (with Melvin A.

The principles of national education are discussed, along with the contribution of education to economic development. Comprised of eight chapters, this book begins with a historical background on Japanese education from early times to about 1950. The next chapter explains the establishment of statutory principles of national education in Japan in a historical and socio-political context, and examines the problems connected with the aims of national education which have been under the influence of statutory provisions and various other factors in Japanese society. The question of controlling national education in Japan is then considered, paying particular attention to the machinery for policy formation in national education; the systems of educational administration both at the central and local levels; and the dispute arising from the centralization of the control of national education. The book concludes by assessing future prospects for Japanese education, including planning, implementing, and financing educational reform.

It is intended not only for the beginner, but also for the more advanced student looking for some relief from the constant frustration of forgetting how to write the kanji, or for a way to systematize what he or she already knows. The author begins with writing the kanji because--contrary to first impressions-it is in fact simpler than learning how to the pronounce them. By ordering the kanji according to their component parts or \\"primitive elements,\\" and then assigning each of these parts a distinct meaning with its own distinct image, the student is led to harness the powers of \\"imaginative memory\\" to learn the various combinations that make up the kanji. In addition, each kanji is given its own key word to represent the meaning, or one of the principal meanings, of that character. These key words provide the setting for a particular kanji's \\"story,\\" whose protagonists are the primitive elements. In this way, one is able to complete in a few short months a task that would otherwise take years. Armed with the same skills as Chinese or Korean students, who know the meaning and writing of the kanji but not their Japanese pronunciations, one is then in a much better position to learn the readings (which are treated in a separate volume).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ymF0MAEACAAJ&dq=Remembering+the+Kanji+III:+Writing+and+Reading+Japanese+Characters+for+Upper-Level+Proficiency+(v.+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Clan Campbell","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K5oWAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Clan+Campbell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Minitutorial - Hop, Skip & Jump into Minicad: For Version 6","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zz91twAACAAJ&dq=The+Minitutorial+-+Hop,+Skip&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Easy Guide to Factor Analysis","description":"Factor analysis is a statistical technique widely used in psychology and the social sciences.

Investigates many infamous occult personalities, including Helena Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, the Marquis de Sade, and Anton LaVey ? Explains the true difference between the right-hand path and the left-hand path--union with and dependence on God versus individual freedom and self-empowerment From black magic and Satanism to Gnostic sects and Gurdjieff s Fourth Way, the left-hand path has been linked to many practices, cults, and individuals across the ages. Stephen Flowers, Ph.D., examines the methods, teachings, and historical role of the left-hand path, from its origins in Indian tantric philosophy to its underlying influence in current world affairs, and reveals which philosophers, magicians, and occult figures throughout history can truly be called  Lords of the Left-Hand Path.  Flowers explains that while the right-hand path seeks union with and thus dependence on God, the left-hand path seeks a  higher law  based on knowledge and power. It is the way of self-empowerment and true freedom. Beginning with ancient Hindu and Buddhist sects and moving Westward, he examines many alleged left-hand path groups, including the Cult of Set, the Yezidi Devil Worshippers, the Assassins, the Neoplatonists, the Hell-Fire Club, the Bolsheviks, the occult Nazis, and several heretical Sufi, Zoroastrian, Christian, and Muslim sects. Following a carefully crafted definition of a true adherent of the left-hand path based on two main principles--self-deification and challenge to the conventions of  good  and  evil --the author analyzes many famous and infamous personalities, including H. P. Blavatsky, Faust, the Marquis de Sade, Austin Osman Spare, Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, Anton LaVey, and Michael Aquino, and reveals which occult masters were Lords of the Left-Hand Path. Flowers shows that the left-hand path is not inherently evil but part of our heritage and our deep-seated desire to be free, independent, and in control of our destinies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uQvaXwAACAAJ&dq=Cult+Of+The+Right+Hand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Telling on myself","description":"What do you do when you have struggled loyally for years beside your husband, living in financial hardship as you bring up your joint children virtually as a single mother, working toward the good times that you can see coming for all of you, only to discover that your husband is committing adultery and is planning to leave you? Worse, he aggressively denies his affair, denouncing you as crazy to your face and to everyone you know, while he schemes to walk off with everything you have worked so hard for as he is reborn into a new life with a star-struck younger woman, as pretty as you once were, who will enjoy everything you have invested in - your financial security, your home-life and even your children. Worse still, he is a notoriously hard-ball lawyer with every intention of crushing you in any way he can, of erasing you from his life, of reducing you to nothing, so that he can move on as if you never existed. Daniel T. Broderick III's relentless harassment of his discarded wife, Betty, made her increasingly crazy as he and his girlfriend - then second wife - Linda Kolkena Broderick piled on the pressure, until one day, on November 5, 1989, at her wits' end and believing herself to be acting in self-defense, she confronted them in the early hours of the morning and in a panic shot them both dead. A multitude of onlookers has absolved Betty for what she did. Many even admire her, especially if they have suffered similar fates to hers. One juror at her trial openly questioned why she had taken so long to kill Dan under such extreme provocation. Now, twenty-five years into a thirty-two year to life prison sentence for her second-degree murder of Dan and Linda Broderick, Betty has reluctantly decided to give her personal account of what led up to that fatal and fateful day, when all three of their futures came violently and abruptly to an end.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=My86rgEACAAJ&dq=Telling+on+myself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Drawings of Rembrandt (Master Draughtsman Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfpStAEACAAJ&dq=The+Drawings+of+Rembrandt+(Master+Draughtsman+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Jews in Babylonia: From Shapur I to Shapur II (Studia Post Biblica - Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism , No 12, Part 3)","description":"This book examines the talmudic writings, politics, and ideology of Y.I.

In a journey of self-transformation and love, Father Borrelli befriends the street children and sets up a support network for them: The House of the Urchins. Morris West spent time in the slums of impoverished postwar Naples.

By the time of her death at the age of seventy in 1603, she was being heralded as rival to the Virgin Mary, as a second Queen of Earth and Heaven, as a woman more than mortal women.

Not long before he composed the Declaration of Independence, the young Jefferson lay for six weeks in idleness and ill health at Monticello, paralyzed by a mysterious \\"malady.\\" Similar lapses were to recur during anxious periods in his life, often accompanied by violent headaches. In Jefferson's Demons, Michael Knox Beran illuminates an optimistic man's darker side -- Jefferson as we have rarely seen him before. The worst of these moments came after his wife died in 1782. But two years later, after being dispatched to Europe, Jefferson recovered nerve and spirit in the salons of Paris, where he fell in love with a beautiful young artist, Maria Cosway. When their affair ended, Jefferson's health again broke down. He set out for the palms and temples of southern Europe, and though he did not know where the therapeutic journey would take him or where it would end, his encounter with the old civilizations of the Mediterranean was transformative. The Greeks and Romans taught him that a man could make productive use of his demons. Jefferson's immersion in the mystic truths of the Old World gave him insights into mysteries of life and art that Enlightenment philosophy had failed to supply. Beran skillfully shows how Jefferson drew on the esoteric lore he encountered to transform anxiety into action. On his return to America, Jefferson entered the most productive period of his life: He created a new political party, was elected president, and doubled the size of the country. His private labors were no less momentous...among them, the artistry of Monticello and the University of Virginia. Jefferson's Demons is an elegantly composed account of the strangeness and originality of one Founder's genius. Michael Knox Beran uncovers the maps Jefferson used to find his way out of dejection and to forge a new democratic culture for America. Here is a Jefferson who, with all his failings, remains one of his country's greatest teachers and prophets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UijPbklJrt4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Girls","description":"Getting over Your Vampire Ex is as Easy as Killing Him and Stealing His Girlfriend Holly Liddell has been stuck with crimped hair since 1987 when she agreed to let her boyfriend, Elton, turn her into a vampire.

The nation's armed forces seized political power that same year and continued to rule until the reestablishment of democratic pluralist government in 1979. In this book, John D. Martz probes the differences and similarities between military authoritarianism and democratic pluralism through an analysis of the politics of petroleum in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian experience provides an ideal laboratory to test the policymaking characteristics and the overall performances of the two regimes ideal-types. Martz uses a textured and detailed analysis of global oil companies and nationalist politics to trace the growth and evolution of Ecuador's petroleum industry. The course of partisan and sectoral politics and the internal workings of military politics are also examined. Against this interplay of politics and the nationalistic struggle against multinational pressures, Martz compares policymaking under military and civilian government. John D. Martz is a professor of political science at Pennsylvania State University. He is the author and editor of more than a dozen books on Latin American politics and was the editor of the Latin American Research Review from 1975 to 1980.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e0uINRLPjXsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Reigns","description":"Four Reigns (Sri Phaendin), M.R. Kukrit s longest and best-known novel, is the rich and entertaining story of the life of Phloi and her family, both inside and outside palace walls. The story unfolds during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (King Rama V) in the closing years of the 1800s, ending in the mid 1940s with the death of his grandson, King Ananda Mahidol (King Rama VIII). Over a span of four reigns, we see the lives of minor courtiers under the absolute monarchy and watch the huge social and political changes that Thailand experienced as it opened itself up to international contact. We follow the characters against the historical backdrops of the 1932 revolution, the new constitutional monarchy, the growing Japanese presence in Thailand, the outbreak of World War II, and the Allied bombing raids on Bangkok. Through the lives and relationships of Phloi and her husband and children, we experience modern Thai history in an intimate and personal way, garnering new insights into the sensibilities of an era. Four Reigns was originally written in 1953 as a newspaper serial in the Thai daily, Siam Rath, as were M.R. Kukrit s other popular novels, including Phai Daeng (1954) (Red Bamboo), and Lai Chiwit (1954) (Many Lives). This is a new version of the original 1981 translation by Tulachandra.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-cIIBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faux Bubba: Bill and Hillary Go to Washington","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cpzSDQAAQBAJ&dq=Faux+Bubba:+Bill+and+Hillary+Go+to+Washington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eco-Renovation: The Ecological Home Improvement Guide","description":"Eco-Renovation, published by Chelsea Green's U.K. Green Books, is organized under four main heading energy, health, and materials.
