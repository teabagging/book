Albert C. Wedemeyer, the principal author of the Victory Plan. In just forty-eight months America raised and equipped a modern army seemingly overnight, a feat that owed much to sound military planning. As Wedemeyer makes clear, mobilization transcends purely military matters and must be understood to embrace the capacity of nations. His work underscores the fact that even in 1941 warfare had become so vast in scope, so expensive, and so technologically complex that nations could never again afford to maintain in time of peace the armies needed in time of war. The conclusion seems inescapable: The United States Army must keep mobilization planning at the center of all its military planning. Military planners and all those studying mobilization and logistics will benefit from processes Wedemeyer and his colleagues used in reaching their decisions on the units and material needed. The Victory Plan provides a clear picture of how they approached the challenge of preparing for modern war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=epL_jgEACAAJ&dq=An+Unknown+Future+and+A+Doubtful+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye and brain: The psychology of seeing (World university library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nUxnAQAACAAJ&dq=Eye+and+brain:+The+psychology+of+seeing+(World+university+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and legends of the old plantation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4brUxQEACAAJ&dq=Nights+with+Uncle+Remus:+Myths+and+legends+of+the+old+plantation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead And Buried: A Shocking Account of Rape, Torture, and Murder on the California Coast","description":"The harrowing true story of California serial rapist and murderer Rex Allan Krebs who, after serving only half of a 20-year sentence for raping two young woman, brutally raped and murdered two more victims. of photos.

The work narrates a linear history of pre-Saxon Britain, from its founding by Trojan exiles to the loss of native British (Celtic) sovereignty in the face of Germanic invaders. Along the way, Geoffrey introduces readers to such familiar figures as King Lear, Cymbeline, Vortigern, the prophet Merlin, and a host of others. Most importantly, he provides the first birth-to-death account of the life of King Arthur. His focus on that king s reign sparked the vogue for Arthurian romance throughout medieval Europe that has continued into the twenty-first century. This new translation is the first in over forty years and the first to be based on the Bern manuscript, now considered the authoritative Latin text. It is accompanied by an introduction that highlights the significance of Geoffrey s work in his own day and focuses in particular on the ambiguous status of the text between history and fiction. Appendices include historical sources, early responses to the History, and other medieval writings on King Arthur and Merlin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MBNbDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+History+of+the+Kings+of+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Song of the Siren: Tales of Rhythm and Revolution","description":"Poems deal with family life, discrimination, religion, food, tradition, human sexuality, robots, and language","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SWgfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Song+of+the+Siren:+Tales+of+Rhythm+and+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"True to Life Elementary Class book: English for Adult Learners","description":"True to Life is a five level course designed specifically for adult learners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_CO4Xu-O5DYC&dq=True+to+Life+Elementary+Class+book:+English+for+Adult+Learners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ABC Murders","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Joseph Smith (Penguin Lives Biographies)","description":"Chronicles the life of the founder of the Mormon Church from his birth in 1805, through the visions he started receiving at age fourteen, to his assassination in 1844.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u3nzkbb2ha8C&dq=Joseph+Smith+(Penguin+Lives+Biographies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes on weaving techniques","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DMTXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Notes+on+weaving+techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and epistles of St. Paul","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h7kWAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Billy Graham Christian Worker's Handbook: A Topical Guide With Biblical Answers to the Urgent Concerns of Our Day","description":"Written for those who telephone-counsel people with special needs like Loss of Employment, Loneliness, Winning parents to Christ, AIDS, Anger and Cults.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OGAFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Billy+Graham+Christian+Worker%27s+Handbook:+A+Topical+Guide+With+Biblical+Answers+to+the+Urgent+Concerns+of+Our+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trixie Belden and the Mysterious Code","description":"Principal Stratton wants to get rid of all clubs in Sleepyside High School, including the Bob-Whites!

An honest sturdy young officer and a decent pretty girl get to know each other on an excursion. Unconsciously they drift into a relation where heart meets heart, the breaking of which causes the deepest pain. But both see clearly from the beginning that there is no other end. For they know that the world is stronger than the individual, and the many small moments than the one supreme. They know it, for they are, like their creator, resigned realists. They shut their eyes only in order not to see the end too near. (Richard M. Meyer)---The interest of Fontane's novels lies rather in character than in action. While he portrays many types characteristic of Berlin and the surrounding region, and is very successful in rendering local color and the atmosphere of the particular circle described in each book, his penetration into universal human nature is sufficiently deep to raise him far above provincialism. His effort is to represent people vividly and naturally in their normal relations, not to strain after sensational or even dramatic situations. \\"Trials and Tribulations\\" (\\"Irrungen Wirrungen\\", 1887) gives an excellent idea of his power. In a gently moving story, told without the forcing of emotion or the contriving of exciting scenes, he deals with the pathos of the relation between a man and a woman, alike in an attractive simplicity of character, but forced apart by difference of rank. The situation is laid before us without expressed censure or protest, and is allowed to have its effect by the sober truth of its presentation. Fontane's is an honest and sincere art, none the less great because unpretentious.

Evolving out of the terse and violent hardboiled style of the pulp magazines, noir fiction expanded over the decades into a varied and innovative body of writing. Tapping deep roots in the American literary imagination, the novels in this volume explore themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsessive passion, murder, and the disintegrating psyche. With visionary and often subversive force they create a dark and violent mythology out of the most commonplace elements of modern life.

Deliberately focusing on Business patterns, Integration patterns, and Application patterns, the authors share with you proven architectural patterns that can help get you up and running quickly, while at the same time reducing your risks. Because today's economy demands that e-business initiatives emphasize profitability and return on investment, the authors also offer guidance on methods to minimize cost, yet ensure quality. Many e-business applications and initiatives fail because of the lack of a comprehensive look at e-business architectures. For example, the recent crashes of many e-business applications costing millions of dollars could have been avoided if all aspects of operational issues had been addressed properly.

With particular focus on Plato, this book is an in-depth study of the contentious dialogue in classical political philosophy. In the late archaic and classical periods, two major traditions of philosophical and political thought developed. One tradition was associated with the Presocratic mechanistic materialistic philosophers and the Sophists. The second tradition, beginning with Pythagoras, gained full expression in the collected dialogues of Plato. Both of these philosophic traditions challenged the long established Greek mythico/religious tradition associated with Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and others. This study examines the dynamic dialogue involving these three traditions, which present competing and conflicting world views. It concludes that Plato's dialogues, taken together, quintessentially embody the mainstream dialogue or trialogue, as it could be called, in Greek political thought. This book also makes the case that the three major traditions of Greek political thought set the stage for the future dialogue of Western political philosophy even to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROwGV92D63IC&dq=Socrates+(Doubleday+anchor+book+A+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boeing 707 & 720: A Pictorial History","description":"The Boeing 707 family - that includes the forerunner Model 367-80, the KC-135 series of military transports and the slightly smaller Model 720 - was the pioneer of the sweptback wing, incorporating podded engines borrowed from the B-47 military bomber.

Who Gets the Past? is one of the first studies of this phenomenon in another arena. In the Middle Volga region of Russia, the intellectuals of two ethnic groups are engaged in a protracted competition for the right to claim descent from various ancestries, most dating back to the first millennium A.D. Archeologists from both the Chuvash and the Tatar ethnic groups are attempting to present evidence connecting the groups with Turkic-speakers, Finnish-Ugric groups, Bulgars, or Sarmatians. At stake, according to Victor Shnirelman, are both territorial and political advantages. Who Gets the Past? tells how and why, from the Stalinist period to the present, these intellectuals have made different, sometimes self-contradictory, claims on the past. The Soviet legacy of reinforcing and politicizing ethnic identities is largely responsible for the original extent of the competition, according to Shnirelman. But the importance of ethnic claims since the Soviet breakup has only contributed to its persistence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8amsdEC&dq=Who+Gets+the+Past%3F:+Competition+for+Ancestors+among+Non-Russian+Intellectuals+in+Russia+(Woodrow+Wilson+Center+Press)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haiku People: Big And Small In Poems And Prints","description":"Some 120 haiku by such masters as Basho, Issa, and Buson--all written on themes of people of various shapes and sizes, young and old--are combined with the woodblock prints and paintings of the great artists of classical Japan.

Atherton s reminiscences and instructions are complemented by his exquisite sketches of tools and scenes from the angler s life. The author s wife, artist Maxine Atherton, notes in her introduction that in addition to his skills as an accomplished artist and fine sportsman John Atherton was a romantic realist, whose exuberant outbursts of wonder over natural phenomena celebrated our planet s everyday magic. Indeed, Atherton s work was featured in the Museum of Modern Art s 1943 exhibition of American Realists and Magic Realists. On a more practical note, Maxine Atherton adds that the Impressionistic fly patterns such as those featured in this book have worked wonders for her fishing, fooling trout in rivers throughout North America and Europe. Skyhorse Publishing is proud to publish a broad range of books for fishermen. Our books for anglers include titles that focus on fly fishing, bait fishing, fly-casting, spin casting, deep sea fishing, and surf fishing. Our books offer both practical advice on tackle, techniques, knots, and more, as well as lyrical prose on fishing for bass, trout, salmon, crappie, baitfish, catfish, and more.

The contributors are drawn from a range of backgrounds and a variety of interests--Jewish, Christian, agnostic, male, female, heterosexual, gay and lesbian--and mostly concentrate on individual passages and books. But the volume also contains some theoretical reflections, and it ends with three +critical responses' from scholars with interdisciplinary interests on the place of queer read-ing of the Bible in broader contexts.

They go in a pub and beat up three of four blokes, stamp on them. But the average pub fight lasts ten seconds. When you get in the ring, you're cold. You're not mad. Your body is playing terrible tricks on you. Being in the ring is the hardest thing you'll ever do. Unlicensed fighting is the raw flipside of boxing. A few men make what they call easy money, but for many the unlicensed game becomes a nightmare of pain and fear. Watching fights that run the gamut from 'backroom jobs' - encounters of uncut street violence - to fully promoted cards with referees and judges, THE UNLICENSED: RANDOM NOTES FROM BOXING'S UNDREBELLY journeys into the margins of contemporary Britain to strip this world bare for the first time. From the remarkable John Barnwell, a veteran of 30 years of brutal contest around the world, to the fearsome and undefeated Billy Heaney, the street-fighting champion they call 'The Galway Bull', and many more, Jon Hoteen shares the lives and times of these hard men as they confide their vivid and extraordinary stories. In parts bleak, funny, shocking and uncompromising, THE UNLICENSED is above all unflinchingly honest about this secret underside of the fight game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BCYeAgAACAAJ&dq=Unlicensed:+Random+Notes+from+Boxing%27s+Underbelly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coherence in the Qur'an","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=86XSJnwdlT8C&dq=Coherence+in+the+Qur%27an&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The social stratification of English in New York City","description":"Second edition of William Labov's groundbreaking study, in which he looks back on forty years of achievements in sociolinguistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bJdKY0mZWzwC&dq=The+social+stratification+of+English+in+New+York+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Margins of Modernism: Decentering Literary Dynamics (Contraversions: Critical Studies in Jewish Literature, Culture, and Society)","description":"Modernism valorizes the marginal, the exile, the \\"other\\" yet we tend to use writing from the most commonly read European languages (English, French, German) as examples of this marginality. Chana Kronfeld counters these dominant models of marginality by looking instead at modernist poetry written in two decentered languages, Hebrew and Yiddish. What results is a bold new model of literary dynamics, one less tied to canonical norms, less limited geographically, and less in danger of universalizing the experience of minority writers. Kronfeld examines the interpenetrations of modernist groupings through examples of Hebrew and Yiddish poetry in Europe, the U.S., and Israel. Her discussions of Amichai, Fogel, Raab, Halpern, Markish, Hofshteyn, and Sutskever will be welcomed by students of modernism in general and Hebrew and Yiddish literatures in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kO2t7HYXuAoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meetings: Do's, Dont's and Donuts: The Complete Handbook for Successful Meetings","description":"The classic reference, updated to cover the Internet, new software applications, video conferencing and teleconferencing.

New material has been added regarding the death of the dollar, a nuclear Iran, and the rejection of Israel. Further, this New York Times best-selling author says the United States is heading into a  Perfect Storm.  Titanic. John F. Kennedy s assassination. 9/11. John Hagee maintains that these American tragedies all have one element in common: they were unthinkable. And in the opening pages of his newest book, Can America Survive? Hagee uses these tragedies to prove two points: that the unthinkable can happen and, given the right conditions, the unthinkable can quickly become the inevitable. In Can America Survive? Hagee asserts that the seeds for tragedy are once again being sown, evidenced by the disturbing economic, geopolitical, and religious trends that now threaten to dismantle the very nation itself.  Think it can t happen?  Hagee asks in a theme repeated throughout the book.  Think again.  Indeed, Hagee presents alarming examples of recent events, current research, scientific evidence, and biblical prophecy that are gathering to create a  perfect storm  that could bring down the  unsinkable  United States of America including: The U.S. s negligent handling of Israel, and history s evidence of the danger to any nation that challenges Israel s God-mandated right to exist The dangerous belittling of Iran s nuclear threat by careless spy agencies and the super-weapon that could stop the U.S. in its tracks instantly The chilling biblical prophecy that confirms Iran as one of six countries that will form an Islamic military force  as a cloud to cover the land  The real $2.5 trillion price tag of healthcare reform, the international currency shifts, and the national economic trends that are poised to bring about the death of the American dollar The criminalization of Christianity around the world; Can America Survive? is not just a warning. It is a wake-up call and a rallying cry to Christian citizens everywhere to prevent the next unthinkable American disaster. After all, as Hagee points out,  those who do not remember the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them in the future.  Think it can t happen? Think again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zzFbzzHj9rcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two on a tower (Thomas Hardy's works. The Wessex novels)","description":"Two on a Tower (1882) is a novel by English author Thomas Hardy, classified by him as a romance and fantasy and now regarded as one of his minor works. The book is one of Hardy's Wessex novels, set in a parallel version of late Victorian Dorset.Hardy placed an epigraph at the beginning of this book. The epigraph is from a Richard Crashaw poem, Love's Horoscope. It reads: \\"Ah, my heart her eyes and she Have taught thee new astrology. Howe'er Love's native hours were set, Whatever starry synod met, 'Tis in the mercy of her eye, If poor Love shall live or die.\\" Plot--Two On A Tower is a tale of star-crossed love in which Hardy sets the emotional lives of his two lovers against the background of the stellar universe. The unhappily married Lady Constantine breaks all the rules of social decorum when she falls in love with Swithin St. Cleeve, an astronomer who is ten years her junior. Her husband's death leaves the lovers free to marry, but the discovery of a legacy forces them apart. This is Hardy's most complete treatment of the theme of love across the class and age divide and the fullest expression of his fascination with science and astronomy. Background--In the 1895 preface Hardy wrote, \\"The scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the part of the country specified, each of which has a column standing upon it. Certain surrounding peculiarities have been imported into the narrative from both sites.\\" Wimborne was the location of the village of \\"Warborne,\\" and Charborough House was the location of the \\"Welland House\\" in Two on a Tower. Hardy's intention, in his own words, was to \\"set the emotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the stupendous background of the stellar universe.\\" Criticism--Because the book defied the social norms of the day, upon release the book was called shocking, repulsive, and one critic called it Hardy's \\"worst yet.\\"[4] Hardy's biographer, Claire Tomalin, says Hardy was \\"writing for serialization, which drove him to pack in far too much plot,\\" and he wrote too fast \\"without time to think or reconsider.\\" Hardy wrote in a letter to Edmund Gosse on 10 Dec 1882, \\"I get most extraordinary criticisms of T. on a T. Eminent critics write & tell me in private that it is the most original thing I have done...while other eminent critics (I wonder if they are the same) print the most cutting rebukes you can conceive-show me (to my amazement) that I am quite an immoral person......","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jtyrDAEACAAJ&dq=Two+on+a+tower+(Thomas+Hardy%27s+works.+The+Wessex+novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grunge the Movie Bootleg","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zkB2AAAACAAJ&dq=Grunge+the+Movie+Bootleg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prolo Your Pain Away: Curing Chronic Pain with Prolothereapy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k1-RAQAACAAJ&dq=Prolo+Your+Pain+Away:+Curing+Chronic+Pain+with+Prolothereapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reason Why.

Elected sheriff of Alameda County, California, in 1864, he went on to become San Francisco's foremost private detective. His career spanned five decades. In this biography, John Boessenecker brings Morse's now-forgotten story to light, chronicling not only the lawman's remarkable adventures but also the turbulent times in which he lived. Armed only with raw courage and a Colt revolver, Morse squared off against a small army of desperadoes and beat them at their own game. He shot to death the notorious bandidos Narato Ponce and Juan Soto, outgunned the vicious Narciso Bojorques, and pursued the Tiburcio Vasquez gang for two months in one of the West's longest and most tenacious manhunts. Later, Morse captured Black Bart, America's greatest stagecoach robber. Fortunately, Harry Morse loved to tell of his feats. Drawing on Morse's diaries, memoirs, and correspondence, Boessenecker weaves the lawman's colorful accounts into his narrative. Rare photographs of outlaws and lawmen and of the sites of Morse's exploits further enliven the story. A significant contribution to both western history and the history of law enforcement, Lawman is also an in-depth treatment of Hispanic crime and its causes, immigration, racial prejudice, and police brutality - issues with which California, and the nation, still grapple today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nC2HHRJcQJAC&dq=Lawman:+The+Life+and+Times+of+Harry+Morse,+1835-1912&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teora English-Romanian and Romanian-English Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EvoqwgEACAAJ&dq=Teora+English-Romanian+and+Romanian-English+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feng Shui in a Day (Just Try This)","description":"Just try these quick and easy fixes to get your home life in order!

When she fell in love with her brother s best friend, Rachel Starnes had no idea she was about to repeat a painful family pattern marrying a man who leaves regularly and for long stretches to work a dangerous job far from home. Through constant relocations, separations, and the crippling doubts of early parenthood, Starnes effortlessly weaves together strands from her past with the relentless pace of Navy life in a time of war. Searingly honest and emotionally unflinching and at times laugh out loud funny Starnes eloquently evokes the challenges she faces in trying to find and claim a sense of home while struggling to chart a new path and avoid passing on the same legacy to her two young sons. At once a portrait of the devastating strains that military life puts on families and a meditation on what it means to be left behind, The War at Home is a brave portrait of a modern military family and the realities of separation, endurance, and love that overcomes.  Rachel Starnes s The War at Home navigates the joys, fears, compromises, and casualties that create the terrain of marriage. And if you are a military spouse, her memoir will reveal thoughts you never even knew you had. This is a wise and fearless book.

This act brought to an end American military presence in the Philippines that extended back over 90 years. It also represented the final act in a drama that began with the initial rumblings in April of that year of the Mount Pinatubo volcano, located about 9 miles to the east of Clark. The following pages tell the remarkable story of the men and women of the Clark community and their ordeal in planning for and carrying out their evacuation from Clark in the face of impending volcanic activity. It documents the actions of those who remained on the base during a series of eruptions, and the packing out of the base during subsequent months. This is the story of the \\"Ash Warriors,\\" those Air Force men and women who carried out their mission in the face of an incredible series of natural disasters, including volcanic eruption, flood, typhoons, and earthquakes, all of which plagued Clark and the surrounding areas during June and July 1991. The author of \\"The Ash Warriors\\" knew the situation first hand. Colonel Dick Anderegg was the vice commander of the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing when the volcano erupted, and he was at Clark throughout the evacuation and standing down of the base. He brought his own personal experience to bear in writing this story. He also conducted extensive research in the archives of the Pacific Air Forces and Thirteenth Air Force, utilized scores of interviews of those who witnessed and participated in the events, and visited Clark in 1998 to see in person how the installation had changed in the 8 years since the Americans left. This story is one of courage, resourcefulness, and dedication to duty on the part of Air Force men and women called upon to respond to one of the great natural disasters of the 20th Century. As the following pages reveal, the Ash Warriors were up to the challenge in every respect.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RGvxjbWok4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consciously creating circumstances","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Armadale (Vol.8, Part 1)","description":"This eBook features the unabridged text of  Armadale by Wilkie Collins - Delphi Classics (Illustrated)  from the bestselling edition of  The Complete Works of Wilkie Collins .

It was the first war to be fought with modern weapons. The Japanese had fought the Chinese at sea in 1894 and had gained a foothold in Manchuria by taking control of Port Authur. In 1895, however, Japan was forced to abandon its claims by the Russian fleet's presence in the Straits of Tsushima. Tsar Nicholas had obtained a window to the East for his empire and Japan had been humiliated. Tensions between the two countries would rise inexorably over the next decade. Around the world, no one doubted that little Japan would be no match for the mighty armies of Tsar Nicholas II. Yet Russia was in an advanced state of decay, the government corrupt and its troops inept and demoralized. Japan, meanwhile, was emerging from centuries of feudal isolation and becoming an industrial power, led by zealous nationalist warlords keen to lead the Orient to victory over the oppressive West. From the opening surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Authur in 1904, the Japanese out-fought and out-thought the Russians. This is a definitive account of one of the pivotal conflicts of the twentieth century whose impact was felt around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-AE-xG7Z3gYC&dq=The+tide+at+sunrise%3B:+A+history+of+the+Russo-Japanese+War,+1904-1905,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feast of the Dead (Prose Series 39)","description":"Feast of the Dead explores the theme of isolation from both American society and the Italian culture of the first-generation immigrants who came to the United States.

The monks educate him and he is proved to be an excellent student, but he suffers from their cold and unfeeling ways. As a young man, Germain eventually takes his vows becoming a priest in the Catholic Church. He settles in a poor village with his faithful dog, Sultan, and it is here that he consoles the humble and oppressed-sometimes risking his life for their sake. As his reputation as a virtuous and holy man spreads, even royalty arrive for absolution of their crimes. Father Germain teaches love of the Creator and mankind with a belief that even the most hardened heart can be turned toward goodness. He exposes church hypocrisy and is persecuted by his superiors; yet he continues to teach according to his conscience.

She shows how each can enrich the other and how both are necessary to a fundamental theory of human cognition. Karmiloff-Smith shifts the focus from what cognitive science can offer the study of development to what a developmental perspective can offer cognitive science. In Beyond Modularity she treats cognitive development as a serious theoretical tool, presenting a coherent portrait of the flexibility and creativity of the human mind as it develops from infancy to middle childhood. Language, physics, mathematics, commonsense psychology, drawing, and writing are explored in terms of the relationship between the innate capacities of the human mind and subsequent representational change which allows for such flexibility and creativity. Karmiloff-Smith also takes up the issue of the extent to which development involves domain-specific versus domain-general processes. She concludes with discussions of nativism and domain specificity in relation to Piagetian theory and connectionism, and shows how a developmental perspective can pinpoint what is missing from connectionist models of the mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xhUll82paFYC&dq=Beyond+Modularity:+A+Developmental+Perspective+on+Cognitive+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ship and Aircraft Fairing and Development: For Draftsman and Loftsmen and Sheet Metal Workers","description":"Long regarded as a standard in its field, this book describes the principles of fairing, development, and layout by first introducing the fundamentals of these operations and then explaining how they are used to achieve a definite result.

Cooper argues that today's terrorists have a spiritual perversity that causes them to place greater significance on killing than on exploiting political grievances. He supports his assertion with an analysis of two groups that share the characteristics of a pneumopathological consciousness - Anum Shinrikyo, the terrorist organization that poisoned thousands of Tokyo subway riders in 1995, and Al-Qaeda, the group behind the infamous 9/11 killings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IeaEDwAAQBAJ&dq=New+Political+Religions,+or+an+Analysis+of+Modern+Terrorism+(ERIC+VOEGELIN+INST+SERIES)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cricket Umpiring & Scoring","description":"Tom Smith first wrote his guide for umpires and scorers in 1980. Since then, his indispensable guide has gone through six fully-revised editions. The 'new' Tom Smith is the first to be fully redesigned and updated for the 21st century. Its publication coincides with international recognition that there should be one universal standard for the training of umpires whatever country they operate in. The 'new' Tom Smith incorporates the full 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket with subsequent amendments as ratified by the MCC and international and national cricket bodies. The freshly drawn diagrams are easy to follow and will be of value not only to umpires and scorers, but to all lovers of the game of cricket. As Richie Benaud, the great Australian cricketer and commentator, has said, he never goes without his copy of 'Tom Smith'. Nor should any spectator who wishes to feel fully qualified in discussing the application of the Laws of Cricket to the game. David Lloyd says, 'Tom Smith is just as valuable a piece of kit as Hawkeye, Snicko and Hotspot in the Sky Sports commentary box, its interpretation of the Laws of the game is the first thing we turn to regarding decisions. it's a \\"must-have\\" alongside the Laws of cricket.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IPc0AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of Experimental Psychology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wQ67GAAACAAJ&dq=Elements+of+Experimental+Psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KAYAKS TO HELL","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zxgHAAAACAAJ&dq=KAYAKS+TO+HELL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flax the Super Food!: Over 80 Delicious Recipes Using Flax Oil and Ground Flaxseed","description":"ABOUT THIS BOOK...

I approached this writing from the perspective of an insider, so to speak, as I have worked extensively in the field of education, first as a high school teacher and now as a professor of education in a university. These essays were prompted by dissatisfaction and a desire. Increasingly over the last few years, I have felt uncomfortable with the conventional wisdom in my field about how students ought to be educated. It just didn't set right with me. Labels vary for the mainstream thinking in the profession, but let's call it a progressive or neo-Deweyian (after the philosopher John Dewey) approach. Some might refer to it simply as modern education. Even though its advocates marshal compelling arguments in support of this set of ideas and practices (what they are will be spelled out in the essays), I was finding in my work in schools that it wasn't getting good enough results with students in the classroom, and that in any case it simply didn't fit me as a person or as a professional: my values, my hopes for schools and students and this society. So I felt an inner push to find an educational orientation that I could believe in more than the one that currently dominates in the field of education to the point that it could be called an orthodoxy, or at least find something that complements it, adds to it. These essays represent the results of my quest. I have concluded that the philosophical orientations that we most need to affirm and employ as bases for constructing school programs in our time are the very ones which are most often dismissed by professional educators, namely, conservatism and individualism. In these essays, I go into the specifics of conservative and libertarian orientations to education, explore what all the talk about teaching democracy in the schools is about, contrast sports and schools as settings, and use the concept of personal authenticity in a discussion of the work of teaching. What holds these five essays together is that they all are grounded in a conservative rather than liberal and individual-centered rather than collectivist frame of reference. These essays are self-contained enough to be read out of order, although I did line them up in the way that I think best presents my argument. I hope what I offer here informs the debate in this country over the best route to take in educating our children. I wrote this book with both general readers and professional educators in mind. For general readers, I hope what is here will provide them with a better understanding of how professional educators come at their work, and thereby enable them to deal with school people more effectively and give them some things they can take into account when determining what ought to go on in their children's education, or in schools generally. For people in the profession who read this book--teachers and administrators, those in training to become teachers, and so on--I believe these writings will provide them with a clearer understanding of the predominant thinking in their field; a good way to understand anything is to compare it with something that contrasts with it. I would presume, and hope, that for some educators and educators-to-be this book will provide them with ideas they can use to guide their work. Much of what follows is expressed in the first person. I thought that if I brought myself into this book it would encourage readers to bring themselves into it. I would like readers to see these writings as my half of a conversation. I want them to respond critically to what I have written and extend it, take it farther than I have been able to--and I don't think they have to be active in the field of education to be able to do that. I want readers to decide how, if at all, what I write changes the way they look at things, and what they a","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pPIbG_3JvxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ask The Dust","description":"Ask the Dust is a virtuoso performance by an influential master of the twentieth-century American novel.

The advent of AIDS in the following decade, the widening spectrum of other newly-emergent diseases (from Ebola to Hanta virus), and the resurgence of old diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria all suggest that the threat of epidemic diseases remains at an historic high. The World Atlas of Epidemic Diseases provides a timely and scholarly review of over fifty of the most important such diseases at the start of the twenty-first century. This stunningly presented collection of maps, illustrations and commentary offers an authoritative overview of the global distribution of major epidemic diseases on a variety of spatial scales from the local to the global. The Atlas is arranged in an historical sequence, beginning with classic plagues such as the 'Black Death' and cholera and moving on through smallpox and measles to 'modern' diseases such as AIDS and Legionnaires' disease. Over 400 figures are incorporated, including 150 specially drawn maps supported by micrographs of the causative agents, photographs of the disease vectors, historical prints and graphs of changing incidence. The text for each disease includes discussion of its nature and epidemiological features, its origin (where known) and historical impacts, and its global status at the start of the twenty-first century. The book concludes with an informed look towards the future, assessing the probable impacts of major medical advances on life expectancy and the chances of success of programmes for the global eradication of diseases such as polio and measles. The World Atlas of Epidemic Diseases makes a major new contribution to our knowledge of the global burden of disease and is an informative and fascinating reference on the changing distributions of disease. It will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the spread, control and eradication of epidemic disease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yNVCiNnGVvsC&dq=World+Atlas+of+Epidemic+Diseases+(Arnold+Publication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Powder Mystery, The: A Problem in Deduction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oxw1AAAAMAAJ&dq=French+Powder+Mystery,+The:+A+Problem+in+Deduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Windsor Knot: Charles, Camilla and the Legacy of Diana (Pinnacle Biography)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Miniauto & Collectors 2002: Fiat Nuova 500, Dinky France 1400, Dugu, Edsel, News, Jaguar E Type, 40 Years (Italian Edition)","description":"Miniauto & Collectors number 10 contains a comprehensive section on Lancia, one of the most prestigious Italian car marques, in the form of the publication l s Profile column.

This codex is the oldest known complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible and was written in the early 10th century in Tiberias. The famous grammarian and scribe Aaron ben Asher inserted the vocalization signs, accentuation marks and the Masorah - a system of comments cross-referencing the spelling and the occurrence of particular words. Because he also proofread the manuscript several times over, it became the authoritative text due to its accepted accuracy. After a long odyssey the codex found its way to Jerusalem in 1958, with unfortunately a major portion missing. In 1976 a facsimile of the manuscript was published and inspired the book edition closely resembling the original text. Thanks to the painstaking work of the renowned Scholar Rabbi Mordechai Breuer, the lost parts - almost the entire Pentateuch - could be reconstructed. To emulate the original, the Jerusalem Crown is laid out in three columns and employs a unique typeface re-creating the calligraphy of the Aleppo Codex. The census for the chapters and verses as well as the names of the weekly torah portions and their divisions for the synagogal reading were added. A short appendix explains the principles of the text recreation and lists the deviations from the standard Leningrad Codex. Dr. Mordechai Glatzer, a globally recognized expert in the history of printing, edited the companion volume. It contains contributions on various aspects of the manuscript's significance and an in-depth description of its history. Notably, Dr. Yosef Ofer's introduction to the Masorah clarifies from where the codex's authority stems and why its text can be regarded as nearly error free. The prestigious Special Edition of the Keter Yerushalayim is limited to 480 hand-numbered, gilt-edged copies. They are bound in richly embossed and partially gold-tooled crimson leather, accompanied by the companion volume. History Aaron ben Moses ben Asher wrote the Aleppo Codex in the year 930 in the city of Tiberias. This codex consisted of 480 pages and contained all parts of the Old Testament, the 5 books of Moses (Torah), the prophets and the scriptures. The codex was stolen in the 11th century and brought to Egypt. It is believed that Maimonides copied from it in Cairo when he wrote his own Torah scroll. From Cairo the codex was moved to Aleppo in the 14th century where it remained in the Jewish community for more than 500 years. The community held the \\"keter\\" in very high esteem - there was a strong belief that the manuscript symbolized its well-being. When in 1947 anti-Jewish riots took place in Syria as a reaction to the United Nations resolution to divide Palestine and the synagogues in Aleppo were burnt, the manuscript was in great danger: Presumably damaged, it was hidden until it could be brought to Israel in 1958. Unfortunately, a considerable portion - almost the entire pentateuch - was missing, only 294 pages could be found. It is due to nearly 20 years of dedicated work by the renowned Scholar Rabbi Mordechai Breuer that the lost parts could be reconstructed. Today the codex itself can be found in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in the \\"Shrine of the Book\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvzYzQEACAAJ&dq=Jerusalem+Crown:+The+Bible+of+the+Hebrew+University+of+Jerusalem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House In My Head","description":"Dorothy Rogers, wife of Broadway composer Richard Rogers, describes the country house that she and her husband had custom-built in the Greenfield Hill section of Fairfield, Connecticut.

As an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, Elsey helped brief the president and his senior associates on war events. He and his map room colleagues acted as the secretariat for Roosevelt's cabled exchanges with Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin, and Chiang Kai-shek; filed records of \\"summit conferences\\"; and stored in safes plans for future operations. He also traveled with the president in order to code and decode the classified messages that flowed between the presidential train or ship and the White House. Elsey's duties continued with Harry Truman's succession to the presidency. He decoded the famous message from Secretary of War Henry Stimson reporting the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and carried it to President Truman. In 1947, he shed his Naval Reserve uniform and joined the White House's civilian staff as assistant to the special counsel to the president. In 1949, he became administrative assistant to the president, and, in 1952, he became a member of the Mutual Security Agency staff. During those years, he grew very close to Harry Truman, and thus, a major portion of An Unplanned Life relates to his experiences then. In the first postwar winter, Elsey was frequently the only staff member who accompanied President Truman on the USS Williamsburg. In September 1946, Elsey submitted a report to Truman on U.S.-Soviet relations, which came to be well known as the \\"Clifford-Elsey Report.\\" Providing Truman with notes for some two hundred of his \\"back-of-the-train\\" informal talks, Elsey played a part in the best remembered feature of the \\"Whistle-Stop Campaign\\" that resulted in \\"the political upset of the century.\\" In addition to his years at the White House, Elsey also touches on his post-White House years-his time in private industry, his months with Clark Clifford when Clifford was trying unsuccessfully to extricate America from Vietnam, and his long association with the American Red Cross. An Unplanned Life is a fascinating look at the life of an extraordinary individual who played an important and unprecedented part in two different presidents' decisions and affected the course of our nation. Anyone with an interest in history will find this memoir fascinating and invaluable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h-JxLijFM70C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mysterium Magnum, Part 1, or An Exposition of the First Book of Moses Called Genesis","description":"Jacob Boehme was born in 1575. He received little if any formal education and was apprenticed to a shoemaker at Goerlitz in Saxony. From an early age he seems to have been devoted to the study of the Bible as well as to have had a growing, inner, sense of the reality of God. Walking one day in the fields, when he was twenty-five years old, the mystery of creation was suddenly opened to him, of which he later said that \\"in one quarter of an hour I saw and knew more than if I had been many years at the university . . . and thereupon I turned my heart to praise God for it.\\" As experiences of this kind came more frequently, he puzzled much as to why such knowledge should be given to him, of all men, who sought only the love of God and was quite unlearned in the ordinary sense. Some ten years later he began to record what he received, as a help to his own memory, and thus was born The Aurora, his first book, finished in 1612. From then on he found both friends and enemies of his work. Due to persecution in his hometown, Boehme later settled in Dresden, where he died in 1624. Mysterium Magnum, written by Boehme the year before he died and at a time when his powers of expression had developed to their full, is perhaps central to his work in some thirty-one or thirty-two original volumes. Taking the general form of an interpretation of Genesis, it far outstrips such apparent confines, touching among other matters upon the meaning of the New Testament and, from the first sentence, leading to the heart of the universal experience of all mystics: When we consider the visible world with its essence, and consider the life of the creatures, then we find therein the likeness of the invisible, spiritual world, which is hidden in the visible world as the soul in the body; and we see thereby that the hidden God is nigh unto all and through all, and yet wholly hidden to the visible essence. Among those who have acknowledged the spiritual stature of Boehme are Hegel, William Law, St. Martin (le Philosophe Inconnu), Dean Inge, and Nicolas Berdyaev.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c0BLJwAACAAJ&dq=Mysterium+Magnum,+Part+1,+or+An+Exposition+of+the+First+Book+of+Moses+Called+Genesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nature of God: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (Problems of Philosophy)","description":"First published in 1995.

Grand Canyon river rats. . . Mormon archaeologists . . . Spelling bee prodigies . . . For more than fifteen years, best-selling author and historian Hampton Sides has traveled widely across the continent exploring the America that lurks just behind the scrim of our mainstream culture. Reporting for Outside, The New Yorker, and NPR, among other national media, the award-winning journalist has established a reputation not only as a wry observer of the contemporary American scene but also as one of our more inventive and versatile practitioners of narrative non-fiction. In these two dozen pieces, collected here for the first time, Sides gives us a fresh, alluring, and at times startling America brimming with fascinating subcultures and bizarre characters who could live nowhere else. Following Sides, we crash the redwood retreat of an apparent cabal of fabulously powerful military-industrialists, drop in on the Indy 500 of bass fishing, and join a giant techno-rave at the lip of the Grand Canyon. We meet a diverse gallery of American visionaries  from the impossibly perky founder of Tupperware to Indian radical Russell Means to skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. We retrace the route of the historic Bataan Death March with veterans from Sides  acclaimed WWII epic, Ghost Soldiers.

It is written in the spirit of communicology and cultural studies: that is, the ways that the products of human communication reveal specific \\"\\"structures\\"\\" of communication and consciousness are studied. These structures of communication reveal much about the way a culture is aware of the world. Rather than providing another interpretation of the meaning of music video, the author seeks instead to provide an explication of music video that is more concerned with what can be called their presentational value and ability to bring to expression, through technology, a cultural vision of human perceptual experience. Music video, it is argued, does not merely present itself, but makes present important aspects of communicative experience, embodiment, technology and the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XMFkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Why+I+(Still)+Want+My+Mtv+(Hampton+Press+Communication+Series.+Critical+Bodies.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Laodicean: A story of to-day (Thomas Hardy's works.

Murder,","description":"Confronting Nazi evil is the subject of the latest installment in the mega-bestselling Killing series As the true horrors of the Third Reich began to be exposed immediately after World War II, the Nazi war criminals who committed genocide went on the run. A few were swiftly caught, including the notorious SS leader, Heinrich Himmler. Others, however, evaded capture through a sophisticated Nazi organization designed to hide them. Among those war criminals were Josef Mengele, the  Angel of Death  who performed hideous medical experiments at Auschwitz; Martin Bormann, Hitler s brutal personal secretary; Klaus Barbie, the cruel \\"Butcher of Lyon\\"; and perhaps the most awful Nazi of all: Adolf Eichmann. Killing the SS is the epic saga of the espionage and daring waged by self-styled \\"Nazi hunters.\\" This determined and disparate group included a French husband and wife team, an American lawyer who served in the army on D-Day, a German prosecutor who had signed an oath to the Nazi Party, Israeli Mossad agents, and a death camp survivor. Over decades, these men and women scoured the world, tracking down the SS fugitives and bringing them to justice, which often meant death. Written in the fast-paced style of the Killing series, Killing the SS will educate and stun the reader.

Then just fourteen months later he was dead and the subsequent legal fight over his estate made headlines around the world. She was Anna Nicole Smith and this is the story of her meteoric rise from a fried chicken waitress in rural Texas to one of the most photographed women in the world, culminating in her untimely death at the age of thirty-nine. Born Vickie Lynn Hogan, Anna Nicole led an outrageous life filled with triumphs and tragedies, absurdities and achievements, drugs and lovers. It was a life lived large in the public eye - she even starred in her own reality TV show. But there was more drama to come. The birth of a baby girl in September 2006 was eclipsed by the shocking death of her twenty-year-old son, Daniel. Then tragedy struck again when the statuesque beauty was found unconscious in her hotel room on 8 February 2007and died soon after. With several men claiming to be the father of baby Danielynn, a stoush over where she'd be buried and accusations flying, Anna Nicole's death proved as bizarre as her life. As Cintra Wilson wrote on Salon.com, she was 'not so much a candle in the wind as a bonfire in a hailstorm'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OwMgcAAACAAJ&dq=Great+Big+Beautiful+Doll:+The+Anna+Nicole+Smith+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible Time Line: Genesis to Revelation at a Glance","description":"Bible Time Line is the best-selling Bible timeline sold in Christian stores.

To illuminate some of the causes of this phenomenon, Virginia Garrard-Burnett here offers the first history of Protestantism in a Latin American country, focusing specifically on the rise of Protestantism within the ethnic and political history of Guatemala. Garrard-Burnett finds that while Protestant missionaries were early valued for their medical clinics, schools, translation projects, and especially for the counterbalance they provided against Roman Catholicism, Protestantism itself attracted few converts in Guatemala until the 1960s. Since then, however, the militarization of the state, increasing public violence, and the \\"globalization\\" of Guatemalan national politics have undermined the traditional ties of kinship, custom, and belief that gave Guatemalans a sense of identity, and many are turning to Protestantism to recreate a sense of order, identity, and belonging.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qCLlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Resolution X-Ray Diffractometry And Topography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anne McCaffrey's The Unicorn Girl: The Illustrated Adventures","description":"A stunning pictorial fiction that continues the fantastic adventures of Acorna, the Unicorn Girl.

Peasants, serfs, untouchables, slaves, laborers, and prisoners are not free to speak their minds in the presence of power. These subordinate groups instead create a secret discourse that represents a critique of power spoken behind the backs of the dominant. At the same time, the powerful also develop a private dialogue about practices and goals of their rule that cannot be openly avowed. In this book, renowned social scientist James C. Scott offers a penetrating discussion both of the public roles played by the powerful and powerless and the mocking, vengeful tone they display off stage--what he terms their public and hidden transcripts. Using examples from the literature, history, and politics of cultures around the world, Scott examines the many guises this interaction has taken throughout history and the tensions and contradictions it reflects. Scott describes the ideological resistance of subordinate groups--their gossip, folktales, songs, jokes, and theater--their use of anonymity and ambiguity. He also analyzes how ruling elites attempt to convey an impression of hegemony through such devices as parades, state ceremony, and rituals of subordination and apology. Finally, he identifies--with quotations that range from the recollections of American slaves to those of Russian citizens during the beginnings of Gorbachev's glasnost campaign--the political electricity generated among oppressed groups when, for the first time, the hidden transcript is spoken directly and publicly in the face of power. His landmark work will revise our understanding of subordination, resistance, hegemony, folk culture, and the ideas behind revolt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ixkfcbWanf0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle for Iwo Jima,1945","description":"One of the decisive battles of the Second World War in the Pacific, Iwo Jima was described by Lieutenant-General Holland Smith, Commander Fleet Marine Forces Pacific, as \\"The most savage and most costly battle in the history of the Marine Corps \\" a titanic struggle that eclipsed all that had gone before.

Winston Churchill is universally recognized as one of the 20th century's great political leaders and his words ring just as true in the world of commerce. A wise, witty, and inspiring leader, Churchill ran Great Britain like a great corporation. \\"Perhaps the finest book on practical leadership ever written.\\"   Brian Tracy Churchill on Leadership demonstrates that the principles that guided Churchill ably translate to private industry today. Author Steven F. Hayward gives strong evidence that, if you remove Churchill from his political context, he would have the resume to be among the great business leaders of any age. Churchill: ? was a financier (as chancellor of the Exechequer) and labor negotiator (as home secretary) ? managed a large transportation network (as head of the British Navy) and far-flung property holdings (as colonial secretary) ? persevered through bankruptcies and other financial disasters ? conceived and introduced innovative new products over the opposition of his colleagues, and reorganized major production operations in the midst of crisis. With wit and insight, Hayward reveals Churchill's secrets for business success from assembling and inspiring a first-rate team to preparing a wise budget, from communicating a vision to structuring effective meetings, from acting decisively to rebounding from a failure. Laced with epochal events from the historical stage, enlivened with stimulating speculation, and leavened with wit, Churchill on Leadership is both an enjoyable read and a thought-provoking lesson on leadership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZv0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Churchill+on+Leadership:+Executive+Success+in+the+Face+of+Adversity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Group Parent Education: Promoting Parent Learning and Support","description":"\`For those working in group parent education I am sure it will a valuable resource and make its way onto the essential reading list of many courses  - Journal In-Service Education This book is devoted to training parent educators and family counsellors and represents a unique and important contribution to the growing field of parent education and support programmes.

Other fight choreographers may find in it a technique or two that is new to them and instructive, but my primary concern is for the actor, director, or stage manager who is a novice at stage violence. I sincerely hope that this simple book will help prevent injuries related to stage fights. Each technique outlined here can be executed in an infinite number of ways, for there are literally hundreds of styles of hand-to-hand combat in existence today, as well as many varied theatrical styles. However, if the reader pays particular attention to the general principles, then techniques can safely and effectively be adapted to include other movements that suit the actor and the action. Each technique is presented so as to lead the combatants step-by-step to the safe completion of the illusion. Don't fall into the trap of attempting to perform a technique too soon. Improvising during performance is dangerous. It is essential that both partners can rely on the constancy of movement and timing established during rehearsals. Also essential to safety is physical preparedness through preliminary exercise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8tzEqOfMJYMC&dq=Combat+Mime:+A+Non-Violent+Approach+to+Stage+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do You Know What I'll Do?","description":"A little girl makes promises to share her experiences with her baby brother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WcDingEACAAJ&dq=Do+You+Know+What+I%27ll+Do%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media","description":"Why do scientists so often offer dire predictions about the future of the environment?

Lamanna and a New Afterword by Tom Rea Less than one hundred years ago, Diplodocus carnegii named after industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was the most famous dinosaur on the planet. The most complete fossil skeleton unearthed to date, and one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, Diplodocus was displayed in a dozen museums around the world and viewed by millions of people. Bone Wars explains how a fossil unearthed in the badlands of Wyoming in 1899 helped give birth to the public s fascination with prehistoric beasts. Rea also traces the evolution of scientific thought regarding dinosaurs and reveals the double-crosses and behind-the-scenes deals that marked the early years of bone hunting. With the help of letters found in scattered archives, Tom Rea recreates a remarkable story of hubris, hope, and turn-of-the-century science. He focuses on the roles of five men: Wyoming fossil hunter Bill Reed; paleontologists Jacob Wortman in charge of the expedition that discovered Carnegie s dinosaur and John Bell Hatcher; William Holland, imperious director of the recently founded Carnegie Museum; and Carnegie himself, smitten with the colossal animals after reading a story in the New York Journal and Advertiser. What emerges is the picture of an era reminiscent of today: technology advancing by leaps and bounds; the press happy to sensationalize anything that turned up; huge amounts of capital ending up in the hands of a small number of people; and some devoted individuals placing honest research above personal gain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zi06EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mark of the Cat: Year of the Rat","description":"undefined","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qD3SGAAACAAJ&dq=Mark+of+the+Cat:+Year+of+the+Rat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We took to the woods (Armed services edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V1kYaPS-IEAC&dq=We+took+to+the+woods+(Armed+services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Das groe Erich Kstner Lesebuch.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PywDCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virginian Railway","description":"The Virginian Railway existed as a separate entity for only a half century, but that period of American history witnessed two world wars and the emergence of the United States as a global superpower.

Although Rogers died before his railroading dream could realize its full potential, the Virginian Railway continued on from 1909 until its merger in 1959 with the Norfolk and Western Railway (now Norfolk Southern).

So, pull up a chair and discover how you can turn seemingly unremarkable, daily moments into opportunities to instill in your child a truly remarkable faith. The Natural Way to Feed Your Child s Spiritual Hunger. Pass the Potatoes. Pass the Meatloaf. Pass the Faith. Since your child was a tiny baby, you have been lovingly providing food for his or her body, stimulation for the mind, love for the heart, and truth for the spirit. Yet it is as you go about the familiar rituals of lifein the very holiness of the mundanethat you may best teach your child about God and His ways. Using the memorable metaphor of the family dinner tablewhere napkins illustrate the power of forgiveness and placemats protect our tables as Scripture protects our children s soulsauthor Lori Borgman illustrates how to make the most of the natural teaching times in daily life and find creative, enjoyable ways to interweave spiritual nurture with the struggles and joys of everyday living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PrMRz9zgz1EC&dq=Pass+the+Faith,+Please:+Nourishing+Your+Child%27s+Soul+in+the+Everyday+Moments+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Memory Jogger II: A Pocket Guide of Tools for Continuous Improvement and Effective Planning","description":"A jargon-free project-management guide outlines a variety of tools for planning, process improvement and quality control while providing illustrative examples and sharing recommendations for implementing specific steps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8jxnPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Memory+Jogger+II:+A+Pocket+Guide+of+Tools+for+Continuous+Improvement+and+Effective+Planning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ballet Surprise (Full House Michelle)","description":"Trying out for the school ballet much to the delight of her family members, Michelle is afraid to tell anyone that she is a poor dancer and decides to do something shocking that will make her the star of the evening.

Macdonald Prize Featured in The Literary Review of Canada 100: Canada's Most Important Books [This is a story best summed up in the words of an anonymous senior Canadian official who, in the midst of a rambling, off-the-record discussion with journalists in 1945, was asked how many Jews would be allowed into Canada after the war   'None,' he said, 'is too many.' From the Preface One of the most significant studies of Canadian history ever written, None Is Too Many conclusively lays to rest the comfortable notion that Canada has always been an accepting and welcoming society. Detailing the country's refusal to offer aid, let alone sanctuary, to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution between 1933 and 1948, it is an immensely bleak and discomfiting story  and one that was largely unknown before the book's publication. Irving Abella and Harold Troper's retelling of this episode is a harrowing read not easily forgotten: its power is such that, 'a manuscript copy helped convince Ron Atkey, Minister of Employment and Immigration in Joe Clark's government, to grant 50,000  boat people  asylum in Canada in 1979, during the Southeast Asian refugee crisis' (Robin Roger, The Literary Review of Canada).

A few short years later, she was Alfred Hitchcock's confidante and one of the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of his first American film, Rebecca. Harrison had quickly grown from being the worst secretary Hitchcock ever had to one of his closest collaborators, critically shaping his brand as the \\"Master of Suspense.\\" Harrison went on to produce numerous Hollywood features before becoming a television pioneer as the producer of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. A respected powerhouse, she acquired a singular reputation for running amazingly smooth productions  and defying anyone who posed an obstacle. She built most of her films and series from the ground up. She waged rough-and-tumble battles against executives and censors, and even helped to break the Hollywood blacklist. She teamed up with many of the most respected, well-known directors, writers, and actors of the twentieth century. And she did it all on her own terms.

Indeed, this relatively small group of twenty-seven works, written during the height of the Roman Empire, not only helped create and sustain a vast world religion, but also have been integral to the larger cultural dynamics of the West, above and beyond particular religious expressions. Looking at the New Testament through the lens of literary study, Kyle Keefer offers an engrossing exploration of this revered religious text as a work of literature, but also keeps in focus its theological ramifications. Unique among books that examine the Bible as literature, this brilliantly compact introduction offers an intriguing double-edged look at this universal text--a religiously informed literary analysis. The book first explores the major sections of the New Testament--the gospels, Paul's letters, and Revelation--as individual literary documents. Keefer shows how, in such familiar stories as the parable of the Good Samaritan, a literary analysis can uncover an unexpected complexity to what seems a simple, straightforward tale. At the conclusion of the book, Keefer steps back and asks questions about the New Testament as a whole. He reveals that whether read as a single document or as a collection of works, the New Testament presents readers with a wide variety of forms and viewpoints, and a literary exploration helps bring this richness to light. A fascinating investigation of the New Testament as a classic literary work, this Very Short Introduction uses a literary framework--plot, character, narrative arc, genre--to illuminate the language, structure, and the crafting of this venerable text. About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l2WloCyb9VkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bailey and Scotts Diagnostic Microbiology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bm6ZzQEACAAJ&dq=Bailey+and+Scotts+Diagnostic+Microbiology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eagles of Duxford: The 78th Fighter Group in World War II","description":"En beretning om den amerikanske Fighter Group no. 78 under 2. verdenskrig.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mntCAAAACAAJ&dq=Eagles+of+Duxford:+The+78th+Fighter+Group+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression","description":"A revolutionary and hopeful look at depression as a silent epidemic in men that manifests as workaholism, alcoholism, rage, difficulty with intimacy, and abusive behavior by the cofounder of Harvard s Gender Research Project. Twenty years of experience treating men and their families has convinced psychotherapist Terrence Real that depression is a silent epidemic in men that men hide their condition from family, friends, and themselves to avoid the stigma of depression s  un-manliness.  Problems that we think of as typically male difficulty with intimacy, workaholism, alcoholism, abusive behavior, and rage are really attempts to escape depression. And these escape attempts only hurt the people men love and pass their condition on to their children. This groundbreaking book is the  pathway out of darkness  that these men and their families seek. Real reveals how men can unearth their pain, heal themselves, restore relationships, and break the legacy of abuse.

As chief executive of America s largest state, she had built a record as a reformer who cast aside politics-as-usual and pushed through changes other politicians only talk about: Energy independence. Ethics reform. And the biggest private sector infrastructure project in U.S. history. While revitalizing public-school funding and ensuring the state met its responsibilities to seniors and Alaska Native populations, Palin also beat the political \\"good ol  boys club\\" at their own game and brought Big Oil to heel. In this eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up in the wilds of Alaska, meeting her lifelong love, her decision to enter politics, the importance of faith and family, and the unique joys and trials of life as a high-profile working mother. She also opens up for the first time about the 2008 presidential race, providing a rare mom's-eye view of high-stakes national politics from patriots dedicated to \\"Country First\\" to slick politicos bent on winning at any cost. Going Rogue traces one ordinary citizen's extraordinary journey, and imparts Palin's vision of a way forward for America and her unfailing hope in the greatest nation on earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ycgLT6udeTgC&dq=Rogue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reader-Response Criticism : From Formalism to Post-Structuralism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Food first!","description":"In recent decades, the various strands of the food movement have made enormous strides in calling attention the many shortcomings and injustices of our food and agricultural system. Farmers, activists, scholars, and everyday citizens have also worked creatively to rebuild local food economies, advocate for food justice, and promote more sustainable, agroecological farming practices. However, the movement for fairer, healthier, and more autonomous food is continually blocked by one obstacle: land access. As long as land remains unaffordable and inaccessible to most people, we cannot truly transform the food system. The term land-grabbing is most commonly used to refer to the large-scale acquisition of agricultural land in Asian, African, or Latin American countries by foreign investors. However, land has and continues to be  grabbed  in North America, as well, through discrimination, real estate speculation, gentrification, financialization, extractive energy production, and tourism. This edited volume, with chapters from a wide range of activists and scholars, explores the history of land theft, dispossession, and consolidation in the United States. It also looks at alternative ways forward toward democratized, land justice, based on redistributive policies and cooperative ownership models. With prefaces from leaders in the food justice and family farming movements, the book opens with a look at the legacies of white-settler colonialism in the southwestern United States. From there, it moves into a collectively-authored section on Black Agrarianism, which details the long history of land dispossession among Black farmers in the southeastern US, as well as the creative acts of resistance they have used to acquire land and collectively farm it. The next section, on gender, explores structural and cultural discrimination against women landowners in the Midwest and also role of  womanism  in land-based struggles. Next, a section on the cross-border implications of land enclosures and consolidations includes a consideration of what land justice could mean for farm workers in the US, followed by an essay on the challenges facing young and aspiring farmers. Finally, the book explores the urban dimensions of land justice and their implications for locally-autonomous food systems, and lessons from previous struggles for democratized land access. Ultimately, the book makes the case that to move forward to a more equitable, just, sustainable, and sovereign agriculture system, the various strands of the food movement must come together for land justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ImolDwAAQBAJ&dq=Food+first!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fodor's to Go: 48 Hours in London, 1st Edition","description":"Authoritative, up-to-date travel information in a handy, compact format features tips on dining and lodging to suit any budget, facts on local transportation and holidays, detailed maps, sightseeing tips, and advice on shopping, nightlife, side trips, and outdoor activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iUKS_1TmzzIC&dq=Fodor%27s+to+Go:+48+Hours+in+London,+1st+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building a Scholarship of Assessment (The Jossey-Bass Higher and Adult Education Series)","description":"In this book, leading experts in the field examine the current state of assessment practice and scholarship, explore what the future holds for assessment, and offer guidance to help educators meet these new challenges.

After attending school in England, Durrell escaped the country he dubbed  Pudding Island  for the Greek island of Corfu, only to make another escape this time from Nazi invasion to Egypt. His experiences in wartime Alexandria led to a quartet of novels, beginning with Justine, that are collectively considered some of the great masterpieces of postwar fiction. Durrell s peripatetic life, which eventually took him to the South of France, fed his work with the richness and drama of his various adoptive homes. A man of protean talents, Durrell is celebrated for his fiction and poetry, as well has his highly regarded translations, essays, and travel literature. In researching this authorized biography, Ian S. MacNiven traveled over a period of twenty years from India to California, interviewing hundreds of individuals and visiting all but one of the many places Durrell lived.

Thompson, and Gay Talese launched the New Journalism movement, Robert S. Boynton sits down with nineteen practitioners of what he calls the New New Journalism to discuss their methods, writings and careers. The New New Journalists are first and foremost brilliant reporters who immerse themselves completely in their subjects. Jon Krakauer accompanies a mountaineering expedition to Everest. Ted Conover works for nearly a year as a prison guard. Susan Orlean follows orchid fanciers to reveal an obsessive subculture few knew existed. Adrian Nicole LeBlanc spends nearly a decade reporting on a family in the South Bronx. And like their muckraking early twentieth-century precursors, they are drawn to the most pressing issues of the day: Alex Kotlowitz, Leon Dash, and William Finnegan to race and class; Ron Rosenbaum to the problem of evil; Michael Lewis to boom-and-bust economies; Richard Ben Cramer to the nitty gritty of politics. How do they do it? In these interviews, they reveal the techniques and inspirations behind their acclaimed works, from their felt-tip pens, tape recorders, long car rides, and assumed identities; to their intimate understanding of the way a truly great story unfolds.

The text's readings and accompanying apparatus-which have been class tested and proven effective through eight previous editions-guide students from a consideration of self to an awareness of how the self interacts with other people and phenomena. The book provides effective models of reading and styles of writing while explaining to students the process and interdependence of reading and writing, stressing the connections students can make between their own experiences and what they read. It also introduces them to prewriting techniques such as freewriting, brainstorming, mapping, clustering, and journals. Reading selections are organized into thematic units that guide students from a reflection on identity through the consideration of self to an examination of close human relationships and finally to more abstract topics such as work and society.

They are both sciences of human action, but have traditionally been treated as very separate disciplines. Divine Economy is the first book to address the need for an active dialogue between the two. D. Stephen Long traces three strategies which have been used to bring theology to bear on economic questions: the dominant twentieth-century tradition, of Weber's fact-value distinction; an emergent tradition based on Marxist social analysis; and a residual tradition that draws on an ancient understanding of a functional economy. He concludes that the latter approach shows the greatest promise because it refuses to subordinate theological knowledge to autonomous social-scientific research. Divine Economy will be welcomed by those with an interest in how theology can inform economic debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KrCCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death comes for the archbishop","description":"\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" by Willa Cather.

Toklas Intimate friends of Gertrude Stein, aware of her indomitable courage and resourcefulness, were not at all surprised when she emerged unscathed from the Nazi occupation of France, her Picasso collection intact and her poodle, Basket, wagging his tail contentedly at her heels. But Stein had her full share of troubles and excitement in those four years, and it is this unbelievable period that she documents in full in this most graphic and revealing of all her books. Written in longhand under the very noses of the Nazis, Wars I Have Seen is the on-the-spot story of what the people of France endured. From the early days, in which Stein was more concerned with foraging food for her dogs than with the fate of democracy, to the coming of the Americans, which gave her the thrill of a lifetime, Stein depicts the heroic exploits of the French Resistance fighters and the excitement of the battle for liberation with all of her signature literary panache.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=89z1XD84_UMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Airplanes and trucks and trains, fire engines, boats and ships, and building and wrecking machines,","description":"The contents of five books are combined into one volume describing the kinds, parts, operation, and use of many common vehicles and machines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BSoIOAAACAAJ&dq=Airplanes+and+trucks+and+trains,+fire+engines,+boats+and+ships,+and+building+and+wrecking+machines,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Environmental Ion Exchange: Principles and Design","description":"Environmental Ion Exchange: Principles and Design contains the most important ion exchange-related design and application issues.

No longer considered the exception to the norm, the stepfamily has been thrust into the mainstream by a 50% divorce rate combined with a high incidence of remarriage. According to some estimates, 35% of children born in the 1980's will experience stepfamily living by the time they reach the age of 18. Although interest in remarriage and stepfamily relationships is growing, the literature often takes the form of popular work or anecdotal accounts with minimal data. This volume provides a much-needed overview of current research and theory in the field. It stems from a series of meetings sponsored by the Society for Research in Child Development and funded by the Foundation for Child Development. The nine scholars who participated in the year-long study group, along with two others prominent in the field, have produced a work which explores the intricacies of remarriage and stepfamily living from a variety of perspectives. How do divorce and remarriage determine parent's adjustment and parent-child relationships? How are the boundaries set within this new family form? What are the dynamics between biological and step parents, both within the newly-created nuclear family and within the linked family units--those tied together for life by their common children? This comprehensive volume sheds new light on these issues and more, including the relatively untouched area of stepsibling relationships. It incorporates findings from five recent research studies, providing data not available elsewhere. The contributors also examine the stepfamily within historical, social, and cultural contexts--from changing demographics to stepfamily stereotypes. They cast a critical eye on current literature in the field and on research methodologies, providing insights on the changing nature of the stepfamily, and developing conceptual frameworks for further research. With so much important, up-to-date scholarship under one cover, REMARRIAGE AND STEPPARENTING TODAY is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in the areas of sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work, as well as for advanced students pursuing any of these disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pk-8QgAACAAJ&dq=Remarriage+and+Stepparenting:+Current+Research+and+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kids Helping Kids Break the Silence of Sexual Abuse","description":"A valuable resource for parents and children, this collection of first-hand accounts and expert advice offers help for prevention and healing from childhood sexual abuse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r9UhEIdtyYAC&dq=Kids+Helping+Kids+Break+the+Silence+of+Sexual+Abuse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II","description":"On December 14, 1944, Japanese soldiers massacred 139 of 150 American POWs. This biography tells the story of Glenn (\\"Mac\\") McDole, one of eleven young men who escaped and the last man out of Palawan Prison Camp 10A. Beginning on December 8, 1941, at the U.S. Navy Yard barracks at Cavite, the story of this young Iowa Marine continues through the fighting on Corregidor, the capture and imprisonment by the Japanese Imperial Army in May 1942, Mac's entry into the Palawan prison camp in the Philippines on August 12, 1942, the terrible conditions he and his comrades endured in the camps, and the terrible day when 139 young soldiers were slaughtered. The work details the escapes of the few survivors as they dug into refuse piles, hid in coral caves, and slogged through swamp and jungle to get to supportive Filipinos. It also contains an account and verdicts of the war crimes trials of the Japanese guards, follow-ups on the various places and people referred to in the text, with descriptions of their present situations, and a roster of the names and hometowns of the victims of the Palawan massacre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iLc4SWerdVIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"State Sovereignty and International Criminal Law","description":"'State sovereignty' is often referred to as an obstacle to criminal justice for core international crimes by members of the international criminal justice movement. The exercise of State sovereignty is seen as a shield against effective implementation of such crimes. But it is sovereign States that create and become parties to international criminal law treaties and jurisdictions. They are the principal enforcers of criminal responsibility for international crimes, as reaffirmed by the complementarity principle on which the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based. Criminal justice for atrocities depends entirely on the ability of States to act. This volume revisits the relationship between State sovereignty and international criminal law along three main lines of inquiry. First, it considers the immunity of State officials from the exercise of foreign or international criminal jurisdiction. Secondly, with the closing down of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals, attention shifts to the exercise of national jurisdiction over core international crimes, making the scope of universal jurisdiction more relevant to perceptions of State sovereignty. Thirdly, could the amendments to the ICC Statute on the crime of aggression exacerbate tensions between the interests of State sovereignty and accountability? The book contains contributions by prominent international lawyers including Professor Christian Tomuschat, Judge Erkki Kourula, Judge LIU Daqun, Ambassador WANG Houli, Dr. ZHOU Lulu, Professor Claus Kre, Professor MA Chengyuan, Professor JIA Bingbing, Professor ZHU Lijiang and Mr. GUO Yang.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lCC7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voracious Children: Who Eats Whom in Children's Literature (Children's Literature and Culture)","description":"First published in 2006.

This Harriman House edition includes Charles Mackay's account of the three infamous financial manias - John Law's Mississipi Scheme, the South Sea Bubble, and Tulipomania. Between the three of them, these historic episodes confirm that greed and fear have always been the driving forces of financial markets, and, furthermore, that being sensible and clever is no defence against the mesmeric allure of a popular craze with the wind behind it. In writing the history of the great financial manias, Charles Mackay proved himself a master chronicler of social as well as financial history. Blessed with a cast of characters that covered all the vices, gifted a passage of events which was inevitably heading for disaster, and with the benefit of hindsight, he produced a record that is at once a riveting thriller and absorbing historical document. A century and a half later, it is as vibrant and lurid as the day it was written. For modern-day investors, still reeling from the dotcom crash, the moral of the popular manias scarcely needs spelling out. When the next stock market bubble comes along, as it surely will, you are advised to recall the plight of some of the unfortunates on these pages, and avoid getting dragged under the wheels of the careering bandwagon yourself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JVwcP0fXmC4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fiberarts Magazine ; November/December 1980","description":"First Published in 1997.

From that perspective, she offers an elegant, deeply satisfying reconciliation of the theory of evolution and the wisdom of the Bible. Perhaps only someone with Roughgarden's unique academic standing could examine so well controversial issues such as the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, or the potential flaws in Darwin's theory of evolution. Certainly Roughgarden is uniquely suited to reference both the minutiae of scientific processes and the implication of Biblical verses. Whether the topic is mutation rates and lizards or the hidden meanings behind St. Paul's letters, Evolution and Christian Faith distils complex arguments into everyday understanding. Roughgarden has scoured the Bible and scanned the natural world, finding examples time and again, not of conflict, but of harmony. The result is an accessible and intelligent context for a Christian vision of the world that embraces science. In the ongoing debates over creationism and evolution, Evolution and Christian Faith will be seen as a work of major significance, written for contemporary readers who wonder how-or if-they can embrace scientific advances while maintaining their traditional values.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5qI4EqvZ4boC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The James Joyce Murder (A Kate Fansler Mystery)","description":"Professor and amateur detective Kate Fansler searches for the murderer of a neighborhood pest, in a case involving an unpublished manuscript by Joyce","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I4g-DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+James+Joyce+Murder+(A+Kate+Fansler+Mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through the Windows of Heaven: 100 Powerful Stories and Teachings from Walter Martin, the Original Bible Answer Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Money Magick: How to Use Magick to Gain Prosperity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Guide to Vintage Trade Stimulators & Counter Games","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Contract Lawyering: What Every Lawyer and Law Firm Needs to Know About Temporary Legal Services, 2nd Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Valuing People","description":"Valuing People in Construction provides contemporary perspectives on the 'glue' that binds the construction process together; people. The book addresses people issues in the construction industry where behavioural outcomes impact upon business and project performance. The main proposition of the book is that as people continue to lead the completion of construction activities, their health, safety, and well-being should be seen as a priority, and valued by stakeholders. As employers and employees, the role of people in construction must be to strive for the improvement of individual lives and society. This edited collection, which is the first book to focus specifically on placing value on people in construction, focuses on people at work, gender at work, conditions at work, and respect at work. In addition to an editorial overview, the book presents tested and refined empirical work and case studies by leading construction researchers from Africa, Australia, and Europe. Essential reading for researchers, students and professionals interested in construction management, the sociology of construction, HRM in construction, gender, work and health studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=stP7zQEACAAJ&dq=Valuing+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DARK TERRORS 5","description":"The world's biggest and best anthology series of original horror and dark fantasy returns with a bumper collection of new short stories and novellas from the hottest names and most talented newcomers:TREY R.

This book includes logic diagrams for design procedures and scaling parameters for the conveying line configuration. It also explains how to improve the performance of pneumatic conveyors by optimizing, uprating, and extending the system or adapting it for a change of material. This book consists of 15 chapters divided into three sections and opens with an overview of the state of the art on pneumatic conveying, along with definitions of the terms used in pneumatic conveying. The next chapter describes the various types of pneumatic conveying systems and the parameters that influence their capabilities in terms of material flow rate and conveying distance. The discussion then turns to feeding and discharging of the conveying line; selection of a pneumatic conveying system for a particular application; and design procedures for pneumatic conveying system. The theory and use of compressed air in pneumatic conveying are also considered, along with the effect of material properties on conveying performance; troubleshooting; and operational problems and some solutions. The final chapter is devoted to the use of bench-scale test methods to determine the material properties relevant to pneumatic conveying. This monograph is intended for designers and users of pneumatic conveying systems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ErQgBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COMPUTABLE ECONOMICS","description":"Computable Foundations for Economics is a unified collection of essays, some of which are published here for the first time and all of which have been updated for this book, on an approach to economic theory from the point of view of algorithmic mathematics. By algorithmic mathematics the author means computability theory and constructive mathematics. This is in contrast to orthodox mathematical economics and game theory, which are formalised with the mathematics of real analysis, underpinned by what is called the ZFC formalism, i.e., set theory with the axiom of choice. This reliance on ordinary real analysis and the ZFC system makes economic theory in its current mathematical mode completely non-algorithmic, which means it is numerically meaningless. The book provides a systematic attempt to dissect and expose the non-algorithmic content of orthodox mathematical economics and game theory and suggests a reformalization on the basis of a strictly rigorous algorithmic mathematics. This removes the current schizophrenia in mathematical economics and game theory, where theory is entirely divorced from algorithmic applicability  for experimental and computational exercises. The chapters demonstrate the uncomputability and non-constructivity of core areas of general equilibrium theory, game theory and recursive macroeconomics. The book also provides a fresh look at the kind of behavioural economics that lies behind Herbert Simon s work, and resurrects a role for the noble classical traditions of induction and verification, viewed and formalised, now, algorithmically. It will therefore be of particular interest to postgraduate students and researchers in algorithmic economics, game theory and classical behavioural economics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ATcylNZuFigC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus, the One and Only","description":"Come along with Beth Moore on a life-changing journey which will lead you through the hills of Galilee with the Teacher, across the lake with the Master, and finally, on the road toward the cross with the Savior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cAoPAAAACAAJ&dq=Jesus,+the+One+and+Only&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arguments Within English Marxism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Structure of Materials","description":"This highly readable, popular textbook for upper undergraduates and graduates comprehensively covers the fundamentals of crystallography and symmetry, applying these concepts to a large range of materials.

The million-copy bestseller Lilac Girls introduced the real-life heroine Caroline Ferriday. Now Lost Roses, set a generation earlier and also inspired by true events, features Caroline s mother, Eliza, and follows three equally indomitable women from St. Petersburg to Paris under the shadow of World War I.  Not only a brilliant historical tale, but a love song to all the ways our friendships carry us through the worst of times.  Lisa Wingate, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Before We Were Yours It is 1914, and the world has been on the brink of war so often, many New Yorkers treat the subject with only passing interest. Eliza Ferriday is thrilled to be traveling to St. Petersburg with Sofya Streshnayva, a cousin of the Romanovs. The two met years ago one summer in Paris and became close confidantes. Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia: the church with the interior covered in jeweled mosaics, the Rembrandts at the tsar s Winter Palace, the famous ballet. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia s imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their country estate. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortune-teller s daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their household. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya s letters suddenly stop coming, she fears the worst for her best friend. From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg and aristocratic countryside estates to the avenues of Paris where a society of fallen Russian  migr s live to the mansions of Long Island, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways. In her newest powerful tale told through female-driven perspectives, Martha Hall Kelly celebrates the unbreakable bonds of women s friendship, especially during the darkest days of history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal Liberators: Research and Morality","description":"Looks at the growth of the animal rights movement and describes its connections with antivivisection movements of the past","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ORbnwAEACAAJ&dq=Animal+Liberators:+Research+and+Morality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual Basic 5 Step by Step (Step By Step (Microsoft))","description":"A step-by-step guide to using Microsoft Visual Basic, covering such topics as building and customizing the user interface, managing data, Visual Studio web development with ASP.NET 4, and working with Windows Phone SDK 8.0.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sD8FCAAAQBAJ&dq=Microsoft+Visual+Basic+5+Step+by+Step+(Step+By+Step+(Microsoft))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The conquest of Mexico,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5hEAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ukrainian Folk Tales","description":"The collection of folktales from the Ukraine consists of one book with 27 folktales.

And indeed, the truths of scripture are so simple that even a child can understand them. So it's no accident that children's sermons have become a central part of the worship service in many churches. Brett Blair and Tim Carpenter offer a year's worth of object lessons that engage children and impart profound lessons for all ages. Two sermons are provided for each Sunday in Cycle C of the Revised Common Lectionary, one based on the Second Lesson and one based on the Gospel. The messages are structured in two parts: the lesson uses an object to draw out active responses from children, then the application connects that object to the assigned scripture reading. Each message includes a clear statement of its exegetical aim. Bright, innovative, perceptive, creative, grace-filled Brett Blair and Tim Carpenter are all of those and much, much more, and that is reflected beautifully in their new book Children's Sermons A To Z. James W. Moore Pastor, St. Luke's United Methodist Church Houston, Texas Brett Blair is associate pastor of Asbury United Methodist Church in Memphis, Tennessee. He holds the M.Div. degree from Yale University Divinity School and is a cum laude graduate of Oral Roberts University with B.A. and M.A. degrees in New Testament Literature.

Our understanding of literary modernism, which we think we know so well, is transformed by these analyses of the anthropological insights that it holds for readers.\\"--Andrew J. McKenna, Loyola University Employing Northrop Frye and Ren  Girard as his theoretical foundation, Johnsen reinterprets the works of three canonical modernists--Ibsen, Joyce, and Woolf--to argue for their commitment to analyzing collective violence as a defining motive in literary modernism. Johnsen shows how Frye's vision of a movement from mythic to ironic heroes parallels Girard's view of a society increasingly demythologized, and increasingly concerned with scapegoats and victims. He points to important similarities between these theoretical visions and a growing concern for weaker subjects across literary history, especially with the move into the modern period. Ibsen, Joyce, and Woolf, he argues, each wrestled with the powerful rituals of self-sacrifice that society requires in the modern world--with their strategies and consequences. Using this focus, Johnsen addresses Ibsen's controversial criticism of the democratic majority, Joyce's inflammatory rejection of physical-force nationalism, and Woolf's curious refusal of feminist anger as kindred responses to modern affirmations of collective violence, not merely paralleling the insights of Frye and Girard but extending and refining them. William A. Johnsen is professor of English at Michigan State University and the author of several articles on European authors and theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RCgwLgEACAAJ&dq=Violence+and+Modernism:+Ibsen,+Joyce,+and+Woolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stereotypes and Prejudice in Conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish Society","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 44, Colossians-Philemon","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Almost Perfect (Perfect Trilogy, Book 1)","description":"Almost Perfect Maddy, Christine, and Amy, friends since college, are thrilled to learn their old suitemate's self help book, How to Have a Perfect Life, has become a smashing bestseller-until they realize she used them as negative examples of how women let fear mess up their lives.

This book examines many fascinating points raised in six centuries of Tibetan and Mongolian commentary concerning the first two sections of this text: the Prologue, and the section on the Mind-Only School. By providing vivid detail, Jeffrey Hopkins reveals the liveliness of Tibetan scholastic controversies, showing the dynamism of thoughtful commentary and stimulating the reader's metaphysical imagination. In the process of examining 170 issues, this volume treats many engaging points on Great Vehicle presentations of the three natures and the three non-natures, including how to apply these to all phenomena, the selflessness of persons, and the emptiness of emptiness. It concludes with a delineation of the approaches through which the Mind-Only School interprets scriptures.This stand-alone book is the final volume of a trilogy on Mind-Only that Hopkins composed over a period of twenty-two years. His heavily annotated translation of the first two sections of Dzong-ka-ba's text is contained in the first volume, Emptiness in the Mind-Only School of Buddhism, along with a historical and doctrinal introduction, a detailed synopsis of the text, and a critical edition. The second volume, Reflections on Reality: The Three Natures and Non-Natures in the Mind-Only School, provides historical and social context, a basic presentation of the three natures, the two types of emptiness in the Mind-Only School, and the contrasting views of Dol-bo-ba Shay-rap-gyel-tsen of the Jo-nang-ba order of Tibetan Buddhism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O39PDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story","description":"Reincarnation of Attila the Hun?

Despite growing acknowledgement of their centrality, relationships between adult researchers and very young participants have been neglected and under-theorised, and in response, this book offers a comprehensive conceptualisation of adultchild research relationships through examination of questions, including: How do power and inequity impact on adultchild research relationships? What does it mean for relationships when researchers  intervene  in the field? How do bodies matter in research relationships? What does an emphasis on relationships with young children mean for the research process? Drawing on data from their own research, the authors contend that relationships are part of a wider web of social relations and spacetime configurations. They propose and develop a relational ethics of answerability and social justice, inspired by the work of Bakhtin and, in addition, explore the way material bodies come to matter, the ambiguity of consent in educator-research, and the risks and possibilities of research relationships. Chapters include innovative formulations of reciprocity,  sensing practices , and political-ethical responsibility. This book contributes to current debates about research with young children, offering an incisive and thorough exploration of the importance of relationships to the research process. Relevant for international audiences, this book is essential reading for early childhood students and educators, researchers, and lecturers with an interest in research with children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iVptAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","description":"A meticulous analysis of Hellenistic culture spanning three centuries, from the death of Alexander the Great in 325 B.C.

Sheridan, a Northwestern University scholar, concentrates on the Kuomintang movement of Chiang Kai-shek, insisting that we judge a political force by whether it solves the problems posed to it, not, as Chiang's partisans prefer, by means of what-if's. Sheridan's focus on the KMT brings more to light than do many surveys of Mao's revolutionaries. The KMT failed either to create an effective dictatorship or to mobilize fascist passions which could ensure willingness to \\"sacrifice.\\" Thus the difficulty in squeezing enough wealth out of the peasantry to meet a foreign debt which totaled half the national revenue. The KMT did ensure that forced opium production took up at least a fifth of Chinese cropland by the 1929-1933 period, and they consolidated a soldier recruitment system that approximated Nazi roundups. However, the book underlines Chiang's failure to give the masses a \\"\\"Strength through Joy\\"\\" spirit; and, as wartime inflation of 300% gave way to postwar collapse, the anti-Communist pitch became emptier and emptier. The Kuomintang turned into a mere holding operation and faded into chaos. Sheridan gives a strong sense of the rapine of the warlords who were Chiang's off-and-on allies, and of the feeble heritage of Sun Yat-sen's patriotic platitudes. He leaves out explicit investigation of the international context while underlining, more than most writers, Chiang's commitment to repay external debt at the expense of the Chinese people. A sound and striking approach to these decades of desperation in the lives of a quarter of the human population if not bypassed in the glut of \\"China books,\\" it may encourage students and academics to go further.

The resulting text emphasized the unity of spacetime and those quantities (such as proper time, proper distance, mass) that are invariant, the same for all observers, rather than those quantities (such as space and time separations) that are relative, different for different observers. The book has become a standard introduction to relativity. The Second Edition of Spacetime Physics embodies what the authors have learned during an additional quarter century of teaching and research. They have updated the text to reflect the immense strides in physics during the same period and modernized and increased the number of exercises, for which the First Edition was famous. Enrichment boxes provide expanded coverage of intriguing topics. An enlarged final chapter on general relativity includes new material on gravity waves, black holes, and cosmology. The Second Edition of Spacetime Physics provides a new generation of readers with a deep and simple overview of the principles of relativity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PDA8YcvMc_QC&dq=Physics+In+Spacetime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Weeping Buddha","description":"National Book Award nominee Heather Dune Macadam presents her first novel - as mysterious and alluring as a Buddhist Koan.

Edmund Gordon lived in Bluefields, Nicaragua, during most of the 1980s, a turbulent period during which he participated in the community's search for solutions to problems ranging from a crumbling economic base to the mutual mistrust and animosity between most Creole people and the Sandinista revolutionary government. Disparate Diasporas is not a conventional ethnography. Rather than being just an observer, Gordon actively participated in the life of the community, intent on contributing to its political processes. A basic premise of his book is that engagement and activity can enhance ethnographic insights and sharpen theoretical understanding. Disparate Diasporas shows how a particular Black community can evolve distinct types of diasporic consciousness, and, depending on the historical moment, how different types of memories, consciousness, and politics come to predominate. The author uses the Gramscian notion of common sense to understand the Creole community's history of shifting politics and ideologies, focusing on the period of the 1970s and 1980s. His work explains the inability of the Sandinistas to come to terms with the racial and cultural challenge to the Nicaraguan nation posed by the Creole community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_a96AAAAMAAJ&dq=Disparate+Diasporas:+Identity+and+Politics+in+an+African+Nicaraguan+Community+(New+Interpretations+of+Latin+America+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian Faith in Contemporary Society: The Framework for Belief","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dad Says He Saw You at the Mall","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Farm Team","description":"Life is hard on a dairy farm in the heartland of Minnesota.

In The Jagged Orbit, Brunner, writing at the peak of form that allowed him to create Stand on Zanzibar, takes a long, hard, disturbing, and hilarious look at the near and not-so-distant future. Catastrophic changes due to rampant drug abuse, uncontrolled violence, high-level government corruption, inhumane treatment of the too-readily defined  insane,  and the accompanying collapse of the social order are wreaking havoc on the world we recognize and turning it into a reality we must fear and hope to avoid. Brunner tells a spine-chilling tale of where the world could possibly go that is all too believable and real for our comfort.  For each generation, there is a writer meant to bend the rules of what we know. Hugo Award winner (Best Novel, Stand on Zanzibar) and British science fiction master John Brunner remains one of the most influential and respected authors of all time, and now many of his classic works are being reintroduced. For readers familiar with his vision, it is a chance to reexamine his thoughtful worlds and words.

Because the majority of young deaf children (especially those with non-signing parents) are reared in language-impoverished environments, their social and cognitive development may differ markedly from hearing children. The author here details those potential differences, giving special attention to how the psychological development of deaf children is affected by their interpersonal communication with parents, peers, and teachers. This careful and balanced consideration of existing evidence and research provides a new psychological perspective on deaf children and deafness while debunking a number of popular notions about the hearing impaired. In light of recent findings concerning manual communication, parent-child interactions, and intellectual and academic assessments of hearing-impaired children, the author has forged an integrated understanding of social, language, and cognitive development as they are affected by childhood deafness. Empirical evaluations of deaf children's intellectual and academic abilities are stressed throughout.

Winner of the three national Coach of the Year honors, the only coach ever to lead six different schools to season-ending bowl games, and the ninth-winningest coach in college football history, Holtz is still teaching and coaching, although he is no longer on the gridiron. In his most telling work to date, the man still known as \\"Coach\\" by all who cross his path reveals what motivated a rail-thin 135-pound kid with marginal academic credentials and a pronounced speech impediment to play and coach college football, and to become one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in history.

Marina Warner uses her superb historical and literary skills to move beyond conventional biography and to capture the essence of Joan of Arc, both as she lived in her own time and as she has \\"grown\\" in the human imagination over the five centuries since her death. She has examined the court documents from Joan of Arc's 1431 Inquisition trial for heresy and woven the facts together with an analysis of the histories, biographies, plays, and paintings and sculptures that have appeared over time to honor this heroine and symbol of France's nationhood. Warner shows how the few facts that are known about the woman Joan have been shaped to suit the aims of those who have chosen her as their hero. The book places Joan in the context of the mythology of the female hero and takes note of her historical antecedents, both pagan and Christian and the role she has played up to the present as the embodiment of an ideal, whether as Amazon, saint, child of nature, or personification of virtue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fdVmNbNId7sC&dq=JOAN+OF+ARC+the+Image+of+Female+Heroism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of the Normal Distribution, Second Edition (Statistics: A Series of Textbooks and Monographs)","description":"\\"Traces the historical development of the normal law.

On November 25th, 1997, the barque Picton Castle, a three-masted, square-rigged tall ship, headed out from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia on a voyage around the world. Aboard ship a shifting crew of thirty, a combination of professional sailors and paying crew who were out $32,500 for the privilege of working  crew before the mast,  would travel for over a year and half, calling in at ports as exotic and varied as Aruba, Somoa, Bali and Zanzibar. Fair Wind and Plenty of It tells the story of an obsession, as Captain Dan Moreland, driven by a desire to make his mark in the world of traditional sail, rallies forces to convert a sixty-nine-year-old North Sea trawler into a seaworthy tall ship, and then assembles the crew to sail it. It s the story of the uneasy balance that is achieved on board, where insubordination and rancour must be kept in line among a crew whose only connection is their common desire to be part of this journey. And it is Rigel s story: a man who was conceived the day his father laid the keel for his first boat, whose mother was a sailmaker, and who has to reconcile his family legacy with his own need to understand why he must take part in the voyage of the barque Picton Castle. In Fair Wind and Plenty of It, Rigel Crockett tells a tale of shipboard camaraderie, gut-wrenching struggles and the near-mutinies that marked the year-and-a half journey -- where fellow shipmates proved to be as perilous as the ever-present sea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ULpi_EOyjIC&dq=Fair+Wind+and+Plenty+of+It:+A+Modern-Day+Tall+Ship+Adventure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dick for a Day: What Would You Do If You Had One?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qcpOPgAACAAJ&dq=Dick+for+a+Day:+What+Would+You+Do+If+You+Had+One%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treatise on Political Economy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Senator's Wife","description":"Two unconventional women--Meri Fowler, pregnant, newly married, and discovering the gap between reality and expectation, and Delia Naughton, wife of a notoriously unfaithful liberal senator--confront the costs and challenges of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uBDDpNrtC1oC&dq=The+Senator%27s+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Broadcast Engineering Tutorial for Non-Engineers, Third Edition","description":"Important Updates!

Thus begins the story set in a grim tenement district of New York City before the turn of the twentieth century. It is there that Robin, once protected by a loving mother and father, both now dead, must contend with a brutal stepfather, Hawker Doak. Yet Robin is faced with only two choices: remain in the ruthless charge of Hawker, collecting the hated rents, and, perhaps worse, being sent to work in a factory or escape into the treacherous slum streets, haunted by, among other horrors, the bullying boys who work and live in the streets, and whom Robin so fears. Either choice provides a sure recipe for a very short life. But in the end it is fear for the life of his baby brother that makes Robin's agonizing decision for him. The answer to whether or not they survive will only be found when Robin discovers the secret guarded by a place called St. Something. Within this true picture of tenement life, Barbara Brooks Wallace has created another chilling mystery that starts with one kind of terror, only to weave its way into yet another, deepened by intrigue and unspeakable treachery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NO65vPnLkjYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Statistics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (Movie Tie in)","description":"Reuniting with the beloved whale friend he once rescued, Jesse is called upon to save the day again when an oil spill threatens Willy's family and the oil company plans to put two younger orcas in an aquarium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DTeiQ68M9zMC&dq=Free+Willy+2:+The+Adventure+Home+(Movie+Tie+in)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Software Measurement and Estimation: A Practical Approach (Quantitative Software Engineering Series)","description":"An effective, quantitative approach for estimating and managingsoftware projects How many people do I need?

Following Star Wars: Aftermath and Star Wars: Life Debt, Chuck Wendig delivers the exhilarating conclusion to the New York Times bestselling trilogy set in the years between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. EVERY END IS A NEW BEGINNING. As the final showdown between the New Republic and the Empire draws near, all eyes turn to a once-isolated planet: Jakku. The Battle of Endor shattered the Empire, scattering its remaining forces across the galaxy. But the months following the Rebellion s victory have not been easy. The fledgling New Republic has suffered a devastating attack from the Imperial remnant, forcing the new democracy to escalate its hunt for the hidden enemy. For her role in the deadly ambush, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane is the most wanted Imperial war criminal and one-time rebel pilot Norra Wexley, back in service at Leia s urgent request, is leading the hunt. But more than just loyalty to the New Republic drives Norra forward: Her husband was turned into a murderous pawn in Sloane s assassination plot, and now she wants vengeance as much as justice. Sloane, too, is on a furious quest: pursuing the treacherous Gallius Rax to the barren planet Jakku. As the true mastermind behind the Empire s devastating attack, Rax has led the Empire to its defining moment. The cunning strategist has gathered the powerful remnants of the Empire s war machine, preparing to execute the late Emperor Palpatine s final plan. As the Imperial fleet orbits Jakku, an armada of Republic fighters closes in to finish what began at Endor. Norra and her crew soar into the heart of an apocalyptic clash that will leave land and sky alike scorched. And the future of the galaxy will finally be decided.

It is the oldest national park in Canada, the second in North America (following Yellowstone in Wyoming) and the third oldest park in the world (following Royal in Australia). It encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 square miles) including the Lake Louise area and part of the Icefields Parkway. Over 8 million people enter Banff Park each year, of which over 3 million are considered park visitors OCo the highest visitation of any Canadian National Park. Most of BanffOCOs natural attractions are easily accessible from its scenic roads and highways. Popular sites around Banff townsite include the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, Upper Hot Springs Pool, Cascade Gardens, Tunnel Mountain Drive, Vermilion Lakes, Johnson Lake and Lake Minnewanka. The townsite imparts a cosmopolitan atmosphere with an expansive array of tourist services as well as cultural attractions such as the Whyte Museum, The Banff Park Museum and the Banff Centre. The Bow Valley Parkway, Lake Louise and the Icefields Parkway also present countless opportunities for sight seeing and wildlife viewing. Banff National Park maintains 1,500 kilometres (932 miles) of trails and 50 backcountry campgrounds. In winter, three downhill ski areas service the area. Connecting Jasper National Park and Lake Louise in Banff National Park, the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) is considered to be one of the premier mountain drives in the world. The 230 km (143 mile) parkway follows the Continental Divide north-south as well as the Athabasca, Sunwapta, North Saskatchewan, Mistaya and Bow Valleys. Glaciers that remain from the ice ages dot the landscape, seven icefields within viewing distance of the parkway. The highlight of the drive for many is the Athabasca Glacier, the only road accessible glacier in the parks.a The author grew up in the Canadian Rockies and has been exploring them since she was a child. The Canadian Rockies are one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, with four million visitors annually. Easily accessible adventures include walking, hiking, mountain biking, fishing, boating, horseback riding, skiing and wildlife viewing -- with some of the most spectacular animals in North America. Where else can you spend the morning hiking through spectacular wilderness and by afternoon enjoy high tea in one of the grand hotels? The guide is filled with inside information on how to avoid the tourist traps and where to find the special places off the beaten path that the tourists don't know about; the most worthwhile outdoor adventures and indoor activities; the hotels and restaurants at all price levels that are the very best; plus tips on places to avoid. Each chapter covers transportation to and around the park, where to stay and eat, attractions and shopping, plus adventures, from drives to day hikes, rafting to cycling. Competing guides focus on the standard tourist sites (where the crowds can ruin your experience), while we take you to the lesser-known spots (restaurants, lodges, hiking paths), which are often more rewarding. A review of the complete Canadian Rockies Adventure Guide from which this is drawn: Having been to the Canadian Rockies numerous times and thinking we had seen all the wonderful places before we discovered this book, we now must plan many more trips there to explore all the other incredible places described in detail in this Guide. With numerous beautiful color photographs, most of which are by the author, this guide is a treasure because the scenery of the Canadian Rockies is some of the most spectacular in the world. A unique feature of this guide book is that it includes hiking details for each of the areas described. Since we have hiked many of these areas, we know this is a necessary and valuable tool for planning hikes. With each section Koller has Hikes, Drives, Sights, and Activities, so for non-hikers it is just as valuable, also giving information for booking guided tours. -- Bonnie Neely (Amazon reviewer)\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAvyJF5SaecC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disparate Diasporas: Identity and Politics in an African-Nicaraguan Community (New Interpretations of Latin America Series)","description":"Based on a decade the author spent among the African-Caribbean Creole people on Nicaragua's southern Caribbean coast, Disparate Diasporas is a study of identity formation and politics in that community. Edmund Gordon lived in Bluefields, Nicaragua, during most of the 1980s, a turbulent period during which he participated in the community's search for solutions to problems ranging from a crumbling economic base to the mutual mistrust and animosity between most Creole people and the Sandinista revolutionary government. Disparate Diasporas is not a conventional ethnography. Rather than being just an observer, Gordon actively participated in the life of the community, intent on contributing to its political processes. A basic premise of his book is that engagement and activity can enhance ethnographic insights and sharpen theoretical understanding. Disparate Diasporas shows how a particular Black community can evolve distinct types of diasporic consciousness, and, depending on the historical moment, how different types of memories, consciousness, and politics come to predominate. The author uses the Gramscian notion of common sense to understand the Creole community's history of shifting politics and ideologies, focusing on the period of the 1970s and 1980s. His work explains the inability of the Sandinistas to come to terms with the racial and cultural challenge to the Nicaraguan nation posed by the Creole community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_a96AAAAMAAJ&dq=Disparate+Diasporas:+Identity+and+Politics+in+an+African-Nicaraguan+Community+(New+Interpretations+of+Latin+America+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rome that Did Not Fall","description":"The Rome that Did Not Fall provides a well-illustrated, comprehensive narrative and analysis of the Roman empire in the east, charting its remarkable growth and development which resulted in the distinct and enduring civilization of Byzantium.

Pundits used such expressions as \\"heroin trafficking,\\" \\"training terrorists,\\" \\"attempts to assassinate Castro,\\" and \\"Mob connections.\\" More specifically, they charged him with having played a major role in the Chilean military coup of 1973. But who was the real Ted Shackley? In Spymaster, he has told the story of his entire remarkable career for the first time. With the assistance of fellow former CIA officer Richard A. Finney, he discusses the consequential posts he held in Berlin, Miami, Laos, Vietnam, and Washington, where he was intimately involved in some of the key intelligence operations of the Cold War. During his long career, Shackley ran part of the inter-agency program to overthrow Castro, was chief of station in Vientiane during the CIA's \\"secret war\\" against North Vietnam and the Pathet Lao, and was chief of station in Saigon. After his retirement, he remained a controversial figure. In the early eighties, he was falsely charged with complicity in the Iran-Contra scandal. Ted Shackley's comments on CIA operations in Europe, Cuba, Chile, and Southeast Asia and on the life of a high-stakes spymaster will be the subject of intense scrutiny by all concerned with the fields of intelligence, foreign policy, and postwar U.S. history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hgf-1AGqIa4C&dq=Spymaster:+My+Life+in+the+CIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holy Order of Water: Healing the Earth's Waters and Ourselves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZX8g_wvpJ4C&dq=The+Holy+Order+of+Water:+Healing+the+Earth%27s+Waters+and+Ourselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counting to Ten with Moses","description":"Provides a simple version of each of the ten commandments, along with items to count for the numbers from one to ten.

This book is studded with provocative ideas, which challenge believers on both sides to grow in good faith. In sum, this book is a call for Christians and Jews to work closely together in their evolving partnership with God. Rabbi Greenberg takes us along on a personal journey, initially stimulated by his research on Holocaust testimony, that led to his rethinking of Christianity, and that ultimately gave rise to his belief that Christianity, Judaism, and indeed every religion that works to repair the world and advance the triumph of life, are valid expressions of the universal bond (brit) between God and humankind. In the second part of his book, Greenberg brings together, for the first time, seven of his most important essays on the new encounters between Judaism and Christianity in our generation. It concludes with a study guide and powerful responsive essays by leading Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish commentators, James Carroll, Michael Novak, Mary C. Boys, Krister Stendhal, and David Novak. - Back cover.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=im0v2wR88sgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elsie Venner: --A romance of destiny,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hf7Onch15AgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minerals of Colorado","description":"A record of the mineralogy of the state of Colorado that spans nearly 140 years and includes 774 different mineral species.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hDJPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Minerals+of+Colorado&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adam Raccoon and the Race to Victory Mountain (Keane, Glen, Parables for Kids.)","description":"Although tempted to stop, Adam Raccoon perseveres and finishes the race to Victory Mountain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Ku2AQAACAAJ&dq=Adam+Raccoon+and+the+Race+to+Victory+Mountain+(Keane,+Glen,+Parables+for+Kids.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rule by Secrecy","description":"What secrets connect Egypt s Great Pyramids, the Freemasons, and the Council on Foreign Relations?

This author is specifically referring to the fact that the Christos spent a lot of time casting out what the Bible calls unclean spirits. These unclean spirits were named \\"Archons\\" by many of the first Christians. They are still roaming the planet. They still are possessing people. The alien invasion has begun. Waves of Alien Parasites are invading Planet Earth. They are the Archons, and they are penetrating the minds of people just like you. Akin to vampires, they drain humans of their life energy. They have been doing so since the dawn of humankind on this planet. Did you know that you could be a victim of Archon attacks? Do you wake up in the morning angry over nothing? Do you get angry at the way breakfast is prepared, with other drivers on the run, or the way someone looks at you while you are getting on the subway or bus to work? During the day, are you often annoyed with your boss and co-workers? Does the rage, frustration and sadness inside you seem to be growing and growing? Are you turning to alcohol, food, social media, or other outlets just to dull the rage you feel? Then, at night, while watching the news do you become even more irritated? Why? Alien Parasites. Author Laurence Galian uses a form of direct knowledge of the Divine called Gnosticism to free you from the devastating attacks of Alien Mind Parasites. This powerful book on the subject of Alien Parasites will teach you what they are, how to detect them and how to eliminate them through forty techniques (plus two super effective bonus techniques). This book is perfect for the average reader and will serve as an excellent introduction to Gnosticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZcfxgEACAAJ&dq=Archons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rotations, Quaternions, and Double Groups (Dover Books on Mathematics)","description":"This self-contained text presents a consistent description of the geometric and quaternionic treatment of rotation operators, employing methods that lead to a rigorous formulation and offering complete solutions to many illustrative problems.

Bach","description":"Ornaments play an enormous role in the music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and ambiguities in their notation (as well as their frequent omission in the score) have left doubt as to how composers intended them to be interpreted. Frederick Neumann, himself a violinist and conductor, questions the validity of the rigid principles applied to their performance. In this controversial work, available for the first time in paperback, he argues that strict constraints are inconsistent with the freedom enjoyed by musicians of the period. The author takes an entirely new look at ornamentation, and particularly that of J. S. Bach. He draws on extensive research in England, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States to show that prevailing interpretations are based on inadequate evidence. These restrictive interpretations have been far-reaching in their effect on style. By questioning them, this work continues to stimulate a reorientation in our understandiing of Baroque and post-Baroque music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hufaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tandy's Money MacHine - How Charles Tandy Built Radio Shack","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seal Morning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XHQMAQAAIAAJ&dq=Seal+Morning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Or Ill Dress You In Mourning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=79OAzQEACAAJ&dq=Or+Ill+Dress+You+In+Mourning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Machine Elements in Mechanical Design (4th Edition)","description":"The concepts, procedures, data, and analysis techniques needed to design and integrate machine elements into mechanical devices and systems.

The chapbooks' contrastive portrayal of an imaginary experience of hell and a pseudo-scientific journey through the cosmos is interpreted as an unconventional approach to the questions of an inquiring mind. This study offers the first analysis of the chapbooks as literary works in their own right, as opposed to simply being sources for Christopher Marlowe's play. It is also the first study to describe the Faustus typology as a vehicle by which uncompromising thinkers of early modernity and the Enlightenment questioned contemporary views about religion, morality and the possibility of experiencing transcendence. While arguing that Marlowe's Doctor Faustus primarily examines the imaginary foundations of religious rules and standards, the author suggests that the 1616 version of the play revived the chapbooks' accounts of spiritual ravishment and intellectual ecstasy. Imaginary explorations of cosmic space became popular in the seventeenth century and gave rise to strongly diverging works of literature, embracing the arcane spirituality of Milton's Paradise Lost as well as Fontenelle's sociable but essentially secular fantasy of cosmic travel. This book shows that contemporary responses to early modern science also tended to address the most urgent concerns of the Faustus legend, explaining the re-emergence of the typology in Mountfort's late seventeenth-century farcical Faustus play and early eighteenth-century harlequinades about Doctor Faustus","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iD6oDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JFK: The Second Plot","description":"A tale of conspiracy and corruption-the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963 remains one of the greatest mysteries of the twentieth century. At the centre of the puzzle stands the enigmatic figure of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was himself killed by Jack Ruby only days after Kennedy's death. Few people today believe the official explanation that Oswald was the sole assassin. Eye-witness accounts, film shot at the time and acoustic, medical and photographic evidence all point to a second gunman, aand a second gunman points to the most feared scenario: a conspiracy. But despite many theories-involving the Mafia, the Russian and the CIA-no one has yet come up with a convincing explanation of Oswald's precise role in the Presidents murder. After 30 years of research, Matthew Smith has uncovered the second plot-the plot in which Oswald's true role in the assassination is exposed-and the unmasking of a second plot leads naturally to the first. In this extraordinary and important book we learn for the first time who Oswald really was, who he was working for and what his true role was in the macabre enterprise. In JFK: The Second Plot the machinations behind Kennedy's assassination are exposed for all to see .","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C491PQAACAAJ&dq=JFK:+The+Second+Plot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Quality Assurance for the Analytical Chemistry Laboratory","description":"xii a second edition might be in order, and readily agreed. Although the basic principles remain the same, discussions with analysts, laboratory supervisors, and managers indicated many areas where improve ments could be made.

Very little of the first edition has been discarded, but many topics have been expanded considerably. The chapter on computers has been completely rewritten in view of the rapid changes in that field. The chapter in the first edition on planning and organizing for quality assurance has been split into two chapters, one on planning for quality assurance and the other on organizing and establishing a quality assurance program, and new material on mandated quality assurance programs has been combined with the material on laboratory accreditation. Numerous examples, especially those involving mathematical calculations, have been added at the suggestion of some readers. In short, this edition is very nearly a new book, and I can only hope it is as well received as the first edition.

Through a careful study of Barth s and Bonhoeffer s works, of their correspondence, and of Barth s comments and revisions after Bonhoeffer s death, Pangritz clarifies the close yet sometimes strained relationship between Barth and Bonhoeffer and cautiously makes the case that Bonhoeffer s criticism has been overemphasized and did not mark a significant breach between the two great theologians.

Located on Broadway between 52nd and 53rd streets, the club named for the incomparable Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker boasted lifesize photo murals of modern jazzmen like Dizzy Gillespie, Lennie Tristano, and, of course, Bird himself, looming large against jet black walls. Exotic live birds perched in cages behind the bar. The midget master of ceremonies, 3'9\\" Pee Wee Marquette, dressed in a zoot suit and loud tie, smoked huge cigars and screeched mispronounced introductions into the microphone. And the jazz-struck young Crow would park in the bleachers till 4 am, blissfully enveloped by the heady music of Bird, Bud Powell, Max Roach, and a host of other jazz giants. From Birdland to Broadway is an enthralling insider's account of four decades of a life in jazz. Bill Crow, journeyman bass player, superb storyteller, and author of the successful Jazz Anecdotes, here narrates many moving and delightful tales of the pioneers of modern jazz he played with and was befriended by. We find Dizzy Gillespie, with whom Crow, because of prior commitments, regretfully declined steady work, dancing at the Royal Roost, Stan Getz sadly teetering on the brink of losing himself to drugs, and Harry Belafonte (known then as \\"the Cinderella Gentleman\\") running a lunch counter in New York's Sheridan Square between music dates. And we also witness many of the highlights of Crow's career, such as in 1955 when the Marian McPartland Trio (with Crow on bass) was named \\"Small Group of the Year\\" by Metronome; Crow playing with the Gerry Mulligan Quartet at venues like Storyville in Boston and Harlem's Apollo Theater (where they appeared with Dinah Washington); and the tour of the Soviet Union with Benny Goodman, a journey that might have been a high point of Crow's travels abroad but was marred by Goodman's legendary mistreatment of his band. Moving beyond jazz clubs to the Broadway concert pit and a variety of studio gigs in the '60s, Crow encounters actors such as Yul Brynner and pop-rock acts like Simon and Garfunkel. From the great to the near-great, from Billie Holiday to Judy Holliday, Bill Crow's wealth of personal anecdotes takes the reader from Birdland, to the Half Note, to the Playboy Club, to the footlights of Broadway. This revealing book is a marvelous portrait of the jazz world, told by someone who's been there.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w33mCwAAQBAJ&dq=From+Birdland+to+Broadway:+Scenes+from+a+Jazz+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Paradise Vendor","description":"General Motors.

The phenomenon of friendship is universal and elemental. Friends, after all, are the family we choose. But what makes these bonds not just pleasant but essential, and how do they affect our bodies and our minds? In Friendship, science journalist Lydia Denworth takes us in search of friendship s biological, psychological, and evolutionary foundations. She finds friendship to be as old as early life on the African savannas when tribes of people grew large enough for individuals to seek fulfillment of their social needs outside their immediate families. Denworth sees this urge to connect reflected in primates, too, taking us to a monkey sanctuary in Puerto Rico and a baboon colony in Kenya to examine social bonds that offer insight into our own. She meets scientists at the frontiers of brain and genetics research and discovers that friendship is reflected in our brain waves, our genomes, and our cardiovascular and immune systems; its opposite, loneliness, can kill. At long last, social connection is recognized as critical to wellness and longevity. With insight and warmth, Denworth weaves past and present, field biology and neuroscience, to show how our bodies and minds are designed for friendship across life stages, the processes by which healthy social bonds are developed and maintained, and how friendship is changing in the age of social media. Blending compelling science, storytelling, and a grand evolutionary perspective, Denworth delineates the essential role that cooperation and companionship play in creating human (and nonhuman) societies. Friendship illuminates the vital aspects of friendship, both visible and invisible, and offers a refreshingly optimistic vision of human nature. It is a clarion call for putting positive relationships at the center of our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yCfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933-1940","description":"Mr. Badger's notably successful history is not simply another narrative of the New Deal, nor does the figure of Franklin Roosevelt loom as large in his account as in some others.

Here, however, the ground has perceptibly shifted. First published in 1981, Nisa served as a stirring introduction to anthropology's most basic question: Can there be true understanding between people of profoundly different cultures? Diagnosed with breast cancer, and troubled by a sense of work yet unfinished, Shostak returned to Botswana in 1989. This book tells simply and directly of her rediscovery of the !Kung people she had come to know years before--the aging, blunt, demanding Nisa, her stalwart husband Bo, understanding Kxoma, fragile Hwantla, and Royal, translator and guide. In Shostak's words, we clearly see !Kung life, the dry grasslands, the healing dances, the threatening military presence. And we see Shostak herself, passionately curious, reporting the discomforts and confusion of fieldwork along with its fascination. By turns amused and frustrated, she describes the disappointments--and chastening lessons--that inevitably follow when anthropologists (like her younger self) romanticize the !Kung. Throughout, we observe a woman of threatened health but enormous vitality as she pursues the promise she once discovered in the !Kung people and, above all, in Nisa. At the core of the book is the remarkable relationship between these two women from different worlds. They are often caught off guard by the limits of their mutual understanding. Still, their determination to reach out to each other lingers in the reader's mind long after the story ends--providing an eloquent response to questions that Nisa so memorably posed. It was not that we had become the best of friends or like close family. It was simply that she and I had the most straightforward connection I had ever had with anyone, before or since. It was as if the !Kung culture and my talks with Nisa touched something beyond reason in me. Even though I didn't necessarily like everything Nisa said, nor everything about her, my heart had been captured. But how often I wished Nisa had been more noble, more selfless, and more philosophical. Nisa had to be known well to be appreciated, for she was complex and difficult. She probably would say much the same about me. We both wanted things from each other, and neither of us got as much as we hoped for. That we both got some of what we wanted--well, that made our friendship extremely valuable. --from the Epilogue","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U5SCpadLfoYC&dq=Return+to+Nisa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal Summer","description":"A theme park  princess  meets a single dad who turns out to be a real prince!

Forty years ago he thought he had found a tradition of thought   Freudian psychoanalytic theory   that had skepticism built into it. He gradually realized, however, that true skepticism is an attitude of continual questioning. The more closely Crews examined the logical structure and institutional history of psychoanalysis, the more clearly he realized that Freud's system of thought lacked empirical rigor. Indeed, he came to see Freudian theory as the very model of a modern pseudoscience. Follies of the Wise contains Crews's best writing of the past fifteen years, including such controversial and widely quoted pieces as \\"The Unknown Freud\\" and \\"The Revenge of the Repressed,\\" essays whose effects still reverberate today. In addition, his topics range from \\"Intelligent Design\\" creationism to theosophy, from psychological testing to UFO zaniness, from American Buddhism to the current state of literary criticism. A single theme animates his bracing and witty discussions: the temptation to reach for deep wisdom without attending to the little voice that asks, \\"Could I, by any chance, be deceiving myself here?\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KpGeOwAACAAJ&dq=Follies+of+the+Wise:+Dissenting+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maid No More","description":"\\"Maid No More\\" by Helen Simpson.

In the contrast between Bluntschli, the mercenary soldier, and the brave leader, Sergius, the true nature of valour is revealed. Shaw mocks deluded idealism in Candida, when a young poet becomes infatuated with the wife of a Socialist preacher. The Man of Destiny is a witty war of words between Napoleon and a  strange lady,  while in the exuberant farce You Never Can Tell a divided family is reunited by chance. Although Shaw intended Plays Pleasant to be gentler comedies than those in their companion volume, Plays Unpleasant, their prophetic satire is sharp and provocative. This is the definitive text prepared under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence. The volume includes Shaw s Preface of 1898.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mKyvvz8i2c8C&dq=Plays+By+George+Bernard+Shaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization","description":"MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES IN PRINT ?

(Psalms 128:2aEUR\\"4) In this blessing, God compared your children to olive plants and commissioned them to be all around your table. My question was, aEURoeWhy olive plants?aEUR Here are some facts I found about the olive tree: The olive tree is one of the most beloved, sacred trees in Israel. It has strong roots that live for thousands of years. They are evergreen trees bearing valuable fruit all year long. Olive trees can grow in a rocky environment with poor soil conditions. They need a sunny position and regular watering to thrive. The olive tree grows quickly the first four years, producing a beautiful white flower. Maturing of the olive tree slows down, developing fruit several years later. The olive leaf extract possesses extreme healing properties. The olive branch is a symbol of peace. The expensive olive wood is fragrant, colorful, dense, and durable. The wood is used for fine furniture and the making of items of religious significance. The wood is seasoned and cleaned by applying oil and rubbing with salt. The olive fruit is very bitter if not processed correctly. With careful preparation, it is a delicious, salty addition to our diet. The Israelites considered an abundance of oil as a sign of prosperity and favor. The olive oil is used to produce light and as an anointing oil for healing. Judges 9:9 says that oil was used to honor God and men. The olive tree is cherished and loved for what it gives the nation of Israel. Our little olive plants should be cherished and loved for what they can do for the kingdom of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MLwuEAAAQBAJ&dq=Olive+Shoots+Around+Your+Table&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected poems of William Wordsworth (The World's Classics)","description":"Selected Poetry of William Wordsworth represents Wordsworth s prolific output, from the poems first published in Lyrical Ballads in 1798 that changed the face of English poetry to the late  Yarrow Revisited.

This first complete biography of the longtime member and chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals and Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States during the turbulent years of the New Deal is a monumental achievement by a distinguished interpreter of constitutional law. Cardozo was a progressive judge who understood and defended the proposition that judge-made law must be adapted to modern conditions. He also preached and practiced the doctrine that respect for precedent, history, and all branches of government limited what a judge could and should do. Thus, he did not modernize law at every opportunity. In this book, Kaufman interweaves the personal and professional lives of this remarkable man to yield a multidimensional whole. Cardozo's family ties to the Jewish community were a particularly significant factor in shaping his life, as was his father's scandalous career--and ultimate disgrace--as a lawyer and judge. Kaufman concentrates, however, on Cardozo's own distinguished career, including twenty-three years in private practice as a tough-minded and skillful lawyer and his classic lectures and writings on the judicial process. From this biography emerges an estimable figure holding to concepts of duty and responsibility, but a person not without frailties and prejudice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eOJ8QbxAHOIC&dq=Cardozo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock and the Pop Narcotic: Testament for the Electric Church","description":"Long out-of-print classic of rock criticism.

The evidence is accumulated from a wide variety of medieval thinkers and images, including the macabre illustrations of the Dance of Death and other popular themes in art and literature, which reflect the medieval obsession with notions of humility, penitence, and the dangers of bodily corruption. The author discusses the impact of the Black Death on late medieval art and examines the development of the medieval tomb, showing the changing attitudes towards the commemoration of the dead between late antiquity and the late Middle Ages. In the final chapter the progress of the soul after death is studied through the powerful descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory in Dante and other writers and through portrayals of the Last Judgment and the Apocalypse in sculpture and large-scale painting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_fV8xR5n4K8C&dq=Medieval+Death:+Ritual+and+Representation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"forever","description":"As her son grows up from little boy to adult man, a mother secretly rocks him each night as he sleeps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ep09WAFbDwC&dq=forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of WonderBaby: From A to Z","description":"The alphabet is represented by a baby that has the characteristics of many different animals, from a beaver to a yak.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=30QlTm-GsdAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walking on Eggshells: Practical Counsel for Women in or Leaving a Violent Relationship","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reflection Therapy (Body Wisdom Books)","description":"Reflection therapy is an easily learned meditative process, a straightforward relaxation technique, and a method for changing behavior.

Noting the presence of puzzles everywhere in everyday life, Marcel Danesi looks at puzzles in society since the dawn of history, showing how their presence has guided large sections of human history, from discoveries in mathematics to disquisitions in philosophy. Danesi examines the cognitive processes that are involved in puzzle making and solving, and connects them to the actual physical manifestations of classic puzzles. Building on a concept of puzzles as based on Jungian archetypes, such as the river crossing image, the path metaphor, and the journey, Danesi suggests this could be one way to understand the public fascination with puzzles. As well as drawing on underlying mental archetypes, the act of solving puzzles also provides an outlet to move beyond biological evolution, and Danesi shows that puzzles could be the product of the same basic neural mechanism that produces language and culture. Finally, Danesi explores how understanding puzzles can be a new way of understanding our human culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6TPpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Year of Meats","description":"In a single eye-opening year, two women, worlds apart, experience parallel awakenings.

But that was after more than five years as one of the preeminent figures of the movement, leading sitin protests and fighting segregation on interstate busways as an original Freedom Rider. It was after becoming chairman of SNCC (the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) and being the youngest speaker at the March on Washington. It was after helping organize the Mississippi Freedom Summer and the ensuing delegate challenge at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. And after coleading the march from Selma to Montgomery on what became known as  Bloody Sunday.  All too often, the depiction of history ends with a great victory. But John Lewis knew that victories are just the beginning. In Run: Book One, John Lewis and longtime collaborator Andrew Aydin reteam with Nate Powell the awardwinning illustrator of the March trilogy and are joined by L. Fury making an astonishing graphic novel debut to tell this often overlooked chapter of civil rights history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KzpKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Q & A: Insightful Answers to Your Most Frequently Asked Questions","description":"Provides information on breast cancer, covering such topics as medical terminology, support groups, medication, and alternative treatments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Rlxz7ETndcC&dq=Breast+Cancer+Q&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thelon: A River Sanctuary","description":"David Pelly tells the Thelon's story, exploring the mystery of Man's relationship with this special place in the heart of Canada's vast Arctic barrenlands.

The place has a history, both Native and non-Native, which gives it standing beyond the intrinsic value of wilderness itself.\\" David Pelly writes as one who has been there time and again. He knows the Thelon from personal experience.

Every day is a gift. Every day I can thank God from the bottom of my heart.  Kelly Mantoan wasn t always able to say these words. As a mother of five children, two with profound disabilities, all her energy and attention was focused on her children s diagnoses and round the clock care. Drained and struggling, Kelly wondered if she had what it took to be the kind of parent they needed. She craved support as a Catholic mother with special-needs children, but felt lost and alone when she tried to rely on secular support groups or well-meaning friends and family who had no experience in the special-needs community. If you can relate to Kelly s story, Better Than OK: Finding Joy with Special- Needs Children is the hope-filled book you need today. In her down-to-earth way, Kelly shares the steps parents need to take to shift their focus away from the negatives of a diagnosis and towards acceptance, renewed faith, and joy. This book is a must-read for special-needs parents, but I would recommend it to any parent who needs a dose of wisdom and encouragement.

Unfortunately, it's also one which has been subject to far more speculation than sound biblical exegesis. Until now. Unlike other resources available on the Antichrist, The Man of Sin focuses on Scripture, not contemporary events, to uncover the truth about this mysterious entity. With skilled exegesis Riddlebarger asserts that, contrary to popular speculation, the Antichrist is not a singular individual but a series of beings that will arise to challenge Christ throughout the inter-advental age before culminating in an end-times Antichrist. Backing this claim first in Scripture, Riddlebarger also draws from historical teachings including those of the church fathers, the Reformation, and historic Protestantism, before contrasting this evidence to the sensational interpretations of many contemporary writers. Pastors, teachers, and study groups wanting to understand the doctrine of the Antichrist will find The Man of Sin to be a unique and comprehensive study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3LdpWDEtPScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Horse Whisperer: An Illustrated Companion to the Major Motion Picture","description":"Describes the Western setting of the film and the origins of the horses, and recounts the making of the movie","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=St16IAe8HIcC&dq=The+Horse+Whisperer:+An+Illustrated+Companion+to+the+Major+Motion+Picture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in European Realism: A Sociological Survey of the Writings of Balzac, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Gorky, and Others","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OP3hXwAACAAJ&dq=Studies+in+European+Realism:+A+Sociological+Survey+of+the+Writings+of+Balzac,+Stendhal,+Tolstoy,+Gorky,+and+Others&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Probability: An Introduction","description":"A concise introduction to probability and random processes at first-degree level with exercises and problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DyifaCLXxkIC&dq=Probability:+An+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In These Girls, Hope Is A Muscle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"A look at the trials and triumphs of high school girls' basketball chronicles one season of the Lady Hurricanes of Amherst, Massachusetts, as they learn loyalty and self-confidence on their way to a championship game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0aY7PgAACAAJ&dq=In+These+Girls,+Hope+Is+A+Muscle+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muslims and the West: a Muslim Perspective","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Just in case: Everyone's guide to disaster preparedness and emergency self-help","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reading Mystical Lyric: The Case of Jalal Al-Din Rumi (Studies in Comparative Religion)","description":"This text provides an extensive critical examination of Jalal al-Din Rumi's body of literature.

A native New Yorker, her mother worked as a chef in her own catering business, run out of their home in Harlem. Driven by the speed and the intensity in the kitchen, Kelis' passion behind watching her mother cook inspired her to roll up her sleeves. Every detail was clear and defined: Red lips, red nails, perfume, earrings and a military demeanour she felt in the presence of a master while watching her mother work. At age 17, Kelis signed her first recording contract and began to travel the world. She discovered local outdoor markets and tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurants and considered them the hidden treasures of her journeys. After 10 years in the music business, Kelis decided to attend Le Cordon Bleu. Attending the famous cooking school gave Kelis the confidence to call herself a chef and to write her first cookbook.

The authors begin with an overview of the field and proceed to essential aspects of naked-eye astronomy, followed by an examination of specific cultures. The book concludes by taking into account the purposes of ancient astronomy: astrology, navigation, calendar regulation, and (not least) the understanding of our place and role in the universe. Skies are recreated to display critical events as they would have appeared to ancient observers - events such as the supernova of 1054, the 'lion horoscope' or the 'Star of Bethlehem.' Exploring Ancient Skies provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships between astronomy and other areas of human investigation. It will be useful as a reference for scholars and students in both astronomy and archaeology, and will be of compelling interest to readers who seek a broad understanding of our collective intellectual history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cgEJu3iUwM0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardening With the Goddess: Creating Gardens of Spirit and Magick","description":"For organic gardeners, magickal practitioners, and people walking the goddess tradition, this book blends earth-friendly approaches with metaphysical methods for powerful and meaningful results.

In creating them, I became so involved with my characters that their lives were still as much a part of me as I was of them long after the issues in which they appeared became collector s items. Pleased as I was about how I brought the characters and their adventures to life in the pages of the magazines, I still wanted the reader to know more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into fuller-length novels that I published in paperback under other titles.

Not just a conservative but a rock-ribbed reactionary, he played the part of a landed gentleman, deplored democracy, and rejected the modern world outright. To Reck the Nazis were ruthless revolutionaries in Gothic drag, and helpless as he was to counter the spell they had cast on the German people, he felt compelled to record the corruptions of their rule. The result is less a diary than a sequence of stark and astonishing snapshots of life in Germany between 1936 and 1944. We see the Nazis at the peak of power, and the murderous panic with which they respond to approaching defeat; their travesty of traditional folkways in the name of the Volk; and the author s own missed opportunity to shoot Hitler.

Since then, Wallace has produced an extraordinary body of journalism and criticism engaging with popular culture and gender and racial politics. This collection brings together more than fifty of the articles she has written over the past fifteen years. Included alongside many of her best-known pieces are previously unpublished essays as well as interviews conducted with Wallace about her work. Dark Designs and Visual Culture charts the development of a singular, pathbreaking black feminist consciousness. Beginning with a new introduction in which Wallace reflects on her life and career, this volume includes other autobiographical essays; articles focused on popular culture, the arts, and literary theory; and explorations of issues in black visual culture. Wallace discusses growing up in Harlem; how she dealt with the media attention and criticism she received for Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman, which was published when she was just twenty-seven years old; and her relationship with her family, especially her mother, the well-known artist Faith Ringgold. The many articles devoted to black visual culture range from the historical tragedy of the Hottentot Venus, an African woman displayed as a curiosity in nineteenth-century Europe, to films that sexualize the black body such as Watermelon Woman, Gone with the Wind, and Paris Is Burning. Whether writing about the Anita HillClarence Thomas hearings, rap music, the Million Man March, Toshi Reagon, multiculturalism, Marlon Riggs, or a nativity play in Bedford Stuyvesant, Wallace is a bold, incisive critic.

Washington is the most complete, definitive one-volume biography of George Washington ever written. In 1948 renowned biographer and military historian Douglas Southall Freeman won his second Pulitzer Prize for his new and dramatic reexamination of George Washington. For years biographies had gone from idolatry to muckraking in their depictions of this somewhat marbleized Founding Father. Freeman s new interpretation was a fresh step, making Washington a living, breathing individual, flawed but heroic. An able commander who defeated the British Empire against incredible odds, Washington proved to be just as adept at wielding political power, and adroitly steered our new loosely called nation through the first stormy years of our unproven federal stewardship and the first two presidential administrations. Here with an introduction by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Kammen, who puts the writing and publication of Washington into perspective, and an afterword by Pulitzer Prize winner Dumas Malone, who explains the travails of Freeman s grinding work, Washington is the most comprehensive biography available, and its value as an important classic has never been more evident.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ThEOtAEACAAJ&dq=Douglas+Southall+Freeman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering Fiction Level 1 Instructor's Manual: A Reader of American Short Stories","description":"Authentic North American short stories enhance students' reading skills, language learning, and enjoyment of literature.

When a drought hits the tiny river town and the depth of the mighty Mississippi lowers, Torie is one of the first on the scene to see what the water has revealed: the decades-old wreckage of a riverboat. Soon, the rumors that surrounded its sinking have resurfaced as well and are swirling all over town, most notably about the existence of a cache of diamonds thought to be on board that was never recovered. Before long, a trove of treasure seekers flocks to town, and inevitably, tragedy strikes amid the feverish competition of the treasure hunt. Meanwhile, Torie is staggered by another discovery---the existence of a half sister she never knew she had. Shocked and surprised, she looks around for a distraction, and decides to dig into what really caused the wreck, as well as the location of the missing diamonds. All in all, the combination of personal intrigue and cold-blooded murder makes Blood Relations a sparkling addition to a terrific mystery series.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ty5sBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 47a, Hebrews 1-8","description":"The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

The countless translators and interpretations of this book differ strongly from each other. Does the Hebrew text indeed justify this? To answer this question, an unprejudiced philological analysis is necessary that keeps strictly to the text, which does justice to the context, and approaches the book intrinsically as rationally as possible. These methods followed by the author make clear that the SofS is a continuous story, which runs from SofS 1.2 to 8.14 with a cohesive structure, which is readily comprehensible and logical. That even applies to verses (e.g. 2.15; 6.12), which are seen by everyone as puzzling. Emendations are practically never necessary, eliminations not at all. The analysis makes plausible that SofS 1.2-8.4 is set in the harem of Solomon. The female protagonist, who has earlier lost her heart to a shepherd, is held there against her will and prepared physically and mentally for a meeting with Solomon by a personal attendant, who first appears in SofS 1.9; she does not succeed in winning her for Solomon. In the SofS a consistent use of language is employed, which means, for example, that the individual speakers are recognisable; this, together with the intrinsically cohesive structure of the work, is a strong argument for one author/editor. The use of veiled language for specific female or male parts of the body occurs more often than is recognised by others. The SofS is the story of the love, which unites two people. It is unique and faithful, and encompasses the whole of the person. Full justice is done to the related erotic-sexual aspect in a satisfying and harmonious manner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tdViAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Song+of+Songs:+A+Philological+Analysis+of+the+Hebrew+Book+(Ancient+Near+Eastern+Studies+Supplement+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze, etc","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Not Playing for Celtic (Mainstream Sport)","description":"Volume three of a bibliography documenting all that has been written in the English language on the history of sport and physical education in Britain.

Design and Debris discusses the relationship between order and disorder in the works of John Hawkes, Harry Mathews, John Barth, Gilbert Sorrentino, Robert Coover, Thomas Pynchon, Kathy Acker, and Don DeLillo. In analyzing their work, Joseph Conte brings to bear a unique approach adapted from scientific thought: chaos theory. His chief concern is illuminating those works whose narrative structures locate order hidden in disorder (whose authors Conte terms \\"proceduralists\\"), and those whose structures reflect the opposite, disorder emerging from states of order (whose authors Conte calls \\"disruptors\\"). Documenting the paradigm shift from modernism, in which artists attempted to impose order on a disordered world, to postmodernism, in which the artist portrays the process of \\"orderly disorder,\\" Conte shows how the shift has led to postmodern artists' embrace of science in their treatment of complex ideas. Detailing how chaos theory interpenetrates disciplines as varied as economics, politics, biology, and cognitive science, he suggests a second paradigm shift: from modernist specialization to postmodern pluralism. In such a pluralistic world, the novel is freed from the purely literary and engages in a greater degree of interactivity-between literature and science, and between author and reader. Thus, Conte concludes, contemporary literature is a literature of flux and flexibility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bZkwO7Y8qgYC&dq=Brainfade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Water (Dragon Quartet, Vol. Two)","description":"In The Book of Fire and The Book of Air, the final two novels of The Dragon Quartet series, dragons Earth and Water, and their human companions, go up against Fire, who has chosen to become a god instead of a guardian, and search for Air, who has disappeared, as the World teeters on the edge of extinction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZA50zQEACAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Water+(Dragon+Quartet,+Vol.+Two)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diary of Dorcas Good, Child Witch of Salem","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTLuPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Diary+of+Dorcas+Good,+Child+Witch+of+Salem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Expository Preaching","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gkqxSAAACAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Expository+Preaching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Automated Rendezvous and Docking of Spacecraft (Cambridge Aerospace Series)","description":"The definitive reference for space engineers on rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVD/B) related issues, this book answers key questions such as: How does the docking vehicle accurately approach the target spacecraft?

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Set in post-apartheid South Africa, J. M. Coetzee s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. But when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced. Lurie pursues his relationship with the young Melanie whom he describes as having hips  as slim as a twelve-year-old s  obsessively and narcissistically, ignoring, on one occasion, her wish not to have sex. When Melanie and her father lodge a complaint against him, Lurie is brought before an academic committee where he admits he is guilty of all the charges but refuses to express any repentance for his acts. In the furor of the scandal, jeered at by students, threatened by Melanie s boyfriend, ridiculed by his ex-wife, Lurie is forced to resign and flees Cape Town for his daughter Lucy s smallholding in the country. There he struggles to rekindle his relationship with Lucy and to understand the changing relations of blacks and whites in the new South Africa. But when three black strangers appear at their house asking to make a phone call, a harrowing afternoon of violence follows which leaves both of them badly shaken and further estranged from one another. After a brief return to Cape Town, where Lurie discovers his home has also been vandalized, he decides to stay on with his daughter, who is pregnant with the child of one of her attackers. Now thoroughly humiliated, Lurie devotes himself to volunteering at the animal clinic, where he helps put down diseased and unwanted dogs. It is here, Coetzee seems to suggest, that Lurie gains a redeeming sense of compassion absent from his life up to this point. Written with the austere clarity that has made J. M. Coetzee the winner of two Booker Prizes, Disgrace explores the downfall of one man and dramatizes, with unforgettable, at times almost unbearable, vividness the plight of a country caught in the chaotic aftermath of centuries of racial oppression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zVFpDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian and Gay Male Experiences","description":"This psychology textbook provides a comprehensive overview of the central themes and issues in lesbian and gay male studies.

Encounters with the living of Salem, and battles with the ghosts of George Corwin and the Devil himself take the reader on a journey through modern day Salem, and back to the Salem of 1692. Mary English, while walking across Salem Common, comes upon two girls being accosted. One is a descendent of hers, Nora English, and Nora's friend, Lynn March. Mary is able to rescue Nora, but Lynn is brutally raped and murdered by a descendent of George Corwin. Waiting until Halloween night, when the veil between the real world and the other world is the thinnest, Nora, and the spirit of the murdered Lynn, cross over to the other world with the help of Mary English and Lynn's mother, the modem day witch, Lillith March.

From Europe to South Africa and from Latin America to Iraq the German case has been studied to learn how to overcome internal division and regain international recognition. In Pursuit of German Memory: History, Television, and Politics after Auschwitz examines three arenas of German memory politics?professional historiography, national politics, and national public television?that have played a key role in the reinvention of the Nazi past in the past sixty years. Wulf Kansteiner shows that the interpretations of the past proposed by historians, politicians, and television makers reflect political and generational divisions and an extraordinary concern for Germany's perception abroad. At the same time, each of these theaters of memory has developed different dynamics and formats of historical reflection. Kansteiner's interrelated essays offer a comparative analysis of the German scene that reveals a complex and contradictory social geography of collective memory. In Pursuit of German Memory underscores the truth that, while all memory may be local, German memories of Nazism are highly mediated and part of a global exchange of images and story fragments.

His origins and even his age were uncertain. His name was Orlando El Duque Hernandez. He was a fallen hero of Fidel Castro's socialist revolution. The chronicle of El Duque's triumph is at once a window into the slow death of Cuban socialism and one of the most remarkable sports stories of all time. Once hailed as a paragon of Castro's revolution, the finest pitcher in modern Cuban history was banned from baseball for life for allegedly plotting to defect. Instead of accepting his punishment, he fearlessly fought back, defying the Communist party authorities, vowing to pitch again, and ultimately fleeing his country in the bowels of a thirty-foot fishing boat. Here, for the first time and in astonishing detail, the secrets behind El Duque's persecution and escape are revealed. Moving from the crumbling streets of post Cold War Havana to the polarized world of exile Miami, from the deadly Florida Straits to the hallowed grounds of Yankee Stadium, it is a story of cloak-and-dagger adventure, audacious secret plots, the pull of big money, and the historic collision of ideologies. Present throughout are the larger-than-life characters who converged at this bizarre intersection of baseball and politics: El Duque himself, Fidel Castro, the Miami sports agent Joe Cubas, the late John Cardinal O'Connor along with scouts, smugglers, and the Cuban ballplayers who gave up their lives as tools of socialism to test the free market and chase their major-league dreams. Reported in the United States and Cuba by two award-winning journalists who became part of the story they were covering, The Duke of Havana is a riveting saga of sports, politics, liberation, and greed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Vz2j5WPU4AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access for Windows 95 for Dummies Quick Reference","description":"\\" a quick, simple, inexpensive guide to Access.\\"   Antonia E.

Aviezer Tucker examines how the political philosophy of Jan Patocka (19071977), founder of Charter 77, influenced the thinking and political leadership of Vaclav Havel as dissident and president. Presents the first serious treatment of Havel as philosopher and Patocka as a political thinker. Through the Charter 77 dissident movement in Czechoslovakia, opponents of communism based their civil struggle for human rights on philosophic foundations, and members of the Charter 77 later led the Velvet Revolution. After Patocka's self-sacrifice in 1977, Vaclav Havel emerged a strong philosophical and political force, and he continued to apply Patocka's philosophy in order to understand the human condition under late communism and the meaning of dissidence. However, the political/philosophical orientation of the Charter 77 movement failed to provide President Havel with an adequate basis for comprehending and responding to the extraordinary political and economic problems of the postcommunist period. In his discussion of Havel's presidency and the eventual corruption of the Velvet Revolution, Tucker demonstrates that the weaknesses in Charter 77 member's understanding of modernity, which did not matter while they were dissidents, seriously harmed their ability to function in a modern democratic system. Within this context, Tucker also examines Havel's recent attempt to topple the democratic but corrupt government in 19971998. The Philosophy and Politics of Czech Dissidence from Patocka to Havel will be of interest to students of philosophy and politics, scholars and students of Slavic studies, and historians, as well as anyone fascinated by the nature of dissidence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QtfVMIlQoYYC&dq=The+Philosophy+and+Politics+of+Czech+Dissidence+from+Patocka+to+Havel+(Pitt+Russian+East+European)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiral Of Guilt","description":"The murder of fourteen-year-old black girl throws attorney Sidney Adamson McCalastar into turmoil when she is forced to defend the accused killer, who turns out to be the half-brother she never knew.

Delicate pencil sketches, striking ink washes, and colorful photographs show the deep connection Graves had to the places he visited, from the Roman Forum to the Grecian Acropolis to Wiltshires Stonehenge. They also tell something of the education of an architect, bringing to light the classical buildings that caused Graves to reexamine his early devotion to modernism.

The boom in popularity has diversified tarantella in practice while setting it within a host of new, unexpected contexts. Incoronata Inserra ventures into the history, global circulation, and recontextualization of this fascinating genre. Examining tarantella's changing image and role among Italians and Italian Americans, Inserra illuminates how factors like tourism, translation, and world music venues have shifted the ethics of place embedded in the tarantella cultural tradition. Once rural, religious, and rooted, tarantella now thrives in settings urban, secular, migrant, and ethnic. Inserra reveals how the genre's changing dynamics contribute to reimagining Southern Italian identity. At the same time, they translate tarantella into a different kind of performance that serves new social and cultural groups and purposes. Indeed, as Inserra shows, tarantella's global growth promotes a reassessment of gender relations in the Italian South and helps create space for Italian and Italian-American women to reclaim gendered aspects of the genre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S6Y6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Volpone","description":"The three plays collected in this volume depict the faults, errors and foibles of ordinary people with exuberant humour, savage satire and acute observations.

His love life has drawn as much attention as his $2 billion-grossing films. After a long-suffering first wife and a philandering second, his current spouse is a supermodel 25 years his junior, and between each marriage he was seen with a catwalk's worth of women who seemed to live on the cover of Vogue. Stallone: A Rocky Life reveals the emotional background of this most private public figure. Based on exclusive interviews with the star himself, his outspoken mother, his second wife and a host of celebrity colleagues and friends, the book presents an insider's view of the actor. Fans will find the star's personal life as compelling as any of his action adventures. The author also tells the story of Stallone's film career, from cartoon icon to failed comic actor to his incarnation as an overweight anti-hero in the critically acclaimed Cop Land. Stallone: A Rocky Life is a thoughtful examination of a man who faced up to tragedies and setbacks to win fame, fortune and happiness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FxTtNwAACAAJ&dq=Stallone:+A+Rocky+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish mission churches of New Mexico,","description":"Excerpt from Spanish Mission Churches of New Mexico Books almost without number have been written on the Mission Churches of California; they have been pictured hundreds of times in pamphlets and magazines, and there seems to be an unfailing inter est in their quaint architecture and the story of their establishment; but outside of the boundaries of New Mexico, practically nothing is known of the far more interesting structures that render the Sunshine State the paradise of the tourist, the antiquarian, and the religious enthusiast. The elements which unite to make the Missions of New Mexico of much more real interest than those of California, will be treated of in the body of this work, and require only this brief reference here. Both in antiquity and variety, the former have a very great advantage. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

I've doubled as an alligator; I've worked for the Shuberts; and I've been joined to Billy Rose in the holy bonds. I've painted the house boards and I've sold tickets and I've been fired by George M. Cohan. I've played in London before the king and in Oil City before miners with lanterns in their caps.\\" Fanny Brice was indeed show business personified, and in this luminous volume, Herbert G. Goldman, acclaimed biographer of Al Jolson, illuminates the life of the woman who inspired the spectacularly successful Broadway show and movie Funny Girl, the vehicle that catapulted Barbra Streisand to super stardom. In a work that is both glorious biography and captivating theatre history, Goldman illuminates both Fanny's remarkable career on stage and radio--ranging from her first triumph as \\"Sadie Salome\\" to her long run as radio's \\"Baby Snooks\\"--and her less-than-triumphant personal life. He reveals a woman who was a curious mix of elegance and earthiness, of high and low class, a lady who lived like a duchess but cursed like a sailor. She was probably the greatest comedienne the American stage has ever known as well as our first truly great torch singer, the star of some of the most memorable Ziegfeld Follies in the 1910s and 1920s, and Goldman covers her theatrical career and theatre world in vivid detail. But her personal life, as Goldman shows, was less successful. The great love of her life, the gangster Nick Arnstein, was dashing, handsome, sophisticated, but at bottom, a loser who failed at everything from running a shirt hospital to manufacturing fire extinguishers, and who spent a good part of their marriage either hiding out, awaiting trial, or in prison. Her first marriage was over almost as soon as it was consummated, and her third and last marriage, to Billy Rose, the \\"Bantam Barnum,\\" ended acrimoniously when Rose left her for swimmer Eleanor Holm. As she herself remarked, \\"I never liked the men I loved, and I never loved the men I liked.\\" Through it all, she remained unaffected, intelligent, independent, and, above all, honest. Goldman's biography of Al Jolson has been hailed by critics, fellow biographers, and entertainers alike. Steve Allen called it \\"an amazing job of research\\" and added \\"Goldman's book brings Jolson back to life indeed.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer said it was \\"the most comprehensive biography to date,\\" and Ronald J. Fields wrote that \\"Goldman has captured not only the wonderful feel of Al Jolson but the heartbeat of his time.\\" Now, with Fanny Brice, Goldman provides an equally accomplished portrait of the greatest woman entertainer of that illustrious era, a volume that will delight every lover of the stage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HQjOHkTTxksC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver Age Sentinels: d20 Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P_CmtlArnjIC&dq=Silver+Age+Sentinels:+d20+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prescription for Dietary Wellness: Using Foods to Heal 2nd Edition","description":"Like its companion books--the number-one bestselling Prescription for Nutritional Healing and the newer Prescription for Herbal Healing--Prescription for Dietary Wellness offers authoritative information that is research-based and clearly written, making it easy for the reader to quickly find the subjects in which he or she is interested and to incorporate the dietary recommendations into his or her daily life.

Included are in-depth examinations of important figures from the vaudeville stage such as Annette Kellerman and Eva Tanguay.

But, when it came, it seemed to be right, because that essentially is what I am trying to do in this book. \\" Facing\\" is to be understood in the sense of \\"looking at in a steadfast and unflinching manner\\". It thus contrasts with \\"Confronting\\" which has the sense of \\"looking at with hostility and defiance\\". As I face life with its joys and its sorrows, its successes and its failures, its peace and its turmoil, my attitude is one of serene acceptance and gratitude and not one of angry and arrogant confrontation and rejection. The other component of the title - \\"Reality\\" - is the ultimate reality for each of us as conscious beings - our birth - our self-hood in its long stream of becoming throughout our life - our death and apparent annihilation.

The role of the NLF during the war has been hotly debated, with officials in Washington claiming from the outset that the NLF was merely a puppet of Hanoi. Based on over a hundred interviews with former Communist cadre and high ranking Party officials as well as extensive archival research in Viet Nam, Robert K. Brigham's is a definitive work that provides a focus on the NLF not found elsewhere. It contributes greatly to our understanding of the Viet Nam War and encourages a reassessment of that conflict. Brigham assesses the impact of the NLF's diplomatic strategy on the conduct and outcome of hostilities, explores the origin and pursuit of its policy objectives, and defines its true relationship with North Viet Nam. He contends that the NLF's success in convincing the world that it was independent of Hanoi was critical in upsetting the political and military balance in South Viet Nam and frustrating the U.S. war effort. In addition, he argues that differences in goals among Communists building socialism in the north, liberating the south resulted in disagreements over responses to American intervention, and he shows how these differences entered into foreign relations and seriously undermined revolutionary efforts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DRWbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Guerrilla+Diplomacy:+The+NLF%27s+Foreign+Relations+and+the+Viet+Nam+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outburst (Todd Mills Mysteries)","description":"Todd Mills, Minneapolis' only openly gay journalist, is drawn into a high-profile murder case when he becomes the sole witness to the slaying of a gay policeman, a man much like his own lover","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vf9lAAAAMAAJ&dq=Outburst+(Todd+Mills+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Darkest Germany","description":"This book is a collection of letters and observations made by British publisher and humanitarian Victor Gollancz after a visit to the British occupation zone in the fall of 1945, generally critical of the British handling of the humanitarian crisis in Germany during the early months of the occupation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HyhoAAAAMAAJ&dq=In+Darkest+Germany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan 12 Practice Tests for the SAT","description":"Prep for the current SAT with confidence.

So when she wins a contest to write a celebrity profile for Deep Focus magazine, she's equal parts excited and scared, but also ready. She's got this. Soon Josie is jetting off on a multi-city tour, rubbing elbows with sparkly celebrities, frenetic handlers, stone-faced producers, and eccentric stylists. She even finds herself catching feelings for the subject of her profile, dazzling young newcomer Marius Canet. Josie's world is expanding so rapidly, she doesn't know whether she's flying or falling.
