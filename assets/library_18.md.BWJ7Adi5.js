Published by MobileReference (mobi).Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Readers should always remember that while reading. Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, \\"Hard Times\\" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper \\"Household Words.\\" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book at times was challenging to read due to its drab setting (Victorian England) and heavy (read: depressing) subject matter, but its clear message and singularity of theme helped keep me focused: all work and no play makes Jack (or in this case, the Gradgrind children) a dull boy. All in all, an excellent and convincing criticism of Utilitarianism. The characters were well developed and evoked genuine feeling, although ultimately you either hate or feel sorry for all of them. Poor Louisa was piteous, having bypassed childhood and forgone love to slavishly follow her father's iron rule; while Josiah Bounderby elicited the kind of loathing one has for a sleazy politician, the way he concealed his privileged background in order to appear self-made and humble.Despite being almost 150 years old, this tale wasn't dated one bit, and its lessons are appropriate today along the lines of &quot;stop and smell the roses.&quot; However, its teachings are not of the inspirational sort, and to read this I would suggest being free from distractions (you will need to concentrate to get through some of the slower parts), and keeping some sort of emotional pick-me-up nearby afterwards. Lastly, unlike some reviews I have seen, I thought it was seamless, despite its being published in installments."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Although critics dislike Dickens' novels for their twisted, drawn-out plots and his maddening penchant for creating soap-operas in the midst of otherwise realistic plots, these faults must be considered in light of the genre that Dickens wrote for: the magazine serial. Even if one is not fond of the structure of Hard Times, a closer example of the story as a period piece crafted to satisfy the tawdry tastes of the rag-reading public exposes a masterpiece of suspense and morality. A very important work and worth reading with or without this context."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I think everyone can agree right from the start that \\"Hard Times\\" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work. It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" or \\"Great Expectations.\\" But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife. Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station. Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse. They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool. No good deed goes unpunished in \\"Hard Times,\\" but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.Dickens's shortest novel, \\"Hard Times\\" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters. Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing. At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"It is unfortunate that HARD TIMES by Charles Dickens is not usually read outside the classroom. It is an unforgettable glimpse of an age that did not prize the worth of the individual over a collective society--sort of like today's emphasis on the same. What stamps HARD TIMES as the classic that it is is Dickens' continual focus on the rights of the individual and his championing of anti-child labor laws. In an age that routinely crushed individuals in the grinding gears of a society that was hell-bent on automating the factory system, it was only lone voices like Charles Dickens who, in his novels, cried out to stop the madness. In HARD TIMES, Dickens takes a savagely satirical poke at a then popular system of thought: utilitarianism, a philosophy which saw men and children as interchangeable cogs in a machine that demanded that all facets of life and output be reduced to facts, numbers, and quantifiable data. Thomas Gradgrind opens the novel by insisting that the students in his school be just like Officer Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot; fame: give me the facts, and only the facts. Those who can deliver advance. Those who cannot get routinely squashed flat. Josiah Bounderby is the villain as he represents the ultimate in a selfishness and fact-centeredness way of life. As typical of Dickens, there is a vast assortment of subplots that he manages to tie neatly together by the closing pages. What stamps HARD TIMES as relevant in this or any future age is Dickens' insistance that, regardless of technological advances, the individual will always matter. HARD TIMES says this as well as any other book."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times feels like a book that Dickens did not polish nearly as much as the many classics associated with his name. It's the story of the unhappy lives of two children of a father who raised them to speak and appreciate only &quot;facts.&quot; Imagination, fantasy, passion, and the like were all forbidden in their household.Their lives are unhappy, as you'd expect. But they also lack much narrative interest. The usual twists and turns of fate that Dickens invests into his characters' lives are mostly absent. As a result the book drags on. Hard Times also lacks the humor found in other Dickens books, his pithy observations of different persona of his time. So, in reading the uninspiring narrative, you find yourself wishing for something, anything of the old Dickensian magic. Alas, it does not show up.If you have other Dickens titles you're set on reading, read them first. You're likely to enjoy them more."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is a fantastic account of how social history intemingles with economic and politcal history as Dickens is a noted writer for the politcal atmostphere of Victorian Britain. This book takes a hard shot at Utilitarinism and with good reason. The imagery and description in this book are simply brillant. A definate read if you want a look at how it was in the Victorian Era."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This is a totally honest book of life between the lower and upper class. Having lived in the United Kingdom for more than 4 years, I truly appreciate Dicken's description of the physical environements of Coketown. It has so much resemblance of present day London's buildings, especially with regards to the North and South part of the city from Zone two onwards, except for the trailing serpents of smoke.As to the characters so vividly presented and the conversations that were exchanged between them in the course of the narration, I just enjoy the satire on fat old Bounderby, the game being turned upon the Gradgrinds, I think mainly to shame Mr old Tom Gradgrind for his stiff-necked beliefs in 'hard facts'. The consoling fact is he did learnt his lessons.Poor Mrs Gradgrind. It was a pity that she had to be killed off so soon in the story. If she had been alive till the end, what would she say to her daughter's divorce, her son's connection with the bank robbery and Bounderby big fat lies? Probably nothing but something she would never hear the last of!I don't know much on how to comment with a literature eye, but I think Dickens did write pretty well here. I would not hesitate to read it again but since I still have a lot of other books to peruse, I may just as well skip this second reading till later..."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"While this is certainly one of Dickens' shorter novels, that does not stop me from considering it an exquisite masterpiece. In all honesty &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is full of chilling passages and convincing characters such as Thomas and Louisa Gradgrind. There is not one single dull moment. Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well. But, don't let the thin length of &quot;Hard Times&quot; fool you. It is a masterpiece and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"To be quite honest, I didn't find this book overly entertaining. However, though you may call me old-fashioned, I still believe there is educational value to reading. And the book is educational. For openers, it provides us a picture of the world in which Dickens lived. It isn't a very attractive picture, but it is probably an accurate one. The city of Coketown was dirty; its inhabitants breathed polluted air; they struggled to make ends meet. There were a few exceptions among the upper echelon, like Bounderby who owned a country home to which he could retreat. But for the most part, the citizens of Coketown were trapped in a day-to-day mundane existence that didn't offer many bright spots. There's no way I would want to trade places.The book is also revealing in other ways. We learn of the class structures of Dickens' day. We learn of the silly pretensions and the airs people of the upper class put on. Morality and integrity seem mostly limited to the lower class, particularly the circus. Dickens gives us a picture of education that is dreary, directed at the head and away from the heart. The carrying out of justice seems somewhat elusive. In the words of Stephen Blackpool, \\"its all a muddle.\\" This could be a summary of the times. Things do seem to be pretty messed up.Still, the book has its appeal. I think for me, the best part was the descriptions of the characters. They definitely weren't complex or sophisticated. On the contrary, they were almost too obvious in their representation of the roles they played. They remind me of facades of a building on a movie set. Bounderby is constantly bragging that he \\"came from a ditch.\\" His character reminds me of so many people who thrive on a sense of their own importance. Tom was a whiner--please, spare me the privileged child who is never satisfied and always looking to be bailed out. Louisa needed to get some gumption and stop doing everything according to the book. For Pete's sakes, forget your upbringing and get a life! Sissy was fun; and Rachael was admirable. Stephen Blackpool got quite a bit of ink devoted to him. Had his character had a better command of the English language we might actually have been able to understand what he was saying. Oh, well. The best characters, without a doubt, were Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer. Mrs. Sparsit gets the Oscar for best female in a comedy role; Bitzer for the character everyone loves to hate. The circus people deserve at least a mention; they definitely add some color to the novel.So, no, its not a must-read, in my opinion. But I've definitely read a lot worse. You must take fair warning, though. Nearly everyone I know has to power through at least the first half of the book. Eventually it gains some momentum, and you'll probably want to finish it. Even if you're not crazy about the book, you can still mention you've read something by Charles Dickens. Someone somewhere might actually be impressed."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Pretty much, the beginning and the middle of this book is pretty dull. The thing that really saves it towards the middle. So I would not read this book if you are looking for something gripping or that will really make you eager to find out what is going to happen next. The book is simply put a drama with no positive turning points until the end. The ending of a book is really inportant to me. This book has a good ending , so that raises the from my point of view.The book was kind of hard to follow for me. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that there are too many characters. There is at least twenty. Some of these characters are Louisa, Mr. Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind, Sissy Jupe, and Stephen Blackpool. Stephen Blackpool's story was very sad and really affected my emotions as I read it. I also felt that Sissy Jupe went through a lot but stayed strong through her troubles.The basic storyline is this: Mr. Gradgrind opens a private school that teaches his philosophy: facts only! He is the father of Tom and Louisa. Louisa has been preplanned to marry Mr. Bounderby, a banker that is twice her age. She does not like this.This book also does not teach good morals and the reading level is pretty high. I would say that anyone who reads this book should be at least 15 years old. I pretty much have mixed feelings for this book."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"this book is hard to understand and boring"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is a book written in older Brittish convention style. The way this story was written I could hardly understand,because I'am not used to reading the older english version.A book like this one would be for someone who can definitly read,and understand almost every form of writing. It's mainly about innocent lives simply being tooken away.This included family, adults, and children,knowing at that time age didn't matter.If you were one of killer's victoms ,most likely you would lose your life.That is what made it so hard for many people to calmly contiue on with thier lives',because they were worried about their safty.Just letting you know, I would not recommend reading this book ,If you're someone like me who dosn't understand the old english version used in this text.This story included characters such as Mr.Marmel,the Welp,Mr.Grandgrind,Hart House, Mrs. Pegler and Rachel.They are all involved in those particular pressures of life in that city. So if you believe you have the right tools to recieve what \\"Hard Times\\" is spouting out to you, I will not hold you back. I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping &quot;Germinal&quot;. For the best critique of Dickens, read &quot;Against Nature&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"&quot;Is there anything more dull than this damn book?&quot; - Gradgrind"},{"Title":"Monday or Tuesday","review":"Monday or Tuesday by Virginia Woolf.

Mr. Hoeppner seems to have taken expectaction apart and created a new faith in what the life around us can mean. I like the feeling that he is moving through time and place gathering the most unlikely things and fitting them together. I think that Mr. Hoeppner explores a lovely level of honesty with what we want, and what we can and can't have. Mostly, I like the way this book of poetry returns me to the world with such a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, and my place within them.Poems like Red Shoulders and Landscape Minus Figures were the first to draw me in, but in the end I think the real, original beauty of this book lies in poems like Six Compulsory Figures, Spell, Its Thousand Pale Shadows, and Spirits of Place. In these poems especially there is not so much a story--it feels like Mr. Hoeppner is drawing life close around him, attuning himself to the details. It reminds me somehow of Alice falling down the rabbit hole, picking off marmalade from one shelf with curious wonder, and putting on another shelf further on.This is a complex collection of many different kinds of poems which each have value. Read it more than once."},{"Title":"Five Golden Rings","review":"Boy was I glad that I found this book at a thrift store for $1, otherwise I would have been very dissapointed.1st story: Fern Michaels - A Bright Red Ribbon: Alone in her car, a weary traveler becomes lost in a blizzard. But a dog wearing a scarlet ribbon will lead Morgan Ames to a safe haven...and into the arms of a most unlikely hero.How did Fern Michaels get to be so famous? Sorry to all the fans of hers out there, but I think her writing stinks! This book reads like something I would have written when I was 14. I never even got more than ten pages into before I skipped to next story. I mean, a woman barges into a man's house, through a doggie door of all things, and he goes into a twenty line speech, (saying \\"Sorry I wasn't here to welcome you\\" - what? He's never even seen her before!) and at the end, he's already telling her that he has a warm robe in the spare bedroom where she can stay. Huh? Completely unrealistic. He's never even seen her before, and he's already going into details like the fact that he's got a robe for her. I mean, where's the, \\"Oh my gosh, as you all right? Where did you come from?\\" Nope, he just starts talking her head off. I read one other of Fern Michaels novellas, and also thought that it could have been written by a teenager. I understand that writers take creative liscence, but a story needs a semblance of realism. No stars if I could - one begrudgingly.2nd Story: Kat Martin - Christmas Angel: Despite having been on opposite sides of the war, Yankee doctor Josh Coltrane is unprepared for the continued bitterness of long-lost love Angel Summers. Can these two former sweethearts learn to forgive and forget the past?I had high hopes for this one. It has so many elements that I love: it's historical, a civil war story, and reunited lovers. But then I got to the part when some straggling Confederate soldiers try to rape Angel. Josh of course shows up with a gun and saves her. And what does Angel do? She begs him to let her attackers go, because \\"the war made them this way\\". Again, completely unrealistic. I guess the author was just trying to show how understanding and kind she was, but I just didn't buy it. No decent man will rape a woman, no matter what he's been through. They deserved to go to jail for what they did, but they didn't. That disgusted me so much that I again skipped to the next story. Two stars, since it started off well.3rd Story: Jo Beverly - Twelfth Night: Lady Alice Conyngham was jilted exactly six years ago. Now, at this year's Christmas festival, she must face the scandal of years past and the gentleman to whom she'd given her heart.One of the better stories in this anthology, and the most \\"Christmassy\\" one. While it's not one I would bother re-reading, it was entertaining. I liked reading about the old traditions, especially the game \\"snapdragon\\". Four stars.4th Story: Katherine Sutcliffe - Home for Christmas: Virginia Valemere is barely handing on to her prized horses. Her father's desperate need for medical attention may tip her over the edge. Virginia's enigmatic new neighbor Dr. Neil Ellison could wind up being her hope for salvation, or her ruin.Another so-so story which was not quite as good as the last. Good for one read, but not to re-read. Had the \\"small-town\\" thing going for it, which was quite pleasant. Three stars.5th Story: Brenda Joyce - The Miracle: In a remote castle on a windswept island, an American beauty challenges a wild Irish nobleman...and finds that after innocence, passion comes -- and a very special Christmas gift.Not a very \\"Christmassy\\" story, but the best one of the bunch. This story is written about two minor characters, Lisa Ralston and Julian St. Clare who appeared in \\"After Innocence\\". You do not have to read that story first (I haven't), this story stands very well by itself. Wow! No one can write romantic tension like Brenda Joyce! This was the first of her stories that I read, but it certainly won't be the last. This story was already printed in \\"A Gift of Joy\\", so if you own that already, this is a reissue of that same story.

If you use it to get more insight in standard user interface and navigation structures, you will not find it. This book is not about defining the 'ideal' navigation or garanteed successful interface. Quite the opposite.See, here is another approach to this thing called the web: what if you do not assume your user/visitor to be an idiot? What if the actual concept of using a website is part of the content and experience the designer wants you to have? It will result in some of the work shown in this publication. Where the user is not taken by the hand and force-fed how to use an interface.You can argue if this is needed, or if this approach even has a contribution to the world of internet. I for one think it has. The web is a means to exchange ideas and thoughts, just as it is a communication tool for business and information. There is simply not one truth or one rule to be followed. And if you do not see the relevance of experiment in how to communicate, use the book to see just where the usability goes overboard, and learn from that :-) But it never hurts to open your mind/eyes to the new and unexpected, even if it does not make immediate sense or logic. This book serves to do just that."},{"Title":"72 dpi","review":"I can find only one use for this book. It is an excellent example of what NOT to do when designing user interfaces.

At the beginning of the story, Niko, Tempus's right-side companion, quits the Stepsons. Cut off from the Sacred Band, he falls victim to the Nisibisi witch, Roxane, and worse. The Band becomes embroiled in assassination and skullduggery in this searing conclusion to the Wizard Wars.Whether you've read any other \\"Beyond\\" books by Janet Morris, or any other Thieves' World books, the deft characterization and surprising plot twists in \\"Beyond Wizardwall\\" will enthrall you. Four strong women, including Tempus's daughter, join the Sacred Banders in this epic fantasy, which climaxes in a surprising twist at the Festival of Man, where Stepsons compete against the best warriors in all the empires and supernatural forces back their favorites to win out over ancient evil....Beyond Wizardall begins in Tyse, town darker and more mysterious than Sanctuary, and takes us on a break-neck ride where mortals fear to tread. New characters and new challenges face the Stepsons, who must sort out the sorcerous from the merely inimical as emperors fall and Nikodemos's life hangs by a thread. A book that will have you on the edge of your chair. A must for fans of the Sacred Band of Stepsons. I lived it; I loved it; so will you."},{"Title":"Beyond Wizardwall","review":"In this third of the three Sacred Band books about the war for Wizardwall, Niko quits the Stepsons, things go from bad to worse, and I loved every minute of watching Tempus get his Sacred Banders through the dangers facing them. Strategy and tactics reign supreme in this book. The horses are fast, the swords are sharp, the women are powerful, and the Sacred Band fights true to its oath, to the death, with honor, to free Nisibis from the black sorcery and evil empire that threaten it. Gods and sorcerers and witches and even the weather choose up sides in this climax to the three volume 'Beyond Sanctuary' series. Each of these books was a Science Fiction Book Club Selection as well as a hardback and softcover and 'authorized\\" Thieves World novels. In retrospect, these three books belong to the Sacred Band of Stepsons series, but I have friends who are combat veterans and who've have never read Thieves World who read these with glee. Tyse, where the band is based, reminds one of a combination of Beirut and Afghanistan, horses and all.Ancient historical fantasy at its highest octave, or maybe ancient military fantasy. Or may heroic fiction, as the tags say, but never your run-of-the-mill fantasy. A book you'll want to read more than once, for certain. The Morrises continue to defy categorization, but in the best possible way."},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"I read this book and couldn't help thinking that I was just &quot;hearing&quot; an account of someone's life. I felt as if I was missing something which I was. And it came out in the last sentence of this amazing and I don't know how she does it book by Joyce Carol Oates. Between &quot;Them&quot;, &quot;Do With Me What You Will&quot;. &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;, and Short Stories written by this woman, I don't know how she knows, how can she get into &quot;our&quot; lives, &quot;our&quot; minds, &quot;our&quot; thoughts, and write so knowingly and correctly about life with such feeling and understanding, I'll never comprehend, just wish if only I had the insight and ability she has. A friend years ago said this book was written as if about my personal family and knowledge she had about our life, but this book was everyone's story, no one could not relate. Again, I thank Joyce Carol Oates for her knowing. I am sure she would understand the previous sentence."},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"It was Virginia Woolf who decried the lack of literature about the lives of the masses, the everyday folk: &quot;All these infinitely obscure lives remain to be recorded,&quot; she said. Of course, she didn't promise to read them!In MARYA, A LIFE, Oates attempts to fill that void. Marya is a portrait of a modern woman from a bewildered childhood to a womanhood that commands admiration, respect and love. She is a loner, bright and different from the people around her. She strives for self understanding and fulfillment.Joyce Carol Oates is a meticulous storyteller and a vivid writer. I wonder if this is autobiographical. If so, the Woolf reference becomes irrelevant. Oates is definitely ordinary folk -- she is one of the finest and most recognized writers on the contemporary American literary scene.But if you're in the mood for a book about a woman growing up and &quot;making it&quot; on her own, you'll enjoy this one.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"The atmosphere in this book is similar to that in other of Oates' novels - - it borders on Gothic Modern.The protagonist is a brilliant, somewhat bizarre loner, a survivor of a dysfunctional family. Her life is spent in proud, purposeful separateness. This becomes so natural for her that the reader does not know if other possibilities or options exist.There is always the threat of a hurricane of emotions behind the facade of calm. It is always understated but we know that only the surface emotions are portrayed. The protagonist shays she's never cried because she's afraid that if she does she will never stop.I love the work of this author. This book will not disappoint if you enjoy the dark, mysterious and bizarre side of human nature. Oates gets this just right."},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"Our book club chose \\"Marya: a Life,\\" so I came to it with no foreknowledge. (The only Oates I had read was her stunning short story, \\"Where Are You Going Where Have You Been.\\") I found \\"Marya\\" far better than most of its recent reviews indicate. It is a tough-minded, beautifully-written look at the early years of a writer who has risen from mean beginnings to find success in the world. It is a far stonger book, in my mind, than book club favorites such as \\"Liar's Club\\" or \\"The Glass Castle,\\" both of which are good books in their own rights.That said, the paperback edition was a huge disappointment -- it was poorly typeset/printed, to the point where it was unpleasant to read. Fortunately, several Amazon sellers had used hardback copies. I recommend that route should you chose to read this excellent coming-of-age book."},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"This is another great book by Oates, that really takes you into the mind of the character. At times it is a bit erratic, and even tedious, but in a style that makes you want to read on. It is a good read if you love the descriptive style of Oates and don't require a lot of dialog and action to maintain your attention."},{"Title":"Marya: A Life","review":"This incredibly prolific author has readily admitted to this novel as her most autobiographical. Marya whirlwinds through the brutality of schoolyard life, the angst of adolescence, the trials of academia, the upsets of failed relationships. In the loosest sense, this is a Bildungsroman, the tale of a young person on the make. If one scene in the novel stands in the reader's memory, it would be an episode about a third of the way through when the school's English teacher is tormented by the class to the point of nervous breakdown.. The episode invites comparison with what happens early along in another Bildungsroman, Richler's THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ.This story is Marya's life, but in some strange way Marya is an outsider, someone less at the centre of events than someone pushed round by them. Self-awareness is her salvation; if not for Marya, then for everyone around her we are reminded of Nietzsche's words about nondescript people who register their presence in the world with a kind of dumb amazement. Everything Marya does shows her on a level of understanding far beyond that of her kin, her classmates, her coworkers. Halfway through the novel (p. 137), we have the intellectually precocious Marya, for whom \\"every word of LEAR [was] hooked in flesh and could not be dislodged.\\" [218 words]"},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"O'Reilly should really offer refunds on this book.

You sigh with relief thinking that maybe now the author will provide some insight. This hope will evaporate quickly, sad to say. First, the author wants to enlighten you by providing an in-depth analysis of \\"Problems, Solutions and Problem Solving\\".Let me share a couple of mangled sentences from this section:\\"To deliver valued solutions (maximum quality and minimum cost within the minimum time), organizations must capture (acquire), communicate (share), and leverage (utilize) knowledge.\\"And later in the same section:\\"In addressing this problem, an overall approach must address how we will understand or conceptualize the problem, derive a solution to the problem, and implement or realize the solution. This approach will determine how we view the problem (paradigm) for the purpose of realizing it. We will apply our knowledge of the situation and other rules of thumb (heuristics) gained from other experiences to derive the solution (artifacts). Our effort will be organized (life cycle) as a series of (possibly concurrent) steps (activities) so that it may be managed to develop the resulting information system.\\"Uuuhhh, and when do we get to start talking about UML? Spare us the attempts at philosophy. We know what problems and solutions are.

They specify an overall problem-solving approach and its components. They specify how problems and solutions are viewed in relation to a problem-solving approach; this is known as a method's 'descriptive' aspect since it describes how knowledge is captured and communicated regarding a problem and solution. Methods also specify a problem-solving approach to be used to solve the problem and derive a solution; this is known as a methods 'prescriptive' aspect since it prescribes how knowledge is leveraged to solve a problem. Methods specify descriptively how problems and solutions are viewed, and prescriptively how the problem-solving effort may be actualized.\\"Do you feel edified from reading this passage?

The rest is horrid.I am comfortable with UML and, most importantly, it's application in a process environment to substantial development projects. I seriously doubt the author has ever broken out of the campus viewpoint.The writing is repetitive and annoying. It is annoying to read this book. Each sentence repeats the prior sentence is a slightly different way that becomes annoying. The book repeats the same information in an annoying manner...sorry, apparently it is contagious. Dont laugh, this paragraph could very EASILY be in the book somewhere.With writing like this there is no wonder as to why bulleted lists where used.

The types of computer book I own could be loosely categorised under the headings of Overview, General Subject Coverage, The Practical Usage Of, Academic and Reference, and I would place &quot;UML In A Nutshell&quot; in the last of these. The books' three sections are: i) an excellent coverage of the meta-issues of development, such as modelling languages, problem solving and the nature of Object Orientation. ii) a concise reference covering the use of the UML. iii) a detailed description of each of the diagramming types in a quick reference format, plus supplementary information on e.g. the Object Constraint Language. Within each section, extensive use of bullet points combined with paragraphs of text and sophisticated diagrams delivers the material in a disciplined manner. Due to the nature of the UML, and the very large amount of detail in the book, it is necessary to expend considerable effort on gaining a full appreciation of the material, effort which will be repaid many times over in correct use of the language. In my view, writing as a commercial software developer, the book is excellent in its stated role - A Desktop Quick Reference. However, those intent on studying the UML must understand that the subject is MUCH more demanding than, say, making basic use of a modern programming language. This is NOT a thousand page, lightweight coverage of the latest commercial development environment, which often demand relatively little skill for basic usage. This is a concise, extremely well thought out REFERENCE work, allowing the reader access to the most subtle and powerful aspects of this sophisticated modelling language. It is ideal to supplement UML books designed for beginners, typically when they begin to ask questions of the &quot;what does this concept actually MEAN, &amp; how does it fit into the broader picture ?&quot; variety. I am very glad to have added &quot;UML In A Nutshell&quot; to my expanding collection of texts on this fascinating subject. Well done, again, O'Reilly."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I think the people who reviewed this book, tried to learn UML from it. Bad idea.

As a software professional and teacher, I think this is a different kind of effort. I have got an Indian edition of the book and low-priced editions of both the UML user's guide and reference guide by the Three Amigoes are also available in India. I do not think this book can pose any competition to the Three Amigoes' books. But as a short and quick reference it should serve some purpose.The numerous errors however should not be ignored. O'Reilly or no O'Reilly, I really do not think that any good book should contain so many errors. The errata, which I found in O'Reilly's site however, is a good compensatory effort."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"This book was extremely significant to me, and reading it was a very positive experience. However, I cannot take issue with a lot of the comments posted thus far for this book.I have read Grady Booch's UML User's Guide, the UML Specifications, James Rumbaugh's OMT Book (from 91), and Desmond D'Souza's Catalysis work. Though I have plunged through each work at least twice, there were still some significant missing links, and this book was a great help in filling many of these in (how Use Cases relate to Sequence &amp; Coll. Diagrams; how Use Cases can use signals (Statechart events); and the real difference in Statechart and Activity diagrams).For those who wanted a quick course in UML, with some well thought-out examples... I can understand their disappointment. It is unfortunate that the online purchasers could not read the author's preface, which states that the reader should have UML experience before diving in. It is a quick reference, not a tutorial, and that difference is huge. I own the Java in a Nutshell book, and I _could not_ learn Java from it... it was useful only after I discovered the basics somewhere else. So I believe O'Reilly stuck to their original Nutshell philosophy, and should not be attacked for not handholding every beginner.I quite enjoyed the first few chapters, which were a metamodel of terms that underly the entire structure of problem solving... an interesting philisophical discussion worthy of three or four reads (and worthy of its own book)! The UML introduction chapters were far too short to be of use (as anyone who has tried to read or write a comprehensive example in UML will notice). However, the reference chapters on the individual UML elements are written well... the bulleted lists and removal of examples make for a quick, uncomplicated, unclouded read. You can always hope for more (any UML book under 500 pages that claims to be comprehensive is suspect... UML is sooo powerful, its applications are illimitable), but for a light 250 page, $20 book, I was quite satisfied. Find a bookstore, flip through chapter 2 and the reference chapters, and see for yourself.When in the field using UML, I have my notes from Booch's User Guide, and a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I started UML with this book and immediately switched over to Martin Fowlers book, but later when I got a good overview of what UML says then this book was a real reference (quick reference).

I'm getting my money back.What happened here, O'Reilly?"},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"When I write a review this bad, I feel that my objections must be as specific and concrete as possible. The good news is that the book gives me plenty to work with.First is the writing style. Nearly all of the text is bulleted lists or hierarchies of bulleted lists. At best, it's an un-natural reading style. This isn't the best, though. Some of the lists go on for pages. Most annoying is that most bullet items start with incomplete sentences. At times, I felt desperate for a whole sentence with subject and verb.Second is the style of illustration. I don't insist that every author be a trained graphic designer. A few basics should be obvious, though. Here's one: at least within any one picture, use different line styles to encode different information or to create contrast. Figure 2-8 uses lots of different styles to say the same thing, fig. 3-7 uses one style to say lots of different things, and fig 5-7 appears to use one line drawn in styles (weights) that change when it turns a corner. These are just examples, by the way, not a complete catalog of problem illustrations or even of kinds of problems.The worst, though, is the technical content. The first half of the book isn't UML at all, it's an introduction to OO design (compared to two different earlier styles) and development process. I generally found the discussions so brief as to border on meaningless. If I wasn't already familiar with the topics, I doubt that I could have figured out what the machine-gun bulleted lists were trying to express. I feel sorry for the beginner trying to learn from these chapters.Even the UML, the second half of the book, suffered from the same brevity and opaque style. The section on state charts, in particular, managed to show only the pieces but never how they fit into a whole state machine. It was as if I showed you a box full of nuts, bolts, wheels, and handles, and expected you to understand what a tricycle is. The section on activity diagrams, however, was short enough to qualify as negligent. I can't even criticize the content, because there's almost nothing there to criticize.I can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"This book focuses on how to create effective and correct UML diagrams, not on software design, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on software design. I use this book as a reference when I want a concise explanation or clarification on how to depict an idea in a UML diagram.Most of the information is presented as an outline of key points--there is little fluff or detail. I attend many lectures and seminars and actually enjoyed that format, but it can be disconcerting to readers.Part I of the book provides a short overview of UML and OO that I often refer to people just becoming familiar with the concepts. While the information can be found in many texts, its conciseness seemed to give me new insights.Part II provides a brief tutorial in UML. Inasmuch as one cannot effectively learn how to model by just reading a book, if you are new to software design you will probably want a book with more examples and diagrams. However, if you're familiar with modeling techniques and have been exposed to UML, this section offers a very condensed summation of the purposes and construction of UML diagramsm.Part III is the &quot;quick reference&quot; section. Each diagram type is covered by a chapter along with a chapter on overall diagram organization, UML extension mechanisms, and even the Object Constraint Language. As mentioned before, each chapter is brief, concise, and highlights key points. I find it helps me focus on the key points of the diagram which I find valuable when I'm in the middle of diagramming and am not sure how exactly to express something.If you are looking to learn UML, this is not the book to buy.

On balance, there is not a lot of narrative in the book. What is there, is very dense:\\"The object-oriented paradigm is reducible to the function-driven paradigm or the data-driven paradigm. That is, while using the object-oriented paradigm, activities can be skewed to independently leverage function-driven concepts or data-driven concepts in a given problem-solving approach.\\" (p 66)So after several reads, the language still feels out of reach. I've gotten another book to help me teach myself: UML and the Unified Process (ASIN 0201770601).Using the two books together, I'm making much greater strides.And when I have learned UML, I am sure In a Nutshell will be a very useful reference."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"Err, I blasted this book in a previous review a year or so ago.

I wonder if this book is reaching the right audience. I believe that most of the bad reviews come from people with little to no experience in UML. Also, don't forget that UML is a concept, a way of thinking. You can learn UML, but that doesn't mean that you understand the full concept. People who are confused, and are lost when they read the bulleted points in this book may write some of the bad reviews.This book is not for those who are planning on starting to explore UML, or for those who are not comfortable with using the concept. Don't expect to get up and running quickly in UML-based design by reading this book. You have to understand object-oriented analysis and design and the modeling techniques in the UML.Although the book has editing errors and needs improvement, it is definitely a good reference for anyone with a firm foundation in UML.

The author's attempt at describing the basic O-O paradigm is possibly the most convoluted explanation I've ever seen.

IMO, this is just one example of many failed attempts at describing simple concepts. I started to wonder if the author was paid by the syllable."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"This book looks like the author just copied the text from a series of PowerPoint slides. The vast majority of the text comes in the form of bulleted lists, and any text outside that is repetitive, echoing either itself or the lists. The lists themselves are poorly organized: information that is hierarchical in nature, is not presented hierarchically. (Instead, it's just presented as a sequence of lists.) So as a result, this text is useful neither as a reference, nor as a tutorial.I'd give this book only a half star if that were possible. The half star would be for the following useful information from the book: (1) the table of contents provides a quick overview of UML, (2) there's an appendix with \\"web resources\\". This amounts to about 5 pages of useful content.If you want an introduction to UML, I highly recommend Martin Fowler's \\"UML Distilled\\". If you want a reference, there's the User's Guide and Reference from Addison-Wesley, plus the web site...Save your money.

The outline approach should have taken fewer words to describe the material, but the book failed. The text was overly wordy and cryptic.

The diagrams only make it worse.Author seemed very knowledgeable and two more times through the editor/review process would probably produce an excellent educated text on the material.Taking the book back and looking at some of the other reviewed books on this site.Had good experience with the &quot;in a nutshell&quot; brand, so bought the book without doing a serious flipthrough. Won't do that again."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"My first reaction to this book after I started to read it was accckkk. The first two chapters are absolutely horrid, they read like someone's class notes from a seminar that were only meant to make sense to them. The intro is the usual waste (I really wonder why nutshell books have them... Who cares about the whole history of UML...If I care I'm sure I can find it on the net somewhere).If I had it to do all over again, I'd still buy this book, if only for the tutorial. I've been using UML for a little while to illustrate points, but decyphering the writing of people who work for Rational is always a challange. They tend to use the long wordy circular sentences that may be useful for achedemic discussions, but really aren't good for doing actual work. The writing style is easier than those for sure but its somewhat strained. I can't quite put my finger on it. I could care less if its correct grammar or not as long as I get the point. The problem is a lot of the writing gives me pause. I understand in the end, but its unnatural.My next major gripe is with the editor. If you have a reference to a diagram it should be on the same page or opposite page as the text. I can understand if you introduce it the page before but if I have to turn two pages to look at the diagram you're referencing, its pretty darn annoying.You'll definately need more than this book to learn UML and more than this book to practice it, but it has its place. Its just a pity that there isn't much of an alternative."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"As some readers already mentioned, it is not a book for someone who wants to learn UML.

I was attracted by the fact that what I expected would be a torturous journey could be reduced to the 260 pages by O'Reilly in an inexpensive handbook,&quot;UML in a Nutshell&quot; . I was also curious if the book was being 'thumbs downed' by Amazon customers reviewing the book because of the difficult nature of UML or because of how the topic was being presented in the book. I haved concluded it has been a bit of both.I took a careful look at the comments of reviewers who have all extensive experience with UML.Most conclude that the text is comprehensive, not a small feat in 260 pages. Of these pros, not one stated the diagrams were inaccurate. (Of the 140 pages I read I found the presentation of the diagrams very instructive). I conclude that the experienced user is so happy to have a comprehensive 'pocket handbook' for UML and is so confortable with the UML syntax that they find the weakness in the writing style of minor consequence.On the other hand, the mass of technophiles that have various intermediate levels, who always expect a book to present information in a clear fashion hits headlong into what they perceive as serious weaknesses in the writing style. Mix this with a dastardly hard subject matter and you have a recipe for a closed book and bad review.On reading further into the text I found that the writing style problems occured with varying frequently but were not pervasive throughout the text. Some of the most annoying aspects of the presentation were unfortunately placed right where first impressions would turn many readers off.The book gets off to a bad start in the Intro using the patronizing approach popular in some training camps, colleges and modular courses where the first paragraph is dedicated to telling you what you'll understand after reading the module. I never liked being told what I will know after reading something. I'll know what I'll know!&quot; This approach to the chapter header is only used in the first three chapters.Then there's the big criticism of the text being bulleted to death. This is most evident in the Intro which probably should be bulleted to the appendix or beyond. Better though, would be to rewrite the Intro chapter in carefully worded prose. When the author uses this bullet style, he does so with way too many points attached. As c_barron put it &quot;After reading a dozen bullet points, all incomplete sentences that don't even sound right unless you make a mental note to repeat &quot;The UML&quot; before it, you tend to lose track of what the author's point was to begin with&quot;.// c_barron is a customer/reviewer of the book at the Amazon siteThe UML Big Picture is the second chapter, is bulleted less and is easier to read. This would probably have been better as the first chapter. Here the author uses another technique that is distracting. As _rread put it, &quot;I completely (totally) concur (agree) with the other reviewer's assessment (review) of the book in listed on this page. If you find this style of writing annoying (aggravating) then you will not enjoy (like or appreciate) this book.&quot;// _rread is also a customer/reviewer of the book at the Amazon siteWhat _rread is describing is the provision of another term meaning the same as the first in brackets. I think we know where the author is coming from. In this highly defined verbal environment he is giving in brackets a formally accepted alternative word to describe the same thing. This can be good or annoying depending on your perspective. I found on reading sections a second time I was able to ignore these brackets. Let me find you a real quote so you can judge for yourself. I'll use a bullet from what I think was a not too popular Intro chapter.&quot;The UML - Is a language. It is not simply a notation for drawing diagrams, but a complete language for capturing knowledge (semantics) about a subject and expressing knowledge (syntax)regarding the subject for the purpose of communication. &quot;When a subject is so 'languagey', it might be better to pick a word, go with it leave the alternatives out.In some chapters the author sounds like he is studying for admission to the bar using a form of repetition. This is a long but good quote to show this. [page 112]&quot;The Class concept is an instance of the metamodel Thing concept. Classes are a description of a set of objects with common structural features, behavioral features, relationships and semantics. They are used to model a set of entities with common characteristics. The Object concept is an instance of the meta-metamodel Thing concept. Objects are instances of classes. They are used to model particular entities. The Association concept is an instance of the meta-metamodel Thing concept. Associations are descriptions of a set of links with comon structural features, behavioral features, relationships and semantics. They are used to model a set of relationships that relate two or more other entities where the relationships have common characteristics. The Link concept is an instance of the metametamodel Thing concept. Links are instances of associations. They are used to model instances of relationships that relate two or more objects. Associations relate classes and Links relate objects. &quot;Although there is some merit in this technique would it not be better to collect similarities where convenient and get the relationship between the concepts out front. For instance,In UML, the concepts of the Class, the Object, the Association and the Link are all instances of the meta-metamodel Thing concept. Associations are used to relate classes and Links to relate objects.Classes are a description of a set of objects (with common structural features, behavioral features, relationships and semantics). They are used to model a set of entities with common characteristics. Objects are instances of classes. They are used to model particular class entities.These are the author own words, just less of them and focused differently..Another chapter that was good was the Tutorial. The chapter on Object Orientation was a little weak. I teach object-oriented programming, but still had a hard time relating what I knew to the what being conceptualized in this chapter. In fairness to the author, I believe this is due to the terminology the 'three amigoes' have selected to package generic object-oriented programming in the UML.But there my criticism ends. I'm glad I have the book. The one chapter I read from the Quick reference section was just right. I know if I was trying to design something in UML the Quick Reference chapters 6 to 16 would be a quick, concise and handy summary of the rules and details of the given topic area which would assist in getting the diagrams and symbols of UML right.ConclusionIn conclusion I think 'UML in a Nutshell' is an excellent effort to provide a synopsis of a very large and difficult subject area. I think the book was ready for prime time in terms of content. Perhaps out of haste or exhaustion or who knows, the book went out the door in a somewhat beta condition from a language point of view, another small irony.I had an amusing afterthought. The manuscript was submitted to proof reader's at O'Reilly to review but none of them could stand UML enough to get through to discover the grammarical weaknesses! I, for one, would not blame them for failing in such a quest!This is a great book, still in the rough, and I would encourage the author (or one of the O'Reilly editors) to refine it into a classic for the next edition."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"Every time I ... buy a technical book without checking Amazon.com for the reviews I end up kicking myself, and this time is no exception. This book is almost completely impossible to read - it is a tangle of repetitive bullet points torn from some cursed corner of academia. When the author does take the time to write a complete sentence it is riddled with odd parenthetical notes that are less than helpful. And the diagrams, at least in the initial chapters, are arcane, in my opinion rather silly, but mostly just needlessly confusing.I found myself skipping larger and larger sections of the text at a time looking for some island of clarity from which I could learn something valuable without too much squinting and ended up skipping all the way through the book.Of all the topics that should be treated in a clear, straightforward manner, coverage of a modeling language designed to facilitate communication pretty much tops the list - so if you are a collector of irony, this book would make a nice addition to your collection. Otherwise, I'd select another title."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I don't normally write reviews but this book was just too much to pass up. I swear I have seen this skit on SNL where some guy just explains something an absurd degree and confuses everyone. This is that skit in book form.For example (I was laughing when I read this) on page 52 where the author is describing objects, the 4th bullet says, &quot;Objects - May be of a simple or complex data type (should have stopped here) Simple data types are not reducible to any subordinate parts. Complex data types are conglomerates reducible to subordinate parts.&quot;I think someone published his dissertation at O'Reilly.Let me say to the folks who gave this book five stars and think that these other people just don't know enough to be in the ballgame, I respectable disagree with you. I have worked with OOA&amp;D and the UML for several years now and I just found this book to be a mediocre reference at best. You are correct, it is not for beginners but a book still needs to be interesting, provide concrete examples and in-depth analysis into the most important aspects of good object-oriented analysis and design. In my opinion, this book really offers none of that.If you really want a great book that will keep you reading like a Tom Clancy novel (okay that is stretching it a bit) you should get Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design in UML by Meilir Page-Jones. Now I have seen some reviews that say it is for beginners but I do not agree. The first section on fundamentals of OO yes, however the subsequent parts of the book get into some very well written detailed analysis about not only best practices with the UML, but also object-oriented software design principles in general.O'Reilly, I am disappointed. I have several titles (Java Network Programming, Java and XML, EJB, Servlets etc.) and this is by far the worse. I think O'Reilly should leave OOA&amp;D and the UML to the Addison-Wesley Booch-Rumbaugh-Jacabson series. Just my two cents :-)"},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I own most of the O'Reilly books, so I'm a bit biased: I think they are great. Except for this one. I keep checking to see if the publisher really is O'Reilly.Here are the major problems with the book:1) The title says &quot;In A Nutshell&quot;, yet the book is 273 pages long. Which would be fine if all of that space was needed to cover the material in nutshell fashion. It isn't, by a long shot. To fill that much space, the text resorts to repeating the same thing sentence after sentence. Here's an example: &quot;Problems and solutions occur within a context. The solution to a problem must be understood in order to be constructed and utilized. The solution must be organized in order to facilitate its realization and adhere to the various constraints of the context (available computer systems, development time, etc.) in which it will be realized. To solve the problem, appropriate knowledge about the problem and solution must be captured, organized around decisions regarding the problem and solution, and....&quot; Shall I go on? It could be summarized with &quot;You need to understand the problem and proposed solution&quot;. Which is better, but for that matter why is *any* of this found in a book called UML In A Nutshell?2) The writing betrays a lack of knowledge on the part of the author of what is important and what is not. As a result, everything is included and nothing seems important. Here's the author's biography from the back of the book: &quot;Sinan Si Alhir has breadth and depth in all phases of the systems development life cycle. With experience in high-level and low-level project work, and his broad and deep knowledge of technology and methodology, he focuses on delivering quality solution-oriented results within various application domains using a multitude of technologies and methods.&quot; This is absurd, and could be reduced to &quot;Knows everything about everything.&quot; Is that what they really were trying to say? I'm sure the author is skilled in some specific areas. But you'll never discover what those are from this bio.3) Perhaps you are thinking that criticing the bio is unfair. It would be, but the text is even worse. Here's an example: &quot;Our effort will be organized (life cycle) as a series of (possibly concurrent) steps (activities) so that it may be managed to develop the resulting information system.&quot; Huh? This takes obtuse to such a level that I can't even think of a simple sentence to summarize what they are trying to say.4) Now when I tell you that about 80% of the text is in the form of bulleted lists you may be thinking &quot;Good, who cares if the text is bad when most of the book is bulleted lists&quot;. OK try this example, which gives just a few of the dozens of bullet points that follow the heading Models:* Are blueprints of systems used for system construction and renovation* Are used to understand and manage complexity within systems* Are used for communication and assurance of architectural soundness* Capture knowledge regarding a system or context* Represent knowledge of problems, solutions, and the contexts in which they exist and are addressed ....You can't assimilate that many bulleted items without supporting text, and if you could you just download the spec and save the $30.00.My suggestion is either save the $30.00 or spend it elsewhere."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I own plenty of programming-related books, and I think I can recognize a good book when I read one. This is not one of those books, which is surprising in an O'Reilley Nutshell book. Certainly it covers the basics and essentials of UML, but most of the substantive information is in bulleted lists, surrounded mounds of useless prose. Here's a typical example:&quot;To deliver valued solutions (maximum quality and minimum cost within the minimum time), organizations must capture (acquire), communicate (share), and leverage (utilize) knowledge. The value of a solution is determined by the quality of the product or service, the cost of the product of service, and the time needed to produce the product or deliver the service.&quot;This paragraph may seem rather innocent by itself, but after about ten pages of this I began to feel physically ill. Nothing life-threatening, mind you -- just a little nausea. Closing the book for several minutes made the feeling go away, and reading the book again cause my symptoms to return.

In many ways this book does more to hurt UML than increase its use. When confronted with this confusing mess, more often than not, people will walk away thinking, UML is too confusing and not a helpful tool.The author babbels on for two chapters without giving any concrete examples, showing the concepts, or demonstrating how it helps you. The diagrams are confusing, for example, the software life cycle diagram. I think the objective of the was author to prove he was smarter than the rest of us rather than trying to help us understand.I want the second edition (assuming it comes out and fixes the major problems) of this book for free because it was a waste of money and is not up to O'Reilly standards.

The 'unique', as the author calls it, style of using bullet points instead of paragraphs is nothing short of mind-numbing. To start a paragraph with &quot;The UML&quot; and then immediately drop into about a dozen bullet points, must have been an intentional device to cause readers pain. After reading a dozen bullet points, all incomplete sentences that don't even sound right unless you make a mental note to repeat &quot;The UML&quot; before it, you tend to lose track of what the author's point was to begin with.The author may be technically competent, but prose certainly is not his forte.

Documents explaining UML (and OCL) were sparse, UML modeling tools were sparse (and proprietary), and the technology to \\"use\\" UML hadn't acheived the wide(r) acceptance and sophistication found today. However, even within this context, one might have complained about the format.This book contains a fair bit of explanation and theory - one understands the difference between sequence and class diagrams. Moreover, one cannot really complain about the books usefulness as a reference, though the low-level \\"nuts-and-bolts\\" information falls a bit short of other O'Reilly \\"Nutshell\\" books. Yet, there is something missing in the middle. One doesn't get how to move from A (introductory this-is-this and that-is-that) to B (how do I depict relationships between classes and interfaces). In other words, one cannot read this book and begin jotting down ideas in UML - at least not easily. My largest complaint is this lack of intermediate instruction - how to move past the basics so that one can take advantage of the reference nature of the book.However, that being said, I believe that this is a useful book to have in one's \\"zoo\\". Further, it is interesting enough to read cover to cover - I did."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"As a devotee of O'reilly titles (it's the first publisher I usually look to on computer subjects), this one was disappointing. Regardless of whether it covers the subject matter well, the book fails simply because of the writing. It is, at least in the beginning, weighed down by comma series that go on forever, parenthetic notes that are redundant, and points that are lost in a volume of unrelated stuff.The author lacks focus, and the writing style is academic. This is not a practitioner's guide. I ended up purchasing a second UML book within a week."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"I bought this book on impulse in a walk-in bookshop, something I normally never do (sorry, Amazon, I couldn't wait).My instinct proved right : for a working developer, this book has much to recommend it: careful argumentation, extrememly useful examples and rigorously disciplined language.Each chapter is a first-class reference on the modelling technique concerned, and because all examples relate to the same system, you quickly get to see how the various views relate.If the book appears wordy, take a careful look at it's size. :-)The only difficulty I had was in relating the author's analysis of software development phases to those defined in project execution processes we use in our work, but the latter lie well outwith the author's control.I suspect that had other reviewers read this book right through, they might have been a little more generous with their praise."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"A useless compendium of high-sounding abstractions, by and for complete ivory-tower computer scientists. Nowhere are any concrete examples given. The defense that &quot;this is not a book for beginners&quot; is nonsense. Even highly experienced practitioners need clear explanations and specific examples. The GOF patterns book and the Fowler refactoring book are also computer science texts, but they always give actual examples of what they are talking about. I get angrier every time I pick up this book and try to make practical application.If the purpose of communication is to promote understanding, this book widely misses the mark."},{"Title":"Uml in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"Like other books in the &quot;Nutshell&quot; series, this is not a suitable vehicle for learning UML, nor is it a comprehensive reference. As other reviewers have noted, Alhir's material is like the handout from a presentation: mostly bullet points but fairly well structured. I recommend it as a first place to look before consulting your primary sources.Reviewing books about the UML is challenging, because it's often hard to separate flaws in the presentation from shortcomings in the UML itself."},{"Title":"Prodigal Souls","review":"Prodigal Souls is a fast-paced, sexy and highly enjoyable read, full of well-rounded characters -despite their individual faults, the reader cares what happens to them. The writing is very visual - I could picture every scene - and it would make a great TV series or film. I kept trying to guess what would happen next, but I was always wrong - Harriet Robbins Ackert manages to make the events both unpredictable and believable. I hope that there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"Prodigal Souls","review":"What I especailly like about this book is that each character is fully developed. No one is always bad or always good, and you feel like rooting for them throughout. Each new character aspect is realistic and seamless, and I was ready for each. The REALLY incredible part of the story, though, was the ending... it's very daring. I kept changing my mind about how the book would end, and I was never right. An aspect I always really enjoy in books is unpredictability, or feeling that the author was not following a canned formula, and therefore loved this one."},{"Title":"Prodigal Souls","review":"Harriet Robbins Ackert has put together a magnificent first novel, that includes wonderful California horse country, just enough sex to keep one interested, interlaced with love, family, jealosy and a good dose of religion, to make for a suspenseful, fast paced, but very believable novel. It keeps you on edge and for her next novel."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"Since expressing my frustration (below), I have since gotten some satisfaction from the publisher. I contacted The Coriolis Group's Technical Support Dept. (1-800-410-0192; JoannD@coriolis.com), and they indicated that defective disks were included with &quot;some&quot; of the books. If you have any problems with the CD, contact them, and they will send you a replacement. So far, it seems to work fine--and it includes Mac files that work in Painter! (So five stars for the tech support team.)Now that I've been able to actually work through more of the book, I'd modify my total star score to a two (hence my three stars on this review to average my one star below). This text attempts to be helpful, but it is extremely disorganized--the first chapter jumps around haphazardly and does not make obvious connections between ideas. In the section on layers, for example, the authors leap into masks (a related but different topic) without warning, launching into a tirade about all the things the program can't do that they think it should; only after a couple pages do you get to what masks *can* do and how to use them.The authors are trying, and I have picked up a few useful tips. Except for a meager center section in full color, the entire text is in black and white, making it hard to see what's going on in many of the screen shots. I don't think the book is as thorough or as well organized as it could be, and there are numerous mistakes that left me scratching my head and having to decipher the authors' meaning (even menu commands are incorrectly listed!); however, it has some uses.If I were to choose a book to learn Painter 6, I'd use the user's manual that comes with the program and the Painter 6 WOW! book--the latter is incredible, in full color throughout, and overflowing with useful tips and hints. Rather than giving you formulaic, step-by-step lessons, the WOW! book shows you real art and describes the process and techniques for getting there. It treats you more like a creative individual. If it wasn't too late, I'd be returning my Painter 6 F/X &amp; Design book for a refund."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"So far, I have wasted an inordinate amount of time trying to get the files on the companion CD to work. This book promises a CD for both Mac and Windows operating systems, but Mac users be forewarned--you must first convert the libraries using a utility (CopyRSR). Regrettably, the utility file included is PC based, so I had to find the utility elsewhere for the Mac. When I finally had the utility and used it to convert the file, I then had to modify the Mac type and creator codes using ResEdit or NortonUtilities. I have now modified the types on six different files using three different applications (and I am not a novice!)--NONE OF THEM WORK IN PAINTER. Painter refuses to open them, or my machine freezes. There is no reason why the files weren't available in both Mac and Windows versions--even if the conversion process worked, it's a lot of hassle when there's plenty of room on a CD for both types of files. In fact, that's what the Painter 6 Wow! book and CD does--and it is, by far, a superior book. I've already wasted a week of evenings on this nonsense--this may soon be a return to Amazon.com (unless my complaint to the publisher gets results). Mac users beware!"},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"There are definitely a few problems with this book. I suspect most people who buy it are not that proficient with Painter. But the book expects you to fill in so many gaps where its explanations are lacking. Later on in the book you are presented with that same lacking infomation in a context where it isn't as absolutely crucial. So it can be an aggravating text to learn from. Sometimes I found items in different menus to that indicated in the text. Some of the material on the CD provided was simply inaccessible. Save your pennies and instead of this text get the Painter 6 Wow! Book which is truly excellent."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"This book clearly walked me through the steps necessary to learn Painter. And in contrast to the &quot;Classroom In A Book&quot; series, Painter 6 FX inspires creativity. Although the earlier version of this book (Painter 5 FX) lacked conciseness, this version is much improved. A thorough teaching tool. Beautifully illustrated throughout."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"As a new Painter user, I picked up the P6 Wow! book for tips and tutorials, based on my experience with the excellent Photoshop Wow! book. But I found many more tips than tutorials in the Painter Wow! Book, and I needed something to help me learn the program -- closer to a &quot;Classroom in a Book&quot; for Painter. This book has more tutorials/projects than the Wow! book. It also speaks frankly about Painter, its good and bad points, and lets you know where the program is buggy or could be improved. The examples are not as inspiring as Wow!, and the book is entirely in B&amp;W with only a small (maybe 15 pages) color insert, but I think the tutorials and general approach are better for the beginning Painter user."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"The contents of this book should be focused on the functions and wiz-bang attributes of Painter -- you'd think. Instead, we are made to sit through the endless harangue of Rhoda Grossman (a name Dickens would have approved of!). Sherry London's opinions aren't as blatant, but when have you ever had to endure a bashing to find out how to use a product? Painter is an incredible product. Thank goodness I already know this or I might feel embarrassed about my choice, based on the commentary in this book. The book is a total waste of money. It gets one star only because zero isn't allowed."},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"I found this book not only extremely helpful, but also fun to read. Painter, at times, can be a daunting tool. The authors presented some innovative techniques I would never have known about in a consise, clear manner.

The authors clearly enjoy using this program!"},{"Title":"Painter 6 f/x and Design","review":"I am frankly surprised at the bitterness of a few of the previous reviews. I have found this book excellent for me, a novice on Painter 6 (mac). It is true enough that in the first chapter, the CD lacks Mac versions of the &quot;projects.&quot; However, the other chapters all work from .tif, .riff or .psd files and are fully supported by Mac. The topics discussed are the things I need to get going with this software.As for the comments regarding the style of one of the book's writers, I can only say that she makes frequent and clever allusions to literature, history and culture. The fact that the previous reviewer does not recognize these references says more about the reviewer than the author."},{"Title":"Business Consulting: A Guide to How It Works and How to Make It Work (Economist Series)","review":"I use this book in my master course on consultancy at our university. It provides an accessible and critical description of what the consulting business presently looks like and what its future may hold. I use this book to complement the more classical academic articles and books students are expected to read on organizational change and consultancy. As such it provdes great added value. One major drawback is, that the authors are so involved in the industry that they sometimes assume too much inside knowledge (terminology, trends) from readers that are relative outsiders. Thus, the book could do with another harsh round of editing by a non-industry expert. The same goes for a number of figures and classifications in the book that seem somewhat immature, are intuitively hard to grasp and deserve much more explanation and elaboration. Again, more editing is needed."},{"Title":"Business Consulting: A Guide to How It Works and How to Make It Work (Economist Series)","review":"I have taught Strategic Consulting to MBAs since 1998.

The author has great knowledge of his subject. A western for all."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"What can one say about \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\"? For as long as man has dreamed of the west, he has written about it or sought it out for himself. Yes, James Fennimore Cooper wrote about the \\"west\\". There were the Dime Novels and the Penny Dreadfuls of the 1800's written by such as Ned Buntline. Then an Eastener named Owen Wister created a character called \\"The Virginian\\" and Zane Grey had already written \\"Heritage of the Desert\\" but \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" would immortalize both the author and the genre of \\"westerns\\". From then on every \\"western\\" would be compared to this one. The ironic part is: Zane Grey never considered them to be \\"westerns\\"; they were romances, romantic adventures, romantic novels. And to be totally accurate, the word, \\"western\\" did not exist at the time this book was written; it did not come into use until 1927 at the earliest, so to insist Zane Grey was a \\"western\\" writer is suspect, at best. But \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" has everything a person has come to know and understand that belongs in a story of the west--the taciturn gunfighter; the woman in distress fighting a losing battle; great scenery; fast horses; and evil men. Yet \\"Riders\\" is more than that. It has sub-plots upon sub-plots that keep the reader wondering what is going to happen next, and this book \\"fills the bill\\". And, what most people don't know or realize today, Zane Grey wrote quite often from a woman's viewpoint, and does so in this book. At the time of ZG's greatest popularity more than half of his readership were women, and he was published in such magazines as, Cosmopolitan, Colliers, and Ladies Home Journal. If you have never read a \\"western\\" I whole-heartedly urge you to try this one. Besides, this year is its 100th anniversary."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Riders of the Purple Sage is a beautifully written and a terrific story. I had heard of the book for years and 10 years ago I borrrowed the book from a friend. I am so glad I read it -- I won't ever forget it.

I purchased the Rider's Of the Purple Sage because I remembered it was a great story. This time around I discovered that it was more than a story. It indicated what a great writer Zane Grey and his wife Dolly had offered to the general public about the History of the Westward movement, Love, Action, and Excitement.

Overall, a great experience!"},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Enthralling, with the almighty gun slinger having an inate sense of right and wrong, Riders of the Purple Sage endows the reader with the ideals instilled from the saga of Heracles' (in Roman Hurcules) trials. By not wasting time developing characters when the landscape serves as silent narrator, by allowing the light of Lassiter's justice to meddle into the darkness of a supressed woman, by using the soap-opera quality of irony to sweep the reader along from page to page... Zane Grey dispelled a critique of the LDS church as it was in the 19th century that far surpasses any 20th century writer could hope to achieve.Lassiter is a ruthless yet pure hearted gunman- his quest for vengeance began out of love, for without love one can never truly feel hate. Jane Withersteen, trapped under her beliefs and confused as to what action she should take, mirrors closely the victimization that cult followers feel when you watch a History Channel documentary- knowing that escape is the only rightful choice, but fearful of the divine punishment to fall upon those excommunicated. It is in the antithesis of her doctrine (on it's surface that is) which ultimately leads to her redemption, and to her final, strong willed, moment's notice decision to allow herself and Lassiter sealed into a valley at the novel's end. It is perhaps the definitive moment of irony when a ruthless gunman condems the soul of a Bishop into a fiery afterlife before pulling the trigger...the simple, uneducated cowboy serving the Christlike role of Savior and Judge, with the man of the cloth no more earnest than the tax collectors that drove Christ into his only fit of rage.By mixing Rambo-esque action, mystery, and above all entertainment, Zane Grey painted a picture of social criticism that could actually be enjoyed without wasting precious ink on avoiding so-called Literary sins. His landscape is Calvinistic in favoring the elect and damning the damned. Only said \\"good guys\\" draw from the descriptive imagery of \\"Nature's God\\". And frankly, his super human cowboys are far more believable than the outlandish epic of Beowulf (which is an epic poem I very much like and recommend).A genuine classic."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I loved this book. I don't know why it took me so many years to discover it. It was written almost 100 years ago so the language is a little different. Don't let that stop you. The descriptions of the landscape are beautiful and if you have been to the West you will really appreciate that. The book is a mystery as well as a western with plenty of twists and turns to hold your interest. I had some unanswered questions when I finished the book but they are all being answered in the sequel, The Rainbow Trail."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"One of the first Westerns, with plenty of action and the romance of the west. It features a rugged individual with a dark past, an independent and hardy woman who is in trouble and a cast of other interesting characters.I think one of the reasons why we don't hear more about it is that most of the villians in this tale are ... (wait for it) ... Mormons. So there is probably some pressure in various publishing houses, etc not to promote it. Zane Grey paints the LDS group here as patriarchal, polygamous ruffians. You would guess that an early Western would use Native Americans, not Mormons, as the villians.Anyway, if you are not offended by the choice of bad guys, it's a good story."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Hell, best novel ever written. A thrilling story, but the writing is what's truly phenomenal. The story seems more painted than written. I don't know how Grey did it, but you see everything, vividly: the colors, shapes, skies, rocks, plants, animals, people. You don't just read about them, you see them through the words. Not just an exciting western story, but a captivating experience. A work of genius."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Zane Grey's \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" is an astonishing piece of work, indeed, a masterpiece of fiction writing of grandly quasi-operatic scope and passion (indeed, truly an \\"horse opera\\", rather as epical novelistically as the stage works of Bordin or Mussorgsky are in muscio-dramatic terms, but in a wild American setting and in the same sort of marvellously gripping way!), but this paperback edition of it serves the book poorly in some ways. There is such an abundance of editions of this work from which to choose that the customer with ease well could do better for himself in finding a superior edition. This reader has what Pocket Books states as its \\"first Pocket Books printing [of] July 1980\\", which could raise concerns about the physical quality of this edition. If the first printing is this degraded in quality, how much poorer would be subsequent printings? The text is riveted, page by page, with variously fractured and missing characters, letters and punctuation alike. This may not be a problem for a good adult reader whose first language is English, since it is not difficult for a well-lettered person to figure out what should be in the off-white spaces of those missing or partly lost letters, syllables, or marks of puunctuation, but a less literate person (young or poor reader, someone whose first language is other than English, et al.) could find the going difficult or perplexing at times.The paper is not of particularly high quality, but the glue binding is holding up well with the years. The customer should buy this edition only if he wishes to obtain Grey's \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" at an exceptionally low price and encounters this edition so cheaply available. At any rate, be aware that at least some of the copies of this edition of the novel in at least some of the printings thereof are of substandard printing quality.Some readers, judging from various Amazon customer reviews, seem to harbour other expectations than what Zane Grey chose to deliver in this unusual novel. For one thing, Grey's writing is very lyrical, highly poetic at times; seldom can the southwestern-mountains terrain of Utah (like that, many ways, of adjacent states) have been depicted in such gloriously vivid word-painting. The space that Zane Grey cevotes to such descriptive prose is not what one expects in the usually more relentlessly action-packed \\"Western\\" novel genre, but Grey's verbally conjured landscapes add immeasurably to the charm, vast sweep, doom, or any other quality of the vistas and moods for the various settings of the narrative. Grey seems to know nothing of limits to literary virtuosity and skill in conveying such scenic depictions and in a way that grips continuously the reader's interest.As for Zane Grey's characterisations of his frontier people, both collectively and personally, these are far more believable than some critics claim them to be. Utah, then a territory known as Deseret (a name that Grey does not choose to use), was at the time of \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" a theocracy, a Latter-day Saints Mormon (L.D.S.) one, at that, during the years of the novel's setting, only very loosely and barely under the oversight of the U.S.A.'s government. These were years when the Mormon cult and the governance of secular affairs were linked inseparably, which led to great abuses of the L.D.S. cult's authority. Brigham Young, the L.D.S. Mormon prophet who led the early Mormon settlers westwards to Deseret, and encouraged the influx of believers, mostly recent converts, ruled with an iron hand and much to his own pecuniary advantage and to that of the other leaders of his heathenish, polytheistic, and (most pertinently to Grey's sympathetic depiction of L.D.S. Mormon women's plight) polygamously abusive, despotic regime. The L.D.S. Mormon cult was raw and savage in its dealings both with its own folk and with outsiders, as Grey so rightly recounts. Mormonism of the L.D.S. kind had not yet produced its first generation of genuine scholars in thier mature and productive years, notably James Edward Talmage and Brigham Henry (\\"B.H.\\") Roberts, whose infulence would transcend L.D.S. Mormonism from a crass and unmitigably irrational cult to something more like the relatively restrained, sophisticated pagan religion that it has become in more recent times; L.D.S. Mormon's follwers were as gullible and rather witlessly naive as the L.D.S. cult's Mormon theology in the mid-19th century was crudely and cruelly unsophisticated.Thus, a lady such as Jane Withersteen, as women were reared to do so, believed altogether too unconditionally in her cult's twisted faith for her own good. The oddly gradual process of Jane's disillusionment, moving from trusting and idealistic believer, although one of much spunk, towards an even fuller consciousness of the prerogatives of her own femininity and of her right to hold property and to exert influence in the face of the L.D.S. cult's rapacious greed and tyrrany, allied with its remorseless suppression of women, is not a transformation that is in the least lacking in credibility. Readers of ancestry as this reviewer's, of long Utahn L.D.S. Mormon descent know exactly what L.D.S. Mormonism's demands upon believers entail! For Jane to be duped in another Christian setting to a similar extent that the relentlessly grasping L.D.S. Mormon men around her exploit her guilelessness would be stretching credibility, but Deseret/Utah was not like any other part of frontier North America! As for the other female characters in Jane Withersteen's orb, they are, admittedly, rather simpering and less effectively and believably portrayed, but Grey compensates richly with his characterisations of Jane Withersteen herself and of the many and varied males in this saga.Of those men, Bern Venters, the romantically handsome and rugged youth, impetuously ardent in love and in his animosities alike, is a strikingly vigourous portrayal of great depth, vitality, and appeal. The L.D.S. Mormon elders and their toadies are distressingly brutish and duplicitous, but, then, that reflects faithfully what all too many of the male leaders of Deseret society really were like. The ranch hands and \\"riders\\" are a delightfully individualistic lot, the best of them being those, whether Mornon or \\"gentile\\" (i.e. non-Mormon), who are loyal to Jane even at the greatest personal cost to themselves; these lads are of manly earnestness and a movingly untarnished probity of spirit. Grey provides for Jerry Card, the unprincipled henchman of the Mormon elders, a splendidly rounded depiction of a venile man whose courage, great skills in horsemanship, and tough ability to endure some remarkable physical ordeals go far to give him some countervailing merit as a person. Jim Lassiter, the main protagonist, at first glance may seem to be too stereotypically stoic and relentlessly \\"alpha male\\", but, as Grey portrays Lassiter, his mysterious character does develop. The manner in which the fulness of Lassiter's identity only gradually reveals itself in his interactions with the other male and female characters, the older and the younger ones alike, is one that grips the reader's curiosity and interest.Grey, as a Western novelist should be expected to do, individualises the various horses, in all of their varying beauty, strength, and animal intelligence quite memorably, too, quite sympathetically for those who love such animals. Bern Vinter's two dogs, intelligent, sturdy, and faithful, receive their own lovingly classy canine portrayals, too.The dialogue of the various men and women reflects their regional origins and their social status. In most of their words as they make use of them, Grey conveys the flavour of these people's differing vernacular accents and speech patterns with reasonable believability, the talk of the sturdy ranch-hands the most charmingly so. Only the simpering \\"baby-talk\\" of Little Fay, the child who becomes Jane Withersteen's ward, really cloys uncomfortably; Grey is far better, bother in their behaviour and speech, at depicting the adult characters than this faerylike girl, or, for that matter, Bess (later revealed to be Elizabeth Erne, Lassiter's long-lost niece), whose waiflike innocence so enthralls Bern Venters, who falls in love with her, but at least Bess speaks more normally than Little Fay does!Zane Grey attained the level of genius in this novel, one of his finest or very best works. Very justly has it retained its popularity as a novel and as a subject for cinematic treatment. Even if the Amazon user has a nearly \\"allergic\\" dislike of the genre, \\"Riders of the Purple Sage\\" has much to offer as a memorable reading experience, for the most unsophisticated reader or for the literary connoisseur alike.

There is a homesteading woman that needs help, a dogooder cowboy, a mysterious gunslinger, and an array of villains that range from rustlers to officials of the mormon church. Almost every western archetype ever used shows up in this book except the town drunk and the almost always present indian. It's a great relief not to see the indian used as a scape goat once again in a western. Originally published in nineteen twelve this book helped set the tone for and developed character archetypes for the entire western genera. What exactly makes up the western genera and why did it happen. The western genera is full of larger than life heros who's only flaw might be an overzealous for bring a bad guy to justice and an inability to speak to a woman. The heroin in these stores is usually a single homesteading woman with a farm or land to protect. The heroin almost always looks to the good guy for support and by the end of the story they have come to depend on each other and generally ride of into the sunset together. The bad guy in the typical western usually has some reason for forcing the heroin into something she doesn't want to do. Examples of this are unwanted manage, selling or leaving her property, or he puts her in danger (usually the indian). The hero will more often than not already know and dislike the villain, or sometimes the villain is made an enemy because he is doing something to the heroin. In some cases the villain comes to town looking to call out the hero and the heroin isn't involved much if at all. One or a few of these situations in play add wide open spaces, horses and guns and you've got yourself a western The story is situated Utah and the description of the landscape is beautiful. Grey utilizes his setting, the story isn't just set out on the plains of utah because it seemed like a good place to put it. With all of the changes in landscape that occur in this book the characters have endless places to explore and hide. The part of the book that appealed to me the most was the character of the gunslinger lassiter. Of all of the westerns that I have ever read lassiter probably has the strongest presence of any cowboy character that I have ever come across in my reading. he dresses in black from head to toe and gives the impression of being an unthinking tool of justice that exists to fight for what he feels is right and destroy anything he feels is evil. The character of lasiter and the image that he is given especially early on in the book reminds me of my favorite hard nosed western hero of all time. The Gunslinger Roland from Steven Kings book The Gunslinger. I feel that this book is almost a kind of surreal sequel to Riders of the Purple Sage, Both mysterious gunslingers clad entirely in black are on a quest for revenge following a mysterious man that had ruined there life and the lives of the people around them. Stephen kings version of lasiter is a much more violent man in a much more violent land. This may just be a sign of the times seeing that Greys book and kings book have about seventy years between there publishing dates. Riders Of The Purple Sage is much more unpredictable than the average western. The characters in this book develop differently than average western characters because of the setting and plot twists in the story. The characters in the book are amazingly much less static than the average characters in a western. The story is made much more interesting by the characters ability to change throughout the story. Making it a book that is fun to read from cover to cover. As westerns go this book not only fits the genera perfectly but adds a couple of different twists and is entertaining through the entire book."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I'm not much of a \\"Western\\" reader.

This man is renowned in Mormon country as a Mormon hater and killer and Jane finds she is strangely drawn to this oddly heroic figure who saves her and her hired hand from the Mormons. These men have come to enforce their will on her by driving off her non-Mormon cowpokes and causing her to marry Elder Tull. But Jane is a convinced Mormon and cannot believe ill of Tull and his cronies so she makes it her business to persuade Lassiter to lay aside his guns and hatred of the Mormons so that he will do them no more harm. In the meantime her hired hand, Venters, freed by Lassiter's timely appearance, goes off into the sage, to save himself, and there encounters the mysterious rustlers who have been plaguing the local ranchers (and now Jane) and learns their deadly secret.Who Lassiter really is and why he hates the Mormons gradually comes out as Jane works her wiles on him, but Tull and his boys, and especially the local bishop, Dyer, only see that Jane is in disobedience to the Church and their will by allowing Lassiter to stay on. Accordingly they continue to press her via the community, causing all her Mormon hands to leave her and all other awful things to occur.RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE is a somewhat strange book and exceedingly harsh on the Mormons (who may or may not have been, as portrayed rather convincingly here, a closed and scheming &quot;cult&quot; in their earliest days) and it is written in somewhat purplish prose (reminiscent of the sage it persistently describes). There are long tiresome sections of descriptive text about the weather and, repeatedly, about the sage and the rest of the landscape which can be grating but which does have an hypnotic effect after awhile.The point of view, interestingly enough, is highly subjective as we constantly see what the main characters are seeing, especially the action as it is happening to them -- a very effective device as it creates an illusion of immediacy and the sense that you are right there with the people in the tale.But there is not a great deal of action until the end and the characters are rather thinly drawn, especially Jane who seems so good and intelligent and yet, oddly, cannot see the darkness surrounding her in her Mormon community. The cowpoke Venters is hard to get a fix on and Lassiter, himself, seems overly passive and too good for the gunman he is said to be for much of the tale. Lots of coincidences too, drive this plot.And yet, for all of this I liked the book. Though dragging here and there, I wanted to finish it and, indeed, it ended well if a bit melodramatically.My copy had a foreword in it which notes the narrative's repressed sexuality throughout and I think this is accurate. It's hard to believe that two young people falling in love with one another could find themselves trapped for weeks in a hidden canyon and never reach out physically for the other. Maybe it was just the literary convention of the time. But the narrative, the descriptions of the landscape and the sage are all fraught with sexual energy and metaphor. But it is also this suppressed tension and almost surreal sense of immediacy, this dreamlike quality, which gives the tale its special power. Not particularly original or even moving, it is yet engrossing and compelling.I find I am willing to finish fewer and fewer books these days as I grow impatient with their authors. But this one held me to the end. For all its flaws and idiosyncrasies, it worked."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"This book could be the script for an Aaron Spelling Western Soap Opera. Grey's women characters are supposed to be strong, but their beliefs never seem to match their actions. His research on Mormons (if he did any) must have come from a really disgruntled former member of the religion. Taken for what it is, a romantic old western, it's good entertainment. You'll roll your eyes, but you'll keep reading."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"If you are not an aficionado of the Western novel but would like to sample the genre, then you should try one or more of the three great classics; Jack Schaefer's &quot;Shane&quot;, Owen Wister's &quot;The Virginian&quot; , and this novel by Zane Grey. Of the three, &quot;Shane&quot; has the most literary merit and is the only one with claims to being great literature. &quot;The Virginian&quot; is often regarded as the first true representative of the genre, establishing as it does many of the great archetypal characters and incidents of Western myth, and &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; remains the best-selling Western.&quot;Riders&quot; has two very remarkable features. The first is the surprising complexity and mythic depth of the story. There is for example, a Garden of Eden theme, with two of the characters isolated for an extended time in a lush wilderness. This is so strikingly like the Emil Zola novel &quot;La Faute de l'Abbe Mouret&quot; (The Abbe Mouret's Sin) that one wonders if Grey had read and been inspired by that work. Interwoven with this is an Oedipal theme. If all of this sounds a bit much for a cowboy yarn, I can only say that it really is all there.The other remarkable thing about the book is its attitude toward the Mormon religion. The hero is an avowed &quot;killer of Mormons&quot;. The LDS church is depicted as essentially brutal and tyrannical. This, I suppose, reflects a prejudice of the time, but I wonder how present-day members of that church regard this novel.It has to be said that Grey is not a great writer and in particular, he cannot do dialogue. In fact, the dialogue in the first few pages is so appalling that I nearly gave up on the book there and then. However, I'm glad I stuck with it. It is such a fine and strange story and has such a wonderful sense of place."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Her father's death has left Jane Withersteen in possession of the richest land holding in the Cottonwoods, a Mormon village on the 1871 Utah frontier. Most importantly, Amber Spring runs through her property and so she controls the water supply that makes possible the rolling fields of purple sage. But now the Mormon church wants to gain contol of the spring by forcing an unwilling Jane to marry Elder Tull. They've been steadily increasing the pressure on her and as the novel opens, Tull and his henchmen have come to arrest Venters, the Gentile foreman on her ranch. Outnumbered and outgunned, Jane prays for deliverance. Just as Tull is about to whip Venters, a rider in black appears--Lassiter, the scourge of the Mormons.Lassiter is an archetype of the mythic Western hero. In him we see the origins of both Shane and Ethan Edwards (from The Searchers, Amos in the novel)--a lone gunmen fighting for Justice, he has descended upon Mormon Utah with a vengeance, obsessively searching for the sister who was kidnapped by a Mormon proselytizer.Jane takes him on as a ranch hand, but makes him swear to forsake violence. Inevitably (as in High Noon), events force her to release him from his oath.Despite an extremely harsh view of Mormons, this is one of the truly great Westerns; a must read.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"In Riders of the Purple Sage, Zane Grey takes the reader to the small Mormon town in Utah called Cottonwoods. The novel is set in the 1870's. The novel is centered on the life of Jane WIthersteen, whose father was the founder and center of the town. Jane faces many troubles in Cottonwoods. The main one is that her cattle have been stolen by Oldring and his gang. Another is that Jane is pressured by the townspeople because she allows Gentiles to live there. She is torn between her feelings and her religion until a stranger, Lassiter, comes riding into town searching for the answers to a secret that only Jane knows the answer to.Jane is the main character in the book. This book is different because most westerns do not center around the life of a woman. Most westerns are focused on the rough, tough, cowboy who shoots people and lives on the edge to survive. Jane is different. Her father founded the town she lives in and she keeps the town going. She is like the head of the town. She owns almost everything in the town and the landscape around it. She is very wealthy and has no biases. She likes who she likes because of who they are, not what their religion is, like the rest of the town does. The town hates that she acts like that. Jane takes Lassiter in and answers his questions about the secret. I really like that the author uses a woman in this novel because it gives a whole different perspective to a western. Most westerns focus on the cowboy and his journeys, but this book focuses on a woman, Jane, throughout the book and the troubles she encounters living in the West. It gives us a perspective of what women may have been like in the West. It still has the rough, tough cowboy, but he is not the only focus in the book. There is more happening than just the journey of a cowboy.This book was also a pleasure to read because it does a good job of describing the landscape around Cottonwoods and in the sage. Some westerns give the reader an idea of the landscape, but this book focuses on the landscape and uses it in the book. For instance, Venters travels into the sage and hides behind the rock and in holes in the mountains and terrain around him. The landscape is used throughout the book when the characters are faced with problems such as the one described above with Venters. The landscape helped to hide him. I think it was clever to bring the landscape in and use it as part of the story. Alot of westerns do not use the landscape, they just describe it to give the reader a setting and an idea of the landscape in the book.The book is a typical western though, because Lassiter is a typical cowboy. He has a deep secret and is in search of answers to that secret. He is a stranger that comes riding into town. He sleeps in the sage under the stars and will not sleep inside. He is on a mission and is not going to let anything or anyone get in his way. Most westerns have the cowboy meet a woman as in this story.Overall, I think this is a good book for all sorts of readers. Zane Grey is a good writer who includes aspects for all kinds of readers. Riders of the Purple Sage is an action pact, mystery solving, all around good book for anyone who is in the mood for a western."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Zane Grey is one of the best-known and most prolific writers in the Western genre. Riders of the Purple Sage is perhaps his most famous novel. And deservedly so. The story starts rather slowly by today's fiction standards, and has a meandering story line that leaves one wondering what the book is all about--or whether it's actually about anything particular at all. But then with Dickensian brilliance he weaves a series of seemingly unrelated tendrils into one complex, exciting, and satisfying conclusion.Rich and beautiful Jane Withersteen has inherited her father's ranch and cattle herds on the Utah frontier border. She resists the demands of church elders to marry Tull, a fellow Mormon, instead showing interest in Gentile sage-rider Ventors. This insubordinate behavior causes high tension in the Mormon town of Cottonwoods, already edgy from an insurgence of Gentiles and years of cattle-rustling mayhem led by the legendary Oldring and his mysterious Masked Rider. At the moment that Mormon ire peaks over Jane's intransigence, Grey adds the catalyst to a chain reaction of violent drama: the arrival in Cottonwoods of Lassiter, the infamous Mormon-killing gunman. The plot plays out with plenty of surprising revelations on the true identity and intentions of the various parties.Grey's style is heavy on scenic description, with almost redundant recitation of the virtues of the purple prairie. But the book has a classic, literary quality to it, something the genre sorely missed until Larry McMurtry brought it back with Lonesome Dove. And horse-lovers will appreciate Grey's knowledge and detailed rendering of everything equestrian. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Zane Grey was a fixture in American letters when it came to the Western. In fact, one might suggest that he invented the modern form of it (though, of course, there were writers of dime novel westerns before him, not to mention James Fenimore Cooper and his leatherstocking tales). But Grey certainly did something memorable and lasting with the form, if this book is any measure. I had never read Grey before, so I picked this one up with some uncertainty. Thought I could not count myself well-read until I'd tried one of his books and this seemed to be the one with the most literary weight. It's certainly named well enough. As it happens, I enjoyed the book in the end, but have to admit that it is weak in a number of serious ways.Set in Mormon Utah in the late 1800's, it's the tale of a young Mormon woman who is the sole heir of her father and owner of the substantial ranch he has left her. Because of the significance of her ranch and because she is a rather headstrong young woman, the Mormon elders feel it essential to rein her in and get her married into the fold as quickly as they can. One particular Mormon Elder, a man named Tull, has his eye on her especially, with the support of his mysterious Bishop. But Jane, pious as she is, demurs, recognizing that becoming one more of Tull's wives (in those days the Mormons were still taking several wives) will only strip her of her freedom and clout in the little community (which she has inherited along with her father's extensive ranch).The story opens with Tull and his other pious brethren about to administer a sound thrashing to a young cowhand who has been working for the heroine, Jane Withersteen, and who Jane has been flirting with. Jane is powerless to prevent the beating and worse until the appearance, out of the hazy, distant horizon, of a man called Lassiter. Lassiter proves to be a hard sort and a known gunman with a special dislike for Mormons. His arrival proves salutary and the end of it is he stays on with Jane at the ranch while the cowhand heads out and the Mormons scatter, tails between their legs.Jane sets out to convince Lassiter that not all Mormons are bad while the Mormon elders conspire to bring Jane down by scaring off all her Mormon and non-Mormon ranch hands. Meanwhile, the erstwhile cowhand (his name escapes me) stumbles onto the secret hide-out of the rustlers who have been robbing the honest folk in the area. There are lots of chases and hiding outs and some gun play. The cow hand finds his love in an unlikely place in the box canyon in which he holes up (hard to believe this man and his intended are together an entire week, feel the way they do about each other and yet never touch one another, but it was a simpler time then, wasn't it?), the gunman hangs around Jane who exerts her feminine wiles to get him to give up his guns before he can hurt anymore Mormons, and the Mormon elders continue their nefarious schemes to break Jane to the halter.Thoughout it all, Lassiter seems oddly passive and inert for the deadly, single-minded gunman he is made out to be. One of the remarkable things about this book is the rich prose in which the landscape is surrealistically painted which gives it both its title and the feel that this is more than just a silly story about good guys and bad guys. And there's a strong sense of suppressed sexuality underlying the entire tale here as embodied in the highly visual rendering of the countryside, its canyons, its sage and its sky. The descriptiveness of the narrative is, however, somewhat repetitive and overdone as though apparently reflecting the turbulent emotions of the characters themselves, as though their innermost feelings are laid bare upon the landscape of their tale.The ending is a bit melodramatic too and rather predictable, but, in all, I can see why this tale has the good name it's got. It's intriguing and enthralling (it kept me reading through to the end -- a harder thing these days as my eyes are not what they used to be and I have less patience than I once did for the fictional word). But in comparison with many other works which I have read and enjoyed, I had to conclude that this one is not quite in their league.Using the amazon \\"five star\\" system, I usually reserve five stars for the really good to the great, four for the pretty damned good to the good, and three to the \\"good but\\" category. This one is thus a \\"three\\" on that measure since it was strongly enough written to carry me as a reader and interesting enough in its unexpectedly powerful use of language but, in the end, that very usage went over the top and slid into the dream-like purple of the sage in which the characters cavort. And the characterizations, themselves, are rather stilted, the tale kind of flat and just plain contrived. I think it's the underlying sexual energy in the writing which really carries the day. \\"Good but . . . \\"SWMauthor of [...]"},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"There are two basic styles of English prose. One is that of Dashiell Hammett - short words, short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters, short novels. The other basic style is that of Charles Dickens - long passages of minute, detailed description. Zane Grey wrote in this second style, and he did it very well indeed. The American West comes alive in the pages of this book, a true classic. Calling this \\"purple prose\\" is like calling the music of the Grateful Dead \\"boogie\\" - it's a putdown that doesn't really mean anything. (Incidentally, a Grateful Dead offshoot band, New Riders of the Purple Sage, was named after this book.) Just as Alice chased a rabbit into Wonderland, so Venters chases a rabbit into Surprise Valley. He discovers true spirituality in the natural world and in other people - not in organized, denominational religion. The theme of this novel is that tyrannical fanaticism - religious and/or political - is dangerous and wrong. Grey was not specifically anti-Mormon. In fact, some of his Mormon charactors were good people. He was against any religious system that was out of control in its lust for power. Think of todays' \\"religious right\\", or for that matter, Islamic extremism. Grey would have disliked both."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I love the freedom and the grandeur Zane Grey brought to even his shortest story, and while RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE is dated, you can practically smell the saguaro lingering on every page, like mold, except with a fresher scent. As many other reviewers have noticed, the book is rife with anti-Mormon sympathies and it sort of does for members of the Latter Day Saints what BIRTH OF A NATION does for black people--i.e., no favors. What will Mormons make of a story which casts one of them as the heroine and all the others as a bunch of low class, scurvy thieving swine with nothing better on their minds than \\"wiving\\" and basically swindling poor Jane out of her wonderful ranch in the Cottonwoods of Utah.Instead Jabe winds up crossing the line and falling for a \\"Gentile,\\" the cowboy Lassiter who wields a six shooter and rides like the wind. She abdicates her place in respectable society to become \\"infamous, notorious,\\" as she sobs out on the purple plain, \\"a rustler's girl and nothing more.\\"The two of them share a common love for children and the West, which Lassiter tries to hide behind his mask of not caring a damn for any person, place, thing or religion. His cold, hard impassivity becomes a screen on which Jane projects her romantic and sexual feelings, which are echoed daily and nightly in Grey's remarkable prose, a splashy palette of colors and earth tones. It won't take you long to rip through this romantic thriller, but you too will be amazed by the sympathetic treatment Zane Grey gives to his heroine, even though she slips through the fingers of morality like a jet of clear sparkling water from the Cottonwood River. Her life of sin is not total debauchery however, for she remains chaste, and lets the landscape, especially its canyons, reveal her pulsating desires."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"An excellent adventure of the Old West.

It is one of a number of the Five Star Western Series released by Gale Publishing since 1996.Riders of the Purple Sage is about a single woman, Jane Withersteen, whose father died and left her a large and prosperous ranch to manage and preserve. She is a devout Mormon in a Utah border community, and is expected to marry a prominent leader in that community although she doesn't love him. A young cowboy, Bern Venters, is a Gentile who works for Jane and actually is in love with her. The local leadership insists that Jane fire him and that he is to leave town. Suddenly there arrives a mysterious rider, Lassiter, who is obviously a hardened gunman and he comes to Venters rescue.After the confrontation, when the confounded leaders are forced to leave, Lassiter reveals that he is on a quest to locate his long lost sister, who was kidnapped by Mormon evangelist years earlier, and her trail has led him here. It turns out that his sister was a friend of Jane's and she is actually buried on the ranch, but Jane refuses to tell Lassiter who it was that kidnapped her, although he suspects that Jane knows.There are hair-raising adventures involving cattle rustlers and the powerful group of Mormon barons, who are determined to run Jane out of business if she persists in her refusal to marry the designated man.Meanwhile, in his flight to escape from the local tyrants Bern discovers the rustlers lair in the canyons and rescues the ward of the head rustler, having been convinced earlier that she was one of his chief confederates.Set in a wonderfully described, beautiful, southern Utah border country, it is a deeply satisfying story, which is guaranteed to keep you entertained for several evenings in any season of the year.Zane Grey published his stories from 1910 till 1939. 109 of them were made into movies, a record that still stands. What happened is that many of his novels were crudely bowdlerized by heavy handed editors at Harper and others, and only now have many of the original manuscripts come to light. With the collaboration of Zane Grey's family, Gale Publishing is circulating them to a new generation of readers.Zane Grey is a fine writer, and he describes multilayered and fascinatingly complex characters. The author explores the psychological motivations and emotional dimensions of his well drawn characters. He describes in an interesting and engaging way, the environment and surrounding scenery of the Old West. His plots are complex and twisted enough to keep the reader turning the pages to the very last page. And the ending is often a final surprise.Gale Publishing provides hard backs and large print editions for libraries, but recently I have seen paper back editions in the bookstores.I have also recently read: Shower of Gold, Cabin Gulch, and an older edition of a biography of George Washington, written just before Grey died in 1939."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I have no idea of what the reviewer means by \\"edited version\\" but Zane Grey is the author that caught my imagination and love for reading when I was a child.

With Zane Grey's detail, you could become the hero and feel all of the angst they were experiencing, smell the air they were breathing, shout with their jubilee, and morn with their losses. Riders of the Purple Sage and Her Majesty's Rancho describe both the hard and good times on the early plains of the Mormons. They are both great reads.

This may be worth a try if you've never read Zane Grey before and want to give it a try but I think I'll stick with Jack Schaffer (try &quot;Monte Walsh&quot;), Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry or A.B. Guthrie from now on."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I enjoy a good western. I understand that the good guys are often too good to be true, and the bad guys are as bad as can be. Still, I was very put off by this \\"classic.\\" As I fought to stay awake through over 250 pages of the words 'purple' and 'sage' being used in various ways, I couldn't help but wonder what all the hype is about this book.Basically, it's this: the good guys are Venters and Lassiter, two practically superhuman cowboys who can do anything--head off a stampede with a blind horse, take 5 bullets and still be able to walk all day, and shoot a man from a horse on the dead run, while on a running horse himself.The bad guys fall into two groups. The Mormons, the evil, black-hearted women stealers, polygamists every one (though the heroine's father seems not to have been one, though he was a Mormon leader), and the cattle rustlers, who are bad, but not as bad as the Mormons, because the rustlers are \\"honest thieves.\\"The action is pretty dull, the romance is nothing short of corny, and each page is dripping with sappy descriptions of landscape. In short, be forewarned. If you want to read this book, fine, but be prepared for Grey to spend more time developing the color of the sage than developing all the characters combined. There are much better Westerns out there."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I picked up this book thinking I was going to get a classic spaghetti western: a gun-slinging rapid-firing rapid-reading book. Instead I got a soap opera set in Utah with purple prose tiringly describing purple sage, cliffs and rock formations. There is an astounding lack of action. Not being familiar with genre, maybe my expectations were off, but I shant be coming back to Zane Grey soon."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"The book came at a timely fashion. It was in great condition and it looked brand new. The book was just as described."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I read the novel in a day and half. The charaters in the book have some, fine qualities, and like all humans have faults The other reviewers, complain about the anti-Mormonsim.While the Mormons were the object of considerblae bigoty, in truth the Mormons of the time were ferociously territorial and hostile to outsiders, They also had the tendency to shoot first ask questions later. This book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Zane Grey was my first western author. After reading one book as a young teen, I began to read all his books. I loved his ability to describe a setting, his wonderful use of simple descriptive language and his love of nature, all show through in his work. The plots are simple enough for young people to follow and the stories usually end well so that the reader has a sense of satisfaction at the conclusion, and he has learned to know the characters as friends. This book is one that includes all these elements! Enjoyable read, especially for teens!Evelyn Horan - authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"No wonder this book started the whole western Genre. It is great literature! Not only does it rivet your attention, but it also asks and confronts meaty philosophical and ethical questions through the lives of its protagonists (e.g. \\"what do you do when your faith seems to require you to do evil in its name?\\")Grey gets a little wordy in his descriptions and his characters sometimes seem a little too too. but this will hold your attention and leave you feeling like you've done more than simply fill your mind with candy."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"This is the only western I've ever read; I'm mostly into classical literature, science writing, and non-fiction, but I asked friends for a book rec in the field, and they said read this one and the two Thomas Berger novels about Little Big Man.The novel is interesting in that it's not a stereotypical western story. The main character is a woman who owns a large cattle ranch and is basically the mainstay of the little town of Cottonwoods, a Mormon town on the Utah border, sort of like the Cartwright family was in the popular TV western series, only in this case, Lorne Green is replaced by a female lead. The novel also is unusual in that it shows her struggling against the tyranny and even criminality of her fellow Mormon ranchers, who don't like the fact of a beautiful, wealthy, but unattached woman, who wields considerable influence in the local town despite their best attempts to undermine her.One the things that sparked my interest in the novel was hearing an English prof in a radio interview on National Public Radio talk about some of the scholarship that is being devoted to genres like the western novel. She was working herself on the books of Karl May (The Legend of the Llano Estacado), Owen Wister (The Virgianian), and Zane Grey.One of the interesting things she had to say had to do with Grey's vivid prose descriptions of the western landscape. She said Grey's prose sensualized the landscape, giving it an almost masculine sensuality and almost sexuality. I'm about halfway into the book, and I can say that the rugged countryside of sheer, rock-walled canyons, arid plateaus and valleys, and wide-open spaces of this part of Utah are vividly described by Grey and serve, not just as a dramatic backdrop against which the novel's events take place, but as a palpable force for good or evil by itself...I think the book has a strong plot with a lot of powerful elements going for it: interesting characters (including a dangerous and mysterious but chivalrous gunslinger), a sympathetic main character who struggles and triumphs against society's evils (not just a few western-style bad guys), beautiful and evocative descriptions of the landscape, and, as the backcover says it, \\"hairsbreadth escapes.\\"One last interesting thing is that, if I remember correctly, Zane Grey was actually a Pennsylvania dentist who failed in his attempt to set up a profitable dental practice in New York. He wanted to get into writing westerns, and when his first novel was a big success, his writing career was launched and he never looked back. Riders of the Purple Sage is probably his most famous book, and despite it's not being a typical western novel, it has become a classic in its field."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"What a delightful story -- promise rises from the ashes of misfortune. All is not lost. There is a future and it's bright and clear in the valley. I understand there is a sequel to Rider of the Purple Sage and would like to read it. If anyone has information, please let me know. Happy Zane Grey reading to all fans!"},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Western novels, movies, TV series have not been popular in recent years. It is good family entertainment, particularly US history.Having never read a Zane Grey book, I was pleasantly rewarded with an excellent read. There should be a revival of Zane Grey literature."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"When a kid in the 1930s, Zane Greys novels helped me through many a trying period and the moral lines drawn were a plus when in the service as a teenager during WWII.Grey\`s novels are everything a reader might want in plot, description and a great sense of \\"being there\\". Read them and pass them to your kids and never worry about suitability for a young teen. I can remember reading one and my Dad another."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I just finished 'Riders' a few minutes ago. It only grabbed me for short stretches, but not enough that you can't put it down. How Venters found the secret and lush hiding place above Surprise Valley and the race to run down Jerry Card and the Mormon henchmen were riveting. I guess my final feeling is that it's dated. Since literature is truly timeless, I know it's hard to explain. I've been on a western tear lately after reading 'Lonesome Dove', which is truly amazing. I then read 'Shane', 'Hondo', 'Hombre', 'Little Big Man' and 'The Last Picture Show' only because it was McMurtry. Perhaps 'Riders' is considered one of the 25 Best Western Novels written because having been published in 1912 it was kind of a precursor of the genre, of the strong silent gunslinger, etc. Really the most interesting thing I found about this book was the love and respect and admiration the characters showed for their horses."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"I thought the movie was very good, so I bought the book.The book has the little girl Fay who isn't in the movie.The details about the Mormons in this era were in the book as well, but not the movie.I have read books considered classic in English and European literaturethat aren't as good as this one!With this book the American western became literature."},{"Title":"Riders of the Purple Sage (Unabridged Classics in MP3)","review":"Recently I read the wonderful Peace Like a River, in which one of the youthful characters is a Zane Grey fan and writes poetry in the western mode. Remembering that Zane Grey was one of those authors I always meant to read, I located a copy of Riders of the Purple Sage and settled in.Like several of the other reviewers, I found the book an ambivalent read, but one that ultimately hooked me. The anti-Mormon tone is a bit thick, and the heroic cowboys are as realistic as James Bond. The sentimentality drips at times, and the dialog is stiff. Yet. . .the story is catching, and it is fun to see how so many of the western mythic and archetypal elements Grey weaves into his most famous novel. Great literature it isn't, but take on its own terms, it's enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Skeleton Man","review":"I have always loved this book. The first time I read it was in junior high. After several moves, I lost it. It was nostalgic to read it again and fall in love with this book as an adult."},{"Title":"The Skeleton Man","review":"This book is a book of mystery and suprise. It makes you wonder throughout the book, What's going to happen? Why did this happen? Can someone stop this from happening? This book makes your questions run wild and your heart beat faster.

I would definitely order from this vendor again."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"This is the best book on writing a story for a film. It provides the techniques that you will need for breaking a 3 act script into sequences, then writing the sequences, instead of trying to write the entire script. It will help you keep your story focused on the logic of your conflict, and your story's direction. You'll want to supplement this book with: \\"Screenwriting: A Sequence Approach,\\" by Paul Gulino, which goes into greater detail about screenplay sequences, and \\"Advanced Writing,\\" by Wells Draughon. Yes, you'll want all 3 books. Kitchen's book is a powerful book on how to build your story. Few writing books address building a story. This one does, and it is excellent. This book works for screenplays or novels."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"Jeff Kitchen has taken classic drama theory and built it into useful screenwriting tools, teaching the type of drama, conflict, and dilemma that the inventors of Hollywood used.He puts the horse firmly before the cart, not the other way around. If you take the time to plan out your screenplay and build it from the bottom up, with a firm dramatic foundation, then it won't have to take you fifteen drafts to get it right. Kitchen shows you how to construct your plot, infuse it with compelling Dramatic Action and Dilemma to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, and how to hold the structure together from beginning to end.Most useful for me are his Sequence tool, which insures that-as no less than Aristotle demands-one scene follows the next in a cause-and-effect way from your first scene to your last. And his Proposition/Plot tool, which makes sure that your protagonist and antagonist respond equally to each other's actions, building and building to a climactic fight-to-the-finish (a term which, to be sure, Kitchen applies even to films like \\"Tootsie\\").One of the best pieces of advice I've heard from a professional working screenwriter is to never spend more than three months tweaking a script. In WRITING A GREAT MOVIE, Jeff Kitchen gives you the tools to get it dramatically right the first time."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"Without a doubt, Jeff Kitchen's Writing a Great Movie is one of the best books on the process of screenwriting to come along in a long time. Kitchen thankfully avoids the flat approach of strict set rules as espoused by Syd Field and Robert McKee for a more creative and analytical technique focusing on dramatic integrity and developing dilemma which is essential for any good screenplay. Highly recommnded for any beginner or advanced screenwriter and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"I'm sitting in a room with the only light coming from my laptop.I've just run into the same roadblock I have crashed into throughout my ten years of writing. It is familiar, but no less frightening.In the scriptwriting process, this would be equivalent with the green flag at the Indy 500. It is the beginning of the adventure.It is both exciting and scary. However, I am now in a much better place. I've been given a map. Just keep taking a left and you'll end up at the finish line.Until I read \\"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist\\" I only knew how to punch the gas and hope for the best. That fearful moment of the unknown, and lack of preparation at the beginning of screenwriting is gone. It is still exciting, but no longer terrifying.Why? This book has given me very simple and straight-forward tools to pre-plan, organize, evaluate, modify, and lay out a map to the end goal -- a dramatic script.I have studied numerous books. I've taken several classes. This is the ONLY course of study that has solved my specific problem.I have an idea ... but how do a work it before I sit down to write. In some cases this methodical preparation will tell you that story isn't there. Even more so, it will help work out the problems in advance, while giving you the confidence in the project/idea before you sit down to write.I've done preparations in the past, but none have given me the confidence to know I've done the work and the story is there.There is something terrible in sitting down to write -- getting 60 pages in and realizing \\"I have no idea where I'm going OR what avenue I'm taking to get there\\".I offer this book at a cure to those that share this problem.For me, this book and these tools offer a variety of solutions.I'm focusing on this \\"lack of guidance\\" issue, because I image there are many people who share this problem. And because I've never found another course of study that solves this specific problem.While I focused on the lack of direction issue, I should note that this book helps in every aspect of dramatic writing. It has helped in building stronger characters, better drama, and more. I utilize these tools with EVERY script I'm writing. And most importantly, the tools have NEVER failed me. I still may write a crappy script in concept, but it is because of the decisions I made rather than a lack of dramatic structure.The only reason I would not endorse this book, is that I fear it will create a lot more competition in the script writing world.I'll set my self-centered fear aside and suggest this script for anyone that is interested in writing.Scott Schlichter"},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"My screenwriting partner and I attended a workshop taught by Jeff Kitchen and purchased this book. We used it as a roadmap to structure our first screenplay, which is now done and ready to shop. Thanks, Jeff Kitchen! He loves movies, he understands what makes them work--once you learn his approach, you can apply it to movies you see--you will find his structure, points, and analysis applies to any movie that grips you, any story that you love.

When is a sequence not a sequence?Answer: When a playwright provides a book on screenwriting that exploits dramatalurgical theories developed by a lawyer over 100 years ago.Confused? Not as half as confused as you will be after you've read this book.In fairness, the author, a classically trained playwright, sets forth some useful tools for dramatic storytelling. The tools were originally developed by William Thompson Price, a lawyer turned playwriting teacher, who founded a playwriting school in New York back in 1901.For example, the book provides useful tools for developing and maintaining a true character dilemma, i.e. a character forced to chose between two equally unacceptable alternatives. The book also sets forth a useful technique for outlining a story that involves working backward from the end to create a cause-and-effect chain of story beats. Though originally developed for use with theatrical plays, these tools are equally helpful in developing screenplays, novels, and any other form of dramatic storytelling.Unfortunately, the explanation of the tools is hopelessly complicated. \\"Plot\\" (with a capital P) means something different from \\"plot\\" (with a little p). The same is true for \\"Sequence\\" and \\"sequence\\". (Where was the editor and/or Editor in all this?)The main problem here is that the author chose to retain the original terminology developed by Price. So we get \\"logical propositions\\", \\"formal syllogisms\\", \\"conditions of the action\\", etc. (What a shock that playwriting terminology developed by a lawyer over a hundred years ago would be confusing and antiquated today when applied to modern screenwriting.)Those with an abundance of patience can dig through this book and find some useful techniques. Others should probably skip it.P.S. The author might consider preparing a second edition of the book, which clarifies and simplifies the terminology (and which, even more importantly, changes that atrocious cover design!)"},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"I've taken courses by McKee, Hague, Truby, Freeman, and others, read countless books, and given an ear to almost anybody else who had a word about screenwriting. While there are many top-notch teachers out there, and their material is excellent, after all this I still sensed that something very fundamental and very crucial was missing . . . there was just something very important about drama that I didn't quite understand.This book by Kitchen nailed it. He goes deep, and explains the \\"why\\" of drama better than anybody else I've seen. In my opinion, his book is better and more useful than any others out there, and if I were to recommend only one book on creating good drama, this would be it.It's demanding, and there are no fill-in-the-blank formulas here, but if you're up to the challenge and the task, this is it.Thanks, Jeff Kitchen!"},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"This is the best book on dramatic screenwriting I've come across. I've read most of the major screenwriting books in print and, though they all have their good points, Jeff's \\"Writing a Great Movie... \\" gets to the heart of what story is all about: drama. He presents four amazing tools that will whip your idea into a structurally solid story, if you are willing to do the work. Nobody said it would be easy but if you have the discipline to apply these techniques you'll find your work is 'touching' its audience in all the right places. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"Jeff Kitchen's book is truly a \\"find.\\" There are tons of books on writing, but so few of them focus on the most critical element to successful fiction writing: having a solid story.Although primarily intended for screenwriters, Jeff's book is useful for anyone who is trying to structure a story. His discussion of dilemma is enough to get any author of fiction headed down the right path. Further, his coverage of the 36 dramatic situations has proven critical to my ability to add depth to my stories. These two concepts, plus his presentation of \\"sequence, proposition, plot\\" will help anyone, beginner or published author, create compelling fiction."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"The first time I read Jeff's book it came in bits and pieces as a series of handouts for his course. Since then, as a multiple award-winning screenwriter in my last year of the MFA Screenwriting Program at UCLA, I've kept it by my side as a reference on each of the eight screenplays I've written. I would strongly recommend it to anyone starting out in screenwriting, and to anyone who has experience and wants to improve their craft. It's powerful, easy to follow, and chock full of useful advice and instruction on writing a great screenplay. The information on backward chaining of plot events is, all by itself, worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Writing a Great Movie: Four Advanced Tools for the Dramatist","review":"As a novice I found this groundbreaking to my education in film creation. Screenwriting is an art of word to visualization, and can be extremely complex when dealing with the human condition. With Jeff Kitchen's in depth however symplistic utilization, of dramatist' ideals of the past, melted with his own teachings, provide a compelling set of tools from which to work. It's as essential to a screenwriter as a hammer and chissel is to a sculpter."},{"Title":"Microsoft Small Business Server 2003 Unleashed","review":"There are several good books on Microsoft SBS 2003 but I have to say that this is the best I have read. Eriq Neale (Amy Babinchak, Susan Bradley, Chad Gross, Anne Stanton and many others) are the top names in the SBS community. They are all either MVP's or frequent contributors to the SBS email lists and blogs. When these folks speak you should listen.The book is a great resource for all levels. It introduces chapters at a basic level for someone who wishes to do their first install but then goes onto discuss Best Practices and even more important Troubleshooting tips.The book covers all the standard topics but also is one of the only books that covers topics like Macintosh integration Patching and ISA 2004.If you manage an SBS server or are a consultant getting ready to take the SBS Specialist exam this book is for you."},{"Title":"Microsoft Small Business Server 2003 Unleashed","review":"I purchased Eriq Neales book, \\"Small Business Server 2003 Unleashed\\". ISBN is 0-672-32805-4. So far, I have read the first five chapters in order. I intend to read the entire book in a sequential manner and then hopefully use it for field work. Here are my basic thoughts on those five chapters.Chapter 1 - This first chapter is a really great place to start for those who do not know the history and intricacies of the four iterations. This chapter covers little known details and some downright bad things in the various versions. I am happy to have read this chapter and learn many things I did not know. Remember the adage, \\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it\\". It appears MS has certainly learned from previous versions and have really gone out of their way to improve this current version. It makes me anxious for the next SBS version.Chapter 2 - This chapter is all about business and how to justify the cost for a business to implement this solution we call SBS2K3. This chapter uses what I call horse sense and some good tips that could help anyone who is going into any business, not just the IT business. This chapter gives a number of real business types and examples and what the justification for each is. In other words, it shows you how to sell the product to each type of business model in this space. SBS2K3 has numerous features, but not every business needs all the various features. Therefore, this chapter shows you how to use the strengths of various parts of SBS2K3 to help shore up various weaknesses in the type of business you are trying to gain a relationship. This chapter is a very good segue from the first chapter. It will help focus you on satisfying a business need and not just making an unnecessary sale. You might call this chapter an MBA lite!Chapter 3 - Before you install the product, you must plan it first. Every war is fought one battle at a time. Therefore, to win the war (customer) you must make sure you do not misfire. This chapter tells you step by step how to keep your powder dry and win the day. You will learn about selling the proper number and types of Cal's (Answer - almost always it is user, not always however). You will plan your network, IP's, DHCP, DNS, wireless and other topics. Each chapter also has summaries and best practices to help you with tidbits of wisdom, shortcuts and the like.Chapter 4 - Finally, we get to install the product. Here is where the rubber meets the road! This chapter assumes a fresh install on a new drive. It admittedly is not the hardcore stuff the migrators may be looking for, but it is a great guide on the install. It quickly moves over the not so detailed stuff and slows down and goes in-depth where it counts, at the GUI portion. It covers the To Do List in two parts and does a fine job of showing you each step and how to perform them. Those of you with a lot of experience however, need not apply. It finishes up with some good old fashioned troubleshooting. Did your installation go nuts on you and leave you crying? Turn here to find out about the logs that can help you get through the tangled mess.Chapter 5 - This chapter gets very serious and can help you out when it comes to DHCP and DNS specifically. It takes turns discussing what each are, how to set them up and how to use the tools to troubleshoot various issues. One nugget, many errors that seem to be AD related are actually DNS related. DNS and AD are so deeply intertwined, it is easy to troubleshoot what you think is an AD issue when in fact, DNS is the culprit! Have you met a friend named NSLookup? When you are troubleshooting DNS errors, this friend can help you out like few others can and get you thinking and looking in the right direction. Has your DHCP laughed at you and left? Learn how to wrangle that rascal and bring it back for good! This chapter was very good and worth the price of admission.This is as far as I have gotten in the book. So far, I feel very good, warm and fuzzy inside about my purchase. Are you an SBS'er? Do you dream of being one? If so, head on out right now and buy this book.Eriq and his 9 co-writers I'm sure will appreciate your purchase. Moreover, I think they would love your personal review. I am not sure who wrote what chapter (except Chapter 2 by Anne Stanton), but I know so far, there is a LOT of talent and gifts in this book."},{"Title":"Microsoft Small Business Server 2003 Unleashed","review":"I agree with the comments of the other reviewers...but did want to add a couple of thoughts. The book is less than 700 pages, certainly not huge by Unleashed standards. Don't let this fool you. For example, chapter 13, covering Exchange Daisaster Recovery actually starts off with an incredibly clear description of the Exchange database structure. It just made the practices suggested in the rest of the chapter much more accessible.The writing is clear and concise...no wasted sludge here. Is anybody else tired of the new breed of tech books that are full of step-by-step screen shots without explanation yet peppered with sidebars, cutesy anecdotes and puns that you have to wade through to get to the point?This book helped me solve problems the minute I got it in my hands.

And, after the headlong rush of reading and absorbing the copious content (it's a big book after all I've been told), I hold addional hope that I will still have sufficient drive to get that real review out the door and on to the pages of Amazon where it belongs. Maybe next month - see you then!"},{"Title":"Antique Dust: Ghost Stories","review":"English author Robert Westall is probably best known for his excellent children's books, many of which have supernatural themes. With &quot;Antique Dust,&quot; the author sets out deliberately, and largely successfully, to replicate the mood and quality of M.R. James' ghost stories. Several of Westall's stories are linked by a protagonist who is a dealer in antiques, a reasonable facsimile of the scholarly collectors who populate such wonderful James chillers as &quot;The Mezzotint,&quot; &quot;Canon Alberic's Scrapbook,&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes.&quot; Despite the relatively modern settings of his stories, Westall somehow captures James' rare ability to juxtapose &quot;real life&quot; and rather humdrum pursuits with the excitingly obscure world of paranormal beings. &quot;Antique Dust&quot; is a superb read for those who appreciate the pleasant shiver provided by the traditional English ghost story-an art which, sadly, is dying away amid the current rage for unsettling epics about sadistic serial killers, flesh-melting viruses, and inevitably gory apocalypse."},{"Title":"Free $ For College For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"David Rosen and Caryn Mladen, the authors, cover every route for paying for college: Scholarships, grants, low interest or interest-free loans, tuition discounts, and other stuff. With that said, I found half useful and the other half irrelevant and repetitive.This book gives good tips on what payment plans do and don't work. Like how working during college to pay your expenses is a bad idea.They also talk about scams, joining the military, athletic scholarships, and other means of reducing your tuition.The best part of the book is how they help you discover what makes you unique and how to use that to win grants, scholarships, and discounted tuition.After reading this Dummies book, I can now assist my friends and myself with getting free/discounted tuition.Here are a few good tips provided in the book:- Some states have early deadlines, so completing your FAFSA as soon as possible is a must. Most states funds require your FAFSA to be completed.- No scholarships are guaranteed, so don't pay money to get a scholarship or for someone to find it for you because most likely it is a scam.- Apply to many small scholarship because they have low competition, helps you winner bigger ones, and they can add up quite nicely.- When applying to scholarship, presentation is the key. Attach a cover letter, print on high quality paper and contact the scholarship committee's office after your submission.- College is a business, so you can negotiate a deal on your tuition. However finish college early because the price will keep on rising.- You can get your student loans forgiven by working for a low income school for 3-5 years."},{"Title":"Free $ For College For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"I originally borrowed this book from my local library but after reading through it a bit, I knew I had to have it!

But as I read through this, personally for me that always looking stuff online, it basically put into a book.I will say that if you a student in highschool getting ready for college, then this book is super beneficial for you. It gives you a heads up of what to do and look for and gives you information that sometimes people wont give you when you starting out college. You wont regret it, and you be more at ease because many stuff u need to know is in one book.I do enjoy the sample essays and what to put and not put into an essay for scholarship and why.

Created in 1940 by Dr. William Moulton Marston (a Harvard-trained psychologist with a law degree and a PhD who also invented the lie detector) to be an inspiration for women everywhere, Wonder Woman remains the world's most recognizable female superhero, thanks largely to Lynda Carter's humorous but respectful portrayal of this feminist (and gay) icon in the 1976-1979 hit TV series. Together with Superman and Batman, Wonder Woman has retained her iconic status as one of DC Comics' three flagship characters through much of the 20th century. However, as a monthly comic, Wonder Woman had become something of a joke by the 1980s - no one really knew how to handle such a strong female character that Dr. Marston had intended to inspire women. In fact, Wonder Woman was treated with much indignity when she was first made a secretary(?!?) in the Justice League of America in the 1960s, stripped of her powers in the 1970s, and increasingly had her character defined by her on again, off again relationship with air force pilot Steve Trevor. Something had to be done, and one of the most acclaimed comic book artists alive today, George Perez, volunteered his services. Wonder Woman was spectacularly relaunched in 1987. \\"Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals\\" collects the first seven issues of George Perez?s work on Wonder Woman and retells the origin of the princess of the Amazons, drawing inspiration from the rich fountainhead of fantasy that is Greek mythology. Born to the Queen of the Amazons, granted superhuman powers by their patron goddesses, and trained to be a warrior from childhood, Diana of Themyscira uses all her skills to promote the peaceful ideals of Gaia, the Earth Goddess, and to protect the innocent. In her first adventure away from her sheltered existence on Paradise Island, Diana must stop the mad war god Ares and his sons, Deimos and Phobos, from starting a nuclear holocaust that threatens to destroy all of earth. For someone like me who had loved Greek mythology from a very young age, George Perez's Wonder Woman was an absolute joy to read. Five stars and two thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"Wonder Woman Vol. 1: Gods and Mortals","review":"Relaunching a series is one tough job. And I have to say that George Perez singlehandedly took a brave step in making Wonder Woman relevant to the 1980s. It isn't easy to relaunch an established character. Particularly a female character.The best thing about the collection, aside from the art is the premise of the story. \\"What do gods do with all that power they amass?\\" And more importantly, \\"What do gods do, when there is no one left to worship them?\\"These are piviotal questions in the collection, that George and Co. have answered brilliantly."},{"Title":"Wonder Woman Vol. 1: Gods and Mortals","review":"The thrilling modern age retelling of the world's first and arguably still greatest superheroine, Wonder Woman, born Princess Diana to Queen Hippolyta of the Amazons on Paradise Island, chosen to go to \\"Man's World\\" to stop the mad war god Ares from destroying the world.Dated though it may be, George Perez's writing in collaboration with Len Wein, Greg Potter and Bruce Patterson helped redefine Wonder Woman for a new era, and it remains some of the best stuff to ever come from Wonder Woman's adventures.I wish I could do it more justice than that. A must read for all fan boys and fan girls."},{"Title":"Wonder Woman Vol. 1: Gods and Mortals","review":"Since I am not such a fan of Madureira or guys who followed his half manga style (although I like Japanese Manga), I'd reccomend this for fans of realistic and detailed artword.

I didn't know what I was doing wrong... I was following a food and water schedule, walking him plenty, and still there were accidents on a regular basis.Now that I've read this book and followed the methods, my dog has completely stopped having housebreaking accidents!

I'd walk him for half an hour and he'd have an accident as soon as we came inside.

I now know what schedule to follow, how to do crate training properly, how to prevent accidents and what to do about them when they do happen.Housebreaking is a bit of a project for anyone who has a dog, but with this book I feel confident that housebreaking will be overwith much faster and with less damage to my home. The front cover says \\"30 days or less to a trustworthy pet\\", and I'll bet that's true because my dog is doing much better with housebreaking already and it's only been 3 days!Also, in the editorial review it says that the chapters are organized nicely for quick and easy future reference, and that's turned out to be helpful too.

This book taught me many things I did not know and it showed me the things I had done incorrectly with past dogs.I used to think crating dogs was cruel. But it has shown me that just like a baby who is kept in a playpen to be safe from harmful things in the room, a crate is a puppy's safe area -- a den -- enjoyed by them. And crate training I now know is the biggest aid in housebreaking a dog.

The book is very straight forward and addresses everything you need to know about house training dogs. We brought our puppy home when he was 8 weeks old. I bought everything on the must have lists and followed everything exactly. By 4 months old he was completely house trained. He's now 8 months old and we couldn't ask for a better situation.

I have two Italian greyhounds, each adopted from rescue several months apart (one at 9 months old and one just over a year old); neither of them were housebroken. Italian greyhounds (like many small breed dogs) are known for being extremely difficult to housebreak - it is the second most common reason they are surrendered to rescue (the first being leg breaks). While researching the breed and reading up on various forums, many Italian greyhound owners state that this breed can never truly be housebroken and will always be prone to occasional accidents, and that it's just something you have to live with when you have these dogs. After reading this book and following the methods, both of my dogs were completely housebroken in just under one month. During that month I had to be very diligent, but the work paid off - it has been several years since and both dogs are still completely reliable. We even moved to a new residence (the book addresses the fact that dogs can regress in their training for a variety of reasons, one of them being moving to a new home) and never had any problems.

Apparently working \\"Mom's\\" don't have the right to have a dog. I didn't even read past that part and I wish I could have returned the book. Most people don't have the luxury of staying home all day.

We could not find anyone to take her. So we bought this book. I truly believe it saved her and us! We have had our Irish two years and, now, she is the sweetest dog, except she is still very fearful of most men. She was probably kicked in the teeth before we got her because she has a broken front tooth. Still, we applied the rules from this book and were very consistent.

Frank Baum, published posthumously in July 1920 (a year and 2 months after his fatal stroke). Where Baum's playful letter to his readers usually prefaces the text, a brief note written by the publishers takes its place. They say that unfortunately \\"The Royal Historian of Oz\\" was called away to a place (heaven) where other children can hear his stories, but he wrote this novel with love and care for his fans to remember him by and they all hope we enjoy them.The book opens with Dorothy and Princess Ozma traveling to the Quadling Country to visit with Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. While looking through the Good Witches' Great Book of Records, Ozma discovers that a war is soon underway between the inhabitants of two lesser known parts of Oz, the Skeezers and the Flatheads. Both Ozma and Dorothy embark on a journey to both places in order to prevent warfare, but are made prisoners by the queen of the Skeezers, Coo-ee-ooh, and submerged in her underwater glass kingdom. It's up to Glinda and the others to set things right.It's nice that Glinda finally has her moment in the sun. She's appeared in all of the Oz books, but never as a main character. Obviously the late Baum saved the best for last by allowing the Great Sorceress to show her stuff. Other favorite characters like Scraps, the Scarecrow, the Wizard and Billina show up too. One of my favorite parts of the story involves a new character named Ervic, a Skeezer who escaped the island before it was submerged, and his journey to the home of Reera the Red, a Yookoohoo (witch) who can transform herself, as well as everything in her home, into whatever she wishes. When Ervic first arrives, he finds Reera as a grey ape wearing nothing but a lace cap and an apron (to keep her cool in the summer heat) and does everything she can to run the boy out of her unwelcoming domain: making her creepy crawly pet spiders, a giant rat and a large crocodile bother him in order to make him run away. However, the boy stays calm thanks to 3 magical fishes who guide him through it all.Although the Oz stories would continue under the writings of Ruth Plumly Thompson and many other authors, none of them could touch Baum's masterful mix of adventure, suspense and magic. What a send-off."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"One of the better books in the series, with a very valuable message - duty means performing some tasks that are unpleasant, but performing those very tasks can make life better for everyone.

Both are made captive by the leader of the Skeezers, who has no interest in peace, and are nearly made permanent prisoners when the Skeezers city becomes trapped under a lake.

Frank Baum is the last in the oz series that was written by Baum and is a splendid tale where we meet most of ourbeloved charachters like Ozma, Dorothy, Glinda, Jack Pumpkin, The Glass Cat and many other memorable ones. The story centers around Dorothy's and Ozmas attempt to avert a war between two tribes called the Flatheads and the Skeezers. The story takes many zany and crazy turns is a fitting conclusion to Baums oz series and I can not wait to read the rest of the oz books written by the other authors like Plumly Thompson and others."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this book on the shelf at Books Kinokuniya, which I bought within the next 2 weeks and read within the next day or two. As many of you already know, this is L. Frank Baum's last writing of an adventure in Oz involving our beloved friends and characters before he died. But what many of you don't know is that this book is the 15th (yes, 15. I choose to count 'Little Wizard Stories of Oz' as part of the series, as it was written by him).I quote form the Afterword: 'Baum finished 'Glinda' in February of 1918, only 3 months before his death in May, and 1 year and 1/2 before the book was published. Though Baum did not live to see 'Glinda' published, he seems to have written it as a farewell to Oz. Since he was quite ill writing it, Baum knew this might be his last oz book. Perhaps that is why he not only gave so many of his beloved characters a \\"final bow\\" in 'Glinda', but also used the book to tie up the loose ends of how magic works in Oz'.In this adventure, Dorothy and Ozma's visit to Glinda reveals (through the Great Book of Records) that the Skeezers have declared war on the Flatheads. Despite Glinda's lack of knowledge on them and her urging for them not to go, Ozma insists on solving the war, as she is Queen of Oz, and Dorothy agrees to come along too, who is given a magic ring by Glinda in time of need (Chapter 1 has a lot of pages, possibly the most out of the entire book). In their journey to the NorthWest, they manage to escape a Spider King, get across a Valley of Mist thanks to the Mist Maidens and arrive at Flathead Mountain. Meeting the King, Su-dic (L. Frank Baum makes another wordplay), they learn how his Queen Wife Witch, Rora, is also involved in the war and manage to escape before being captured. They arrive at the Skeezers' Lake Glass Dome, and their meeting with the young but selfish and vain Queen Coo-ee-oh results in being her prsioners, but fortunately become friends with one of her maids, Lady Aurex. That night, the Flatheads' attack results in the Glass Dome sinking into the lake and Coo-ee-oh being turned into a diamond swan (but still she remains vain of herself), which means that she cannot return the Glass Dome to the surface, leaving Dorothy and Ozma trapped below, even though they try to find ways to break the enchantment. Glinda learns of their trouble and calls together Ozma's Counsellors, which consists of (almost) all the characters we have known, met and loved. Together, they decide to find and free Dorothy and Ozma from their imprisonment. Meanwhile, one of Coo-ee-oh's servants, a young boy named Ervic meets the 3 Magic Adepts, who have been transformed into fishes, thanks to Coo-ee-oh's theft, and follows their instructions, which leads to his meeting of Red Reera the Yookoohoo sorceress, while at the same time Glinda and the others arrive at the Skeezer Lake. Reera returns the fishes to their true forms, who, along with Ervic, return to the Skeezer Lake, where they meet Glinda, the Wizard and everyone else, who together attempt to free the captured citizens of the Glass Dome. Eventually, the 5 magical performers join up with Ozma, Dorothy and Lady Aurex in Coo-ee-oh's basement, where they discover the means of Coo-ee-oh's magic, which rises the Glass Dome back to the surface. Once returned safely, a new Queen of the Skeezers is crowned, and the Flatheads are given treatment in a way that will stop further trouble from arising from them.I loved reading this book and adding this to my collection of Oz Books by Baum and others. Although, even though this was a great adventure, it also had a few mistakes and/or disappointments:* The only characters who failed to appear in this adventure are Aunt Em (Uncle Henry appears instead), the Hungry Tiger, Billina the Yellow Hen and Eurika, Dorothy's Kitten (Dorothy does mention the colours of the cat though). One character I HATE having in the series is Mr. H. M. Woogle-bug, T. E. (Highly Magnified, Thoroughly Educated), appearing here as one of Ozma's Counsellors. The story would've had an improvement if the HUNGRY TIGER had replaced him insted, along with a final appearance by Aunt Em, Billina, and possibly as an extra delight, the Good Witch of the North.* Another disappointment is the pictures. John doesn't draw enough pictures throughout the book, and many chapters only have 1, 2 or 3 images: the traditional 'chapter-title', a 'full colour plate' and 'end-of-chapter' images (although, it is nice having the 'chapter titles' going for almost 2 pages). John does a portrait of Glinda, and it gets published twice. Fortunately, some chapters do have 5 or so pictures. There are no images of Reera the Red or Rora in their true forms, and quite a few colour plates are placed in the wrong chapter (e.g. the colour-plate of Dorothy and Ozma being carried by the Mist Maidens is placed in Chapter 2, when actually that particular adventure is in Chapter 3). Also, John draws 2 images of Trot and the Patchwork Girl: one in colour, the other black-and-white (which is far better, which means his should've kept the b&w; version and changed the colour one to something else). Also, pg 176 has the Scarecrow drawn without his nose! And I much prefer having Dorothy's hair being long and brown, with Ozma longer and golden (slightly curled). But Dorothy still has short blonde hair, and Ozma's dark hair is tied up, a bit like Glinda's portrait. Glinda should've been drawn with her hair out in ringlets instead of in a 'net'.* A few other reviewers have said that Glinda doesn't have a big enough appearance in this book, although her role is magnified. I slightly do agree that she could've appeared and done more in the story, maybe doing a 'end-of-story-speech-to-Dorothy-and-Ozma', which may have been expected, but rememeber, L. Frank Baum was sick during the writing of this story, so perhaps he meant to, but couldn't get around to it without letting anybody know.But there are a few good points that are interesting about this book. L. Frank Baum may have gone back to his play and taken a scene/concept of that production and put it in this book: Glinda of the South gives Dorothy a Magic Ring in time of need which helps start the Rescue Expedition, which is just like how in the 1902 Stage play of 'the Wizard of Oz' how Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, also gave Dorothy a magic ring, which was later used to call for help in the Poppy Field, which summoned the snow storm to destroy the poison flowers.As you may have noticed, the Flatheads who live in the NorthWest in this 'Glinda' book, are not the same Hammer-Heads as encountered by Dorothy and her friends in their journey to Glinda in the South in the 'Wonderful Wizard' book, which was an odd surprise. They are two entirely different people with different bodies, despite the similar flathead appearance.But despite the mistakes and small/unimportant disappoitments, this was still a fantastic book to read. I'm sure that this would be an even more fantastic movie, if given a few improvements and slight changes."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"Excitment surged through me as I browsed the bookstore shelf, I had found the long-forgotten OZ shelf of the childrens section. I read most of the OZ books long ago, but I had noticed that there were a few that I didn't recall reading, so I ventured into the corner were Frank Baums captivating stories were held. I bought this book, excited about Dorothys adventures that I had yet to experience, and when I opened the cover, I noticed a note stating that this was Baum's last book, and that the publishers were going to try to create another book about OZ. I obviously noticed that this never came to be. Baum seemed to know this would be his last book, because the world of Oz went out with a bang. Every loved character was mentioned, or brought back into the wonderful tale of Dorothy, Ozma, Glinda, Flatheads and Skeezers.

All previous characters present and trying to save the girls again. Liked the new characters."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"The final book of L. Frank Baum's original Oz series is bittersweet. Sweet because it features Glinda -- so pretty in pink on the cover. Bitter because Baum died before it was published in 1920, and at the beginning of the tale where an endearing letter from the author would generally be there is instead a missive from the publisher. Rats. Though other Oz tales would follow, this one marks the end of Baum's original 14. It only seemed like the writer, who suffered a fatal stroke at age 62 in May 1919, would go on to write these tales forever.So the sweet sorceress of Oz comes front and center in this one, instrumental in saving the day and certainly demonstrating her value in the land of Oz. (By the way, unlike the 1939 Oz film, Glinda is the Good Witch of the South in Baum's books -- Quadling Country -- though she's never really referred to that way. Baum does not identify a witch of the North, though the wicked witches of the East and West come into play just as they did in the classic movie.)In the action here, Princess Ozma observes, in Glinda's Great Book of Records, that there are two obscure groups of Oz inhabitants, the Skeezers and the Flatheads, who are about to go to war. Ozma decides she must journey to this far corner of her kingdom, way up on the edge of Gilliken Country, to bring these wayward subjects in line. Dorothy accompanies the fair princess, but then the two encounter great trouble. Cue the great Glinda.Baum finishes well, though I have to wonder, because of the very slightly different flavor of this last book, if his publisher had to do a little finishing for him."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"We got the other 13 books a while ago in the Oz series and Glinda of OZ wasnt available.

Having had this book for many a year it is good to see it back in hardcover. True there is the Del Ray paperback, but this one is the edition to get your children. Baum's books are still wonderful and magical today. His writing has a wonderful warmth and originality to it that one doesn't get very often. Even if your children only know of the film it's ok to get this for them. Dorothy and Glinda as well as all the other favorites from the MGM film are here with the new creations of Baum. Don't think this book is dull...far from it. Baum has written a very tightly plotted story with plenty of adventure.

When Ozma and Dorothy try to reason with both parties they are rejected by one group, and taken prisoner by the other.

Not one of the best books in the series but not one of the worst, either, \\"Glinda\\" falls somewhere in the middle. While visiting the good witch Glinda, Ozma and Dorothy learn of two factions living in a remote corner of Oz that are planning to go to war. Wanting to prevent such discord in her paradise, Ozma and Dorothy travel to this land to prevent the Skeezers and Flatheads from coming to blows, but wind up becoming prisoners in an island beneath a lake.The biggest problem I have with this book, as with many of the \\"Oz\\" books, is that just because the title has a character's name in it doesn't mean he or she is the star. While this is one of Glinda's bigger roles, it's not really her book but more of an ensemble piece. Baum, as if he knew this would be his last outing, crams nearly every character he'd created into the rescue party that sets out to free Ozma and Dorothy (but no Hungry Tiger, sadly), and most of the characters featured in that rescue don't have much to do but stand around befuddled.The story has a fair amount of magic and introduces a few new characters, but no particularly memorable ones. Though there's nothing really bad about it, the book is noteworthy mainly because it's Baum's last before he died and Ruth Thompson took over the series.Wow.

Baum shows a lot of ingenuity in this book and the sinking of the city underwater reminds me of a work of science fiction--but of course, Baum has showed glimmers of this before, with the introduction of such characters as the robotic Tik-Tok.

Often in the other books the \\"bad\\" antagonist characters (the Nome King, Kalidahs, etc.) advocated or committed acts of violence. In the other books those characters are always foiled by their own foolishness and the kindness, gentleness, cleverness, and magic of our heroines and heroes. Unfortunately, in this book there are some disturbing moments of terrible behavior on the part of our beloved characters. Among other things, Dorothy talks about \\"whipping\\" the Pink Kitten! What the ?!?!?!?!?!? (Yes, the Pink Kitten is incorrigible and ultra-naughty, but still!)I had forgotten how much these things upset me as a little girl. In the other Oz books Dorothy and Button Bright would never try to hurt another creature. This is so un-Ozish that it troubles me.Glinda of Oz is still fun, but not a book I'd give my little girl.

It's the most conflict-centered piece except RINKITINK and maybe THE LAND OF OZ.More than most, this book has a plot which begins, develops, and concludes. More than most, it lets you watch the magicians at work together, pooling their resources to accomplish a complicated task. More than most it raises interesting long-term questions about distant local wars and the responsibilities of great powers.It offers some of the most interesting secondary characters: not just the Su-Dic and Coo-ee-oh who are plausible, vivid personalities, but Red Reera, Ervic, the \\"three fishes\\" and even the Su-Dic's golden pig wife. All outstandingly Ozzy characters.This book also has a more sci-fi quality to it than usual, with a deadly poison capable of inflicting major environmental damage and an island held in place by an expanding metal column. (Baum shows he's not senile, by remembering that if you lower the water level and then raise the island, it goes way above the lake's surface.) The pictures of Coo-ee-oh's hi-tech magic instruments enhance the sci-fi feel. There's also a greater sense of real danger in this book than many others. The Su-Dic and Coo-ee-oh are as serious and ruthless as any of Baum's villians and there's nothing comical about either of them except maybe the idea of canned brains, which is presented as dead serious.Some readers complain that it's not really about Glinda. OK, but is WIZARD really about the Wizard? Is EMERALD CITY about the Emerald City AT ALL? Also, SCARECROW.More objectionable is the inconsistancy that Dorothy was wearing the Magic Belt the whole time, and should have been able to teleport home. Plus, didn't she learn in LOST PRINCESS to make wishes on it? Baum invested way too much power in the Magic Belt from the very beginning. Lifted it from the Tarnhelm in DAS RHEINGOLD but that's another review."},{"Title":"Glinda of Oz","review":"With the completion of Glinda of OZ, I can now claim to have read every one of L.

Being the good, just, and noble queen she is, Ozma decides to travel there with Dorothy and the wooden sawhorse in order to implore her people to solve their differences without violence. The journey there is practically uneventful (Ozma and Dorothy adroitly find themselves out of only one misstep), but once they visit Evil Queen Coo-eh-oh they find themselves imprisoned under a globe. Glinda, alerted of their peril by an enchanted ring she gave to Dorothy, sets out immediately with all of OZ's favorite characters in order to rescue the two girls and make peace between the Flatheads and the Skeezers.Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this story as much as I did the others; perhaps that is because I've grown up and lost my ability to see the playful fun in Baum's books-although I certainly hope not!"},{"Title":"The ice ghosts mystery.","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old and I've read it innumerable times since.

I think if you read this, agree or disagree, you will never look at religions the same way again.Further, this is Eliade's most accessible and complete book.I graduated with a religious studies degree from Yale University, and read this book in the first year after I graduated. I learned nearly as much from this book alone as I did from my undergraduate education. That is a strong statement, but I mean it."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"Amidst the chaotic profusion of symbols, myths, rituals and mystical perspectives of the world's religious traditions, Eliade weaves a mandela-like portrait of humankind's incredibly vital relationship with the divine, spanning several thousand years. Not for the faint of heart, this monumental work provides important insight into the often confusing psychology of the primitive religious experience; an experience characterized by perspectives charged with meaning across broad fields of associative and interdependent symbolic realms.Eliade bases his discoveries of common patterns in the global-religious-traditions upon a thematic theoretical framework. In this manner, he avoids the pitfalls latent in more common conceptions of religious experience that are defined by psychologically artificial categories created within perspectives that tend to be too narrow. Such commonly expressed and narrowly defined perspectives often stop short of understanding the limits of psychologically artificial, chronological, geographic and even ethnic categories; categories which humanity's important religious archetypes of divine experience have traditionally and absolutely transcended.In this vein, Eliade's &quot;Patterns in Comparative Religion&quot; also provides important material for the interpretation of dreams. I think it is no mere coincidence that both primitive religious experience and the native realm of the unconscious both display a disturbing and important tendency to buck the rules of normality that our modern conscious minds so often wish to impose upon experience. It is from the creative associative milieu of dream symbolism that humanity's religious traditions have incessantly sprung and to which one must arguably return for the most fertile understanding of the 'primitive' divine experience.Mircea Eliade's &quot;Patterns in Comparative Religion&quot; surely presented me with a formidable challenge, however, as with any important challenge to understanding that I have experienced, the rewards have far outweighed the difficulties encountered along the way."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"Mircea Eliade's contribution to the study of religion cannot be overestimated; his works quite simply revolutionized the discipline. Unfortunately, he had a tendency, especially in later life, to crank out volumes on every conceivable theme and concept, and many of these later works simply do not work. But he wrote a small number of great books, works without which you simply cannot claim to have read the \\"classics.\\" Patterns is one of these great books.The translation is dubious, to the say the least, but even so Eliade comes through. He always does. In Patterns, he walks through a kaleidoscope of images and concepts, demonstrating at once his brilliance and his disturbingly broad reading. He never uses one example where ten will serve, and this becomes part of the whole argumentative structure of the book.The point, you see, is that these \\"patterns\\" he pulls out-out of history, out of context, whatever-appear again and again. The opening chapter, on \\"Sky Gods,\\" for example, is a little manifesto, a demonstration of everything Eliade is all about. If you really master this chapter, come to understand every bit of how it works, you will truly understand Eliade.For those who have been introduced to Eliade through The Sacred and the Profane, for example, and are looking for an accessible book, Patterns does have the difficulty of moving rather rapidly through its arguments. Some discussions simply move too fast for the general reader; Eliade is trying to talk primarily to scholars, and as such he assumes that his readers have some familiarity with his examples. But unless you plan to challenge his thought deeply, you simply do not need to read all of the background material.One failing of Patterns is simply its publication date: this book is from the fifties. And a lot has changed since then, particularly our knowledge of lots of other religions. So sometimes his examples seem simplistic, or downright dubious-and they are! But you just can't begin to make sense of Eliade without Patterns.If you liked Joseph Campbell, it's time to step up to the plate. Read Patterns, maybe reading Cosmos and History and The Sacred and the Profane first, and you'll see the real thing at work. It's true, he doesn't really address his audience magnetically as Campbell sometimes does, but then his project is primarily to suggest to that reading and studying other people's religions is the only way for moderns. You see, desacralization has made modern humanity incapable of seeing the truly powerful worldview of homo religiosus (religious humanity). But unlike Campbell, Eliade doesn't think that we can solve this by getting in touch with our bliss and our myths; he thinks that only reading books can approximate this world.Admittedly, from a scholarly perspective Eliade is a crypto-theologian with a huge axe to grind. Sure, some of his examples are extremely problematic-a point that Jonathan Z. Smith has made on more than one occasion. But like Smith, I'd argue that we need to go through, not around: without Eliade, we can never really make sense of how we look at religion now, how everyone looks at it.The point about Patterns is that it's really a great book. It's wrong-about just about everything, when you get down to it!-but it's one that needs to be read. These days, lots of folks in and out of the Ivory Tower seem to want to get in touch with spirituality. But Eliade was talking about this fifty years ago, and his points still have considerable weight. Why reinvent the wheel? Go to the source, read Eliade at his best, and feel a revolution overtaking you."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"this is a must-have book for everyone interested in mythology and religion. this book defines what religion was to ancient people, and what was considered sacred to them. it covers the structure of the sacred, the sky and sky gods, the sun and sun-worship, the moon, water and water symbolism, sacred stones(why they were considered sacred), the earth/woman/fertility connection, vegetation/regeneration, the axis mundi, agriculture and fertility cults, sacred places, sacred time, the function of myths, and the structure of symbols. in this book you will find what all religions and mythologies, from all over the world, have in common. you will find the roots of all religious beliefs in this book. it is definitely worth your time to read, again and again."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"Eliade presents an impressive collection of data from the religions and mythologies of an incredible number of different cultures, organized according to recurring themes: sky gods, agricultural goddesses, cycles of death and rebirth, and so on.

I'm left with unsatisfied curiosity to know what Eliade believed is to be learned from this collection of parallels.

The answer is in this book."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"This book is a neat summation of a career, which, taken as a whole, was an amazing feat of a lifetime that will probably never be repeated again. Academia in Eliade's day was an agon of turbo charged minds who still possessed an elegant, old-style scholarly erudition. Thinking was the flower of a massive global system that could cull the best and brightest from hundreds of millions of Europeans and afford to keep them fed and comfortable, amidst enormous libraries with works collected from the biggest empires the world had known. But this discourse was still flush with confidence and hadn't yet passed into the closed, self-referential pedantry and nauseous over-specialization we often see today.This time, furthermore, was one of tremendous discovery and enthusiasm over this entire world of religions that couldn't even have been imagined before. It was a time that was witnessing--well, the few who cared to notice were witnessing--the destruction of literally thousands of ancient traditions--ancient worlds. There was a palpable feeling that we had to learn from and save some glimmer of their meaning not only to preserve mankind's heritage, but also to, perhaps, learn the truths that would save us from ourselves. Something of the zeal of this quest in captured in \\"Youth Without Youth,\\" a book and movie also to be highly recommended as a commentary on the pursuit that guided Eliade's life.Eliade was one of the most Erudite thinkers in history, being familiar with the whole range of western sources from Homer and the bible to the latest results of phenomenological research, along with an admirable attention paid to the folk traditions of Europe. He had also read much of what was available from the entire rest of the world. The range of source material that Eliade had access to by his mastery of European and ancient languages was astounding.In this book its almost like he has taken a whole truckload of source materials and anthropology books, drew a mind map of the contents on a five story tall white board, and then condensed the contents into the size of a single book."},{"Title":"Patterns in comparative religion","review":"This the last book my son has asked for.

This book was quite complete as of it's publication date, but it is a little out-of-date now. Mr. Clarke also confuses readers with inconsistent terminology at times, once referring to a server as a dedicated 'workstation' rather than a dedicated computer, and a continuing reference to a 'central print queue' rather than just 'print queue.' His constant medical analogies and references are mundane and worthless. The book is written to about an eighth grade level, not an eighth grade reading level, but an eighth grade intelligence level. It's like reading a child's book of NetWare. The book does appear to be organized well and the necessary information is contained in the book. It's just unfortunate that it is buried between and beneath endless pages of medical school wannabe diatribes, 'Zen' garbage, and off-topic quizzes as filler. The book is nearly 1,000 pages, but if the useless garbage were removed, it would be more like 600-700 pages. It's truly too bad because Mr. James does appear to know NetWare very well. I teach computer courses for a business college that uses this book as a text. It is extremely difficult to teach from this book because of the filler and the lack of useful quizzes and tests in the book. The Clarke Tests on the CD are good, but are filled with stupid sound clips from movies and TV that are of varying volume, some quiet and some quite loud. They are very unprofessionally recorded and very annoying during testing. The tests on the CD included with the New Riders MCSE books are far superior to the Clarke tests, however. The saddest reality is that this is apparently the best book available other than Novell's own training books which are much more expensive and are apparently only available through authorized training centers (with training courses)."},{"Title":"Novell's CNE Study Guide for Core Technologies","review":"I like the way Clarke organized the relevant topics in passing the CNE exam---adding Humor to a boring concept.

Whoa! The Novell course goes into substantially more detail than the Microsoft course. I found Clarke's book to be an excellent guide through the maze of material that Novell requires familiarity with. And it was a pleasure to notice that this book seems to be the foundation of many other guides and lectures that I have been exposed to both in Novell and Microsoft curriculums. The author does go overboard on Zen commercials, puzzles, brain teasers, and the like but it is easy to skip over these parts when you have time only to study material you will need for an exam (or in my case, for my next lecture)."},{"Title":"Novell's CNE Study Guide for Core Technologies","review":"Clarke has an easy way of presenting what is otherwise complicated technical concepts.

A story of any person, her/his feelings of love, submission, power, and the eternal quest for the answer to one's sufferrings and triumphs in life. A book that feels as real today as it did yesterday."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"Boleslaw Prus' The Doll falls into a category of books which could be described as peripheral realism. They are late 19th century novels which share nothing in common except that they are written in countries which are in the \\"periphery\\" of world literature. This is not a comment on their quality, but on the lack of curiosity of the Anglo-American mind to take the trouble to encounter them. Other examples of this trend are the Spaniard Benito Perez Galdos, the Portuguese writer Jose Maria de Eca de Quieros and the Italians Giovanni Verga and Antonio Fogazzaro.\\"The Doll\\" is not of the same quality as such works as \\"Fortunata and Jacintha\\", \\"The Maias,\\" or even \\"The Little World of the Past.\\" Supposedly it is the story of a successful businessman who tries and fails to win the heart of a shallow, spoiled, aristocratic girl--the doll of the title. It is this story, but there is more to it than that, more than what Prus thinks. When the protagonist Stanislaw Wokulski is not worrying ineffectively over Izabela Lecki, he is a smashingly successfully businessman. Why he is so succcessful is not really made clear, Prus does not have Balzac's eye for describing complex financial transactions in compelling ways. Wokulski is obviously a good employer and obviously a man of charitable and humane impulses. The woman he assists, and whom his clerk thinks would be a better wife, Mrs. Sawatska, is a rather conventional portrait of female virtue. If there is anything truly \\"Dickensian\\" in this book, as the dust jacket promises, it is not Prus' sense of detail, which is meagre, or a fine talent for grotesquerie or wit, but instead the conventional, rather vapid portrait of his heroes. The style is prosaic, the social atmosphere rather narrow, and people wanting to learn about the urbanity or religious life or common people or entertainments of 19th century Warsaw should look elsewhere.There is one passage that is an exception to this. It really is remarkable, the one that portrays Izabela's complete isolation from the real world. \\"If anyone had asked her point-blank what this world is, and what she herself was, she would have certainly have repled that the world is an enchanted garden full of magical castles, and that she herself was a goddess or nymph imprisoned in a body.\\"From her cradle, Izabela had lived in a beautiful world that was not only superhuman but even supernatural. For she slept in feathers, dressed in silks and satins, sat on carved and polished ebony or rosewood, drank from crystal, ate from silver and porcelain as costly as gold.\\"The seasons of the year did not exist for her, only an everlasting spring full of soft light, living flowers and perfumes. The times of day did not exist for her either, since for whole months at a time she would go to bed at eight in the monring and dine at two at night. There was no difference in geographical location, since in Paris, Vienna, Rome, Berlin or London she would find the same food--soups from Pacific seaweed, oysters from the North Sea, fish from the Atlantic or Mediterranean, animals from every country, fruits from all parts of the globe. For her, even the force of gravity did not exist, since her chairs were placed for her, plates were handed, she herself was driven in carriages through the streets, conducted inside, helped upstairs.\\"As for other parts of the novel, there is a continuing theme of anti-semitism as Wokulski and his colleagues notice with some concern its rise. Unfortunately it is not entirely clear whether Wokulski or Prus fully recognize its evil or whether they share some of it themselves. On a first glance Wokulski is a hard working businessman, the kind that Poland obviously needs, who is not appreciated by its inefficient aristocracy. They look down on him as an arriviste and the selfish, vapid Izabela either ignores him or toys with his feelings. But on another level Wokulski is not really attracted to her. He is in more in love with the concept of matrimony than with an actual person. It is not simply the conservative atmosphere around courting that hampers him, but Wokulski's own lack of force. This portait of Wokulski's ambiguity, an almost Hamlet like quality of indecision, does not make compelling reading. But it is an important portrait of impotent masochism and it is expertly done. It is this that establishes Prus' claim to greatness."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"If you have any interest in European Literature, then this novel is worthwile reading. All the major characters are beautifully created; the feelings that they experience are very realistic. The author's style is very powerful, and the plot is interesting enough to keep you reading until the spectacular conclusion. Easily one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"I immensely enjoyed the story; the characters (especially Stas); the details of life in Warsaw, the Polish countryside and Paris; the overall quality of the writing; etc.Two other observations. Firstly, a very strong undercurrent of anti-semitism runs throughout the book, which was a bit uncomfortable to read at times. I was struck by how prevalent these sentiments seemed to be in Poland at the time. I guess I had heard this was the case, but to see it present in such a matter of fact way, albeit in a novel, was still unsettling.Tied to that was some of the commentary from the Jewish characters that times would get even tougher for them as they were experiencing increasing levels of prejudice: a grim foreshadowing of future events.Secondly, I could not help from thinking how awful things would become in Warsaw in some 40-50 years after this book was published. Prus describes much of Warsaw life in loving detail, complete with vivid descriptions of buildings, streets, parks, etc: all to be turned into indescribable rubble and chaos by the Nazis, with no little help from the Soviets. Very sad, indeed."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"This novel is a piece of micro-sociology in action. The story of Stanislav Vokulski aspirational life, the impossibilities of his love, the context painted with paints taken from \\"all-social levels and intersections\\" is depicted in the way that the imagination really imagine the tensions of those created, but not paper, lives. Many of book's characters strives for the notion of \\"development\\" both social and individual.The author took care to make their efforts as difficult as they really are. Highly recommended for men around forty. They use to read it with much insight here in Poland at that point of their life, when taste of apparent success may occur surprisingly bitter and biggest dreams not worth the engagement.Strangely enough the book is \\"a must read\\" position in Polish high school - for 18-year kids not understanding the half of its world."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"While this tale is tedious at times, I found it relevent for our times. See it in a modern context. Our celebrities arfe the aristocrats. While we worship them and youthful beauty, our country is sinking, and while we fool around (sports events often usurp the evening news, for example), the Chinese are buying up our industries, taking jobs away, and we are powerless. This book was a warning to Poles to wake up. It's appropriate for us too. I read this during the O&#62;J&#62; Simpson trials when the rest of the country was watching the trial. There are some trials in the novel that we would find familiar to our court system. There are too many parallels for comfort."},{"Title":"The Doll","review":"I got half-way through and quit; the book just didn't work for me. Prus obviously intended to write \\"realistically\\", and his rather disconnected deployment of scenes and character development does mimic the complexities of real life. So, in that sense, he was a success.However, he completely fails on much more important levels. For example, the plot lacks even a hint of conflict. Wolkulski (the main character) faces no conflict as he gives in to his obsession for Izabella, nor does he seem to have any particular difficulty in achieving any of his foolish stunts to try to win her. Since it's obvious from the start the relationship is doomed, there's not the tension of \\"will he get the girl?\\" Not even the obvious potential friction of his being a class-crossing social climber creates any conflict (other than a few characters commenting on his boorish manners). A 600+ page book needs more conflict than that to justify itself. I could not uncover the purpose of reading (or of having written) the book.Prus endows \\"The Doll\\" with the trappings of realist novels: frightening descriptions of the lowest of the poor, moral angst of rich do-gooders over the poor in their midst, endless analogies between streetwalkers and Mary Magdelene or poor men and Christ, and a vast panorama of characters representing all levels of society. However, Prus does not use these devices to move his story. They seem more like window dressing put in place to make the novel look and smell like the work of a realist.Worst of all, Prus' story and characters don't seem to have any relevance beyond the pages of his book and there's no whiff of meaning anywhere. The best example of this odd characteristic is the anti-Semitism in the book. There are lots of cuts (broadly and with subtle acid) at the Jewish characters, however (as another reviewer mentions) Prus never addresses anti-Semitism in even the most vague way. He presents society only and makes no comments or suggestions to the reader. A newspaper article works as better fiction than that!Reading this book was a bit like watching a movie you already know the ending to. It can be entertaining if the ride is interesting. Unfortunately, Prus' narrative is too dry and dispassionate and his plotting too erratic and minimalistic for the ride to pull you in. As a result, I just didn't care what was going on and didn't find any of the characters worthy of my attention. I didn't feel there was any purpose in reading the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Guide To Moab, UT Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"I used this book to navigate around the back trails near Moab (Arches & Canyonlands National Parks).

With this fabulous autobiography I get the best of both worlds as the legendary Roz tells her story. This book remains one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, one to which I return time and time again.Why do I enjoy reading a true life story? I think it's because it's fascinating to learn how a person came from obscurity and became someone influential and beloved by millions of people the world over, to learn about the good times, the struggles and the triumphs.Why do I love Rosalind Russell? Well, that's harder to put into words. But I'll try. I think it's because she was such a versatile actress who was adept at comedy (\\"The Women\\", \\"His Girl Friday\\", \\"This Thing Called Love\\", \\"My Sister Eileen\\", \\"A Woman Of Distinction\\" and \\"Auntie Mame\\"), powerful in drama (\\"Sister Kenny\\", \\"Mourning Becomes Electra\\" and \\"A Majority Of One\\") and expert in musicals (\\"The Girl Rush\\" and \\"Gypsy\\"). How many actresses could do all that? Whatever she did on screen she did as a true professional. But, in real life she was also a tireless worker for charity and a devoted wife and mother. Rosalind Russell was a greatly respected woman among her peers.In telling her story, Miss Russell brings her delightful sense of fun to the fore. From the opening anecdote about winning a prize in a horse riding contest, to the way she got out of her first movie contract when a better offer came her way, to her ploy to get over the title billing in \\"The Women\\", Miss Russell spices her life story with wonderful humour that makes this book irresistible. She also includes some of the more tragic events of her life without remorse or self pity but with the strength of character that saw her battle breast cancer and crippling arthritis. It's all presented here in an endearing portrait of a true Hollywood survivor.What is also fascinating is the foreword by her husband Frederick Brisson. What Miss Russell does not include in the book is presented by her husband, rounding out this multifaceted portrait of a great lady. For example, her breast cancer and mastectomy are not discussed by Miss Russell but by her husband. Miss Russell lived in an era where revealing such a health crisis would have effectively killed her career. But, she lived through this traumatic time and continued to give the powerhouse performances she was famous for. Also recounted are her nervous breakdown, the heartbreak at only having one child and the deaths of those close to her.This is a wonderful book, one that I can not recommend highly enough. Although currently out of print, hopefully it will be back in print where it belongs in the not too distant future. My advice: do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of this fabulous book, even in a used copy. It will certainly provide you with a banquet of wonderful stories from a wonderful actress and woman, Rosalind Russell."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"From the forward written by her husband, Frederick Brisson, the reader is drawn into the dynamic life of Rosalind Russell. This book is full of delightful escapades of her childhood and shows an honest glimpse of a movie star (the best man at her wedding was Cary Grant) and the consummate professional she was. Gifted as an actress, no doubt, but Russell, shows the reader that it's the age old Thomas Edison adage - Genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. Talk about a persistent, creative marketeer of promoting herself, this book is a must-read for anyone needing to be shown a road of how it's done. She once told her only son, Lance, \\"Flops are part of life's menu and I'm never a girl to miss out on any of the courses.\\" And several times flop she does, always pulling herself up from the boot strings and trying again. Also, the glimpse into Hollywood legends lives - Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, even Coco Chanel, are a satisfying bonus to reading this book.Funny, poignant (her sister, whom Roz calls \\"The Duchess\\" and whom she based the character of Auntie Mame, dies early in the book) and thought-provoking, Russell indeed proves that life is a banquet to be feasted on and enjoyed each and every day. A delectable read, you'll come away from this book with a brighter take on life."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"This book is about Rosalind Russell's career. She is funny, and as I stated above, honest. She speaks of rheumatoid arthritis, with which she was afflicted, and her childhood.

This is a wonderful book!!!"},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"As a longtime &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; fan, I was anxious to read &quot;Life is A Banquet&quot;. I'm thrilled to say that Ms. Russell didn't disappoint. She is a gem ~ authentic and honest and a wicked sense of humor. She maintained her ability, despite her success and life in Hollywood, to laugh at herself and those around her. If you can find a copy of this book, grab it and enjoy the ride. She absolutely lived her life as a banquet. May we be so lucky."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"This is funny, poignant, interesting, and delightfully written.

You feel as if you have come to tea with Miss Russell and she is telling you stories."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"I read this biography years ago, but after reading a recent article about Rosalind Russell, decided I just had to have it.

I learned much I hadn't known before about her early life, as well as her co-stars. The book gives hilarious insights into such projects as His Girl Friday (1940), and The Women (1939), her first comedy.Roz, the fast-talking dame, will never disappoint in this three-laughs-a-page book. It's also got some great photographs, of her childhood, early acting career, and behind-the-scenes shots of her films.

I will definitely be buying from Mrs. Wiggins at every opportunity!"},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"Rosalind Russell's autobiography is full of stories about her movies and Broadway career and her friendships with Hollywood stars like Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra. She discusses in detail her breakthrough movie,The Womenand all of her early MGM films. My favorite Russell movies came later in her career and sadly, she devotes only a few quick sentences toPicnic(never mentioning Kim Novak),Auntie Mame(nothing about her costars), andGypsy(not a word about Natalie Wood).Much of the book is a testament to her long marriage to producer Freddie Brisson, who writes a very loving and revealing preface. She was strong and dynamic, a talented and dedicated actress, but her family always came first in her heart. Although she was quite ill at the end, she barely mentions her problems and indeed, spends no time in self-pity. (She was still editing the book at the time of her death.)It was disappointing that she glossed over her later movies, but her strength of character and humor shine through on every page and the book is quite inspiring. Many personal and professional photos are included."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"I could (and have) read this book over and over. Rosalind Russell takes you through her life as a child in Conneticut, her career with MGM, and her marriage to Freddie Brisson. I found each story engrossing, none of it was disinteresting. She tells the story of her life as if she was speaking to you personally. This book is a must read for any Rosalind Russell fan."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"Reviewers don't mention the ghostwriter of this autobiography which is told in the first person, the hilarious and wonderful Chris Chase who also wrote Betty Ford's biography.Anyone familiar with Chase's articles in the NY Times and her book would recognize her voice here.The book is wonderful but while it's honest about Russell's deep religious feelings and patriotism, it skates over her right-wing sympathies (to which she was entitled) and her friendships with Nazi sympathizers.Russell was indeed a multi-talented and fascinating woman who had an amazing life. I liked and admired her--- I enjoyed this book immensely, but I wish she had been challenged more."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"This is not the behind-the-scenes tell-all one would expect from a Hollywood star. Instead it's a tame memoir that covers most of Russell's famous movies in just a couple sentences each. It certainly is told in her blunt \\"voice,\\" but she reveals little about who she is, the people she worked with or the roles she made famous.Diehard fans will love it simply because she wrote it. Published after she died, the book comes across as too reverential. She doesn't talk about any wild love affairs or even many on-set adventures. It's just kind of a boring life story. (Her husband's preface is actually more informative than the entire rest of the book!)There are a few things she likes to talk about, in particular her friendship with Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant. The only chapter written with much enthusiasm is about her 25th wedding anniversary party given by Sinatra in Vegas. But she then talks about how much she and her husband are apart--and how they allow a man who has been in love with her for decades to move into their house while the husband is gone. Few other personal details other than saying she and her husband fought a lot.She also takes a lot of credit for Auntie Mame. It's hard to say if she's being honest about how much input she had into all aspects of the original stage production, but she acts as if she almost single-handedly made a variety of decisions that turned it into a hit.Her lack of movie-making stories is truly disappointing. She should have some really interesting stories of working with famous directors and stars--but she barely even mentions some of her works. My favorite is The Trouble With Angels, which she dismisses as \\"the nun movie\\" and only devotes a couple sentences to it even though she devoted two years of her life to the film and its sequel! The same with Gypsy, His Girl Friday and others--she gives glib, terse observations and then moves on. She either doesn't recall stories or is hiding something. Either way, this book falls far short of her definitive life story."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"There is no doubt that she was talented and beautiful and suffered a lot in her life ( who doesn't). However, the book is very dull and boring. David Niven did a memorable job in his book about the same era, with scandalous snippets and interesting tit-bits. Rosalind places herself above such \\"sins\\", which is how she was. She continually upsets the chronology of the events in her life thereby creating confusion, this could be because she was so unwell since 1960 - and that really upsets the apple cart.Few years back, I watched Picnic on TV ( though not aware who she was), I seem to remember her acting; which was totally uninhibited.However, this book is a loser and doesn't entertain at all. Her cheerfulness and supposed candor becomes forced and contrived.Avoid..."},{"Title":"life is a Banquet","review":"This is one of my favorite books folks. Yes, she dishes up a bit of dirt and gossip about the stars she worked with but, she does it with such class and a healthy dose of sensitive editing. The respect she felt for her co-stars is evident and her life story a pleasure to read. Ms. Russell takes you right along with her through the joy, sorrow, and crazy fun that made up her life. I found this book to be both uplifting and motivating. What a smart,witty,enthusiastic lady! If you don't love her yet, you will after you read this."},{"Title":"Portland Laugher (Thomas Black Mysteries)","review":"This was the first book I read by Earl Emerson. As a Portland resident and a Tacoma native I was able to identify with Emerson as he weaves his plot from Seattle to Portland. Thomas Black is the perfect character for this and the other books in the series. An ex-cop turned private investigator, Black has the feel of a Northwest detective. Living in the U Dub district in Seattle, Black is depicted as a down to earth guy trying to earn a living as a private detective. Emerson draws from his own knowledge of the Northwest as a Seattle firefighter and a Tacoma native in unraveling the plot. Many of the characters he creates are unique and present a great composite of Northwest life styles. A great read and terrific climax."},{"Title":"Portland Laugher (Thomas Black Mysteries)","review":"I bought this book in the Portland airport just before a flight back home. Usually I pick up a book for reading on a flight, and when done leave it for either the airline people or another passenger to pick it up -- but not this one. I was hooked from page one and when finished I kept it and loaned it out to others as a highly suggested read.This was my first Emerson novel; what is interesting is how it shows that he (the author) had developed his ability to paint characters richly as well as handle plots with more dexterity than in his earlier novels, which I sought out to read after this one. I also have read books he's written since this one (except his latest, &quot;Catfish Cafe&quot;), and feel this is his best effort -- both in the Thomas Black series (this book features Thomas Black) and in the Mac Fontana series.If you are an Emerson fan and haven't read this one, by all means read it. If you've not read any Emerson books yet, make this your first one. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Portland Laugher (Thomas Black Mysteries)","review":"In Portland Laugher, Emerson uses his cavalier style of writing to develop a sinister cast of characters caught in a fatal game of cat-and-mouse. But who's chasing whom?More than a cleverly woven story, Portland Laugher intertwines its twisted plot with the bittersweet emotional complexities. On all fronts, this book kept me spellbound until its devastatingly brilliant conclusion."},{"Title":"Portland Laugher (Thomas Black Mysteries)","review":"The \\"Portland Laugher,\\" the seventh installment in the Thomas Black series, is a complex and engrossing book tinged with creepiness. The strangeness begins when a middle-aged, sexually aggressive woman, with a timid young man in tow, visits Thomas to ask him to keep an eye on a newly released criminal who might be planning vengeful acts against a number of people who got him put behind bars. Thomas takes the case even though he harbors doubts about doing so, particularly when he learns that Philip, his fellow suitor for the love of his friend Kathy, is also in the mix, having been present at the incident that sent the criminal, Billy Battle, to jail. Thomas finds many twists and turns in this case. Attempted murders and murders occur. The last quarter of the book contains a lot of dramatic action, and most of it isn't good for Thomas.The creepiness in this book relates to the main plot characters and their dysfunctional lives. These characters have interacted in very bad ways for many years, with Billy Battle allegedly committing heinous acts on animals, a young girl, and his foster brother. The woman who hires Thomas has inappropriate relationships with many men, some of whom are part of the case. The murders that occur all have a hair-raising quality about them. All the plot characters, including Philip, are not quite normal, which helps hide the sociopathic killer until Thomas figures it all out.In this book we don't get into Thomas's mind as much as we do in some of the other books, even as relates to his feelings about Kathy. The only emotion presented is Thomas's dislike of Philip. Throughout the investigation Thomas feels a little dirty about looking into Philip and has to ask himself regularly if he is trying to prove Philip a criminal or if he is truly looking for the truth. Emerson makes Thomas keep his emotions about Kathy in check during this case, even when the two are sparring and the tension is strong between them. On an aside, it is hard for the reader to believe Philip is much competition for Thomas for Kathy's affections, as he is so goofy and very cheap.Emerson does a good job of keeping a handle on the plot, which sometimes seems to be spiraling out of control but never really does. He also uses a great device by interspersing the \\"regular\\" story with sections in which Thomas is coming out of a coma in the hospital. These sections are done particularly well, with hints for the readers and with an intimate feeling of being present as he awakes from the coma.I think this book is really well written. It is perhaps a little too complicated, but I think overall it is perhaps the best book in this series that I have read to date."},{"Title":"Fumblerules","review":"Safire definitely knows what he's talking about-and he isn't afraid to tell it to your face, either. I love the cocky attitude of this handbook, and I doubt I'll ever have as much fun learning about grammar and rules again-unless I read another of his books! I've read this book twice-and plan to read it again soon-and it reads like a joke book. It's laugh out loud funny, and his humor is right up my alley (avoid clich&eacute;s like the plague).At the beginning of the book, he bluntly tells you to \`do as I say, not as I do' which it would behoove you to take notice of, as every chapter title is in itself a grammatical error. (And behoove seems to be his favorite word) For example, the chapter on double negatives is called: Don't use no double negatives. From run-on sentences to using negative statements, this book has it all.With colorful phrases like, \`blond enough to make a bishop kick a hole through a stained glass window' and painfully demonstrative examples, this book is for anyone looking for an educational laugh. Safire's point is always clear, straight and to the point, making this one of my favorite books. Don't hesitate, and buy it now!

What a treat! Dennis Frye is the authority on Harper's Ferry ( who's fault? Miles, McClellan, or Franklin?) Robert Krick must have been a rebel because it seems as if he was right in their midst, and standing next to R. E. Lee at that, as they crossed the Potomac. As for A. Wilson Greene, he knows and has studied McClellan with the best of historians. George Brinton McClellan could have ended the war on several occasions but instead prolonged it and then patted himself on the back. And finally, Gary Gallagher shows us &quot;a season of opportunity...in perspective&quot; splendidly."},{"Title":"Antietam: Essays on the 1862 Maryland Campaign","review":"As Civil War histories go, this one falls on the upper end of the middle of the pack.

Caddo has run an ad from an heiress. The authorities suspect some sort of fraud and are investigating. But since the advertisers are anonymous, Caddo wants Perry Mason to verify this item. Caddo explains the market for this publication, and how it works (Chapter 1). Perry explains how his letters will try for a response from than anonymous heiress. Perry wonders if that ad is part of a scheme (Chapter 2). One letter draws a reply, and Perry will have detectives who can spot and follow &#34;MM&#34; (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 Perry and Della visit Union Depot to watch the meeting. The next morning Perry reports the facts to Caddo. Later that day Perry gets a report from the young detective who met &#34;MM&#34;; was there a trick? An errand brings Perry and Della back to Union Depot, and they see familiar faces (Chapter 6). Later Marilyn Marlow visits Perry to ask for help with the problem about a will. She explains the purpose of her ad (Chapter 7).In Chapter 8 Perry gets a visit from Mrs. Dolores Caddo, who is upset by her husband's involvement with &#34;MM&#34;; she's not so dumb even if she is a big blonde. Perry tries to calm her and fails, so he calls Marilyn Marlow to warn her. After this Bob Caddo shows up. [This is one funny scene!] Marilyn Marlow calls with terrible news: Rose Keeling has been murdered! Rose's prior testimony will stand. Perry and Della arrive, question Marilyn, and Perry decides to take a chance with his client (Chapter 9). Lt. Tragg arrives, and holds Perry and Della for a while [another funny scene]. When they are released they try to visit the other witness, Ethel Furlong. But Perry is fooled by appearances (Chapter 11). In Chapter 12 Perry meets the Endicott family: Ralph, Palmer, and Lorraine. [The new ballpoint pen is mentioned here.] The Endicotts will benefit if George Endicott's will is broken. Ralph had seen Rose Keeling a few hours before her murder. Next Marilyn Marlow is intensively questioned and she blurts out some facts to Sergeant Holcomb. Next Lt. Tragg takes her to his office. It is an example of a police interrogation using \`bad cop, good cop' (Chapter 13). Perry sums up the known facts in Chapter 14.When Perry visits Mr. & Mrs. Caddo he learns that Dolores Caddo met Rose Keeling after 11 am. But Mr. & Mrs. Caddo deny everything to Lt. Tragg. Did they outsmart Perry (Chapter 15)? No one seems to have a motive for Rose Keeling's murder except Perry's client (Chapter 16). Perry and Della return to take another look at Rose Keeling's apartment. Della tells the difference between packing and unpacking. But they get a big surprise when they leave (Chapter 17). The Preliminary Hearing starts in Chapter 18. A bloody knife was found hidden in Marilyn's car, wiped clean of any fingerprints. On their return Perry and Della see Robert Caddo with the Endicott brothers (Chapter 19). The cross-examination of Lt. Tragg involves the difference between packing and unpacking clothes (Chapter 20). Perry sends Paul Drake to get more information. An important and new fact arises from the use of the then new and rare ballpoint pen (Chapter 21). The case against Marilyn Marlow is dismissed, and Perry explains the solution (Chapter 22). &#34;Once you get the correct solution all of the evidence fits into place.&#34; [You need to multiply the dollar amounts by 20 to adjust for today's values.]"},{"Title":"The Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses","review":"Shortly after Ludwig penned this book in 1995, I can remember the infuriated computer press churning out condemning reviews.

The first section discusses viral reproduction techniques, ranging from the simplest overwriting virus to complex multi-partite viruses and viruses for advanced operating systems.

The language is explained as an isolated phenomenon without reference to existing scripting tools (VBA, VBScrit, Rexx, etc.). The main use of Perl in Win32 environment is CGI progammining and here the book does not have enough value for beginners. Generally this book looks like an attempt to adapt the original Randal Schwartz book to the Win32 environment (second edition for UNIX also is not the best introductory book available, but at least it was one of the first books on Perl). The adaptation attempt failed and the results are pretty disappointing. Neither the examples, nor style are very suitable to Win32. For example &quot;Standard Perl distribution&quot; (page 6) contains recommendations like: nmake ( Build all of Perl) nmake Test (test your distribution) nmake install (Install to the target dir. In the Makefile) These recommendations can be considered a joke for Win32 beginners, who get used to prepackaged software. Chapters are very uneven in length and quality. The Chapter 1 is disappointing. The secret word guesser introduced in the Chapter 1 is definitely far from the best introductory example for Win32 audience. The number of unexplained concepts introduced here would scare novices. Probably more simple examples of a couple of UNIX-style filters (head, tail, and maybe unique) would be more appropriate. Chapter 2 is OK. Chapter 3 does not provide a clear description of Perl syntactical and semantical achievements and pitfalls. For example, Perl considers a negative subscript on the array as a count back from the end. So each element has two indexes (from the beginning and from the end). The last element has an index -1 that is very convenient. BTW Perl use the same approach in the substr built-in function. Chapter 4 seems to be written by &quot;structured programming diehards&quot; and is very weak. Rich Perl control structures are not covered. Neither continue, next, break operator (they really simplify construction of non-trivial loops), nor the short-circuit semantics of || &amp;&amp; operators in if statements (not apparent for people who never programmed in C) was not discussed. Chapter 5 (hashes) is only 4 pages long for such an important subject as associative arrays. Strangely enough it does not mention the %ENV - probably the most important associative array for novices. Chapter 6 (Basic I/O) is very short. Perl after all was designed to process logs and such a chapter definitely should be more than four pages long and should contain more examples. Chapter 7 fails to recognize the different mentality of Win32 users. Basically there are two approaches to the regular expressions in Win32 environment. One is to use it only when necessary and the second is to use them whenever possible. The first camp (partially represented by former REXX users and VB users) prefer more procedural way of text manipulations and tend to rely more on substr, index, length, split and join functions in text manipulations, while the second is the regular expression addicts. The authors definitely belong to the second camp ;-). IMHO non-greedy (minimal) matching is often more convenient that a regular one, especially for novices, but it was never mentioned in the book. Chapter 15 is probably one of the few things that were done right in the book. The index and substr built-in functions are covered adequately. I would like to mention that the authors cover a very important use of the substr in the left part of the assignment function (the idea borrowed from the PL/1). Chapter 16 is just OK. Chapter 17 is a joke as DBM is the Unix-only beast. Only the last page (&quot;Win32 Database interfaces&quot;) can be considered relevant for Win32 users. It's really depressing to see such a blunder in an O'Reilly book. Chapter about CGI is somewhat superficial. At the same time it is the main application area for Perl, especially in Win32 environment. The only subject covered in this book that was not covered in the &quot;Cross Platform Perl&quot; is the coverage of OLE2 (Chapter 19). It uses a rather interesting example of MAPI. Win32 is not UNIX. Strangely enough for such a book the discussion of pitfalls of Win32 environment is completely absent. For example the authors fail to stress the difference between chop and chomp function. Even the most annoying difference between UNIX-style and Win32 style directory paths syntax (with &quot;\\\\&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot;) was never mentioned. I believe O'Reilly should do better reviewing and editing job if it want to preserve its reputation of publisher of consistently well written and edited books. - Nikolai Bezroukov BASF Corp.

I could pretty much give this book a rating anywhere between 1 and 5 stars and justify it. That being said, I have learned a lot of perl through reading the book &amp; doing the excellent exercises that are provided (with answers), therefore it deserves a decent rating despite its faults.The book is an overview of the language, not a reference. It's a tutorial that takes you through the major language features. Some of the chapters are regular expressions, filehandles, formats, hashes, functions, etc. The writing is generally clear and accessible and the examples are very well done. Most people should feel comfortable using perl after working through this book.The real failing of the book is that it is pitched as a Win32 book but it is full of UNIX-centric examples and idioms. The chapter on DBM is likely to go unused by almost every Windows programmer and there is not much coverage of OLE automation/COM/ActiveX, which is key to Windows. The book would also have benefitted from a look at Windows system administration tasks and how to automate these with perl.Another minor frustration is the &quot;Topics We Didn't Mention&quot; appendix. This book is only 220 pages + appendices, index, forewords and there could easily have been room for discussing those topics (like basic networking, security, the compiler).In short, it's a good book to learn perl with if you're stuck using NT at work like me. That being said, the book is rough around the edges and could be polished significantly in a future edition."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"I concur with the bulk of the reviews here: This is a shallow book, especially given Perl's scope. But it WILL help Windows folks understand many of the key Perl concepts that otherwise go unmentioned.And that's the major point here. The book may be a trivial intro to Perl, but at least it doesn't assume you're a *NIX weenie. After getting annoyed reading the 3rd edition of the camel book, I bought this book. It was helpful in clearing up all those references to the weird stuff that *NIX dudes apparently are born knowning, and got me quickly into writing simple Perl scripts.You want heavy details of the Win32 or NT-specific functions? Go read the POD embedded in those modules. Or get a different book.This is &quot;LEARNING Perl on Win32 Systems&quot;... I read it in about 6 hours, total, cover to cover.

It provides an entertaining and thorough stroll through the language. There are a lot of little differences between this book and the other 'Learning Perl'.

Combined with the reference work 'Programming Perl', you will have everything you need to become proficient at the language. Highly recommended for both amateur and professional programmers."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"I've had this book for 2 years, and have definitely gained from the purchase.

I found the very first chapters to be of good service, though I spotted these elementary Perl programming techniques in other O'Reilly books too. The Win32 part is in my opinion very poor, it doesn't explain things very well like OLE, reading/writing the Event log and other rudimentary system administration tasks. If you have a lot of free time on your hands like I sometimes tend to have, take some time to search for example scripts for Win32, and together with this book you will be able to understand. Though I think a new edition would be a good idea, covering specifically Win32 platform (people should buy other books to learn Perl in general, I do not like to see the same 3 chapters in every book over again)."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"This book doesn't have enough in depth coverage of PERL. For a programmer, this book is too simple, for a non-programmer, this book is too hard."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"I found that this book was good, particularly for the Win32 platform, and recommend it to anyone who uses Windows, regardless of their initial interest in programming. The only problems I had with the book are that the CGI (and OOP, which is introduced only in the context of CGI...but it could be so much more) chapter is left in limbo as far as being able to use any of the examples. If it were used on a Unix webserver (which are almost always setup to handle Perl CGI scripts), the examples would work fine. However, this is Perl for Win32, so IIS or PWS (if possible...I don't think it is, however) should be the web platforms targetted, and a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; setup instruction would be good to be able to test those examples."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"This book provided a reasonable introduction to the language elements. As a complete novice, I learned enough to read CGI scripts. It was helpful to work on the well-done examples and then to look at the answers. I would have preferred a \\"log cracking\\" example rather than &quot;secret words\\". Although I got the syntax of the hashes, I missed their glory in solving problems. The regular expression examples were good, but I could have used a full-blown example here also. This book sent me searching for CGI/web packages, such as the database package DBI (which may have been more useful than the DBM), the graphics package (GD), and more on writing HTML code from Perl scripts."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"It is a very useful book that covers many useful aspects. It does so quickly, without that filler that many books like to have to make themselves thicker. If you've never done programming or scripting, you might get lost in the first chapter (for example, there are nested conditional loops on page 14). Luckily, the later chapters go on to explain all of this.You get some real juice, too: file/directory manipulation, handling processes, registry editing, database connectivity. It definitely gets your feet wet with what you can do with Perl."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"I agree that Chapter 1 was a bit challenging, but after working my way through it, the familiarity of seeing some of these things as I work through the rest of the book is actually very helpful. If you are coming from a zero-programming-skills background, you should probably look at the book before you buy it, but if you understand any type of programming logic, this book should provide a great beginner path to learning Perl."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"This is the toughest book in this category. This is not well organised and it lacks examples. The given examples are not up to the mark. I request the author to give more examples and tips to do the programming efficiently and effectively.

The style is conversant and nice to read, which makes it a very good introduction to Perl if you happen to work on NT.

The two Learning Perl books (Unix and Win32) are easy to read and understand and great for a person first learning Perl. The Perl Cookbook is incredibly useful for someone trying to figure out how to do some of the more advanced things. I wish there were books like this for Java. This book, although it says win32, can be applied to Unix. At least about 95% of it is transferrable to Unix. Perl is an interpreted language, therefore it is Platform independent except when you make system specific calls to the OS."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"This is a great place to start learning Perl. As a first exposure to THE standard text-processing language of the web, this is as good as you will find.I think some of the reviewers who rated the book lower were probably discouraged with the learning curve of the language more than the quality of the material.Save money and buy the Perl CD Bookshelf (also O'Reilly), which includes Learning Perl on Win32."},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"This book is a good introduction to the PERL language.

PERL is not, NOT, for non-programmers, despite the plethora of '21 days', 'for &lt;whatever&gt;' etc books.That said, of the PERL books, this 'gecko' (as well as the 'llama') book offers the most well-organized, best-written, and best-edited (the programs actually run) introduction to the language.Plus, there is a web site that specifically supports this book!"},{"Title":"Learning Perl on Win32 Systems","review":"One of the best reasons to use Perl in a Windows NT environment is to write large, complicated batch programs.

If Peabody were nobody, his elegant little book - which fits nicely between \\"Our flying time today will be...\\" and \\"Please return your tray tables and seats to the locked and upright position\\" - would be a commodity. The good news is that Peabody really is somebody, at least in the world of entrepreneurial start-ups. He's founded six truly successful start-ups. During the Internet's wild, wild West days, he sold Tripod, one of his start-ups, to Lycos for $58 million worth of Lycos stock. Peabody also has luck in spades. The Lycos deal forbade him to sell his stock for two years, during which time its value increased tenfold. After the two years were up, he unloaded it...and the Internet stock bubble burst just a few months later. Ka-ching! Unlike 99.9% of successful entrepreneurs, however, Peabody attributes most of his success to having smart associates. We appreciate Peabody's trim approach, not to mention his track record. This book is strongly recommended to every entrepreneur. Get smart, so you can get lucky."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"This is a very small book relative to other business books, but it does make quite an impact.

Peabody brings the start-up world to life with humor, humility and some incredibly sage advice for a young guy. I only wish (for my pocketbook) that I had read it a lot sooner!

If you are fond of business books, you probably already have heard about almost every idea mentioned in the book already, but there is more to it. It's the emphasis on passion and having philosophically positive ideas for betterment of the world, yes seriously. Also I enjoyed how Bo phrased importance of ignorance and also knowing that you don't know. A combination of these two is a killer!An skeptic might say that the writing is very distributed; Its not themed to follow a certain pattern and can easily be named as disparate thoughts of a one time successful (or lucky) entrepreneur. I agree, it might not be the best book out there but its definitely one of the very good ones. Something I noted; there is a pun in the book towards \\"Good to Great\\", one of the best books in its genre backed up by years of research. You can always disagree with the ideas and BO gave a good justification for what he does, but there isn't just any match for statistical data which backs it up.

He doesn't get caught up in ego and personal accomplishment like some of the big names in the business community.

He also says that entrepreneurs are born and not made, that's very bad advice.Not all of us realize that we want to be entrepreneurs until later on, and neither did he but he admits in the book that he graduated with average grades and companies don't want to hire people with simply average grades, so he started up Tripod.Obviously he did plan to become an entrepreneur, it was either that or work for minimum wage somewhere. After his decision to become an entrepreneur, he obviously was smart enough to figure out what he needed to do and who he needed to talk to. He makes it seem as if everything fell on his lap; don't believe his hype.I think this is bad advice because there are people who want to better themselves, they may not be ready to become entrepreneurs but later on they might be, and by telling people that entrepreneurs are born and not made then he discourages those people who might be entrepreneurs.A lot of the advice in this book is just bs, he also tries to put down A students, saying that they won't succeed much in business. That they will only be managers. That's funny because a lot of smart people end up wealthy, especially straight A students. Of course you do have certain smart people who don't know how to get along with people, and if you're one of them then you need to change. It's a good thing that I checked it out from the library first."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"The Skinny: A short book of advice about succeeding as an entrepreneur.Pro's: Concise and authentic views about entrepreneurship.

The author mines his real-world experiences growing a number of different companies to offer insights that I think are applicable even outside the world of entrepreneurship, and I suspect that his conclusions might even be understated: it's not only budding entrepreneurs who could benefit from a more grounded, philosophically-positive outlook of the type Peabody suggests. Fluidly and wittily written, a great read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"I read Lucky or Smart after receiving a recommendation from a very creditable source. However, it was a great disappointment, and in my opinion, a waste of money. $13.95 (as per the inside cover of the book) for 58 pages that delivered little value.Bo Peabody may himself be both lucky and smart for founding and selling a low revenue-no profit generating internet company during the internet bubble; I hope you are lucky enough to read this review and then smart enough to avoid purchasing his book. My brief summary of the lessons from the book follows:Chapter 1: Start a company that is innovative, morally compelling and philosophically positive; this will attract smart, motivated people that will do great things because they are smart and motivated (Enron aside)Chapter 2: you are born an entrepreneur or a manager - accept who you are because you cannot changeChapter 3: entrepreneurs are B students, managers are A students - unfortunately I was a B student in high school and an A student in college, something the author does not addressChapter 4: strive to be good enough to survive; if you do you will be bought by a company that can make you great; but don't be great on your own or you will not surviveChapter 5: have faithChapter 6: don't take no for an answerChapter 7: entrepreneurs don't have power - \\"get used to it\\"Chapter 8: stay calm and be gracious in difficult situationsChapter 9: read the WSJ daily, the NY times on Sunday and pick one other reputable weekly or monthly business magazine - and don't read any other form of pressChapter 10: always sellChapter 11: know what you don't knowafter reading the above there is no reason for you to purchase the book unless you want to know more about Bo Peabody or the companies he founded. That is all there is, except for a number of tangentially related stories that involve Bo and his limited experiences in the business world (I say this because he was in his early thirties when this book was written).Instead of reading Lucky or Smart I would highly recommend the Richest Man in Babylon or Rich Dad Poor Dad."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"I enjoy reading stories about entrepreneurs and the (sometimes) crazy stuff they do. Bo Peabody is a crazy and, might I add, highly entertaining, entrepreneur. Bo made wads of cash selling his internet company Tripod at the height of the bubble. He was in his mid 20s.\\"Lucky or Smart\\" is a small book, in length no greater than a weekend NY Times magazine article. The tone is positive, irreverant, and homely. There is some classic diatribe. For example, in talking about the corrosive effects of Blackberry's on the concentration span of executives nowadays, he recommends that smart entrepreneurs send them to competitors to rob them of their power of thought (p45). Sad but very likely true.Bo sees the business world as made up of A-students and B-students, the former being primarily managers, the latter entrepreneurs. Each plays a very important role in a new venture. There is a symbiotic relationship between the two, with the B-students pushing the envelope, selling, and ignoring accepted wisdom in search of new frontiers, while the A-students refine and focus based on the view in the rear-view mirror.There isn't a lot in the way of inspiration or guidance but Bo shows us that you can be lucky or you can be smart, and a truly smart person realizes when she's getting lucky and capitalizes on it.If you enjoyed \\"Dot Con\\" by John Cassidy, \\"Dot Bomb\\" by J.

I'm so surprised others gave it four stars. The author just got lucky with his timing and he inflated the valuation of his company by posing as a slacker CEO while in reality he was working 100 hour work weeks.Then he was smart because he cashed out instead of going IPO because in his own words, he knew that the company was \\"all hat, no cattle\\". Then he took his money invested it in other companies that he \\"started\\" through his venture capital company. He actually doesn't talk about any of those operations so one wonders if he considers investing the same as starting a company.Personally I wasn't looking for someone's luck story. I wanted \\"secrets to an entrepreneurial life\\" as the cover claims and what I really wanted was information that I could implement in the next company I start. This didn't teach me any. It was like reading an article in some bad paper, like USA Today, just longer.If you want an autobiography of a random lucky guy, this is the book for you. If you want to make your business more successful without lying to the press or being someone you aren't, read Adrian Slywotzky. He can tell you some real entrepreneurial secrets that you can apply to your business."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"This small book from the founder of Tripod is worth the hour it will take you to read it. Peabody was a \`B' student and suggests that successful entrepreneurs are almost always \`B' students: good at lots of things, experts at none. To compensate, \`B' student entrepreneurs need to hire \`A' student managers (and coders and VPs), who are excellent a one or two things, to successfully take a startup to maturity. This revelation is not rocket science, and not an entirely new concept either, but it is very interesting to hear how this strategy played out for Peabody and Tripod.Even though he made millions, Peabody does not boast or make the silly claim--like many Internet millionaires--to have known all along that he was destined for greatness. In fact he is quite humble: he readily admits he was making a lot of his business strategy up as he went along, and that with Tripod, it could have just as easily gone the other way and ended in failure.The three salient lessons from this very short memoir of an entrepreneur: work very hard, hire the right people, and be smart enough to know when you are getting lucky."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"I picked up this book on the recommendation a client. Mr. Peabody tells good stories and lays out some straightforward facts. In many ways, it's a nifty little autobiography with some useful nuggets of information.The advice he gives is mainly for Type-A personality entrepreneurs; Risk-taking, project-starting individuals whose main focus is getting product out the door so their effort can be called a success.For anyone who does not fit that mold, this book is not necessarily speaking to you. However, even if its not directed at you, you'll still gain some insight into why people like Peabody behave and think the way they do.What I liked most:-- Always sell. As the person at the top of the organization, always sell.-- Recognize which role is naturally in you: Entrepreneur, or Manager, and then excel in that role.-- Know what you don't know. Don't try to buffalo your way through things. To me this is part of being intellectually honest.What could have been better:-- I do agree that striving for \\"good\\" will be what gets a company off the ground, but that's the end of the road for the entrepreneur on that project anyway. After the entrepreneur moves on to other challenges, the company he leaves behind needs to press forward and strive to be great. That part needed more value ascribed to it.-- Peabody talks a lot about selling at the entrepreneurial level, but never touches on the mechanics of developing a strategy for it. It may be instinctive to him, but it would have been nice to have him explain a more functional approach.I liked the book. Quick read. Some good nuggets. Just not enough of them in the right places.I suppose Peabody followed his own advice: He wrote a good book, not a great one."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"This is one of the best business books I've ever read. It conveys highly insightful, meaningful ideas in a remarkably concise and common-sense way. No droaning on with complex business models or contrived new management theories.

The ideas it contains are motivating, entertaining and invaluable. I've purchased several copies for colleagues. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lucky or Smart?: Secrets to an Entrepreneurial Life","review":"I have to say, Bo is shockingly refreshing. This is a phenomonal book and a short read to boot.

The book is also one of the most readable business books to come out in a long time; it is a pleasure to read. It also happens to be one of the shortest and least expensive, so it won't tax one's schedule or wallet.

It is hard to disagree with this assessment, since this tome is really that good and the research which went into it is nothing short of painstaking. George Ostrogorsky introduces his narrative with a thorough overview of the development of Byzantine studies from the sixteenth century onwards, followed by the history of the Empire proper by sections, each of which covers a specific historical period. In addition, each section is prefaced by an excellent bibliographical narrative of Byzantine sources which cover the period in question; these narratives put together provide the reader with a very instructive literary history of Byzantium. Ostrogorsky has a penchant for detail in both the text and the extensive footnotes accompanying it. But let the reader beware: this book is essentially a dry political and military history with some legal, theological, and economic history thrown in for good measure; even the literary history mentioned above limits itself to documents of historiographical value. The author did compensate for the lack of written coverage of the arts and architecture by including nice illustrations of Byzantine structures and artwork. Even as this revised edition was published almost 30 years ago, &quot;History of the Byzantine State&quot; remains a much-revered classic among Byzantinists."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"George Ostrogorsky's book covers all Byzantine history from Diocletian and Constantine to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is, moreover, intelligible and useful to the nonspecialist with only a broad historical background. Its particular value is that it imparts an understanding of the *process* of Byzantine history, especially in three key periods. First, the transformation of the decrepit East Roman Empire to a viable state able to withstand great adversities and heavy defeats. Second, the reinvigoration of that state after the iconoclast crisis and its rise to great power. Finally, the unintentionally suicidal policies adopted after the death of Basil II, which led to the breaking of Byzantium's back only fifty years later. Ostrogorsky's copious footnotes - happily, not endnotes - are especially useful because they cite many arguments and authors with which Ostrogorsky himself disagrees. Thus he provides easy access to views other than his own. There are a few minor irritants in the softcover edition, the absence of most of Ostrogorsky's excellent maps being the main one. There is also some little use of untranslated and untransliterated Greek. But neither deficiency adversely affects the book's overall value."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorsky has put together a good single-volume survey of the thousand years of Byzantium. The tale begins, standardly, with Diocletian and Constantine, and ends with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. He takes an omniscient view of Byzantium, focusing neither on the lives and deeds of the Emperors nor the cultural and religious developments, but telling a well-balanced narrative. In that it serves as a useful introduction. However, Ostrogorsky writes without any passion, and fails to humanize the major figures. There are, though, several excellent maps that put others to shame. In all, the book is worth owning for the factual narrative and great maps. If you are looking for an impassioned and entertaining story you should pick up John Julius Norwich instead."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"This book is a well presented overview of the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it suffers from the same problems as most other political history books, it fails to take into account important non-political developments. For instance, the Plague of Justinian is not mentioned. One would thing that a sixty percent mortality rate in Constantinople would earn at least a passing glance. However, the author/publishers are not responsible for the woeful inadquecies of political history. The problem with the book lies in the bizarre lack of maps. (I have the Rutgers University Press, Fourth Paperback Printing, 1995.) There are only two maps (p. 289 and 521). They are both of the Balkans. There is not a single map of Anatolia in the entire book. Why would anyone publish a book in English for a western audience on the Byzantine Empire and not include a single map of Anatolia?"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Ostrogorski's History of the Byzantine State does a great job describing the relationship between the state, the civil and military aristoracy and small holders.He starts this theme during the early tenth century and carries it forward to the end of the book. It is a story of how the state becomes less and less able to defend itself against the aristocracy.While other writers speak of Ostrogorski's lack of passion about Byzantium's last centuries, this is also an advantage because it allows him to focus on political and military causes of the Empire's decline after 1025.A few years ago I read Vassliev's two volume book on Byzantium and enjoyed it very much. In particular, those looking for a lengthy discussions of culture would do better with Vassilev.But it was only after reading Ostrogoski that I got a clear understanding of the political change after the death of Basil II (and the role of Psellus in them), the wars against Michael VIII after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 and fourteenth century civil wars.In addition, this is a very well written book. In particular, Ostrogoski does a great job of starting his paragraphs with short, pithy topic sentences. He is also very good at drawing broad comparisons across Byzantine history (Vassilev, by contrast, tends to get caught up in details).In sum, while I am glad I read Vassilev first, Ostrogoski's book has given me a much stronger sense of the outlines of Byznatine history."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"\\"Roman political concepts, Greek culture, and the Christian faith were the main elements which determined Byzantine development. Without all three the Byzantine way of life would have been inconceivable. It was the integration of Hellenistic culture and the Christian religion within the Roman imperial framework that gave rise to that historical phenomenon which we know as the Byzantine Empire.\\" Thus begins the first paragraph of George Ostrogorsky's masterful narrative of Byzantine history. As this quotation demonstrates, Ostrogorsky's writing is a model of erudition, clarity, and efficiency. It would be hard to improve the quality of his prose, and he maintains this level of scholarship throughout the 500+ pages of main text. But the writing has a natural fluidity which carries the reader along rather effortlessly throughout the full span of East Roman/Byzantine history, from 284 A.D. (rise of Emperor Diocletian) to 1453 A.D. (fall of Constantinople to the Turks). Ostrogorsky gives this inherently rich and fascinating material the virtuoso treatment it deserves, and the reader is rewarded on every page by Ostrogorsky's efforts.Of course, readers of this English translation from the original German of the 3rd edition (1963) of Ostrogorsky's \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" owe an immense debt to Professor Joan M. Hussey, whose rendering of the German into English is a masterpiece in its own right. Moreover, through the collaboration of Professors Ostrogorsky and Hussey, the truly extensive references and footnotes have been brought up to date from the 1940 German 1st ed. to the 1967 time-frame of Hussey's 2nd English edition presented here. Of course, in the intervening 40+ years a veritable explosion in the fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies has taken place, but Ostrogorky's mastery of the original sources, and the German, French, Italian, English, and Slavic secondary literature will not soon be replicated.\\"History of the Byzantine State\\" is a delight to read, and is divided into 8 main chapters. These chapters are respectively subdivided into numbered sections, and both chapters and sections are clearly titled, so that the breadth of Byzantine History is clear through a glance at the Table of Contents.Other reviewers have complained that Ostrogorsky's writing is dry and lacks a \\"human touch.\\" I found the opposite to be the case: \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" has a cogency and beauty of style, and is a model of articulate scholarship. And with such rich material as the myriad colorful historical human figures and locales which populate Byzantine history, it would be difficult to render this history in a boring fashion. Ostrogorsky's emphasis is the political narrative, but he does not ignore social and cultural aspects of Byzantium, and upon finishing his book the reader has a sense of a complete picture of Byzantine history and civilization. In the paperback version now standard the maps are incomplete, but this is easily remedied by consulting an historical atlas or the Internet."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine State","review":"Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth.

There are too many names, places, parties, and so on. But it is what I wanted: a sweep through the political history of the Byzantine Empire.

The not so good part is that it assumes knowledge about many peoples that contribute to the story.When I read \\"The Histories\\" by Herodus I had a terrible time getting through the part on the Scythians. That is because I had know idea who they were. I went to the Net and found a reference to them that was just a few paragraphs, that they were Indo-European, that they may have invented horseback riding, that their decendents still lived in the Cacus mountians. After that I was interested in them and had not trouble reading the material.I say this to point out the biggest drawback of this book. There is no mention of the ethnographic or linguistic relationships between the various groups. Today it is important that Serbs and Russians are enthnically close. This books doesn't give a hint of these kinds of relationships. That makes it more difficult to remember the information.However, it is still a valuable book to help understand the events that made the world the way that it is.

It is not written well, but rather in the style of your mom telling one of her vacation stories. The parts of the book that could have lended drama; hurricanes and drug dealing, were approached with little interest for the reader. The drug dealing almost brushed off and w-a-y too much info on the hurricane.The Blanchard's come off as some sort of godsends to the people of Anguilla, and the verbatim conversations with their son by phone are excruciating: \\"say hi, let me know about your classes, ok, sleep well....\\" zzzzzz...snore....By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less if their precious restaurant and wine cellar survived the hurricane, I was numbed by the images of Melinda playing board games with her friends while her husband flew into the eye of a storm.Worst of all, this book did not conjure up any images of island life or make it seem desirable. I couldn't smell the sea air or taste the food.I was repeatedly confronted with 2 self-absorbed white people rounding up everyone on the island to become their new \\"family\\", and the pace of the book is nearly real-time, if this is 10 years and 2 restaurants condensed to \\"capture of spirit of life on Anguilla\\", I'm glad I'm not friends with these people and expected to endure their boring cocktail stories at some fabulous party they'd throw for themselves!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I read this book and while I thought it was interesting during the first few chapters, it quickly turns into a self indulgent tale of \\"look how much money we spent and all that we went through to live in Paradise\\".Are these people for real? Seems to me that the book was written to recoup their initial start-up expenses. Been to their little restaurant in Paradise and the food is about as good as the book. In fact, I gave them one star for their food and book combined."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"No visit to the Caribbean is complete without a dinner with Melinda and Robert Blanchard on Anguilla. The book tells a wonderful story about two people whose vision is one that everyone who experiences it is changed in some wonderful ways. My introduction was the HP Goldfield wedding which is highlighted in the book. The stories remind all of us just how Melinda did do the impossible. And, yes, the Berlins and the Fullers did show up at the wedding in a 50 ft sail boat....but, read the book to learn more. Thanks, Melinda and Robert!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This is a well-written and interesting story about a Vermont couple throwing caution to the trade winds, selling their business and opening a restaurant on the remote Caribbean island, Anguilla. They chose the island for its beauty and its pace and because they had fond memories of past vacations there. The Blanchards soon learned, of course, that operating a restaurant in a place where everything-building materials, equipment, food-must be imported (with a 25 percent duty on top of it), was no vacation. Everything but the staff had to be imported from either neighboring St. Martin or Puerto Rico or Miami.Written in first person in the voice of Melinda Blanchard, she describes charming island characters and does a good job with \\"island patois.\\" She gives a worthwhile account of the efforts to build (and then rebuild after a category 4 hurricane destroys their establishment) and run this exclusive restaurant-the choice of Hollywoods stars and VIPs. She even peppers the pages with recipes. The pace slows down to island time in the middle with perhaps too much detail about boat building and racing and local carnival celebrations, but overall it was a good read and very inspirational. Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Blanchard."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"The Blanchards' book transported me back to this unique island in the Carribeean that I happen to have grown to love over the years. For an &quot;arm chair&quot; traveler this is a first class ticket. First, the description of the culture, people and scenic charm of the island is true and told with with humor and irony.What a surprise to find it...really thinks it beats Frances Meyer and Tuscany at that game. They did a great job making salad dressing...which I always bought...and I am sure they don't need to be modest about their struggle to establish a &quot;world class&quot; resturant as well as assimilate into this very tight community that is a former British colony. Whenever we are on Anquilla it is the people that top the list, next come the best beaches in the world. A great read with a recipe or two that aren't too complicated to try. Great for that rainy afternoon this summer."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Having lived in the Caribbean for almost five years and having recently visited Anguilla, I found the Blanchard's tale to hit extremely close to home.

I appreciated the Blanchards sensitivity towards all the people they met in Anguilla and how they made the tiny island their home. I've read many books about the Caribbean and enjoyed this the best.It was easy to associate myself with the book and Anquilla after spending a memorable day there myself. As a frequent visitor to St. Martin, I would one day like to return and have dinner at Blanchards. I encouraged my wife to read &quot;A Trip to the Beach&quot; and hope she'll feel the same way I did after reading it.As I read, all I kept telling my wife was, &quot;I don't want this book to end&quot;. She interrupted me several times to look at the great recipes. I think the book describes the tranquility and unhurried life on Anguilla very well. It makes me want to return. I only wish, that someday, we will be able to spend time connecting with the people as they did, rather then doing the tourist thing. I am looking forward to an update. I think &quot;Tales from the Beach&quot; should be their next book title."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This is a book I picked up several years ago after traveling to St Barts. Reading along with the restaurant adventures of Bob and Melinda Blanchard gave form to our idea of doing the same one day!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Excellent book for someone hoping to move to the islands as well! Great insight and perspective on island life and the prospect of starting a business there."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"My husband and I traveled to Anguilla in early 1997 and have since had no desire to go anywhere else in the Caribbean. We went back in 1999 and are planning another trip in April. Since it is a fairly unknown island (or used to be) I was very surprised when I heard this book being read on NPR and immediately bought it.This is a great read if you have ever been to Anguilla...it brings the beaches, the people and the atmosphere right back.It is a great read if you want to go to Anguilla...it gives you an accurate and fun portrayel of life on the island.This is a great read if you ever wanted to cash it all in and run away to the islands or live whatever other dream you have but never though you could live.Finally, it is a great read just for fun. The anecdotes and stories are great, ranging from funny to dramatic, and the colorful characters make you laugh out loud.The recipes they include make your mouth water and add an extra bonus to the book. I can't wait to get back to their great restaurant and maybe even try some of those recipes on my own! I am sure you will enjoy the book as we did."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"My wife and I are going back to Anguilla for our 3rd time in 5 years! We have fallen in love with the island, the people, the laid back culture, and of coure, the Blanchard's and their restaurant! It is truly a magnificent restaurant, on a magnificent beach, on the most amazing island in the Caribbean! We consider no other place in the world when planning our Spring getaway! Although I am breaking my vow to keep Anguilla a secret from the rest of the world, if you do go, do me a favor, and keep it to yourself!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This is a marvelous book! I have been to St. Thomas and St. John, so I know all about their beauty but now I MUST take a trip to Anguilla to visit that magical island and to eat at BLANCHARDS!!!!Through this wonderfully written tome, I have fallen in love with this beautiful place and immediately upon finishing the book searched for the email address for Blanchard's, printed off their latest menus (!) and emailed the Anguilla Tourist Board so that I can begin researching my trip!This accounting of Mel and Bob's dream and how they achieved it is superb - you feel as though you go through each step with them; the agonizing ritual of ordering and receiving ANYTHING for the house or the restaurant; the warm, wonderful, colorful people of Anguilla who took Mel, Bob and Jesse into their hearts and their lives; the sheer hard work they put into the creation of this wonderful restaurant; the horrific hurricane that basically wiped out 2 years work - and more is in this hard to put down book.As a confirmed foodie myself, I feel as though I tested all of those recipes with Mel and WISH for the day that I can taste her creations myself - in person!The only thing that could have possibly made this book any better would have been to have color photos of the creation of this restaurant! That is the only downside to the book at all - you don't want it to end!Next step - get myself to Anguilla and have meals (lots) at Blanchard's!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Whether you're an island lover or a wanna-be traveler, the Blanchards' book is so authentic that you'll feel as if you've been there. Much like my own trip to Anguilla, the book was over much too soon, and I wished there was more! It was the best read I've had since &quot;Don't Stop the Carnival&quot;."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Having arrived in Anguilla just a day after the formal launch of the book, there was excitement and conversation generated by &quot;a book written by the Blanchards&quot;. This excitement among locals was palpable and piqued my interest. The converations included the book launch party at Blanchard's and the book itself but the special fun seemed centered on recognizing the &quot;characters&quot; mentioned in the book. My curiousity about the book was further enhanced by a wonderful dinner at Blanchard's and it felt right and opportune that I should purchase a copy of the book right there. Copies were prominently, conveniently and enticingly displayed at the bar. Not surprisingly, it held my interest from cover to cover. Best of all, as I turned the pages, I could feel, smell, hear and see Anguilla and loved that it extended another Anguillian sojourn well beyond my too-short stay on the island."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Having arrived in Anguilla just a day after the formal launch of the book, there was excitement and conversation generated by &quot;a book written by the Blanchards&quot;.

I have never been to these islands but through Melinda's words, I felt as though I was right there with them . . . meeting all of their new friends and employees, sharing their joys and sorrows, experiencing their challenges and achievements. I can't wait to read the new Blanchard's Table. Melanie Blanchard definitely knows how to write an extremely enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"The bitter reviews are totally undeserved and off-base. I felt like I was reading about some other book.The Blanchards, who were probably the worst business people in the western world decide to open a little beach bar restaurant on the island of Anguilla. Things change when they find the perfect place, but the rent is thousands per month--way too much to build a beach bar. It has to be a fancy restaurant. Did it occur to them to negotiate or look for a cheaper place? They didn't say it did. So, they start designing and planning. They soon learn that most everything has to be imported from elsewhere. Melinda flies home to Vermont to pack everything and put the house on the market and then to Florida to buy EVERYTHING they'll need to build and furnish the restaurant. Bob is back in Anguilla supervising the construction. This is all Very Expensive. Just the customs duty on everything was staggering. Luckily, they had sold their former business which provided them with the dollars they needed--although, they came perilously close to running out of money.The Blanchards respect and care for the people of Anguilla is obvious. The people of Anguilla seem to have accepted the Blanchards as citizens and friends. In fact, they still have most of the staff they originally hired when they started the restaurant.I especially enjoyed the sailboat race story. Bob was asked to help build and crew a boat for some locals. He was thrilled to be asked. When he asked about how they were going to get a sail the group told him they hoped he would pay for it. \\"How much\\"? he asks. They tell him $2,400 and he says, \\"OK\\"!The Blanchards worry about their son in college in Washington state, but there are no long winded boring phone conversations with him as someone else reported.This book is not at all a \\"cure for insomnia\\" in fact, I found the opposite to be true. I stayed up too late reading it.While I'm not sure I would like the Blanchards if I knew them and I'm a little disappointed that their newest venture means they can't spend much time on the island they wanted to spend the rest of their lives on--I still loved the book."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Refreshing! Take a break from all the Provence and Tuscany stories! Well written, very witty and great recipes included. One of the few books about foreigners moving to the Caribbean.I am packing my bags, next vacation is in Anguilla! With Dinner at Blanchard's restaurant!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Reading this book was like taking a trip to Anguilla in my mind, each sitting bringing lovely images of the sun, beach, food, local life. On the same level as Under the Tuscan Sun or the Provence books (complete with recipes scattered throughout), this book is a great account of the experiences of a foreigner adapting to a new culture/setting. Those who have travelled to the Caribbean will surely laugh out loud at some of the more typical experiences (both good and bad) that the Blanchards have in moving to and opening their restaurant. Ultimately, the story is a love letter to the island of Anguilla and its residents. I hope to travel there soon and dine at Blanchard's too!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I loved the book so much, I read it slowly so it would last longer. I wish that I had the capital the Blanchards had in order to do what they did. This book will really appeal to those who love to cook or are involved in the restaurant business. I bought it because I love the Caribbean and it satified me."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Hipkat and ActionJunkie have summed it all up perfectly. Nothing else to add. Oh. Yes there is. I happened to be in a bookstore way back when this book was released and the Blanchardss were speaking. I pretty quickly observed they were quite charmed with themselves. I didn't stay to listen long. The book was passed to me by a co-worker. Couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"If you have ever been cornered by an innkeeper or B & B owner whose life contains five minutes of interesting tidbits, but who takes two hours dragging you through a poorly synthesized tale, you've already had the experience of reading this book. To make matters worse, the quality of writing and tone are comparable to a sixth grade essay along the lines of \\"What I Did on My Summer Vacation.\\"If you are looking for an interesting book about life as an American in the Caribbean, try Herman Wouk's semi-fictional \\"Don't Stop the Carnival.\\""},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I am 14 years old and this is the best book i have ever read. I absolutely love it! It's an easy read but is very entertaining and it documents Bob and Melinda's fascinating life. I highly recomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I couldn't agree more with the above reviewer. Although the writing style and flow of the book was appealing, the attitude and lack of humility by the authors made it, at times, almost uncomfortable to read. For example, at one point they describe a hurricane that has hit the island and damaged their restaurant and say \\"...you saved the wine cellar, brillant? Is the wine still in there?\\" Paahleeeze! The very next sentence tells his employee to go home and clean up his damaged home but to be back 'first thing tomorrow morning with your tools and brothers to clean up his mess'. Anymore stories of what their personal strife (enormous shipping fees/taxes and the inconvenience of traveling back and forth from their \\"Vermont\\" home to pick up expensive materials) would have been pathetic. If you want to understand and appreciate the island life, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"A Trip to the Beach is a fantastic book that you can't put down. Usually I want a book to end, but not this one - I was sad to finish it. I was awed by their ability to open the restaurant with all the trials and tribulations they had to overcome. I highly recommend this book - the food descriptions were fabulous. I am awaiting their new cookbook and can't wait to try the recipes."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Talk about carpe diem... that's what the Blanchards did: They uprooted themselves from cozy Vermont and settled their new home in their own form of paradise. Their courage is admirable and exciting to read about. The Blanchards are people I'd love to hang out with on a Carribean island. It's definitely a great book to read in the winter months to keep you warm!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"There was a lot of fluff writing in this book. The idea of the book is very solid and, at the same time, whimsical. They have an awesome life story to tell, but the writing itself doesn't do the story justice."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"having moved to the Abaco islands in the Bahamas only 7 months ago, after spending 28 years in England, and the last year working for a US investment bank in the heart of London, this book really made me think how similar Anguilla was to the northern Bahamas. The way the locals talked in their broken English, the no-rush mentality, the awesome beaches and scenery, the power outages, the expense of imported goods etc made me feel like I'd written the book myself - I could identify with so many issues the Blanchard's come across.To &quot;outsiders&quot; this book seems like a fairy tale, and unless you visit for longer than a touristy week or two, you'll probably never experience this tranquil side of life as the Blanchards did. I'm going to write my own book of the Bahamas right now..."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I thought this was a very good book. The Blanchard's risked alot moving to Anguilla but everything in the end turned out fine. I do agree with one of the other reviews that they were better off then most and could afford the high prices they had to pay for relocation and the building of their restaurant. But, I think this was a very good read and I was able to feel like I was on vacation while reading this book."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I dearly loved this book. The Blanchards have done a beautiful job of telling their story in such an endearingly human, yet captivating way. Their descriptions of the people and places they encountered drew me into each chapter of their adventure. I didn't want the book to end!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"The Blanchards did a wonderful job relating their experiences (both the good and the not-so-good) as new residents/business owners in Anguilla. Though I have never been to this particular island, I was captivated by their story and the delightful descriptions of the land and people. I had a hard time putting it down and was sad when it ended. I actually found myself entertaining thoughts of picking up and moving to the Caribbean! A great read all around."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This book was well written and gave a fantastic depiction of life in the caribbean. I am a beach lover and enjoyed this book immensely while vacationing in the carribbean. I purchased this book as a &quot;beach book&quot; and was not disappointed. I have recommended this book to numerous family members and friends. Even if you are not able to travel this book will definitely be a great &quot;Trip to the Beach&quot;."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I am a small business owner (although my business has nothing at all to do with restaurants or food) and I enjoyed the adventurism of the Blanchards' escape to the Caribbean. It is at once inspiring and humbling to read their tale of hard work and rewards. Of course, they encounter their share of challenges along the way, but the way they describe them as well as their recovery makes the book a worthwhile read. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Though the book is well written and easy to read it is somewhat disturbing to hear yet another story of affluent white people taking advantage of the economic disparity between the first and second world.These people move to the Caribean without so much as business plan or any idea of where they will buy their supplies. It all works out for them mostly because they can afford to put $250,000 into the venture. How many Anquillians could be much more successful if they had that kind of advantage?Also disturbing is the attitude of the Blanchards towards their new neighbors whom they view as quaint and colorful.These people view Anquilla as a paradise for them and other rich white people and have very little concern for the actual inhabitants of the island - beyond the few locals they patronizingly adopt in order to make themselves feel more connected and therefore more special than regular tourists.When an issue is brought up it is always examined from the point of view of tourists. \\"How will ______ effect someone who is trying to enjoy a good novel while relaxing on the beach?\\"If you insist on reading this book please balance out the distorted view by also reading Jamaica Kincaid's \\"A Small Place\\"."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"An easy reader that is lots of fun both for the story and relationships as well as the food and some recipes (few, but interesting). It is a great book to read during the gloomy winter weather!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Thank goodness that, in addition to Free-Range Chicken Breast with Wild Mushrooms, Melinda and Bob Blanchard can turn out a great story too. No two dimensional, &quot;my struggle to success&quot; fluff piece, A Trip to the Beach is a rich, spicy broth blending the Blanchard's determined efforts to establish a culinary toe-hold in beautiful Anguilla (British West Indies) with the beautiful, determined Anguillans who helped them make it happen. Anguilla is no &quot;Disney World&quot; stage set of all-u-can-eat buffets, blender drinks, and canned calypso. Rather it is a fiercely independent, sophisticated island culture struggling hard against pressures of the fast-buck, big money outside world to preserve and protect its astoundingly beautiful physical and cultural assets. The idiosyncracies of the culture are the attraction for the Blanchards to Anguilla and, at the same time, the source of the sometimes excruciating obstacles to executing their modest plan to open a pleasant resaurant with a good wine cellar in a place they love. With an intimate, forthright voice, Melinda Blanchard takes the reader through a highly personal journey from their Northeastern roots to the realization of their dream - feeling like a &quot;belonger&quot; in their beloved Anguilla. A Trip to the Beach will appeal to both beginner as well as the seasoned Anguilla &quot;expert&quot;. I have enjoyed 6 visits to the island (and to their divine resaurant) and the Blanchard's richly portrayed characters, and colorfully detailed experiences took me that much deeper into a people I already love. Enrich someone's life by giving them this book. Or better yet, give it to your spouse or significant other (as my wife did) as bait for a longed-for trip to this special place. Or just buy it for yourself, put your feet up and lose yourself for a while in a story with a lot of heart, a lot of humor, and some really yummy recipes. You'll feel like a &quot;belonger&quot; too!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Along the &quot;Provence&quot; and &quot;Tuscany&quot; genre of books, this anecdotal book takes the reader through a year of dealing with natural and human challenges as the Blanchards try running a restaurant on the upscale island of Anguilla. Having been a visitor to the island many times, I suppose I was somewhat inclined to be predisposed to enjoy the book, but then again I could also have been more critical. It's a pretty quick read, full of local characters, and makes you realize what kinds of things you're up against when you try and do something like this. You'll want to make plane reservations to see the island for yourself when you've finished reading it. It's light reading, perfect for a cold winter day as it transports you to an island paradise that is so idyllic in the midst of today's hectic urban world."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"My husband and I have been lucky visitors to the gorgeous island of Anguilla and we have eaten at Blanchard's. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food was wonderful. After reading the book and visiting Anguilla 3 times in the past year, it was interesting to meet the people in the book. Anguilla is a very close knit island of approximately 9000 people. When I read the book and talked to the &quot;belongers&quot; in Anguilla they told me a different story about the Blanchards. The book leads the reader to believe that the Blanchards were walking on these gorgeous beaches and just decided to start a restaurant. The truth is that the Blanchards owned a restaurant called Mangos on the island and sold it!! They made a lot of money and then came back to open Blanchards. Shabby Davis is a wonderful Anguillan who was kind enough to do several things for the Blanchards. In fact, the whole Davis family is remarkably kind and sweet. Many of the people in the book were never asked first if they opposed their names being used in the book. Unfortunately, this was not good PR for the Blanchards. They should have been honest about what really happened on the island and understood the cultural and language differences between Americans and Anguillans. I was disheartened after I found out several things about what really occurred during the Blanchards opening and running their 2 restaurants in Anguilla. Anguilla is a terrific island with wonderful people. We need to be considerate of them and not spoil their island. I found that I was viewing the Blanchards in a totally different way.... as true capitalists!!! They seem to be only out for money and themselves."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"a must read for anyone who has been or will go to anguilla, the island where they have there restaurant. an enchanting and warm tale about a husband and wife who move to paradise to live out their dream. it is full of great recipes from the restaurant, but also just a great story!!!!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Although the authours of the book are listed as Melinda and Bob Blanchard, it appears the entire piece is written by Melinda, speaking for her husband as applicable (although I'm sure he approved). I read this book after having read Solomon Time by Will Randall, and I probably should have read them the other way around because while the Blanchard's book is all about creating their own successful business on an island paradise (kudos to them), Solomon Time is about a man who travels to the Solomon Islands to help the islanders start their own business and become self sufficient. The whole tone of the latter seems a bit more noble and more palatable. Mr Randall does not evoke any sense of 'me' and is not on the island to meet his own personal ends. It's much more selfless. Depending on who you are, you may prefer his book. Because in the Blanchard's, there is a persistant air of, well, American-ness (you may like that, or you may not). It's also interesting to note that, as informative and telling as the book is with regard to opening a restaurant on a tiny island (as well as a genuinely warm account and in-depth profile of the islanders - by far the best part of the book), there is constant reference by Melinda to rather silly trivialities, eg reports on everything she's eaten every day (which is usually some form of meat) and apparently growing increasingly fatter, or as the locals say, &quot;coming nice&quot;, and it just reads a touch like a spoiled, wealthy and shielded housewife who doesn't want the real version of the island but who craves the five star hotel existence (she runs back into the car during a business negotiation because some little bugs are biting her ankles). You also get the faint impression that everything they do, every action they take, every involvement and favour to the islanders is rooted in the end goal of making their business a success rather than a genuine interest in helping out for helping's sake. It is also a touch ironic that Melinda considers herself a 'belonger' to Anguilla and to bemoan the loss of innocence on the island, and when she speaks in local talk (eg bad english), sorry, but I couldn't help but feel a bit queasy. What was also a bit unnerving was not once, but twice a reference by Melinda to making a business out of the local elections (eg selling campaign buttons and other unnecessary junk to the islanders). Makes you wonder when Bob will run for office. Money makes money, no matter where you are or what you do. And when you have a quarter million plus at your disposal, is it that surprising to make a success of anything? Just, erm, food for thought.bwhiskey"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Here we have an older couple that decides to move to their favorite vacation spot, Anguilla, located near St Martin in the Caribbean. Melinda and Bob Blanchard decide to open a restaurant on the island in what is supposed to be spur of the moment decisions. After a takeover in their last business (selling salad dressings nationwide), they are avoiding partnerships with others and must deal with the island etiquette of renting land, dealing with the meticulousness of claims at duties, and finding a place to live. We get a look into living on the island through the eyes of Melinda Blanchard, self styled chef and owner of the restaurant and meet a variety of characters in the employees that quickly assemble to form the Blanchard's staff. Throw in some recipes, a boat race, and Hurricane Luis which destroys the restaurant the first year and you get a nice quaint little travelogue that will be a quick and interesting read.Still, after reading the book and enjoying it, there is something about it that makes the whole venture seem much less 'spur of the moment' and less of a hardship than it seems to be promoted as. Here we have a wealthy couple that constantly travels, runs whimsical businesses, and is willing to drop $300,000 into building a restaurant on a 16 mile long island that caters largely to tourism and is subject to possible hurricanes every year. The business is almost an afterthought to Melinda who appears to want to live in Anguilla just to stroll the beaches and read books. None-the-less, the book is a wonderful break into island life and should you find yourself on Anguilla, you will want to stop at Blanchard's to meet the crew and enjoy what sounds like delicious dinners.One last thing, keep in mind, the authors aren't telling you the whole story of their experiences, past and present, which would affect your view on their \\"dream come true\\" story of this restaurant."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Reading this book, you are taken to the world of Anguilla, a small Carribean island where it is so beautiful that they don't need a weatherman. The Blanchards started up a restaurant bearing their name years ago on this island heaven and it became one of the highlights of the Western Antillies. In this book, you are taken through their journey, their lives together, of building a restauarnt of a fine reputation.I MUST ADVISE: The book is cannot be fully appreciated unless one actually travels to Anguilla to experience the happy and peaceful mood of the entire island and to actually meet the Blanchards to see how lovely people they are.It can be seen that at the beginning of the novel, it is pointed out that although, yes, the Blanchards had already started a restaurant, Mangoes, before their current one, it would not be discussed for the means of telling the story. Also, just because Melinda and Robert's name both appear on the cover, and just one is the narrator, it does not mean that they both didn't write the book together, sharing their experiences and building the structure for the book.This trip to the beach will be one you never forget...."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I could hardly put this book down and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The writing is good but not, by any means, poetic or inspiring. The story is not compellingly constructed. In fact, it is pretty simple: an American couple, having sold their business in Vermont, thinks it might be great to open some sort of small beachside restaurant on Anguillia in the Caribbean. They take the plunge, Complications follow. Bigger complications (a hurricane) follow early success.The seductive allaure of &quot;chucking it all&quot;, going where it is always warm and almost always beautiful, of leaving behind the urgencies of the States and living closer to the beauty of nature, is something that, I would guess, many people have considered and a few have tried. Just what is it that people, in particular the Blanchards of this tale, are trying to leave behind? What do they expect to find? Are they fleeing unhappiness or chasing a higher level of satisfaction in life?This is not the story of two people fleeing the too closeness of relatives, of getting burned out on work or turned off by commercialism or violence in our culture. It is, simply, the story of a dream of owning a restaurant in the Caribbean paradise and trying to make it work.The dream quickly gets out of hand. They find a location, but the monthly rent will be far too high and the cost of bringing the property up to useability will be far too much. So, the dream changes and they change with it. No beach front home, just an apartment overlooking a gas station. No tiny eatery on the beach, they decide they have to do a big time, classy restaurant to have any hope of paying the rent or recovering building costs.Why is this simple tale so engrossing? Well, if you love the Caribbean, or any southern lattitude, you'll likely enjoy this story. If you have traveled south, so much the better. It is an adventure told by two people who know how to combine hard work, skill and total dedication to making their dreams realtiy. Horay for the Blanchards!We get a real taste of island culture and see it through the eyes of people who appreciate, and love, what they have found. As stated, it is a simple story, simply told. The lack of affectation or higher goals in the writing, however, is part of the charm. It is a quick, fun read which I recommend to anyone interested in knowing more about the Caribbean and the joys and sorrows of starting a restaurant, or any business, in the islands.There are only two things that seriously bothered me about the book. First, the primary writer and voice of the narrator, Melina Blanchard, gives all of the island characters a kind of old fashion black dialect. The locals come off sounding like they just stepped out of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. While I don't doubt that the islanders do not speak like Vermont Yankees, I have major reservations about whether they all sound the way southern blacks were thought to sound by whites 50 or 60 years ago. I really wonder how the islanders react to this verbal protrayal. Many people in the Caribbean, of all races, speak with a lovely, improved version of a British accent, one that sounds rather nicer than that of many northern visitors.Secondly, the most dramatic part of the story, Hurricane Luis, is given rather short shrift at the end of the book. It was husband Bob who got caught in it and, since he is obviously not the primary author of this work, we don't learn nearly as much about the whole experience as in the earlier phases of the adventure. We also are not given, even in the just released paperback version, an update on where matters stand with the restaurant and the lives of the Blanchards and their Caribbean dream. Too bad. I guess we will all have to go to the restuarant and ask them. Hope they've got a moment or two then to fill us in.p.s. The Blachards should have added: &quot;Don't try this at home. kids&quot;. Very few people could have pulled this off. They had money in the bank and experience from starting eight other businesses before they went south. Plus, they were willing to work and work and work some more. If you want to sit on the beach and contemplate the meaning of life, don't ever consider opening a restaurant or hotel in the Caribbean or, probably, anywhere else."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Mel and Bob Blanchard have done what I feel many wish they could...just leave it all behind for that dream of a house overlooking the unbelievable Caribbean water. Their baptism into the island lifestyle will have you giggling and crying at some point during your read because they are sharing some very amazing experiences as they follow their dream (with more than a few potholes along the way). I loved this book and really want others to realize the charm of the Caribbean, beyond the beautiful beaches and in her lovely, warm, wonderful people! Having experienced this firsthand in my life, I was so thrilled to read a book that really conveyed that message. It will captivate you! I only now must figure out when I can make MY trip to Anguilla that I have wanted to do for several years. I know the trip will have been worth the wait!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Nearly all reviews of the Blanchard's book &quot;A Trip To The Beach&quot; fall all over themselves with compliments. Well, it WAS a good book, but let me introduce some sense of persepective here.First, the audio version reminded me, yet again, that authors should never be allowed to read their own work. Although it was charming to hear Melinda Blanchard's nice voice, it was equally annoying that she ripped through the text without ever altering her tone, even from one paragraph to the next. A professional reader would have made the experience much more enjoyable.Second, it was disturbing to discover (from other sources) that Melinda and Bob actually owned another restaurant on Angulla before opening Blanchard's! They hint at this by referring to their book as a compilation of events over a ten year span - and they even said they owned a restaurant in the past (no location) but not mentioning &quot;Mangos&quot; (their previous Anquillan restaurant) seems unnessarily devious and has the reader wondering what can be believed.Third, wouldn't you have thought that, after ten years on an island paradise frequented by the rich and famous, that the Blanchards would have better stories and anecdotes to tell? They had some good ones, to be sure, but one suspects that if you went out drinking with the Blanchards you'd hear some much better stories.And, finally, so many of the stories ran on and on and on. There was a long, rather boring boat building/racing sequence, the hurricane that wouldn't end, etc. The Blanchard's would have been better advised to fill that space with more stories like the Sandra Bullock dinner party or even the tourists who ran out their entire water supply washing sand off their feet.BUT...with that said...I do recommend this book. The Blanchard's are surprisingly good writers and you will easily fall for them and their Anguilla. Like the other reviewers, I would love to visit Blanchard's and envy those who have. And I would even read another book by this enterprising couple should they ever choose to write one. They just need to get someone else to narrate the audio version :-)CJ"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I read this book recently and I enjoyed it so much. It's amazing to read how starting a business in the caribbean can be a challenge but also a real joy. This book talks about how \\"living on island time\\" really means things don't get done when they should. There are many enjoyable chapters in this book that really makes it an easy read worth reading."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"What a wonderful trip, (and without leaving my living room!) The audio really makes a difference here. It just transports you from familiar surroundings to a tropical, (almost) paradise. You take this journey with the Blanchards and cheer their success as you would your own. Funny, suspenseful and completely entertaining. Highly recommended. One of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Another book that makes me want to pack or sell everything I own and move to an island in the tropics. This book brings a unique view into the transition from living in America to living on an island. Some funny stories too!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I've read this book twice since it came out and enjoyed it greatly both times. The Blanchards come across as nice, hardworking, down-to-earth people who treat their employees well (and the employees are very loyal to them, working for them for years). The book is well-written, easy and very entertaining, especially for people who have fantasized about escaping their lives and running away to the islands. If you ever get a chance to go to Anguilla, do yourself a big favor and eat at their new restaurant, Blanchard's Beach Shack. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I found this book to be one the most inspiring while entertaining novels I read since a teenager.

This book is about a couple who decided to sell their home in Vermont and open a restaurant on a tropical island.Overall, the book was great. Their main goal, however, seemed to be to tell stories about the life of the locals. I appreciated the stories but I wanted to hear more of the logistics of starting a restaurant in a foreign country.For instance, the wife is the cook for the restaurant and the book hardly addresses how she knows what foods to choose, how to decide portions etc. She says that she studied some cookbooks but there has to be something more than that. I suspect the couple owned restaurants before this one but that is never specifically addressed one way or another.Second, they talk about having to watch how they spend their money but they don't seem to act that way. Meals are all eaten out, the wife talks about shopping at Williams Sonoma and Crate & Barrel. They shipped all of their belonging from Vermont to the island. The items required by the restaurant (glassware, dishes, appliances) were bought in Miami and shipped over. The Blanchards paid $26,000 in duties alone. It's obvious that they came into this with money. I'd love to know how much and a few more details about how much the whole operation required to get started.Overall, it is a fun book and I enjoyed reading it. If anything, I just want to learn more about the whole experience."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Ok, so while I was pleasantly surprised by how this turned out to be sort of a foodie/travel book, it still wasn't the best account out there. It had many strengths to it, but in all, just wasn't as interesting as it could have been.Melinda and Robert Blanchard, after selling their business at far below what they should have, decided they want to live on the island of Anguilla. Not as well known to the tourists, but still with a thriving tourist economy, they decide they will open a restaurant on the beach and make their living that way. The only problem is that things are very very expensive in Anguilla and bringing things in from the outside even more expensive. And running a restaurant is tough enough when you can get everything easily. The easy peaceful life they were looking for quickly evolves into something a little more fast paced and difficult.I found Melinda a somewhat ok narrator. She focuses on the hardships more than the pleasures of island living and even insults her husband by calling him an optimist like its a bad thing. I guess I just didn't like the negativity. Her husband seems like he'd be the more enjoyable narrator but he doesn't really write this book despite his name being on the cover. She does describe the island people fairly, but I would have liked to hear a lot more about them.Most of this book, as opposed to being about the island and the people, was more about the running of a restaurant. And while I enjoy books about food immensely, that wasn't what I expected going into this novel. Although I was happy that she included several recipes for different foods. But the food they did cook wasn't really island food per say. It was more fancy stuff as they opened a fancy restaurant. I guess thats what happens when you're in a tourist area though. To be honest, the food places they visited sounded more appealing to me than their restaurant.An ok travel book with food elements thrown in. Not my favorite of the travel books I've read but not the worst either.A Trip to the BeachCopyright 2000296 pagesReview by M.

It's well-written and moving and you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I too agree, they may have worked hard at the restaurant but there is no mention of owning other restaurants before, \\"Blanchards\\".Melinda Blanchard has the reader believe that she is a complete novice in the restaurant business and reads cook books and magazines to help her cooking, I also believe they now have \\"self help\\" books out there, all fine and dandy but the money they had to start has all to do with the opening of a restaurant.I too followed my dream and moved to a tiny Island, (which I will not mention as this island is truly paradise and we like to keep it this way) the only way I could \\"follow my dream\\" was by working very hard at my business and being lucky enough that my business can support me.Island life is very laid back but can also be very expensive, living on an Island requires hard work or hard cash or both!What I did like about the book was overshadowed by the references on the large amounts of cash they spent and the true details they chose to omit.If I were a writing a book about \\"my Island\\" I would certainly change the characters names to protect their identity, I would probably change the Island's name to protect It but then I am not the owner of a restaurant!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Overall well written with a very good description of island life.

I found myself reading much slower as I neared the end of the book because I didn't want it to end! The Blanchards detail the good and the bad and the inconvenient things that go along with living on an island in the middle of the ocean, but never in a boring way.

We needless to say I accidently stumbled across this gem of a book. I started reading it before we left, and I could not put it down... After arriving in Anguilla I finished the book and convinced my wife to read it. Anyways, if you have ever been to Anguilla or are planning a trip there, this book is a must read. When we went to Blanchards on Christmas I already felt like I knew the entire staff. And after tasting their food I could not wait to get back to the states to try the tuna receipe."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"If you have had the good fortune to visit Anguilla this is 'must reading'--you'll want to savor every word, every moment--but alas you'll spoil the pleasure by reading this in a day.

Having been in the restaurant business, my husband and I could certainly appreciate the problems they encountered. It sure changed our mind about the same dream they had. Now, I just want to go relax on a boat - off the coast of Anguilla of course. When we went to their restaurant on several occasions, the food was fabulous. Anguilla is certainly our favorite island after visiting many others. Melinda's description of the island and the people were right on the money.

What a good book!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I just finished reading A trip to the Beach. It was awesome but I coulda done without their constant references to having lots of money. I mean they spent thousands on the supplies to build a beach restaurant that's not all that big. And they built it mostly themselves or so they say. (I have my doubts here...) And when a hurricane destroys it all a year later they go back to Anquilla (rhymes with Vanilla) to rebuild it all. No mention of insurance or where the money came from. Whatever. It's a beautiful dream, but something got lost in the translation of this true story. I think humbleness got lost. But it was like taking a little trip to somewhere new and I never left my own Jacuzzi bathtub. And that's a [inexpensive] trip!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I do love travelogues. This one is especially wonderful. Most get off on one tangent or another and really exploit that, but this book captures a dream a lot of us have which is to move and live on an exotic island.

If you are looking for good beach reading on vacation this year, I highly reccomend it. Very good to escape to that perfect island in your mind."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I have never travelled to Anguilla. Now that I have read Melinda and Robert's book about their adventure of starting up Blanchard's Restaurant there, I feel at home there already! I enjoyed the people we met personally who helped them in their venture. It is always wonderful to &quot;meet&quot; people who give up all of their world's possessions to start over again to make a dream come true. This book gives the reader the courage to do just that.As you read, you feel the highs and lows of their attempts to do just that: establish a new family home and business in a beautiful part of the world: The Caribbean. They chose the tiny Island of Anguilla and in a very short time became family to all who lived there. Youll will laugh alot at the antics of their &quot;highly qualified staff&quot;. I especially loved the inclusion of recipes they conjured up to suit the natural foods that they found on the Island. When you read this book, I think you, too, will want to travel there and taste the flavour of life overlooking the turquoise bays. What is your dream? Will you have the courage to make it come true?

Before you know it, you're submerged within it's pages, neglecting the clock, surpassing any predestinated points that you promised yourself to stop at. Bob and Melinda's \\"A Trip to the Beach\\" has justly enthralled many readers of prudent taste since first being published in 2000. For an absorbing and mesmeric account of two native Vermonters who inaugurated a simple but distant dream, born on a vacation to the Caribbean. On a whim, they move to a foreign country, and start a restaurant on the tiny, remote island of Anguilla. Entering a world of excitement, frustration, joy, and perseverance to live an anything but ordinary life. This seemingly envious lifestyle proves to be a gigantic undertaking in spite of all it's seductiveness. The romanticized notion of escaping the stresses of a mundanely uneventful New England way of life, only to become a castaway in a distant oasis of a subtropical sunny paradise is simple to swallow but nothing is as easy as it seems. The Blanchards, you will soon discover, can nearly vouch for Murphy's law. Coupled with their persistence and immortal ambition sets the stage for a charming true story and notably enjoyable read.Stemming from this innocent yet simple vision of opening a small lunch stand on the beach, an ebullient dream quickly turns into an venturesomely enterprise of a posh dinning restaurant serving everyone from wealthy vacationers to renown movie stars. A logistical nightmare, the Blanchards are forced to balance building a ritzy eatery from scarce island materials, importing supplies, while establishing a whole new life in a completely different foreign culture far from the plentiful civilization we've grown accustomed to. Many things we might take for granted prove to be a troublesome liability- even freshwater must be delivered to them on the island. Unlike a Hollywood film or a glamorized Nora Roberts novel, the story of Bob and Melinda \`s audacious and adventure filled life in Anguilla is real. A reader will be charmed by the local characters, smell the freshly grilled lobsters, and hear the sounds of the benign calypso music without ever leaving home. It soon becomes easy to transport yourself to their situation, asking yourself, what would I do?Overall, an authentically inspirational tale of willpower, surmountability, and fortitude in a bold stride towards a deviating but enchanting new life. Some have mistaken the Blanchard's drive and intrepidity as egotism. If your literary appetite hungers for some disgruntled hippies' tale of soul-searching while living a primitive lifestyle in an exotic location, then look elsewhere. If the Blanchards for any instance took the reality of chasing their dreams during such a pivotal time in their lives lightly, they most likely wouldn't have a book to fill let alone embracement of such luscious success. The only melancholic fervor encountered is ending the book itself. If only it were longer!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Most of us that have Carribean dreams get by listening to Jimmy Buffett. Some read the fiction about trying to make the dream happen - Wouk's \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" is probably the most famous attempt. Every once in a while, someone really does it. That's what the Blanchards chronicle in A Trip to the Beach.Truth is stranger than fiction, as their trials and tribulations of learning to live in another country, start a restaurant and build a new life are interesting entertainment. They offer the opportunity to live a life vicariously through them.The end is predictable in a sense - you come away saying, \\"Looks like a great life, but a little to hard to try for myself...\\""},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This book was such a treat!

Throughout the chapters the reader becomes very familiar with the cast of characters who help Bob and Mel Blanchard move to and open up a restaurant on the laid-back island of Anguilla. The book carries you through what life is like on &quot;island time&quot; and the challenge of trying to be organized on an unorganized Caribbean island. You get to know the Blanchard's and their staff at the restaurant on a personal level. The trials and tribulations of everything from clearing customs with a bed to trying to find fresh poultry above grade D in Anguilla will keep you smiling throughout the book. Highly recommended as good summer reading."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"As a Caribbean traveler, I couldn't put this one down! The Blanchard's have managed to transport you to Anguilla, and give hope to everyone that's ever dreamed of buying a place in the tropics! Reading about familiar places always makes a story more interesting and this one adds the ups and downs of my fellow New Englanders as they try to fulfill their dream. I also enjoyed getting to know the many friends and employees they describe in such a way it makes you want to hop a plane and meet them too. I was disappointed when the story ended..I could have read on and on. It really took me back to &quot;island time&quot; which is the best part of visiting the Caribbean! Great reading!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This book is a journal of the first year in the lives of a couple who decide to cash in their chips, sell their house in Vermont, and start a restaurant in Anguilla. Although they've had some experience in the food service industry before, having started a reasonably successful company that makes bottled sauces, they had no idea about the challenges that might face them when trying to run a business in a foreign country and culture.Their first task upon arrival in Anguilla was to find a suitable location for their restaurant. They soon discovered that the way to find a property in Anguilla is not through a real estate office, but through connections and backroom deals, sealed with a handshake. As they moved on to the renovations and supply stage of their business, they were shocked to find out that they couldn't just run down to the local Home Depot to get construction materials. Slowly, they became aware that things are done differently in Anguilla, and one reason why prices for tourists are so high is that most everything must be shipped in from Miami and pass customs at great expense.It's very fortunate for them that Melinda is a great cook and Robert is handy and knowledgeable in so many areas, and most important of all, that they have a healthy relationship based on trust and wanting to keep each other happy. Many people would never have the courage to even attempt what the Blanchards have done- -they would sit down first, make some calculations on the back of a napkin, check with the local business people to find out about tax laws and suppliers, and give up before they ever got started, realizing that the venture would be hopeless. But the Blanchards aren't planners, they don't agonize over what disasters the future may bring, and as a result, with fortune smiling upon them, their little business venture seems to fit in fine in Anguilla."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Caribbean vacationers who have ever wondered what it would be like to sell everything and operate a business on their favorite island retreat will find satisfaction in this easy going account of a Vermont couple who move to Anguilla. Anguilla is a sixteen mile long thirty-five square mile patch of land at the northern end of the gentle crescent of islands in the eastern Caribbean nestled close to the flashier and better known St. Martin. Here on this quiet island the Blanchards arrive with their life savings and a dream to open a restaurant. Their story is about the embrace of the gentler life rhythms of this special island paradise. For the Blanchards the secret of \\"island time\\" is a life of breathing deeper and walking slower. Along the way we meet the locals against a background of palms, bougainvilleas, frigate birds, blue skies, and sandy beaches. We follow the Blanchards during the holidays, a local election, a demanding wedding celebration, summer boat races, an employee's dismissal, a break-in, etc. Occasionally we are treated to a recipe, for example, banana bread or better yet, \\"banana cabana\\"! The gentle trade winds that are the text of this impressionistic account build to a natural climax - a direct hit from Hurricane Luis (1995). Stow this paperback in your carry-on bag for quick relief while you wait impatiently to board your fight to the island paradise of your choice."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I read the book and found it to be not the story of two people, but the story of one. Apparently, Bob was not interested in writing the book yet his name appears as an author. The book did not appeal to me or my wife who both love the island of Anguilla. -Strike 1.Despite this, while my wife and I were in Anguilla we decided to try Blanchards. I even brought my book to be signed.(My book is not signed) From reading the book, and the reviews from the USA Today, among others, the Blanchards bailed out of \\"corporate deal making\\" and started a restaurant in Anguilla without any previous restaurant expierence. Upon futher review, this is not the case.Not only did they previously own a restaurant in Telluride,CO, they actually owned one in Anguilla, which they sold.The restaurant, Mangoes, still exists to day.Srike Two.No doubt the cusine and atmosphere are superb. However, the shameless hawking of, son Jessie's \\"upcoming\\" artwork is just that, shameless. Art is in the eye of the beholder,so if you go there ,like it, and want to buy it contact me and I will get the same for $2000 to $3600 less.Strike 3...Bottomline: How could you write a book like this and omit so many relavent facts? Answer: To create a fairy tale story to get publicity for your restaurant. Also, How could the mainstream press fall for this? Answer:????? By the way, there are many great restaurants on the island of Anguilla. Anyone, please advise if I have any of the facts wrong. Clearly, the Blanchards did not let the truth get in the way of a good story.EBM"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This is a book for those of us who still fantasize about running away to an island. This is the memoir of the Blanchards, who sold their business and moved from their home in Vermont to Anguilla. As anyone who's been there knows, Anguilla is one of the nicest (and now, most expensive) islands in the Caribbean.At first, it sounds like a neat idea to move to paradise and open a restaurant. However, restaurants are the most difficult businesses to run - and trying to start one on a Caribbean island is twice as difficult. I've often wondered, \\"Where do they get their food from?\\" Well, this book answers that question. Despite all odds, the Blanchards open what turns out to be one of the best restaurants in the Caribbean. But - just when everything seems rosy - hurricane Luis hits.I wouldn't suggest this book to everybody. There's little dramatic tension and I don't think that it is going to win any prizes for literature. It is simply this couples charming story of moving to paradise. If you are very interested in living on \\"island time,\\" then this will interest you. JUST BE WARNED - there is a lot of discussion of food in the book and YOU WILL get hungry every five minutes."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"As a quick reading alternative to a romance novel, this book would work. But for a literary experience this book falls short. It is an interesting exercise to read it and figure out why. First, the book has two authors, but only one voice. Melinda Blanchard's voice dominates the text. During the parts of the story where she is not around, i.e. the parts her husband Bob wrote, her voice becomes omniscient which felt wrong. I would have liked to hear Bob's voice as a co-author in the book. Second, Melinda tells us what we see instead of showing us the surroundings and everything is either Lush or Luxurious. Perhaps she lost her thesaurus among her imported tropical plants, silver and crystal. Despite a lack of description to center a reader into a place they may never have been and a need to find a synonym for lush, the lightness of the prose fits the airy vacation feel the authors wanted to give to the narrative and it works, for a beach read. What bothered me the most about the book was the prevailing voice of innocence. Not once did a reflective voice step in to deepen the experience based on what she knew now looking back or to provide greater insight or reflection on the coexistence of two different cultures, vastly different socio-economic status or an exploration of if it is even appropriate to try and become a local which would have made their story relevant and interesting. This total lack of reflection lead me to continuously question why she felt the need to tell me this particular anecdote over any of the others she could have chosen? Was it in some way integral to her learning about the island, culture or restaurant business? I'll never know because she never told us and it takes a light airy book and makes it completely frivolous.If a reader has spent any time living on an island and actually immersed in the local culture, then you have met people like the Blanchards. They are the ex-pats who are not there to live life with the locals, but to live life as perpetual tourists on a tropical island. This knowledge will color every single narrative in the book in a negative way.If a reader has no experience with the over privileged western mindset set in a developing country then the book could be an enjoyable moment of escapism for you in the way that a mass market mystery or romance novel provides escape."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This book is a wonderful read.

I visited Anguilla this spring with my family and have never spent a more pleasant week anywhere in the Caribbean! It is truly the most friendly and enchanting island of them all. The Blanchards' book is captivating, enjoyable and makes any reader long to abandon mainland life for a sunny spot on an Anguillan beach. Their account of the people they encountered was wonderful and their experiences mirrored the true friendliness of native Anguillans. The story was very well written and I felt like I knew the Blanchards and their staff by the time I finished the last page. It was so good that I went out and bought their new book, Live What You Love and the companion cookbook to \\"A Trip to the Beach\\", At Blandchard' Table.(both very good as well!)

A must-read!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Melinda and Bob Blanchard have written a wonderful account of the trials and tribulations of building, maintaining, and operating a restaurant on a tiny Caribbean island.When these adventurous folks found themselves more or less out of business in Vermont(their gourmet food business had failed) they decided to chuck it all and retreat to the Caribbean.They tell a fascinating story that includes all of the obstacles that a restaurant patron might never think of when sitting down to a meal at Blanchards restaurant: the need to buy building materials and all of the supplies such as tables, linens, dishes, glassware, etc. in Miami and have everything shipped in; the difficulty of finding competent help; the daily struggle to get perishables sent to the island; the vagaries and dangers of the weather.Despite many setbacks and problems, Melinda, who narrates this book, never whines about their circumstances. Their love for the way of life overshadows everything else. It was so interesting to read about how they conquered the myriad obstacles along the way (lack of water, cooking for a full house with no electricity one night, growing flowers and shrubs in an area with little rain, finding a house at a reasonable price on a resort island).I also liked learning some of the history and government of this island and how it arrived at its present status.A lovely trip!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"...I bought the Blancards' book at their restaurant after eating dinner there.

Books like this one, won't help. Already the &quot;glitzeratti&quot; have found the place.

Could have easily been interpreted as fiction had I not known it was a true story.The setting is obviously amazing, and she does a GREAT job of bringing it to life! You can almost feel the tropical breezes, and hear the palms swaying. The characters are brought alive and you feel like you personally know each of them by the book's end.I have been to all of the islands that neighbor Anguilla, and she made me feel like I had just taken a vacation. This was one of those books that you looked forward to snuggling up with, instantly transprting you...where you find yourself trying to carve time out of your day just to read.You will not be disappointed with this one!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"Reading this book shows you that no matter how big your goal, you CAN do it! Bob and Melinda just put one foot in front of the other and made their dream of owning a restaurant in Anguilla and moving to their favorite vacation spot a reality! Reading this book shows you that the only thing coming between you and your dream is fear. I left a job that I hated after reading this book. I never would have had the strength to do it without reading this book. I got another job in less than a month, making a little less, but was so much happier. It also built my self confidence knowing that I had taken control of my life and made things better.A Trip to the Beach changed my life. I'm ordering one now to send to a friend who's in a rut and I know this will help her! Thank you Bob and Melinda!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"This book was one of the best books I've ever read! Being a lover of the Carribbean, this was a total escape. I felt I was there and knew all the characters in the book. An American Dream to chuck it all and move to the Carribbean. Would love to visit in real life!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I LOVE LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK !!Can't WAIT for the author's second !!! need i say more?"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I don't often read biographies or personal stories like this one, but this really resonated with me. We've been thinking of moving to Costa Rica, and this was an amazingly similar story. Melinda Blanchard really makes you feel like you're there with them, making each decision, facing each problem, making new friends. At the end, you say \\"Wow!\\".Now I'm going to get the cookbook too..."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I loved this book. I love Anguilla, and this book made me feel like I was back there again. I can't wait to go back now and hopefully meet some of the people in the book!"},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"I am always looking for good reads about life stories of those settling in the Caribbean as I have attempted several times. The Blanchards love of Anguilla matches my love of St. John and Tortola and now Dominica. After reading this book I also enjoyed Live what you Love and would really love it if they would write a sequel to A Trip to the Beach."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"THis book was a joy to read. I love the trials and tribulations of the Blanchards in Paradise. I only wish I had half of the determination they have! Highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Trip to the Beach","review":"The Blanchards have done what a lot of us dream of doing: a fun job without bosses in a fun country with fantastic weather--at least in season! Aside from providing a thoroughly enjoyable account of their move to Anguilla, the book is also a passionate description of how one can make a dream come true, and with not that much money at all. Having said that, their repeated references to the Anguillan \\"paradise\\" maybe a bit excessive when one considers the horrible red-tape, vicious hurricanes and logistic nightmares they had to deal with. But perhaps that is what makes this book really excellent: it is a realistic view of the pros and cons of the Blanchards' choice, devoid of sticky romanticism and with no trace whatsoever of the smugness and superiority complexes one often finds in writers who move to a foreign country and tell their story."},{"Title":"Mr. Betts and Mr. Potts","review":"I got this book from our library 3 months ago and have renewed it four times in a row! My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it and I have to say I enjoy reading it to her. It has wonderful rhymes, rhythm and review (like the house that jack built) so it is lots of fun! I have my daughter guess the next word because the rhyming is generally predictable, it also teaches a little about colors and is just plain silly which makes it fun for all. At last I am buying my own copy so someone else can get it from the library!"},{"Title":"Mr. Betts and Mr. Potts","review":"Cute story but not one of our favorites. Positives:nice rhyming text, repetitive verse so your kids can join in from memory, into to colors. Negatives: not a big fan of the artwork. It's not bad, just not great."},{"Title":"England Under The Tudors","review":"Sir Geoffrey's is a great work, worth every minute spent reading it. One gains an understanding of the times, the society, the national and international politics, the economy, the religious issues -- and the fascinating Tudors and their administrators. A wonderful piece of work. Too bad the publisher Routledge packaged this masterpiece in a miserly volume meanly produced by The Guernsey Press. The type, which looks as though plates were made by photocopying some earlier printing, is like the fine print in a sales document -- so miniscule one must squint even in very good light. On many pages the text flows into the narrow gutters so that one must forcibly press the book open to make out what lies next to the binding. Because of the cheapness of the edition, reading it will be slow going for you, unless you do as I did: Force each two-page spread onto the flat bed of a photocopier, set the enlargement at 120%, and copy the text. Once I did that, the reading went smoothly. Shame on you, Routledge and Guernsey Press, for giving us such a fine work in such a shoddy presentation."},{"Title":"England Under The Tudors","review":"Direct, opinionated, sometimes even combative, Elton delivers a tour de force in historical survey. This book is a highly readable, meticulously researched, and thoroughly engaging review of the period from the beginning of the reign of Henry VII to the death of Elizabeth. As survey of English history during the time of the Tudors, you can't do much better than this book.The character and accomplishments of each of the rulers stands out as a uniquely individual: Henry VII, the fiscally responsible monarch who established the Tudor claim to the throne and restored the monarchy to solvency; Henry VIII the religiously orthodox ruler who nonetheless broke with Rome and established the Church of England; Edward, the protestant fanatic who (fortunately?) did not live long enough to have much impact; Mary, sincere but of limited ability as a queen; and of course Elizabeth.Elizabeth's portrait is perhaps the most interesting, since she reigned longest and cast such a huge shadow over the time. The view is a balanced one. Elton is not over-awed by his subject, as so many biogrpahers of Elizabeth seem to be. He acknowledges her political deftness and sure-fire judge of men's ability, without losing sight of her failings and personal weaknesses. Her fiery temper and vainty are not forgotten and not every decision she makes is hailed as correct - nor is she dismissed as being merely \\"lucky\\" for her entire 45 year reign, as the occassional critic of Elizabeth seems to imply.The true hero of the work, however, is none of the monarchs, not even Henry VII whom Elton seems to think quite highly of. It is Thomas Cromwell, who essentially ran the government during the crucial years of Henry VIII's break with Rome. Elton credits him with \\"revolutionizing\\" the beauracracy of the country as well as guiding policy for the entire span of his service. Hea rgues that the revolution in Henry VII's time was guided primarily by Cromwell and merely \\"consolidated\\" under Elizabeth.Along the way, other men of ability and position who influnenced the course of history are given time as well. There is the brilliant but ultimately unsuccessful Woolsey, who Elton believes set the stage for the collapse of support for Catholicism in England, William Cecil (later Lord Burghley), who was Elizabeth's chief minister and right hand man throughout most of her reign, and the tragically unstable Essex who was his own worst enemy, to name only a few.A great introduction or refresher for those interested in learning more about a period that was crucial to the formation of the England that become the world's dominant power."},{"Title":"England Under The Tudors","review":"Elton is the most dangerous of historians -- clear, logical and able to charm with his (sometimes) dry wit.Although fair due is given to all the monarchs:Henry VII is capable and prudent;Henry VIII is less capable, less prudent and in above his head;Edward VI is selfish and malleable (but he was young);Mary is sincere and narrow (Here Elton makes one of the few unfair statements in the book. He says, truly enough I expect, that during &quot;Bloody Mary's&quot; reign fewer people were killed for the cause of religion or rebellion than under any other Tudor. This ignores the brevity of her reign and makes no allowance for what might have been if Catholicism had been forcibly reintroduced.);Elizabeth is truly a great ruler;...the real hero is Thomas Cromwell who, in engineering Henry's divorce, established England as a state ruled by law.A wonderful book."},{"Title":"England Under The Tudors","review":"This book was on my reading list for History A level 45 years ago but I'm not sure that I ever read it. Reading it now, however, I can see that Elton's views, which may have been controversial at the time, crucially informed my history teachers!It is a very upbeat history, particularly interesting in its judgment of Henry VIII.The story of Henry VII is well told, the careful statemaker who established firm, even ruthless governance, succeeded by the 'Renaissance Prince' who wasted no time in overthrowing some of his father's carefully constructed policies.Nevertheless, while revealing Henry's cruelties and his determination to sacrifice anyone and everyone in order to safeguard the realm and succession, remeniscent to me on a smaller scale of the attitudes of Mao and Stalin, it was under Henry that the future of British greatness was made possible.He was not afraid to sever the connection with Rome, and to sacrifice his two great servants, Wolsey and Cromwell, when they became past their sell-by date.He left England in chaos as although he knew his route he could not manage men like his servants, and the last years of his reign suffered in every respect except general direction. Crucially, Henry refused, a bit like Queen Anne 150 years later to come down on one or the other side of the great debate, which was at that time religion.After his death Edward went one way and Mary the other, but Elizabeth picked up the reins just where Henry left them and consolidated all his achievements.The account of Elizabeth's reign focuses on her maintainence of a steady path. Elton appears to criticise her vacillation and romantic swings of mood, whereas Alison Weir in her biography tends to see these as feminine wiles which enabled her to twist the courts of Europe round her ringless wedding finger.There is a great chapter on Hawkins and Drake, and a moving one on the arts.This book doesn't explain everything but it is very positive about the achievements of the Tudors, in a way that I feel would be quite unfashionable were it to be written now."},{"Title":"Pennsylvania","review":"This has wonderful real life photos and short relatively easy to read pages for the early reader."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Elizabeth I","review":"Elizabeth is the subject of scores of biographies and this isn't one of the better ones. Williams' writing style is OK, but not deeply engaging, and he glosses over some of the most interesting periods in Elizabeth's life. The book is well-illustrated and is a decent introductory biography of Elizabeth, but it lacks the depth and insight any biography of this amazing woman should offer."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Elizabeth I","review":"I purchased this book to use as resource material for a book I am writing myself, part of which took place during Queen Elizabeth I's reign. The written material has been very helpful and the photos of paintings, etc have given me a clearer picture of the people and places of that era than simple words would not have been able to do."},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Elizabeth I","review":"There is so much to learn about Elizabeth the 1st. In The Life and Times of Elizabeth the 1st, by Neville Williams an abundant amount of information is given about Elizabeth's life before and during her reign as Queen of England. Before Elizabeth became Queen she suffered through a rough childhood without a mother, being called horrible names by people and being imprisoned by her own sister. During her reign as Queen, Elizabeth had to deal with life in court, religious matters and being courted often by suitors, yet choosing to rule on her own. This book also has many illustrations, which helps you in your understanding of the book.I felt this book had a lot of useful information about Queen Elizabeth's life. I also found it a very intriguing read. This book relates to the book To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. In To Kill A Mockingbird Atticus shows courage. He shows courage when he took Tom Robinsons case and tried to save him even though he knew in doing so he knew it could possibly hurt him and his family. Like Atticus Elizabeth also showed courage. She showed courage when she chose to rule England on her own even though she was being pressured to marry. There is so much to learn about this incredible monarch and what she went through throughout her life. I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"Peripheral visions: Swans Island ghost stories","review":"I first opened this book looking forward to getting spooked by true tales from a small wind tossed island off the coast of Maine. What I discovered was a journalist's take on ghost stories. You got the facts, but the spine tingling aspect was sorely lacking. I wanted so badly to be scared by the story of the woman being woken in the night by the feeling of someone holding down her legs. But for some reason, it just fell flat. I think the author meant well, but it would be greatly improved by a rewrite. They don't need to fictionalize by any means, but just some tweaking would make it a more enjoyable read. What did impress me was the quantity of ghost stories from a place with only 350 year round residents."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"i saw the movie for the first time in elementary school; i read the book for the first time in middle school; i bought the book in high school; now i'm taking it with me to college, and you can bet i'll someday read it to my kids. when you read the book, you get william goldman's fabulous character descriptions, narrative, and irony, and when you see the movie you get the equally fabulous portrayals by the actors (wallace shawn is to die for!). universally recommended!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I don't know what it is but I find that at least once a year I reread this book. An english teacher of mine once spoke about how there is always one book that becomes the most special to you and is something that you can fall back upon to put your life back in order when things are low...I guess for me it's this one. It is simply wonderful and only gets better each time I read it. Yay yay yay!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Just a repeat of what's been written previously: amazing, fabulous, wonderful book. Wry humor &amp; witty dialogue abound. If the jokes inside the book don't get to you, maybe the inside joke will:Morgenstern doesn't exit. The unabridged version doesn't exist. They were Goldman's literary devices. I don't know how much better the original could have been when this IS the original work by the original author."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Like most, I saw the movie first (died laughing), and expected the book to be so-so. I was overjoyed that the book is just as funny! Goldman's &quot;notes&quot; can at times be intrusive, and the ending is rushed, but it's a very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I hate to disappoint anyone, but S.Morgenstern doesn't exist. He is merely a brilliant creation of Goldman, a way to piece together a bunch of ideas that he had been working on but could not figure out how to weave them into a storyline. I find it amazing how many people actually believe that it's an abrigement. If anyone wants to know the specifics on how the book was contrived, I'd be glad to dispose of any information I have regarding the most charming tale that I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What can I say? This book had everything humor, love, greed, decite, revenge, and oh yeah it also had humor! I don't know had he managed to weave everything together so well, but it doesn't matter he did and you will love it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I own two copies of the movie and can resite it word for word. I had trouble finding the book but when I finally did I was totally impressed. I am only on the fourth chapter and have decided that I want to buy it. I will always love the movie and I make everyone I know watch it at least once. They all have grown to love it too. I hope they DO NOT come out with a sequel because then it will ruin the original movie. The first is always the best and always will be. Dont change what doesnt need to be changed. Princess Bride will always be my all time favorite."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman's Princess Bride by William Goldman is a book about the beautiful Buttercup who promises to marry the handsome Westley, but learns he is killed by pirates. When Buttercup vows to never love again, a prince forces her to marry him. Westley comes back, apparently not dead, and tries to get Buttercup back. Read this awesome book to find out what happens next. This book, a fantasy, is good for mostly girls because there is a lot of girl/boy stuff. The author, William Goldman, is actually a screenplay writer more than an author. His version of The Princess Bride is actually based on his movie and the first version. S. Morganstern is the actual author. One reason why readers might like this book is because it has the Count who, although he is a bad guy, is very funny in a sarcastic sort of way. A really good scene is when the main characters are in the fire swamp. Everything is described so vividly, like when Westley is attacked by the R.O.U.S. (rodents of unusual size). Another reason why readers might enjoy this book is because it has not very realistic but very cool animals."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I remembering watching this movie when I was little then I saw the book at me friends house. I borrowed it, read it in 2 days and loved it more than I loved the movie. Which is a lot!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book. I am dying to see the movie. If there is a sequel then I have got to read it. The only thing is I don't think Buttercup deserves Westly. He risks so much for her. When she leaves him at the fireswamp I CRYED at how foolish and unworthy she is.But I still loved it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read all the reviews from Amazon and it seems that other people have already expressed my delight with this book. However, like Randy McMahan, I would like the unabridged version of this book. Any ideas from anyone???Judy"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a wonderful book. Let me say that again: wonderful. Wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful. A million times wonderful.I adore the movie. I've seen it countless times. But the book is even better. We learn more about those wonderful characters. And S. Morgenstern's use of the language (as abridged by Goldman) is masterful.And we get to read part of the long-lost sequel! I want to read the rest! Please, Mr. Goldman, if you read this, finish the abridgment and publish!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Besides penning a delightful (satirical) work, I love how convincingly the author has pretended to adapt this work from a longer story by &quot;S. Morgenstern.&quot; He had cynical me believing it the first time I read _The Princess Bride_. The story itself is effectively tongue-in-cheek, mixing cliches masterfully in a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has healed serious illness, cured the blues, substituted for the lack of a love life and generally been a wonderful companion through countless readings. Having purchased innumerable paper back copies of this book to give to friends (and enemies) it was with great, great pleasure that I found the hard cover edition. This 25th anniversary commemorative version includes the long lost chapter, &quot;Buttercup's Baby,&quot; which adds an unexpected element of spiritualism to the magic of this beloved tale.This is a book to read alone or read aloud. This book can be used as an antidote to excess cynacism, a polstice for a wounded heart or as a stimulant for an underused imagination. Share this book with those you love and use this book as a test for those you would love -- you wouldn't want to spend you life with anyone who doesn't just love it too."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"True love, &quot;the best thing in the world, except for cough drops,&quot; good vs. evil, and a striking, satiric wit make this the ideal book for those of us who still cling to the age-old romantic themes of fantasy, while searching for the modern-day approach of reality."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first saw the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; while in college. It became immediately one of my favorite movies of all times. My wife and I purchased the movie and then the &quot;Good parts version&quot; of William Goldmans' book. I am unclear if there really was an unabridged version, but if there is I really would like to have it to read, to add to my collection, and ultimately pass down to my children. Mr. Goldman, if you ever review these comments, my hats off to you. You provided me with many hours of pleasureable reading and viewing. I would like to have my questions answered regarding whether there really is the book by S. Morgentstern or was this a &quot;pen name&quot; that simply adds realism to the book. Thank you again and I look forward to reading your other works..... Randy McMahan"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of the best ever! I read this book over 10 years ago, right before the movie came out. While the book is better than the movie, don't miss that either. Both are wonderfully funny and whimsical."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a book that my kids will have heard via the bedtime story. I will read this to then at a rate of a chapter a night. A must read. Give it to a loved one."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"About 5 years ago I was intorduced to the movie the Princess Bride, and I fell in love with it instantly. I read the soft covered book a few years ago for the first time, and just recently bought the 25th anniv. edition.

Would definitely buy from them again!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Great and fast will buy again from them. received it before due date and book was much better than described."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is an exceptionally fun book to read. Vivid imagery, quirky dialogue, clever characters and non-stop excitement make the book a fun, can't-put-down story... until the editor chimes in to explain why he abridged a certain part of the book or point out the fact Morgenstern has played a trick on the reader.Goldman does a fine job of explaining the history behind the book in his introduction, but he also did a fine job of giving away parts of the story to one of the few individuals who've never seen the movie nor read the book. This was easily remedied by skipping the rest of the two introductions (why does a book need two introductions by the same person anyway) until the action was suddenly halted by the Mr Goldman once again chiming in to tell the reader he'd cut a significant portion out of the book and a windy explanation as to why he did so while taking a few lines to give away upcoming plot details. He did however warn he was going to continue his interruptions, so they were easy to anticipate and skip. The one which unnerved me most was when Morgenstern obviously contradicts himself, which is not a surprise considering his style and adds a creative light-hearted air of fun to the tale. The editor's italics appear suddenly saying something like \\"see, he tricked you again...\\" Apparently Mr Goldman never learned the art of humor, especially the very important fact of ruining a joke the moment it's explained.Complaints about the editor aside, the story itself is magnificently exciting and elicited more than one moment of laughter. I definitely recommend reading this book, just skip reading anything the editor wrote until you're through the whole thing (made much easier on the Kindle by highlighting the interruptions and going back later)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is the best book that I've ever read. It's worth more then five stars. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes high adventures, unforgettable characters and romance."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. It is full of imagination and humor, lots of zany humor. Even though it is a very lengthy story you forget all about its length ( I didn't want it to end!) and I would recommend it to parents and their children or any one who enjoys a good, clean (and funny) story.P.S. I think the GOOD PARTS version may be annotated and mine wasn't. The only bad thing I have to say is that I didn't enjoy the BUTTERCUP'S BABY part but you don't have to read it if you don't want to. And by the way, how any one can select parts of the story and label them &quot;good parts&quot;( which implies that the other parts are bad or not entertaining) is beyond me. Anyway,ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I grew up on the movie The Princess Bride, and so naturally I couldn't wait to be completely blown away by the novel. After having read it, I can now truthfully say that the movie, however exceptional it is, does not do the book justice. How could anyone ever make a movie based on a masterpiece? Don't get me wrong-I love the movie, but the book is simply a triumph.The story tells of Buttercup, the milkmaid destined to become the most beautiful woman in the world, and her love, the farm boy Wesley, who will defy all logic, reasoning, and even death to find her. S. Morgenstern tells their story with wit, humor and charm. William Goldman' abridgment comments allow a brief understanding of Morgenstern's comments and thoughts, a breath of air, before the reader plunges back into the book.This is a tale that anyone, young or old, can enjoy. It is stories like these that the soul thrives on."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was surprised when I walked into a bookstore and saw this on the shelf. I really liked the movie, but had no idea it was also a book. I was even more surprised when I found out that it was a lot older than the movie. The style is very modern and not at all hard to understand. I now own a copy and am planning on reading it again soon!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As a child growing up on a Florinese farm, Buttercup enjoyed doing two things, riding on her horse, Horse, and torturing Westley, whom she called Farm Boy. Westley was an orphan adopted by her father to help tend the farm. Unbeknownst to Buttercup, Westley was madly in love with her, and did everything he possibly could to impress her. Only when Westley decided to sail to America to seek his fortune, did she realize how much she loved him back.Only, there were a number of problems, and things didn't end up according to plan. On the way to America, the Dread Pirate Roberts captured Westley. Roberts is known for leaving no survivors. Buttercup, lost in her grief, agreed to marry the hunting and war-happy Prince Humperdinck. The day the Prince announced that he would marry Buttercup, the evil Sicilian, Vizzini, and his sidekicks, Fezzik, the Turkish giant, and Inigo, the Spanish sword wizard, kidnapped Buttercup. Read this story of true love, high adventure, and find out how Buttercup's fairy-tale life ends up.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys fantasy. I loved this combination of action, romance, and just a touch of comedy. The way Morgenstern relates these events is incomparable. He always manages to find the perfect word others seem to struggle to find. He includes such great detail for every scene, whether it has great importance or not. He really captivated my attention to the point I couldn't put the book down. Simply put, I absolutely loved the Princess Bride, and it is my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Usually when you read a book that is based upon a Hollywood movie, or has been turned into a Hollywood movie, you are disappointed. Because Goldman wrote both the book AND the screenplay, none of the humour is lost. Scenes cut from the screenplay don't leave you feeling like you've missed out on anything. Excellent romantic fairytale. Pirates, sword fights, and romance. What else can you ask for?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I think the first time I read this book I was 17 years old. I have since reread it 5 or 6 times, each time loving different parts, or understanding different parts that I either missed the 1st few times or just didn't get. This book is truly a book for all ages - not to be missed. I am always searching for another book just like it, or another William Goldman book just like it, but not to be found. Guess that makes it a true classic. The movie is also my favorite movie. Don't miss either book or movie!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Ok, so maybe there is no \\"Princess Bride\\" book except this one, if that is the case I will just live without reading it. This was terrible, all chopped up and in the middle of these chapters this guy starts blabbing again about his \\"other\\" books he's written. I don't care! I got this book to read the story that the movie was based on NOT what thos golman guy thinks is interesting and about his dumb career!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I find this book quite offensive. Mr. Goldman is certainly not the rediscoverer of Morgenstern's book, which was never really lost. Rather he has produced a film edited version that is proof that modern publishers and producers have no confidence in the intelligence of their readership. Bypass this abridgement and seek rather for the original masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What a load of garbage. First of all getting though the boring yuck of his life story is just stupid. Then the story, parts aren't half bad. Getting interrupted by his italics was maddening. This book was not worth my money,time or effort. Save yourself!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This version of The Princess Bride annoyed me in many ways. For instance, William Goldman deleted whole sections of the original story. As if he knew exactly what the reading public wanted to read. I for one, would much rather read an original classic than to read a butched story and spoon fed only selected portions. The title of this book should read &quot;The Princess Bride as written by S. Morgenstern as destroyed by William Goldman. Shame on you Mr. Goldman for destroying what could have been an enjoyable reading experience with your pointless cuts and intrusive ramblings."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman is a thief, and I'll see him in court"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Was looking for the original version that would mirror the movie with a classic feel. This was NOT it. Returned. Disappointed. Can't find what I want anywhere. This book has some screen play from another writer inside. Boo!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the movie, and perhaps it was that that ruined this book for me. I found the fact that he kept pointing out WHERE he was skipping over the princess going over her zillion dresses and whatnot EXCEPTIONALLY dull.... I know why they left all of that out of the movie, it is boring. I usually keep a hold of all of the books I read. I don't own this one anymore."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This has to be one of the most egomanical books I've ever read. The forced cleverness and side bars are oh-so unnecessary! Can S. Morgenstern get his head through a door with an ego that big? I doubt it.A classic? Hardly. And it is basically a good storyline. It's such a pity that the author goes off on his self-aggrandizing chatter all the time.Do yourself a favor. Buy the movie! Peter Falk is worth the price of admission! Now there is a narrator!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I, like William Goldman, read this book when i was little. Also like him, though, I read it as the original. The reason that edited books such as this annoy people like me is that it is no longer the author's work. The editor (Goldman) took the author's (Morgenstern) artistic licence away when he took out everything he thought the audience would not need to read or enjoy. The title says \\"The 'Good Parts' Version\\" but who is he to say that? Goldman says that he loved this book as a child, so why shouldn't anyone else? Just the way that it is? He should have just gotten it reprinted. A writer himself, he should know that authors hate to have their works changed. What they write is what they want to be said. Not edited out.Finding this book on the library shelf while browsing was one of the happier moments of my simple life. But I was disappointed when I found out that so much had been removed.This is an okay substitute to the original, he did not actually change anything that was written, but I still think that the editing was unneeded. I gave it three stars because of what was left of the original."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book brought tears to my eyes because it was so... AWFUL!!! I was expecting a nice fairy tale-and instead- I got a boring, stupid book where the author comes in every page and a half talking about how golf was invented then. This book is only, ONLY for people for really, really, really, quirked senses of humor! If tyhe rating of zero was available I would give the Princess Bride a -3. Not a worothy book!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Don't waste your time renting this movie!! You have to read the book to have the full effect! It's very entertaining, funny and full of adventure! I loved it! A must read for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is the book-on-tape version of the classic novel on which the movie was based read by its director, and it IS an abridgement. For one thing, the very intense scene inside the lightning sand is not included.If you're a fan of the movie, read the book. If you love the book, get this tape for your next road trip. Reiner does an excellent job recreating the magic he brought to the movie, and a lot of the book that wasn't shown in the movie is here.As in my review of Rich Hall's \\"Vanishing America,\\" the missing star is only because of the quality of cassette tape used for these books on tape. My copy has developed an annoying squeal that has made much of it virtually unlistenable. When I get a clean copy, it's getting dubbed right away to Maxell or CD."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The only drawback about this version is all the cut out portions.

I grew up with the movie, and saw it so many times I had most of the lines memorized. When I began reading the book, I was glad that the first chapters or so seemed just as good as the movie. Then wham, I suddenly found myself reading something about the author sitting by a pool in Hollywood, waiting for his agent to call about the script, and feeling guilty about missing his son's birthday. Icky!I do not mind background from the author, describing how his dad had read S. Morgenstern's \\"Tale of True Love and High Adventure\\" to him when he was a kid, and how the story had inspired him to write \\"The Princess Bride\\" as an adult. However, the rest of it I could do without. Save the Hollywood descriptions for a separate book like \\"The Making of the Princess Bride: How I struggled to get this made into a movie\\". It also pains me to hear the writer of a good story chastise himself.I would still recommend reading \\"The Princess Bride\\" and seeing the movie because the story is charming and the characters are adorable. If you are going to read the book, look for an earlier version that does not include the author's annoying narratives."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"In reading the novel form of The Princess Bride, rather than Fred Savage, we are treated to bits of William Goldman's childhood, his woes with his editor, and in the foreword and afterword, his family life. I really would have liked it better without, at the least, the bits of the editor and his family.Goldman portrays his wife and son in less than flattering... perhaps even less than loving... manner. In fact, at times he out-and-out insults them. I found myself wishing I could smack him on the head and tell him to get on with the story. The rest of the text was somewhat tainted by the unflattering portrayal of Goldman that he brought upon himself in these areas.In another section, we're informed that Goldman's editor forced him to cut out a large part of the adventurous text, where Inigo and Fezzik are journeying to gather the materials necessary for Miracle Max's potion to heal Westley. This bit of text seems little more than Goldman being rather hissy towards his editor, like a child who has had a toy taken away, and only serves to call that much more attention to a loss of text that nothing can be done about.Personally, I think that \\"The Princess Bride\\" needs a 'Really Good Parts' version... as told by someone other than Goldman."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read this book and loved it, but i was really disappointed when i saw that there was know chapter four. And when I tried looking for a copy that wasn't abriged all i could find was the same one i have. But other then that small problem it was a great book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A decent enough story, but the author tries just too hard to be oh-so-clever. I'm really not sure why this book is so adored, when so many others do it so much better."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a book that has many adventures and the fighting rate is high. I watched the movie before I did read the book. What I realized the book is way better then the movie is. The book is very descriptive but I haven't read any of the other books that Harry Goldman's wrote to say that he has written very good books. Most of the characters are described with care and the setting, plot, and lives of the people and where they lived and their life were also described. This book is the absolute worst some may say but then they aren't using their imagination or they don't know how. If I didn't use my imagination then the book would be the worst book that I have ever read. Like many science fiction books you have to pretend that the plot, characters, and setting are real. The book is very funny and it is also very exciting. I recommend the book to anyone who wants to read an adventure in a book. Only you have to believe that the book is in real life or it won't be very interesting."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just love this book! The movie was awesome too! Cary Elwes is amazing! LISTEN UP! S.Morgenstern is a REAL guy! He wrote the book. William Goldman abridged it. Don't listen to the bull from the other reviewers about S.Morgenstern being a figment of William Goldman's imagination. He's not. By the way, Florin and Gilder are made up but that was the name of the currency they used back then. I'm proud to say that I know all about it because I've watched the movie so many times."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a great book for all ages. At first it may be a little confusing, but once you get into the book you'll love it! I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read. I couldn't get my nose out of it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Okay, short and sweet. I like this book because it has not only True love, but Real love--the kind that doesn't come easily and you have to work for it. Westley, Buttercup, Humperdinck, Count Ruger, Fezzik, Inigo Montoya, Vizzini and etc are all names to be read about and LOVED or DESPISED. Lastly, the only reason I gave this book 4 stars, (because I love it but have to be honest) is that it has an ending that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more, and Goldmans &quot;interruptions&quot; get a big aggravating. Oh,yeah, this is the only book I would say that the movie is a lot better but the book explains stuff-like where the heck are Buttercups parents?:)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is one of those books that you can't put down till your finished! It has all the elements of a true fairy tale. The Princess Bride may not have been the first fairy tale, but if you think about it, it could've been. The only reason I didn't like the book was because of all the explaining William Goldman did. {I wish I could get my hands on an orginal to compare!} Other wise it was a winderful book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"When I first heard about The Princess Bride,it was from my fifth grade teacher Miss Flynn. Also, Fox used to air it back in 1994 a lot. I simply fell in love with the story. It's a classic tale of true love, adventure, swordfighting, castles,and good versus evil. I read the book by Goldman and it was the most pleasurable reading I have ever done. No long, boring descriptions, no long dialogue scenes, and best of all, the love story was not corrupted by any sex. It was truly love, like looking into each other's eyes, kissing and not marrying for money. It was everything a romance should be! Plus the characters were witty, humorous and unique. You've got to own this book. Keep it on your bookshelf. This is the best fantasy romance out there. And by the way, I just found out. There is no author called Morgenstein. Goldman wrote The Princess Bride. And I'm glad he did."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I must admit that I, for one, was fooled by the new hardcover edition into believing in Morgenstern - and was very much looking forward to going out and finding the unabridged version to read the &quot;good parts&quot; which Goldman claimed to have left out for sake of plot. I think the only thing I like better is to find that in fact I had been tricked all along! How wonderful, it only increases my opinion of a book I already loved."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I found the book at an old used bookstore in Ocean City Md. During a rainy beach day I started it, and never made back into the water. I was quite young when I first read the book, but I was always interested in the unabridged version.

If you know PLEASE email me!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This doesn't have much to do with the Princess Bride, but I have 2 questions. Is S. Morgenstern Real? At the end of the book there was some chapter about &quot;Buttercup's Baby.&quot; Is this a real book? If so, where can I find it?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has an extremely disappointing ending--it just left you hanging. At the beginning, the author's notes are amusing, but they grow very old very quickly. The movie is much, much better. If you must read this book, buy the paperback version and save yourself some money. Better yet, buy the video."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"that not enough people have read the book! =) oh my God, I LUV THIS BOOK!!!!! even though i got hooked on the book after i got hooked on the movie, i like the book better. you can understand the movie much more easily if you've read the book. even though i wish they could've put the entire book in the movie without changing a single word of it (many questions arise if you've only seen the movie, does buttercup have any parents? what the heck is inigo and fezzik saying? why doesn't The Princess Bride go back on the big screen?), [i know it would be too long, probably 4 hours or something] the movie is a really good adaptation of the book. Boy, did I feel stupid when my sister told me that there was no such person as S. Morgenstern! I mean, it's really very clever the way William Goldman wrote his book. I strongly suggest you buy this book and cherish it forever. The binder on my copy is almost coming off, i've read it so many times! This is the only book i've read that i would not change a single word of! I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! &quot;Inconceivable!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It is not fair that I rated this book 8 because to me this book deserves a 9 or up. The only reason that i give the book a 8 is that I am not a person that enjoys to be fooled ( because ever since I got to this country 3 years ago I've been fooled by everyone I know )and this book did exactly that!! However, I have to give credit to William Goldman for doing a awsome job of fooling the readers. Being a fantsy book reader myself I enjoyed this book very much. Like all others the author did a good job of bring things that we (human) can only dream to life, in addition the book's setting and plot are not banal at all, but I have to admit that I had almost thorwn the book in to the trash can when I read to the part where &quot;Westly&quot; died. One more thing that I have to point out is that unlike my other friends I think the prince is nothing but a useless, pusillanimous, and arrogant little fool.P.S. The ending should be more conclusive and happier. Because people like me who doesn't have that much of self-confidence and happiness in our lives just can't bare the thought of the terrible fate that the newly re-united couple and their newly found friends might face in the future.In case you wonder why I don't have a E-mail address the answer is that I'm a student who typed this up in Wotton High School.

This book can be a bit difficult to understand due to how the author navigates through time. However, it's entertaining."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"We're of two minds on this one. Seriously, we want to boldly proclaim The Princess Bride as the most original and creative work of fiction ever penned. And in the same breath we feel the need to ask why, oh why, was it necessary to do that to the narrative. Let us explain. Let us try to explain...William Goldman's version of The Princess Bride is actually an abridgment of S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. What makes this so remarkable is that S. Morgenstern is actually a mere invention of William Goldman's mind. Get it? The novel contains two separate narratives. The first is the exciting story of Buttercup, Westley, iocaine powder, ROUSes, and a gentleman with six fingers. The second is an entirely fictitious account of William Goldman's life and the tedious process of abridging a lengthy novel focused on the excess of European high society.Our initial opinion of the actual abridgment is positive. The story was funny, thrilling, suspenseful and romantic. The dialogue was witty although every line felt like it would translate perfectly into a screen play... The characters were great and in the case of Fezzik - larger than life. The added realness of Westley and Buttercup's relationship was welcomed, although the reunion scene at the base of the Fire Swamp left much to be desired... We also learned some valuable insight into how tensions between Gilder and Florin escalated over a hat collection and the important distinctions between Snow Sand and Lightning Sand.And then there's the separate narrative about how the abridgement came about. Our opinion is not so positive. Yes, the technique was quite unique and at times funny, but it was also distracting. Each time the abridgment was interrupted for some additional insight, we kind of just wanted to get back to the story.As a complete work of art, The Princess Bride was an enjoyable read. Yes, we wanted more of the actual story and less of the commentary, but we always provide high marks for uniqueness. This book IS unique and in many ways the journey was more enjoyable than the destination. And even if you've seen the movie a dozen times, there's enough extra plot to keep any staunch Cary Elwes or Robin Wright fan entertained. Our only plea is to the S. Morgenstern estate: please let William Goldman abridge Buttercup's Baby..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Great book, but whatever you do, make sure you DON'T BUY FROM ARCHIVE BOOKS. There was writing and notes all over what was supposed to be a \\"like new\\" product."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As a fan of the movie, and learning that the book expands on the backstories of many of the characters I was quite excited to read the story. Having never been much for reading (I read slowly and books can take a long time for me so I am very selective about what I read), I decided that my love of the movie made this a worthy book to read.As my fondness for the movie was the driving motivator for reading this book I feel a comparison is prudent in this case.After reading the book I find myself conflicted as to whether or not it truly was a good idea to do so. You see, the movie is all about love, unbridled and unflinching in even the face of death. Perhaps the realists or pessimists out there may say that this detracts from the story but it's a fairy tale in a world of fantasy so I say why not? =)The movie is, for the most part, a condensed and somewhat rose-colored-glasses version of the book. In the book, Mr. Goldman goes between providing details on \\"S. Morganstern's\\" drivel on-and-on about certain scenes, providing an insight into himself as a child arguing to his grandfather reading the story (ala Fred Savage's character in the movie) and at times speaking to the reader as the grandfather in the movie. At times I found the interjections to be reminiscent of the movie and other times I felt it detracted from the story at hand. I think it'd be cool if Mr. Goldman were to release another book detailing this instead of interjecting it into the story itself. To some it can be a nice aside, but I found it brought me out of the world of the story.What really gets to me are the characters. For some, I felt the characters in the book were better while I felt that in many ways the characters in the movie were better.Viccini is one that I enjoyed much more in the book than the movie. His character is darker, and meaner and far from the comic relief that he represents in the movie (though I will say he was acted well and is a memorable character nontheless). I also found Inigo's story to be much more interesting in the book, where it's expanded upon much more than the movie.Unfortunately, and the one that really got to me was Buttercup. Her character may be the typical helpless heroine of the story but at least she held true to her ideals and principals. In the book, I found her to be many times more conceited and quite frankly dumb. As well, for the realists out there you may be happy to learn that Westley and Buttercup do argue and bicker in the book.As well, the book is a bit darker than the movie. I won't go into details as I don't want to spoil anything but that is the truth of the matter.So in conclusion, as to whether or not you should read this book I would say it's entirely up to you. Personally I'm still wondering if it was wise for me to do so. Sure, I enjoyed learning of the backstory or more details about the various characters, but I would not say that this is a story about \\"true love\\". There are changes in the way things play out that to me find it hard to believe in this fairy-tale's premise. Still, it is my hope that this review can assist in providing some insight for you =)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"at first i doubted it'd be like old-foggie style and really boring, but the story is really catchy!!! i really love the ups and downs in the plots and the way the author portraited it!! and without Goldman's abridgement this book would be nothing!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Bought for my wife's bookclub. She read it quick. Says it was her favorite movie growing up. That's good enough for me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is the best book in the world. It is writen as thought it is abridged(did i spell that right?) but it isn't and it is the most funny thing you will ever read. for example(read this and see if you can say you dont like it):&quot; we have now decided that the poisened cup is most likely in front of you. But the poison is powder made from iocane and iocane comes only from Australia and Australia, as everyone knows, is peopled with criminals and criminals are used to having people not trust them, and I don't trust you, which means I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.&quot; come on you have to love that and there are ROUS rodents of unusual size, and lots of other stuff that everyone loves. also the movie is really good too."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was an painful experience. I understand that there is no way that I can dissuade an enthusiastic \\"Princess Bride\\" fan from wanting to delve in further...but don't. The only reason I gave the book two stars is because it does have a good story in it- the story in the movie. The rest of the book is just awful.William Goldman's constant interuptions are more than a nuisance- they take up a good portion of the book. The story doesn't even start until around page 40, because he's so busy misleading us about the book's origin. Of course, he doesn't get around to that until after discussing (in detail) his love of sports, his ADHD, his bout of pneumonia and a number of other completely uninteresting and unrelated made-up details about his life. His story-telling style is almost enough to make you give up long before Buttercup meets Westley in the first place. He rambles... there is no other way to put it (well, maybe \\"babble\\"). By the end of the story when you reach \\"Buttercup's Baby,\\" you might as well stop, even if you have toughed it out this long. It is more shameless babble about Mr. Goldman, (the obese son loses weight. Sorry to ruin the suspense,) followed by a story with more of the plot missing than present.Almost as bad as Mr. Goldman is the way that Buttercup and Westley treat each other in the book. They are completely disrespectful toward one another. They insult each others' intelligence and talk down to each other (especially with Buttercup. The author and Westly seem to assume that a beautiful woman would be lacking in brains, in fact, they say so.) It is really off-putting, and I am more than a little grateful that this part was taken out of the movie.The movie is a real abridgement. It's an abridgement of the book, and even though much of the movie is word-for-word with the book, it skips all the crap that Goldman insanely thought was adding to it. There is some character development that is missing in the movie, like about Inigo's father and his training all over the world after Domingo's death, and even though this is interesting, wading through the asinine dribble just is not worth the effort.I implore you to save yourself the bad experience and just accept that the movie is the best part of the whole venture, and rest easy knowing that you're not missing anything good."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of those other little gems that slipped under the radar when I was growing up. Once again, I remember the movie, but never knew that it had come from a book first. I must have seen the film a hundred times (thanks to USA network, TNT and the like). However, it wasn't until a few weeks ago, that I actually seeked it out in its true form, almost 15 years later.What I was amazed with, was the faithfulness of the film to the text. They were almost dead on, with all the scenes, and especially the dialogue. Some things, as normal, were altered a bit or changed, but for the most part, what you see in the film (minus extra exposition and some character development) is what you read in the book.It is a good read, filled with great dialogue and wittiness. Yet at the same time, some of the authors \\"intrusion\\" into the text can be a little distracting at times. And at others, it is neat to hear him talk about how certain ideas came about, that directly affected the \\"film\\" version. Now that i've read it, when I view the film, I can honestly say they were dead-on with the casting. The personalities they picked, were excellent.If you are interested in going a bit beyond the movie, and seeing some extra info about Buttercup and Wesley, its a great little read (depending on what edition you get). And you can really see, just how honest/faithful they were, and careful, when bringing it to the big sreen. . .years ago."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I enjoyed this book so much, more than the movie, I think, that I tried to find the unabridged Morgenstern's version, which, as it comes out, is very hard to find!!! I won't spoil it for you, but after reading Goldman's version, look up S. Morgenstern in the Library of Congress, then read Goldman's version again with open eyes."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The only drawback about this version is all the cut out portions. Sometimes you don't want to read 21 pages all about hats but I feel you should at least once. If you don't, you can't really say that you've read said book.

It as a great sense of adventure that I have not seen been beat in a book yet. It also has I very deep love story that nobody can not be affected by. It shows you what is important in life. This is packed with magical places, true love, sword fights, and touching moments. Even though this sounds like a girl's book, it is actually awesome for both sexes. Simon Morgenstern writes an exelent story but I'm not so sure about William Goldman doing the abridgement becuase he sounds like a real jurk with all of his comment and all, he includes TWO of his introductions that he wrote and are so pitiful they were the worst parts in the whole book. Plus just when the exciting parts come along, he butts in and tells his own personal thoughts and I wish I had the origional because he takes out about 60 pages a chapter at least (not to mention that he took out the WHOLE chapter four and replaced it with a page of his dumb commentary. What I'm trying to say is that Morgestern is the real writer and that book I give five stars but this phony Goldman character; I give his commentary and introductionS an F- and 0 stars."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"That \\"The Princess Bride\\" has become a classic is obvious. Discussions about whether the book or the movie is better are a matter of taste, but surely without the book there would have been no movie. I watched the movie again last night, perhaps for the 25th time. This is only remarkable because I am neither \\"into\\" fantasy nor movies in general, and I like to fashion myself as a mature adult who watches maybe five hours of television in a month. But I am a writer who, when he occasionally stumbles upon a precious gem, likes to hold that gem in his hand, and examine its beauty from various angles and in different lights. Mostly I read nonfiction, and recently discovered another such gem of literature that I found actually alludes at times to \\"The Princess Bride.\\" This new book is called \\"Danger Close,\\" by Mike Yon and it seems destined for film. Overall, \\"Danger Close\\" is a serious book about a Green Beret who grew up in Florida, but this true story includes in real life many of the elements that occur in the fantasy world of TPB (True Love, fencing, fighting, torture). The comparison is by no means perfect, but at times the author, Mike Yon, actually winks at the readers that he, too, is a \\"Princess Bride\\" fan with lines almost straight from TPB. For instance, on page 31 of the 1st edition (there are three editions now so the pagination may have changed), the author described squirrels scampering through the trees as \\"rodents of unusual agility.\\" [As opposed to ROUS's: Rodents Of Unusual Size.] At first you might think this just a coincidence, but the further you venture into \\"Danger Close,\\" the more hilarious the secret references to TPB. This is made more remarkable by the fact that Mike Yon, for his creation of \\"Danger Close,\\" received the very prestigious and rarely bestowed \\"William A. Gurley\\" award for creative nonfiction. And so, this is yet another example of how fans, at least one of whom, Mike Yon, is now an author in his own right, are placing \\"The Princess Bride\\" with the classics."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I thought that this was a good story and I loved the movie, but I found Goldman's comments quite annoying and even if he doesn't really have a son I didn't find his rude remarks funny. I did always wonder why Goldman's name was so large and Morgenstern's so small but now that I know that there is no S. Morgenstern I get it, I also get the rather modern twist on the classic princess story. I advise you to skip that Italic portions and just read that story. I also reccomend not buying the 25 anniversary edition, I did because I thought Buttercup's Baby was included but it was just the first chapter and even that wasn't very good. I recommend just buying the paperback or better yet get it from the Library because it is not worth the money. I really did like the movie though (which I thought was just as good as the book) and I think the story is great, but there are better books out there. My favorite line is &quot;Life is pain Highness, and anybody who tells you differently is selling something.&quot; (not an exact quote) I also enjoyed Buttercup's dumb blond personality, sorry if I offended anyone by using the term dumb blond. I don't mean to sound to negative here I really did enjoy &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; I would probably recommend for some afternoon when you are bored and want some funny entertainment because it is funny, also skip the introduction chapter (I quit half way through and went to the real first chapter) it is not worth reading."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I had a great experience with this seller.

I picked it up for a Film &amp; Lit Adaptation course; the movie has always been one of my favourites, so I was interested in seeing where the film came from.

Morgenstern) and his talking book, I've turned my life around, learned to walk, and had my copy bronzed!Soon thereafter I bought another copy.The book, so incredibly and cleverly crafted, has certainly taught me one thing...Thank you for that one thing, Mr. Goldman, and finish that sequel!*.........*(Believe it or not, this actually is one of my favorite books, ever. But both the literary & theatrical aspects of the P.B. Experience were heightened moreso than I could have ever previously imagined upon the startling revelation that the mysterious & wonderful S. Morgenstern was all a fabrication of \\"Abridger,\\" William Goldman! This very revelation, my reluctant & most likely non-existent audience, occurred within the past hour for me, and is what prompted my review! *you're welcome* ...The lateness of the hour is probably what tempered my sarcasm, despite my undying love for this story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"We all know the story, if not from the book, then from the movie. And we all know that it truly IS a \\"Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure\\". What we probably didn't know was exactly how and why it was brought to life by William Goldman and his Florinese father. What makes this story is actually the abridgement, and the entertaining and charming way it is explained. The original William Goldman introduction published in 1973 was an essential part of the enjoyment of the abridged novel, and is now complimented by another introduction, written for the publication of the 25th anniversary edition of this book. Both intros are invaluable and will have you falling out of your chair with laughter, and they are the perfect lead-in to the the equally hilarious writing of S. Morgenstern himself. And finally, after your travels and adventures with Buttercup, Westley, Fezzik, and Inigo come to a close, ANOTHER jewel is discovered in the last 70 pages: the abridged first chapter of the sequel, Buttercup's Baby, along with an essential explanation by Goldman again.To sum it up, this 25th anniversary edition not only takes us into the lives of our adventurer's, Fezzik, Inigo, Westley and countless others; it also takes us into the life of another adventurer in his own right, William Goldman. Even if you've never heard of him before, by page 399, you will care about Goldman, and you will identify with him. We, the characters, and Goldman become a family. And I don't know about you, but I am dying to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Like many people, I never knew about THE PRINCESS BRIDE book until after seeing the movie several times. Recently, I finally sat down and read the book and was amazed. Goldman is amazing! The book gives a lot of insight into the charcters and why they do the things they do (why does Fezzik like rhymes; exactly how did Inigo's father die; etc.). However, the story is told in such a stylish and intriguing way that it is difficult to ever put the book down until you finish reading it (Goldman writes in a style that I can only hope to emulate).It has been over twenty-five years since THE PRINCESS BRIDE first appeared and it will continue to be read for years to come. Filled with such characters as Fezzik, Inigo, Miracle Max, Buttercup, and Wesley and places such as the Cliffs of Insanity and the Zoo of Death, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a book of pure genius. It is a classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read William Goldman's book when I was 13 and have been terribly addicted to it ever since. When William Goldman was a child, his father had read him a story that he fell in love with. A tale of adventure, pirates, royalty and more. As he grew, the book was always close to his heart so when his son was old enough, Goldman wanted to share this book with him. That is what makes this book so special, it is really two books in one. The first is the fairy tale in all it's glory. The other, is a wonderful glimpse into both the family and professional life of the author as he searches frantically for the book that defined his childhood relationship with his father. As a child myself, I loved the fairy tale aspect of the book but as I grew it was the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; part that I appreciate most.I highly recommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"this is one of the most amazing books i have ever read! the characters are very real and beleivable and the storyline is very unpredictable. but what i loved most was mogenstern's wording. it is as if you are living the book. although i was slightly dissapointed by some of the things goldman left out from the orriginal, i still enjoyed it thouroghly. i reccomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman's The Princess Bride is an excellent novel that displays his original style, his wit, and his beautiful story telling that is sometimes unappreciated. This tale of \\"true love and high adventure\\" takes the reader from the very top of the Cliffs of Insanity to the pits of Guilder's fire swamp. The story takes place in the land of Florin where love blossoms between farm boy Westly and his sweet, Buttercup. All is good until Westly must leave and his ship is overtaken by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who leaves no survivors. Buttercup, distraught by the loss of her love, is asked to be queen of Florin by the evil Prince Humperdink, and with no hope of true love again she accepts. Vizzini the genius and his two cohorts, Inigo the sword master and Fezzik the giant, soon kidnap her in order to start a war between Florin and their rival Guilder. The kidnappers are followed by a man in black who is also trying to get Buttercup. Could it be a long lost love? Goldman's story telling style is unique and quite entertaining. The outer plot line of taking his own point of view and incorporating past memories of his father reading him the book as a kid is a clever device for holding the reader's attention. The constant interruptions of the story by Goldman and his personal insights become a tale of their own. The allusion used in these interactions between father and son is an entertaining and effective external method of guiding the reader through the book. His theme of true love conquering all adversaries is the main premise. All the over the top romance is balanced quite nicely with a brilliant adventure story. His writing is sophisticated yet still an easy read and one book to be enjoyed by those of all ages."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Okay. Take a courageous farmboy who's pretty darn smart. Then take the most beautiful woman in the world. Imagine that they're madly in love. Add an evil prince, some interesting swordplay, and a few more nutball characters and viola- you've got The Princess Bride. While making fun of the usual fairy tale, at the same time, it conveys the normal idea that good always triumphs over evil. The would be author, William Goldman, tells the reader that he has edited an out-of-print novel of a man named S. Morgenstern that his father used to read to him when he was a kid. At first I thought he made up S. Morgenstern and the \\"original\\" The Princess Bride, but upon looking more closely at the reviews page, there were a few quotes from professors at Columbia University saying they taught a course in Morgenstern . Wow! Well, the girl, Buttercup, (the name says it all,) lives on a small farm in a place called Floren. (Wherever that is, I don't know.) Then, one day, she realizes she's in love with the farmboy. How inconvenient. But, it turns out he's in love with her too. So, he goes off to seek his fortune so they'll have money when they get married. Pirates that are famous for leaving no survivors attack his ship. Figures, huh? Well, Buttercup goes into despair, she'll never love again, blah de blah. So then the prince of the place, seeing her exquisite beauty, asks her to marry him, she thinks, Hey, that have I got to loose, and agrees. But then dudes wanting to use her to start a war capture her. She's rescued by a mysterious man in black who turns out, by some deranged law of nature, to be her long lost love. Well, of course, as you can imagine, the prince isn't too thrilled. He tries to do away with the used to be farmboy (who's name, by the way, is Westly.) And, there's a bit more action, and some interesting dialogue. I would tell you that the end is happy, but that's not for me to say now is it? The book certainly has its moments. The characters seem to know the way the world works. \\"Life is pain,\\" the queen tells her son, the prince. \\"Anyone who says differently is selling something.\\" How true. If you're looking for a funny, touching novel, I would definitely suggest The Princess Bride. Not only does you face ache from smiling after even the first few pages, but the characters stay in your mind and heart long afterwards. Read it. You'll thank me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a wonderful book. If you love adventure and true love stories, add this to your home library. The story starts off with a bang, and after Buttercup tells Westley, the poor farm boy, of her love for him, he too tells her how much he cares for her. He has no money for marrige, so he sails across the sea to seek his fortune. When he is gone, Buttercup gets some devasting news about Westley. Then she gets kidnapped, forced to marry the evil prince Humperdinck, who wants nothing but a war, and threatened with death more than once.This is a wonderful story, a definite must read. Just tell 'em, Kyla sent you!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is set after the invention of blue jeans, but before the invention of Europe, and it opens with a history of the most beautiful women in the world. It is a mix of high adventure and sharp wit that is a delightful read, but it's also something more.The story is peppered with the comments of its &quot;abridger&quot; and it is in these comments that the true beauty of the book shines through. Behind the tongue-in-cheek story about beautiful princesses, strong men, fencing, kidnapping, miracle workers, devilish tortures, and let's not forget self-immolation, is a story about a boy whose life was changed by a story, and a man who who is desperately hoping that the same story can change it again.A must-read that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've watched The Princess Bride movie many times a year for, quite frankly, as long as I can remember. It's one of those movies I grew up loving and grew fonder of as the years went by. It's so full of quotes, things I use so often even in daily life - as recent as dropping my brother off at his girlfriends (he's 16 and will never read this so I can tell you all) and yelling out, \\"Have fun storming the castle!\\" as he made his way up the driveway he refused to have me drive into.But as much as I love the movie, I hadn't picked up the book until a year or so ago. And then.. then, I felt much as Fred Savage's character must have felt (and much like Goldman describes his own feelings as a boy in the abridged notes) ((If you believe the abridged notes I shall giggle at you)), I fell in love with the book.I mean - the jacket says the following:So! Are you ready for Fencing and Fighting? True Love, Strong Hate and Harsh Revenge? A Giant, Lots of Bad Men, Lots of Good Men, plus Rodents of Unusual Size? Not to mention Death, Lies, Truth and Miracles? It's all here!Honestly? How could anyone turn that down?This isn't a story to take seriously. It isn't heavy literature to be discussed with a glass of port in one hand and your nose turned up in the air. It's a story that thrills and amuses, that has its moments of clarity and moments of confusion. It has everything my inner child craves in a book and it's for that reason it's on my yearly re-read list.If you haven't read The Princess Bride yet, I encourage you to do so - no I challenge you to. And I dare you not to like it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Length:: 1:57 MinsGood book, was better since I had seen the movie. Was a mix of a few genres of literature, so not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is my all-time favorite. It has every interesting theme available in less than 250 pages. I would recommend it to every person with a heart, sense of humor, and love of fantasy. It is a timeless classic, and one would have to be completely insane not to recognize it for what it is: an incredibly stupendous work of art!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you watched the movie, what you saw is what you'll get here. My kids (6 & 8, who have not seen the movie) loved my reading this to them until Westley gets captured by Humperdink. From that point they mostly lost interest, much as I did (with the movie anyway). Still, there are many humorous moments in the book and I found myself wanting to finish reading it (including all the asides by Morgenstern) on my own.For parents of younger children: This is not the easiest book to read outloud. There are many passages that roll of the tongue easily, but then you hit stretches that you simply stumble through. While Harry Potter has it's assortment of difficult to pronounce names, the narrative there otherwise seems to have been proof read aloud. This seems not to have been.For those parents concerned about language, violence and sexual content, this is a fairly tame offering for younger children."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Like I stated in the title, The Princess Bride is just one of those books that everyone should know about and should be assigned in high schools everywhere. I can't believe I was forced to read Great Expectations but not The Princess Bride. Sure, Dickens is a great writer and no, i'm not comparing the 2 books or authors, but this book is just SO GOOD. It should be required reading for all ages because I think different people can take such different stuff from it. Plus it has so many great examples of unique literary devices (i.e. the Morgenstern thing). The story is fantastically tongue-in-cheek, which I love. A lot of people I know have seen the movie and don't even know the book exists. I haven't seen the movie (yet) so I can't really compare the 2. However, if the movie is half as good as the book it'll be fantastic as well. Trust me, this book will make you want to watch the movie. The story is so compelling and funny there's no way anyone could be bored. As to the characters, they are just as intriguing. I fell completely in love with Fezzek, the giant who is not quite as much of a dunce as the other characters seem to believe. Anyway, the point is...read this book. I don't think too many will regret it.P.S. I noticed most of the 1-star reviews complain about the \\"abridgement\\" of Morgenstern's classic and how it should have been left the way it was. If you genuinely dislike the story/characters/writing/etc. then by all means write a 1-star review. But if you're giving the book 1-star with the main reason being Morgenstern was a better writer...please don't. It'll save you a lot of embarrassment."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Ahhh... the Princess Bride. A tale of true love and high adventure. The Princess Bride, written by S.

Morgenstern's true story of love and high adventure. Now, 25 years later, I have finally read the book. William Goldman does an excellent job of editing out the dry exposition about trees and musty dry politics and sticks with the swords and romance and humor. He also details some background information about his trip to Florin and the S. Morgenstern museum.The actual fabrication of these details and the earnestness with which he writes about them makes them believable and often had me scratching my head wondering. I imagine that Mr. Goldman had an enormously good time concocting his fictional life and details of S. Morgenstern.This book is funny!It is an easy read and has all the great elements of a great adventure. The addition of Buttercup's baby at the end was a wonderful surprise that left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A real \\"tale\\". Of love high adventure nonetheless!

The characters are comically drawn archetypes, the story is definitely &quot;true love and high adventure&quot; that will please readers from 12 to 120, and best of all, it has a wonderful sense of humor that had me laughing from page one. Talking about it makes me want to read it again. The movie had to leave out so much that was in the book, they are really two different stories, so don't use the movie as a standard to judge the book. It also makes a great read-aloud story to share with family."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I bought this book in a store in Perth, Australia when I was bored one day.

This is a book that must be read, and read often. Buy it when you're 12. Read it a few hundred times. Hang on to it so you can read it to your children in 20 years. But now that you've even looked at this page, you are doing yourself a GRAVE injustice if you fail to buy it. The themes are timeless.

This is a hilarious, incredibly entertaining book that you absolutely will keep reading. I have no patience with a lot of fantasy books-but this one is different. The interesting part about this book is that while you will love the story, the thing that really makes this book so incredibly is it's details. There are a thousand little side stories, a million little anecdotes, a billion little hilarious moments that make the book so incredible. It goes into every detail-you know in some books, how something interesting happens and you wish the author would expand it, but they just plod along with the not-so-interesting plot? This book refuses to do that. If you loved the movie, this is the ultimate tell-all book. You'll learn everything-about Buttercup's parents, kiss statistics, the motivation behind the torture machine, character backround stories in minute detail..honestly, half the book is dedicated to filling the gaps that the movie leaves. I have nothing but praise for this book-buy it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is easily one of my favorite works of all time. Goldman does a brilliant job. The characters are both fantastical yet altogether real. In many ways, the book surpasses the movie. No longer is Fezzik just a gentle giant, but you understand the loneliness of his existence and why he hooked up with the Vizinni. The in-depth background on Inigo's quest for revenge makes an already great character even better. In addition to the terrific characters, the book is downright funny. It's easy to see why the movie hews so closely to the novel's words. The end result is a a humourous, touching tale that should be on everyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book, and yes, it DID ruin my vision of the characters, but the book was still infinitely better than the movie.

She teaches Freshmen Honors English at a large public high school, and after she read my copy in under a week, she decided to add it to the reading list for her classes! I credit myself with inadvertently introducing scores of ninth graders to this wonderful book. It's intelligent, humorous, touching and lighthearted all at once. Do not hesitate to read this book! All of my friends who have read it and I have this circle of inside jokes from The Princess Bride. I've become friends with total strangers because one of us mentioned the title and the other's eyes lit up.

A few years ago I decided to read the book version, and it quickly became my favorite book. It is definitely better than the movie because although the movie is clever and magical, the book works within a frame that the movie could never. Not only is there much more detail that molds the plot and the characters, but the central theme of the book is different as well.This book is amazing in so many ways. It is the ultimate fairy tale: full of romance, action, revenge, adventure. But unlike most fairy tales it is never clich&eacute;. The true genius of the book is Goldman's ability to completely contrast reality with fantasy so that the reader fully appreciates the fairy-tale aspect. What would normally be expected is unexpected. The obvious becomes something to ponder on, the mundane becomes extraordinary, clich&eacute; becomes unique.Like I said I read the book a few years ago, and I've had the urge to read it again, only to realize that S. Morganstern and William Goldman are one in the same and the \\"abridged\\" version is the only version.

This is different than the movie, so don't expect a word-for-word printed version of the movie. The book does do a better job of fleshing out the characters.The book starts with an introduction meant to lead the reader into thinking this is an abridged version of the childhood story the author heard from his father. The book is full of parts that have been \\"cut\\" from the story for our reading enjoyment.

There's a certain weight taken off your shoulders when suddenly it's made clear in no uncertain terms that: Life Is Not Fair. It's not supposed to be. It's not meant to be. You can stop being disappointed by the steady stream of crap life throws at you, and embrace reality: Life Is Fundamentally Unjust. Any fairness you happen to come across is either accidental or a state that was fought for and hard-won, and transient (or bought). The stories lie. A gentler way to put that is that the stories are not true, they're fairy tales, illustrations of what might be or might have been or never will be - but the core of it is that the stories lie. The wrong people get married. The wrong people get the wrong jobs. The wrong people die.Fortunately, in Florin there are Miracle Men who can help with that.However, Miracle Men - and others - make mistakes. That's life.Purity and loss of innocence are deeply underscored in the novel. Where the film was mostly a marvelously fun comic fantasy, the book digs a bit deeper, bites a little harder. Don't worry - I'm not about to commit an attempt at literary exploration of the themes; I'll leave that for the experts. Where I can speak from authority is on my own experience. The movie never made me well up when the boy demands to know \\"Who gets Humperdinck?\\" To which the response is, of course, \\"Nobody.\\" It's like William Goldman's fictional(?) epiphany about life not, in fact, being fair. The incontrovertible fact that Prince Humperdinck richly deserves, in fact needs to be \\"got\\" does not, in fact, mean that he will be \\"got\\". Humiliated, beaten, stripped of the success of his plans and of some allies and of his prized Whites and so on, yes. Killed as he so richly deserves, which would be a satisfaction on a par to that felt when Count Rugen gets his? No. Sorry, kid. I really am sorry.Changing tacks: Fezzik in the book (not in the movie though) kept reminding me of someone, and it was after his reunion with Inigo that it struck me who that is. Fezzik is Pooh Bear. He is the self-proclaimed bear of very little brain, not learned or very quick thinking, but not ashamed of his lack, and possessed of an unexpected level of wisdom. (This would make Vizzini ... Rabbit, perhaps? And I think Inigo must be Christopher Robin. Humperdinck might be a Heffalump.)It would be very easy to render this review as a sort of left-handed compliment, to hold it up against the unimaginably wonderful movie it spawned and let it fade a bit in the comparison. But I am not left-handed, and, in the end, this retains its adoring five-star rating.I ramble on a bit more on my blog: [...]"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My book right arrived on time, and exactly as they said. (It said like new, and- it was like new!)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it, yet it was not a first edition. It was published in 2003. The first edition was published in 1973, a thirty year difference.It was an excellent copy of a third edition."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Im glad that I got a copy in such great shape, really really really great shape. really really really really happy"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Wow, where do I begin? Being a big fan of the movie and critical of adaptations, this book was as close to perfect as you could possibly get! I absolutely loved it! The movie stays very faithful to the book; and the book is purely awesome. The book even contained the aspect that the story was being read to a child by an adult. Goldman took it even a step further and created an entire storyline outside of the actual Princess Bride story. The whole idea of abridging the \\"original\\" story by Morgenstern was fictitious, but it had me believing it was the truth. It wasn't until after finishing the book, I looked it up on the internet and found out it was fake; it was all part of the story. Very creative, I must say.Aside from that, the main story of The Princess Bride was exciting, funny, and touching. The characters were deep, witty, and likable. It contained a great balance of romance, action, suspense, and witty humor. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll cherish the book. It gives greater detail and background to various characters not seen in the movie.This has undoubtedly become my favorite book by far. To think another story could outdo it is absolutely........INCONCEIVABLE!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read this book when I was ten, and then again the same year, twice when I was eleven, and again this year. I became entranced with it from the first page. It's one of those books where you never want it to end because it means that you'll have to say goodbye to all the characters that you know and love. It's one of those books where you you get so caught up in it, that nothing else matters, and you find yourself becoming one with the page, not seeing or hearing anything else around you. At least that's how I feel. It gets better each time I read it, and I know that I will many times in the future. If you read The Princess Bride as a child, it becomes a relic that induces nostalgia and a feeling of warmth and happiness, like saturday morning cartoons and Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. Perfect for rainy and sunny days alike, The Princess Bride is an unsung hero in the book world, the place it deserves being filled by the likes of Harry Potter. In short, this might be one of the best books you will read, or have read if you are as lucky as me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you are like me and saw the movie before reading the book, you will not be disappointed. Many times, if I see a movie before reading the book, I have a hard time appreciating the book. So I usually try to read the book and then watch the movie and if something goes wrong, I can blame the movie and not the original!The movie is very faithful to the book. I was surprised to find that the book includes all the little inserts you see in the movie between the boy and his relative. Of course, the book is a little funnier at times because you get the benefit of the author's commentary. It is easy to see why the movie was such a success from reading the book. Each character is as witty and absurd on paper as they are on film.There is also a bit which I love about how the author extended the reunion of Buttercup and Wesley but had to take it out because the publisher didn't think anyone would read it. Not all books can survive the intrusion of the author (even if the \\"author\\" is fictional), but The Princess Bride is all the better for it.It is comical, witty, and wildly entertaining. You'll probably read it straight through from beginning to end. I did!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I can say in all truth that this is the only book that has ever made me laugh out loud at least once in each chapter and made me cry right after. As said before by other readers, The Princess Bride truly has everything you could ask for. True, it doesn't have some deep, philisophical meaning to it, but that's what makes it great! In the book the writer first says that it was written after France, but before Europe, but after America. He is so obviously trying to make it known that his story isn't one of deep meaning or truth, but a lighthearted comedy with the most melodramatic and steryotypical characters he could think up! Anyone could argue that Westly and Buttercup's love isn't real, that they don't even know each other and fall in love after only kissing once. Well, no one ever said Snow White had heavy conversations and love making with her lil boyfriend, did they? The best part of the book is probably the author's commentary on the parts he edited out. &quot;If you ever suffer from insomnia, read this part of the book.&quot; or something like that, because it was so boring. So, if you're looking for a good-time, heart lifting, steryotypical fairy tale with a dash of sarcasm, The Princess Bride is for you!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"OK, 600 people have reviewed this book, so I humbly hope I have something new to say! Well, this guy's a genius: He plays with our heads by inserting the banal phony narrator/author S Morgenstern, through whom he earns the author's license to feed us his own \\"two cents\\", and also to play some clever author tricks--If I were to guess the point of all the twists in this book, it seems to be a wish to highlight the contrast that divides all people into roughly two camps--doers vs. watchers, back seat drivers vs. those at the wheel, reckless exhibitionists vs. the smug but hooked voyeurs who live vicariously through the doers' every dared move. Mr. Goldman doesn't get at all preachy, nor does he tell you which side he's on. He pokes fun at the excesses of each side's prototype players, by painting them as caricatures uttering banalities, or by describing their soul-searching when faced with a tough decision in a tone of exaggerated sympathy that manages humor, but oozes mischief. Yet his touch (which in other books he writes can reveal bitterness, or show hints at a dark side within), in this book remains light and playful. His characters may be ridiculed on one page, but on the next page receive his genuine respect and awe, morphing from fools to heroes. In fact, through most of this book Goldman shows such joy in taking his protagonists through his plot's wild ride, that he does not come through as a detached chronicler recounting the stumblings and foolhardiness of reckless dreamers, but as an author who does not pre-judge his heroes with knowing superiority, and does not even know how they'll turn out, but instead awaits for fate's verdict on the wisdom of the paths he sets. This stance by Goldman is what I think ices the smashing success of his plots--in his books and in his screenplays. In the Princess Bride, he devotes the entire book to this agnosticism about how one should choose in life between daring vs. doubt and fear, when there is no right answer in advance, and when the chosen path can lead to a life lived fully,to a crazy plunge to doom, or to a cowardly life of sitting on the sidelines as an armchair traveler, a dreary moral judge who is the master of 20/20 hindsights, while secretly addicted to, and getting off on, the thrills of the voyeur. This book is a parody on this tension in life, rendered masterfully, with humor and suspense, breeziness and dead seriousness--perhaps because Goldman himself is waiting to see how it turns out."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am not going to be melodramatic. Honest to goodness. But The Princess Bride... oh man. The Princess Bride has changed my life.My mother was a PB junkie to begin with. I grew up watching the movie. I loved the setting, storyline, clothes, speech, absolutely everything. But this *isn't* a review for the movie.When I grew older, the movie hardly quenched my thirst. My mom told me there was a book that the movie originated from. I about died and went to heaven.The public library didn't have it-- The school library didn't have it-- I didn't have it.So for awhile, I forgot about it.Until one day in the 8th grade when my Creative Writing teacher was absent and made us watch the movie. And then it all came back to me.I went to the public library and rented the movie every Wednesday. I become friends with one of the librarians who had OC-Princess Bride. It was a sad, sad world.Until Christmas of 9th grade- I got the book!I read it in 3 hours. Then read it again. I cannot explain to you how much I loved it. It was absoultely perfect. It had everything the movie had plus a little more depth on the history of the characters and what went on during the scenes.It was heaven. The line delivery- clever. The context- unforgettable. The characters- lifelike. William Goldman created a masterpiece when he wrote this. And the fact that he was &quot;taking&quot; it from S. Morgenstern's &quot;classic&quot; made it all the more enjoyable, and showed he was truly a talented writer.. for awhile I believed it!For those who wonder why the movie is different from the book, I don't know what to say. William Goldman wrote the book. William Goldman wrote the screenplay for the movie.If he truly felt that the Pit of Despair would have been more suitable for movie conditions- all the power to him!Those who pass up the chance of reading this novel are missing something.They're missing a classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read several reviews on this site taking Mr. Goldman to task for editing S. Morgenstern's classic, The Princess Bride. Please allow me to set the record straight.S. Morgenstern is a distant relation of mine. It had been very difficult in my early years, trying to explain to others about my Florinese heritage, when Florin is so little known and almost never taught in school (just try to search for it on the web--shameful--there's even a fringe group that claims Florin never existed at all)! Thankfully, all of that changed when Goldman wrote his book and even moreso with the release of the delightful film version in 87. Now, I have something to refer to, and even more than that, a family legacy to really be proud of. I am certain that Gilder-Americans feel much the same way, no matter how their anti-defamation league has taken Goldman, et al, to task over their supposed \\"racist portrayal.\\"You see, I have one of the few extant copies of the original Princess Bride, all leather-bound, gilded, thousand pages of it. And it is dull. I mean, DULL. My mother had to prod me for years before I finally read the thing through. Goldman did the world a favor by abridging it into such a wonderful novel (the Florinese are not known for their brevity) and my family a tremendous favor by giving fame to my ancestor that he does not, honestly, quite deserve.People have asked me before whether I intend on ever suing for any share of the proceeds of the book or movie. Again, I'd like to clear the air by saying that Mr. Goldman tracked my parents down quite some time ago and made arrangments with them prior to the release of the novel. Mr. Goldman didn't want that made public; I hope that he will overlook my disclosure because I just want the Goldman-bashing to stop.So, to all of those who've enjoyed this abridgment, I thank you as a scion of S. Morgenstern, but direct you to thank William Goldman all the more. For those who cry injustice at his abridgment, I ask you to stop: it's better this way. Believe me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"OK, first I'm going to get the review part out of the way, and then enlighten some of you other reviewers to something truly astounding that just possibly might have slipped your notice. So. The review.This is just about the best book I have ever read. I've had the film memorized since I was four years old, and it was always the movie of choice in our household. Then, when I was 12, my mom bought me the book. I didn't think it could be any better than the movie. I was wrong. Of the two, the book is definitely my favorite (Though the movie is still in my top five all time classics list!) There's a lot more straight out hilarious humour in the book. The funnies are of a whole different sort than the movie, but that's part of what makes it work so well. Goldman's elaborate &quot;Morgenstern pretense&quot; coupled with a few fantastic sections on his home life, fat son, shrink wife, ever changing maid (all of which is made up, by the way) make it even more wonderful.These pretenses bring me to the real shocker which many of you seem never to have grasped. *DRUM ROLL* S. MORGENSTERN DOES NOT EXIST! Yes, I can hear you gasping. I can imagine some of you falling over in a dead faint. It's going to be all right. It was just an enormously clever and totally entertaining self promotion plot on the part of Goldman. (You have to admit, it was genius.) Oh, and by the by, Buttercup's Baby? Well, it doesn't exist either. Oh, sure, you say, what about the excerpt? It was right there! In the back of the book. Yeah. That's all Goldman ever got around to. One measly little chapter, which is the great tragedy where all us Princess Bride-a-holics are concerned.But even without the added pleasure a sequel would bring, this book is the best. In the world. To this date. So read it! And for all of you gullibles out there, repeat after me: There is no S. Morgenstern, the is no S. Morgenstern, there is no S. Mor.... *FADE TO BLACK*"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Let me set one thing straight right away for people who are about to buy this. There is no S. Morgenstern. William Goldman made him up for this book. He does a really good job of trying to make you think there is. There was never any country called Florin as far as I know, so there can't be a Florinese writer, and the writing style sounds too much like Goldman's. So you don't have to worry about buying the original instead of abridged version. I thought this book was very funny, it even made me laugh out loud sometimes, which is rare. It certainly could have done without the occasional sexist remarks, though. The story probably wouldn't have been that good without the humor, but I like how he makes a point about old classics which could have been good adventure stories without all the long descriptions of politics or other things that don't add anything to the story. I would recommend borrowing it from the library. Make sure you see the movie, too. It doesn't spoil the book since the main thing is the humor, and it lets you get ideas of what the scenes and characters look like. It is for ages 12 and up. The descriptions of torture would give nightmares to younger readers. I am 14."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First of all, this book isn't really about a princess and a pirate and giant rats. That story is in there, but the book is really about the italics. It's a satire and a well written spoof. My daughter sat down one afternoon and a couple of hours later set the book aside and declared she was finished; that the book was really kind of silly and boring. \\"No way!\\" was my response, \\"Did you read the italics?\\". She had not and she had missed the whole point of the book. She picked up the book and read it again, this time with the italics. I heard frequent giggles, snorts and all out guffaws. The \\"story\\" is just what you see in the movie; cute, fun and plenty of adventure. The italics show you how brilliant William Goldman is in creating an abridged version of a book that never existed.This book was my selection for the monthly reading in my book club and we had a great time discussing this book and everyone's reaction to the story. Many of the people in the club had to Google William Goldman and S. Morgenstern and still could believe it was \\"ALL\\" fiction.If you want to read an incredibly well written spoof on a historical book that never really existed, read this one. If you want to read a fairytale about giant rats and princesses being rescued, check out the children's section."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"With over 500 reviews already on the board, there is probably very little to be added in praise for this wonderful book, so I will try and keep it short.This is one of the ten best books written in the twentieth century. You may think such a brash and monumental statement to be somewhat inconceivable, but it is true. There have been few books better in the last hundred years.This book has one of the best plot devices ever conceived (an abridgment of an older, and entirely fictitious, work allowing the author to interject himself into the story at will), one of the best romantic speeches ever written (Buttercup to Westley pgs. 51-52), one of the best and cathartic action sequences ever penned (Inigo vs. Count Rugen with that amazing &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya...&quot; line for punctuation), one of the best concluding lines of any novel ever (I'm not giving it away...you'll have to get to it for yourself) and, finally, one of the most quotable and heartrendingly true quotes ever put down on paper, &quot;Life is pain, anybody that says differently is selling something.&quot; (Spoken by Westley to Buttercup in the movie, but by Fezzik's mother to her gigantic son in the book).Somewhere along the way we all grow up and lose that innocence childhood affords. The myths give way to harsh reality and the fantasy is buried by the real world. The genius of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is in acknowledging this fact rather than glossing over it and moving on through to the other side. And it does so in such an engaging and entertaining way that a little bit of that wonder is returned, even in the midst of the darkest fire swamp. So if you, like many of your fellow wanderers on this earth, find yourself mostly dead, you owe it to yourself to read or re-read this marvel of modern literature and regain a little spark of laughter and life so precious in these precarious times.As a last note, the 25th anniversary book contains new material that you missed the first time around and is just as sensational as the original book itself.Like I said in the opening, one of the ten best books...And I Mean It..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my sister and I ended up reading it before I gave it to her. All I can say is that it was the most fun I have ever had reading a book in my entire life."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First The Princess Bride is a great book.One of the things people don't realize is how sarcastic Goldman really is. It's wonderful.Have you ever tried to find the Original book by S. Morgenstern written in the 1600s? S. Morgenstern doesn't exist. Neither does the original The Princess Bride.(These points won't mean anything to anyone that hasn't read the book) William wrote the whole book, the first and only one. He made the book to seem like he is just Rewriting this Classic. His father is not from Florin, because Florin doesn't exist on any map except in the book. His father didn't read this book to his went he was a kid, because the book didn't exist. So, basically most of his personal intro of the book is just made-up.And all throughout the book, (he talks within parentheses, expressing his thoughts and concepts about the book). When all the time he just talking about his own book that he is writing. Often he will say what an amazing writer that S. Morgenstern is, when all the time he just talking about his own writing. Also, he says the original has 43 pages about the current hat styles but that he is going to skip them to get on with the action. He just made that up.Isn't it great!Goldman is a very intelligent writer and just as funny and humorous. Once I realized that that S. Morgenstern never existed, I found the book more enjoyable. You saw all the inside jokes that Goldman made for himself and the readers that \\"got it.\\"One point I want to make it that Goldman is often more than he seems. He has a great, sarcastic sense of humor. I have never laughed so long and hard reading a book as I did read the Princess Bride. Sometimes when he says something, he's just making it up. It's his book... why not? His writing style is constant no-stop creativity.Definitely read it. And Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read this book in 1979, long before the movie was made. Goldman's treatment of this novel elevated the genre of fairy tale to a whole new level. He wrote as though Morgenstern was the true genius who penned Princess Bride and made the reader feel like they were peeking over Goldman's shoulders and reliving a real piece of his life. It would seem he believed (incorrectly at times, judging by some of the reviews I've read here) that readers would have enough intelligence to figure out this was all one big brilliant fantasy.While the movie is cute enough (and certainly not one of my favorites), it is a mere skeleton compared to all the hilarious and ingenius details in the book. Buttercup's parents arguments alone are worth the price of the book. Goldman's rant, in a straight face, about Morgentern's inconclusive ending, as well as his other comments on the supposedly real book make this novel a gem.To start off, Buttercup didn't simply become a beauty overnight and wowed Humperdinck. In the book, you get to find out how she went from not getting baths to become the #1 beauty in the land, how she caught the attention of Humperdinck's right hand man, Inigo and Fessik's sad pasts, and how Buttercup and Wesley don't actually live happily ever after.(I apologize for any misspelled names since it's been about a decade since I last read the book)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"To all of the people who feel that there is too much personal information in the book this is for you. There is no S Morgenstern. It's not real. It's all made up! Helen his wife, Jason his kid, they don't really exist. Most of the legal wrangling stuff never happened. Now that you know that, go back and read the book and all the little edits and realize- \\"Wow, William Goldman made them all up!\\" I have a lot of respect for him for all of the little points, so to all of you who say he should keep his personal life out of the story- It's not real! It's all a Story!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was written, in whole, by William Goldman. There was no &quot;original&quot; to abridge. That, my friends, is pure writing genius. Writing an abridgement in which the abridgement is the actual book. Who else would have thought to write that? The man is a Genius. *not to mention his amazing writing abililites*"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life. I spent most of my formative years playing &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; with my siblings after we watched the movie, but there was always something missing. I found that the book was a magical experience and though I have seen the movie innumerable times, I still found the book to be suprising and wondrous. And Kathy_J, as much as I would be interested in seeing an unabridged version of this story, there is none! It's all a facade, brilliantly carried out might I add."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Even if you are unfamiliar with the Robin Wright / Cary Elwes movie of this classic tale, then you will be surprised by the brilliance of the story. William Goldman claims that he was read this book as a child by his father, but I have reason to doubt this after having read the book and examined the evidence. There are several contradictory statements in his &quot;autobiographical&quot; introduction, which may cause you to doubt his word, and searching for an unedited version of the supposed Morgenstern original may drive you mad as it does not seem to exist. This aside, whether you find beautiful princesses, fairy tale romances, poisonous exchanges, mad Sicilians, giants who used to be unemployed in Greenland, sword wielding Spaniards with grudges to settle, giant rodents, evil (Iago could take pointers from this guy) princes, albinos, miracle healers, pirates, sword fights, insanely good jokes, the best theory on life that you will ever find, or just mysterious men in black masks interesting you will find this book to be remarkable. It will have you in stitches, in horror, turning page after page, desperate to find out what happens next, and in thrall. There has rarely been an adventure story better written or one that appeals to a wider audience. Eat your heart out, Rob Reiner. You still can't touch the original for sheer style."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"And no, the movie ISN'T better (although it comes awfully close). The simple fact of the matter is that William Goldman wrote an amazing book. It is cleverly written (the whole S. Morgenstern thing itself is a crack-up) and made me laugh out loud as I read it. This book has everything: comedy, romance, adventure, true love, etc. I can't say enough good things about The Princess Bride. Just read it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"All right, as most others who have made comments have noted, there is NO S. Morgenstern. Several comments below speak of Morgenstern as if he were real, and indicate disappointment (or worse) in Goldman because of his adaptation. Personally I think those commentors were also kidding and playing along with Goldman's running joke. Laugh, and pretend to be indignant with 'em.This book has everything you ever wanted in a fairy tale, is eminently quotable, and I guarantee you will laugh long and hard. The movie is as worthy a screen adaptation as there ever was, with only the exception of The Godfather Saga. Read it, see it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book goes under the guise of being a revision of a &quot;S Morgenstern&quot; tale. It is in fact a cleverly written first-generation book. It is an engaging, amusing, and delightful read! I recommend both reading the book AND seeing the movie (&quot;The Princess Bride&quot;)- the book goes into detail about the lives of each of the movie characters, and the movie &quot;fleshes out&quot; the book characters."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride novel and movie go hand in hand more closely than any other combination I have read/seen. Lucky for the audience, both are excellent. Also lucky for anyone who reads the book after having seen the movie, the former explores the characters, landscape, and history (e.g., of Guilder and Florin) much more deeply, and can afford to give insight into plot twists and turns that the film wasn't completely able to do. In fact, I finished this book with a greater appreciation of the movie, and a better understanding about a piece of dialogue here or a reference there.Of particular interest and amusement were the rich descriptions of the backgrounds of the villains who kidnap Buttercup and are pursued by the Man in Black: Fezzik the giant was forced into professional wrestling by his Turkish parents despite his aversion to violence, and he had a penchant for rhyming games which was developed as a mechanism to cope with his troubles; Inigo the Spaniard was hellbent on avenging his father, who dedicated his life and sanity to crafting the world's most perfect sword, only to be snubbed and then slain by his customer, the Six Fingered Man. Also noteworthy and absent from the movie are such elements as the Prince Humperdinck's Zoo of Death, and the tempestuousness of the relationship between Buttercup and Wesley (for Buttercup matured and became a lady during the course of the book, but was not without a bratty stage or two along the way).Best of all, perhaps, was the alleged editing and abridging job that Goldman did on the S. Morgenstern text. Believe what you will about whether or not there was such a beast as S. Morgenstern, whose tale is described by Goldman as a wry commentary on Guilder and Florin customs and history; that there is a debate at all, even a silly one, is testament to the spirit of fantasy this book creates. Goldman's narratives and musings that interpolate the text are welcome interruptions, not to mention funny contributions to \\"the story overlying the story.\\" The very concept of weaving a fictional abridgement into a stellar fictional tale is brilliant, especially doing so without derailing or distracting the audience."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"We recommend this book to any adult with a craving to venture into their imagination, and at the same time looking for humor in an unorthodox fairy tale. Although there are few distasteful aspects of The Princess Bride, our love for this story exceedingly outweighs any bad feelings towards Goldman's work. Our only negative view of this book is what we can only describe as \\"over-characterization.\\" Goldman sometimes developed his characters too fully. He produced such a vivid description of his characters that sometimes it is hard for one to use his own imagination. Although, for most readers, Goldman's ability to produce these vivid descriptions would probably be greatly appreciated! Other than over development of some characters, the book had all excellent qualities. Besides those few instances, Goldman's character development was superb. At one point, Goldman provided short side stories about each of the characters background and about how they became acquainted with the criminal mastermind Vizzini. The author also produced a vivid image of Buttercup's physical beauty, by describing all of the prettiest women before her, leading up to her life. Besides Goldman's in depth character description, he also had a great writing style. The author made it seem like he was editing an abridgment, not in truth actually writing a story. Throughout the novel, Goldman says things like how it took the Countess days to pack and Buttercup years to train in the \\"original copy\\" however he edited those things out. He also alluded many times to when his father read him the story when he was a child with pneumonia, how he got upset when his father quit reading, but this was impossible since Goldman wrote the book as an adult! Nonetheless, Goldman's comments throughout story are truly believable. The book also carries universal themes to be carried throughout the ages. He comes right out and says he wants people to learn that life is not fair. He also, not as directly, implies that unexpected things happen to good people and because of these unexpected happenings, things do not always go as planned. Goldman was also creative with his writing style. When Inigo was to get revenge against the Count, he did not just kill the royal man, he cut out his heart piece by piece until the Count died of horror, a truly unique idea. Goldman also did not add a traditional fairy tale ending when concluding his story. He wrote that things should have gone happily ever after, but they did not because of little mishaps along their route to escape. This separated the fairy from the rest. Overall, this book was a great piece of literature that was quite enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"So begins William Goldman's introduction to his fantasy classic. (It really is his; there is no Morgenstern, don't let him fool you.) This is and always will be, to me, THE book. I can open it to any page, read one line, and immediately be able to quote the next three. I don't know if I still could, but there was a time when I could recite the entire first chapter from memory. Farmer's daughter Buttercup, after tormenting him for over ten years, realizes she is in love with Westley, the stablehand. Fortunately, in spite of her horrible treatment, he loves her back, and so leaves to earn a fortune in America (this was after America) so they can afford to marry. Along the way, he's captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup, meanwhile, is the most beautiful girl in the world, and so is chosen by Prince Humperdinck to be his wife. But on their formal engagement day, she's kidnapped by three strange men. Who hired the kidnappers? Who is the mysterious man in black following them? Why is true love better than everything except cough drops? You'll have to read to find out!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book to death. I owned the movie and decided to read the book. I read it in one weekend and that's unusual for me when I put off homework, TV, computer, everything! I just wanted to read the book. Ask my family, they hated me the whole weekend beacause of my dazed state. Even when I was forced to do anything besides read it, I only half did it, because I was too into the book to stop thinking about it. This book has everything you need to stimulate the brain: adventure, love, excitement, humor, you name it! I myself fell in love with Westley after the first few pages. You feel what they feel...and it's wonderful."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you have not watched this movie yet, DO IT NOW! :) It is one of the best romantic comedies you will ever watch. I must admit more of an attachment to the movie (now available on VHS or DVD) that was based on this story (you can't beat Billy Crystal, Robin Wright, Cary Elwes and Rob Reiner directing). It is definitely a new fairy tale classic!The book is a little hard to get used to since it is written as if William Goldman translated a book by S. Morgenstern (which is all fabricated). It even has a &quot;preview&quot; of his upcoming novel about Buttercup's baby ... just don't expect it in the stores anytime soon. ;) Still, it is definately an interesting and gripping way to tell a story Plus, it has got everything in it that you could ever want ... romance, humor, rhymes, villians, miracles, giants, wit, heros, heroines and more!The only reason I gave it four stars is because I loved the movie so much that no matter how good the book is ... it just doesn't compare to the movie.Don't forget to pick up the CD as well!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's me again. I wanted to defend the book from a few accusations that seem to have popped up. The introduction has offended some people since they believe Goldman is insulting his family. Actually, I think he was writing about an &quot;alternate&quot; version of himself. I read on the jacket of another of his novels that he has two girls, not a boy. So, he was making up his family life in this book. Think about it, I mean, don't you think his wife would read the book her husband published. The whole thing is part of the gimmick.As I said before, this book is more than likley a spoof of the notoriously wordy historical novelists, that is the point of the &quot;abridgement. Or, perhaps the author just wanted to write a silly story. Either way, the book is fun. There is no point in complaining about the &quot;abridgement&quot; and if the introduction is not to one's taste, then it can be easily skipped. It doesn't make much sense until after you've read the story anyway.Great book, read, enjoy"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"\\"I love you,\\" Buttercup said. \\"I know this must come as something of a surprise, since all I've ever done is scorn you and degrade you and taunt you, but I have loved you for several hours now, and every second, more.\\"Everyone has seen the movie The Princess Bride, and the book version sat on my shelf for about six years before I actually got around to it. I guess I expected I wasn't going to enjoy it as much as the movie - and I was correct.The movie is no masterpiece, but who didn't watch it a few hundred times back around 1987? My 1987 self thought Westley was perfect, and Buttercup was perfect, and their romance was perfect, and everything about the story was perfect. Many of the scenes and dialogue of the movie are lifted directly from the book.It's just that I think it works a whole lot better on the screen than on the page.This is a weirdly disjointed book. The author keeps butting in to tell a story about how he first heard the fairytale, and about how it got published. He's going for a tale within the tale and pretending it's all true. I think it's supposed to be funny, but I certainly couldn't agree. When the author's not intruding on the story (The Boy being told the fairytale worked much better on the screen), we're drifting off for long periods of time in order get the secondary characters' long-winded backstories.When we're not being interrupted, we get the adult fairytale you'd expect. I think the book is a little less child-friendly than I anticipated.Peasant girl Buttercup is growing into the most beautiful woman in the world (she is, naturally, a fool). She's completely clueless to the world around her until a countess makes a move on the farm boy, Westley (who's a bit of a [...]). Buttercup has a big revelation that she loves Westley, she tells him, and he packs up his things and goes across the sea to make his fortune.However pirates attack Westley's ship and Buttercup hears the news that he is dead. Prince Humperdinck asks Buttercup to marry him, she agrees, and then Westley returns. Now though, he's the Dread Pirate Roberts and turns up just in time to rescue Princess Buttercup from a bunch of assassins. And so on. And so on.I do understand that this book is something of a parody of fairytales. The heroine is beautiful and stupid and the hero is a complete [...] who is forgiven for anything and everything because he's handsome and good at everything he does. It definitely got a few smiles out of me.It's just that I didn't love it. I've always had a problem with the scene in the movie where Westley almost backhands Buttercup for not understanding how much he loves her (because nothing says, \\"I love you,\\" like a slap in the face). But the original scene in the book is worse:\\"I have loved more deeply than a killer like you can possibly imagine.\\"He slapped her.\\"That is the penalty for lying, Highness. Where I come from, when a woman lies she is reprimanded.\\"\\"But I spoke the truth, I did, I-\\" Buttercup saw his hand rise a second time, so she stopped quickly, fell dead silent.Westley is plenty furious that after years of mourning her dead lover, Buttercup has agreed to marry. But apparently he can and will do whatever he wants. His explanation for years of sex with wenches the world over - knowing full well Buttercup isn't dead - is, \\"things happened\\".I'm on Buttercup's side on this. I mean, five years and the guy couldn't pick up a pen (er, quill) and paper?! I really do get that no pirate is going to be celibate or anything, but it was all these little things that made Westley nothing more than an arrogant jerk.I guess the moral of the story is that some things are better left to happy memories of twenty-three years ago. If the book had been less disjointed; if the characters weren't quite so awful; hmmm, well there's a good story in there - it was extracted for the movie - but there's just too much not to like about this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride by William Goldman is okay though personally I think think the movie is better.BTW: I think it is totally hilarious that so many reviewers think that there really is an S. Morgenstern and don't understand that it was all created by William Goldman and that S. Morgernstern is not a real person.I will probably get unhelpful votes and called a liar like everyone else who has tried to educate people that S. Morgernstern is not real but oh well, whatever!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I listened to the audio book recording of William Goldman's The Princess Bride and while I think the story itself is good I think the audio recording was awful! The man who did the reading did okay with the male voices but the female characters like Buttercup sounded harsh. Buttercup sounded like an old man trying to clear phlem out of his throat!I would advise people to read the paperback or hardcover book editions instead of listening to this horrible audio recording!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is probably a shocking thing to say, but if you would like to know the story, then get the movie, not the book. As Goldman did the script for the movie, the book and the movie are just about identical. There are some differences of course, but the movie is really better.Why?Goldman pretends he is abridging some work by Morgenstern who is actually fictional. This IS the book. The thing is, Goldman continuously breaks up the story with a load of crap writing. In the movie, it was a bit charming when the boy interrupts the grandfather. In the book, it is like someone is hitting you in the face with the rotting flesh of a large buffalo and it absolutely sucks. Plus, the first 10% or so of the book is Goldman spouting off about nothing. As I was reading it in the kindle, and watching the progress bar tick past 7% of the most mindnumbingly boring garbage I've read all year, I actually started to worry that the entire book would be nothing but this. Had I downloaded the wrong thing?I've read the Princess Bride before but with actual paper. The benefit, and probably why I forgot about Goldman's Mr. Hyde breaking in and ruining a good story, is that with a paper book one can flip the pages a lot faster, rip them out, and burn them. The Kindle does not offer this ability and that is too bad.So if you have seen the movie, then great, you do not need this book.Now, the story part, when Goldman pops some writer's strength immodium pills, is excellent. Witty and quickly passed with a great plot and memmorable characters and places. So if don't have a DVD player with TV, then by all means, buy this book. The moment you see a big section of italics, start hitting that Next Page button as if your life depends on it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Buttercup falls madly in love with the farm boy, Westley. He travels to America to seek their fortune. Before he gets to America, he is captured and killed by pirates. When Buttercup hears of his death, she vows never to love anyone other than Westley again. Against her will, Buttercup is forced to marry Prince Humperdinck. She is kidnapped by a giant Turk, a Sicilian and a Spaniard. There is a mysterious man in black following Buttercup and her capturers. Little does she know the man in black is her one true love coming to whisk her away from Prince Humperdinck. When Prince Humperdinck hears that Buttercup's long lost love has rescued her, he sets out to kill him, potentially ruining Buttercup's happily ever after.If you are looking for an adventurous, dangerous, high risk tale of true love, \\"The Princess Bride\\" is definitely the book. The novel involves intense situations of fencing, fighting, kidnapping and wit. A clever twist is used by the author who pens himself under the name \\"S. Morgenstern\\", a fictitious narrator. This book has the perfect balance of intense adventure and romance in its' whimsical plot. The novel includes life like characters, a touch of humor, and a happily ever after ending. It is no wonder Goldman's \\"The Princess Bride\\" has become of the most popular novels this century."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I absolutely love this book, and Amazon did an excellent job with the kindle edition.

I found it after reading another great Goldman book, Boys and Girls Together. I thought that was one great book. Goldman's classic tale of love is wonderful. I have the movie (what fan doesn't) but I prefer the book to the movie. The writing is so vivid, the zoo of death in particular. I also loved the way Goldman fills in the character background. Indigo's boyhood is so vital to explainig his quest for revenge. There was one scene in the movie that was better than the book and that was the Miracle Max scene. Billy Crystal was great. If you like this book try another Goldman. I recommend Boys and Girls Together ( maybe they will reprint if enough people ask), Magic, Tinsel, and of course Marathon man and it's sequel Brothers. Goldman is truly a talented writer. I have loved to read anything by him."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of those books that draws you in so deeply you find yourself pushing it away from you muttering loudly &quot;HOW could that evil person do that?

I am going to go crazy if they don't publish ALL of Buttercup's Baby soon!

I have read the book countless times in one year. I first read it last year when i was in 8th grade. my reading teacher flat out told us on the first day and almost every day after that:There is no such man S. Morgenstern.There is probably a man named that, but he did not write the Princess bride. S. Morgenstern is only a creation of William Goldman. Goldman simply made him up to make the story more interesting (which it did).And, by the way i always get a kick out of reading the comments from the weird psychotic people that actually think that there actually lived an S.morgenstern that wrote The Princess Bride. I love the comments:&quot;shame on you Mr Goldman for messing up morgensterns book,&quot;&quot;im gonna sue you!&quot;&quot;the original was much better&quot;&quot;Shameless profit taking and pablumization.&quot;&quot;I liked the real book, but the abridgement leaves stuff out. &quot;&quot;William Goldman's destruction of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;Haahahahheheee!

The first time I read it, I fell down laughing. The title does not adaquetly describe the book, although the back cover does try to remedy this. It is not so much a story about true love between Westley and Buttercup and the evil villain Prince Humperdink (what names!) as it is a catalogue of the rediculous held together by a stereotyped romantic drivel storyline. For me, the story line is carried along by the humor inherent in the novel. Situations are rediculous, people experiance impossible odds and miraculous saves, only to emerge victorious.

I first read this book in my youth, when it was initially released. I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (screenplay by Goldman), and needed a good read. I got it. I have reread it and loaned it out so many times that my old first issue finally wore out. So I ordered a new one to share with my kids. Buttercup, Wesley, Inigo, Fezzik and Vizzini are memorable, each with his or her own story. A great book to read to kids, too."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As much as I loved the movie, I loved this book more.

It is, I think, the funniest book ever written, and Goldman has managed to capture the essence of true fantasy.

Really, one of the best books ever."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. I had seen the film several times and had heard that the book was good also. I wasn't disappointed. The film was pretty much lifted directly out of the book with little change. A few minor events or lines is transposed on occasion but most of the script is word for word. Also, this book has some added insight and commentary. A quick, and good, read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book really made me think there was a country called Guilder and a country called Florin, even though I knew there wasn't.

The movie really is a tale of fencing, fighting, love, torture, courage, cowards and heroes.BUT . . then I read this book. My main emotion on finishing it was \\"Yuck!\\" Morgenstern's characters are unstable and timid; Wesley is portrayed as the village idiot, and Buttercup is scarcely more intelligent. The whole story is, well, gross. Not in a Lord-of-the-Rings forces of darkness way, more in a little-kid's-nightmare way. If you liked the movie because it is a ripping yarn, a fun good old-fashioned story of true love and high adventure, don't read this book.That's just Morgenstern's text, though. William Goldman . . all throughout the book, the story is interrupted by long, pointless stories about his dysfunctional family, obese son and personal insecurites. At the bleak and foreboding conclusion, he closes with a lot of shallow and rambling philosophy on life and injustice.So, if you enjoyed the movie and want the other side of the story, ye be fairly warned."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The movie \\"The Princess Bride\\" is a glorious adventure of love and hatred, passion and revenge, and the devotion to them that brings happiness a superb romantic tale, beautifully filmed with lovely settings. The screenplay was occasionally confusing because of unintelligible references. (The drunken Spaniard's anomalous line \\"back to the beginning; I am waiting for Vizzini\\", the sudden appearance of a holocaust cloak at the crucial moment, the albino's wheelbarrow [\\"over the albino, I think\\" but it never was], and the convenient, but meaningless, introduction of four white horses at the very end, all hang in the air.) Goldman's screenwriting is not all brilliance.The only thing to be said for the book is that the anomalies in the film are explained in it. Everything else is total confusion. Goldman invents a spurious author for the book, H. Morgenstern, and a spurious Morgenstern museum, in a spurious country (Florin), with a spurious language (\\"Florinese\\"), and gives himself a troublesome wife and child (which he never had in reality), and ridicules them all on every annoying interpolation of them into the tale. The story is bracketed by prefaces to editions that never existed, and interrupted by explanations of cuts made from a novel that never was, all intended to keep the reader mentally off-base. It all makes the story look silly, Morgenstern verbose and boring, the museum curators gratuitously snotty, Goldman's family annoying, and Goldman himself seem a self-absorbed, super-annuated cynic. Many writers have invented fictional sources for their fictional tales (Tolkien's \\"Red Book of Westmarch, for instance), but you always know when their tongue is in their cheek; Goldman's slips in and out so subtly you never know where you are. (This will happen when you give someone the raspberry.) And the switches are obviously a deliberate attempt to deceive the reader. Fiction may not be literal truth, but it is not deliberate deception either. This book is. It is literary fraud.Why did he do this ?First, Goldman seems to get an ego trip by playing with his audience's heads. Most of the people who posted five-star reviews on this website appartently had no idea they had been gulled, and I suppose Goldman sits back in his overstuffed chair giggling at how clever he was to dupe the people who paid him so much money. Obviously, his is an ego that needs some boosting, and Goldman must find it where he can.More important, I think, he felt he had to save face. For the film, he had composed an enthralling story of love and revenge, and people might think he was (God forbid!) a Romantic himself. So unsophisticated! and in the 1970s yet! So when it came to making a book from the film, he invented a fictitious author (modelled, obviously, on writers like Scott and Dumas), and a \\"real world\\" life of his own, and larded his heroic story with cheap shots at his straw men, with the dialog dumbed down to show he is a folksey guy and the romanticism slandered to show he is culturally up-to-date.He used his own beautiful romantic story to lampoon the very romanticism that allowed him to tell it and sell it, and to denigrate the people who loved it. If he had a microgram of intellectual integrity, he would have written either a straightforward book for the millions who loved the movie (instead of trying to undercut their positive emotional response to it), or else a straightforward exposition of his own views on romanticism. But his lampoon is despicable.We all appreciate love and courage and devotion and gallantry. We may not always find ourselves doing it, but we always find ourselves respecting it when we see it. We do see it, sometimes, in a book or film, and perhaps occasionally in the real world which is a good thing, because there's a little Buttercup-seed in us all, and it needs all the water it can get. We would like to be better people than we are, and seize any model we find. This is not something to sneer at or make fun of!In the movie, Goldman gave the seed water; in the book, weed-killer.But poor Goldman. The water worked and the weed-killer didn't. The American public will forever love his romantic movie, but the only ones who praise his anti-Romantic book are the ones who missed the point. The cynicism of his hypocritical book was intended to kill the romanticism roused by his movie, but the book was slain instead. But you cannot kill the movie \\"not with a thousand spears!\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring i almost fell asleep"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a terrible book because it has no point!

I love the little side stories about Inigo and Fezzik, especially Inigo, and I think Buttercup is awesome and just one of those girl power girls.Everyone should read this book, and both kids and adults (I was nine when I first read it). It's great! My English teacher said she thought it sounded like some cheesy Disney story, but really it's a modern story set in ancient times. The characters were really realistic to me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A fairy tale which imposes its self upon wit's front door."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Read it in a one day, the last time I read it. I try to pick it up at least once a year because of its infatuating quality."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a book everyone can enjoy It has Action, love, and is just a great book. I hope everyone will read it!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I think that this book is excellent. In the movie the left out the best part; when Buttercup and Westley start falling in love and when Count Rugen comes to the farm house. I love the part where Buttercup goes to Westley's hut and tells him that she really loves him. This is the best book that I have ever read!! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I keep reading it over and over and now I know some of my favorite lines by heart. If you haven't read this book then you have no idea what is missing. I am so glad that I got this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a wonderful read. It has everything: Fighting, fencing, true love, economic allegory, strong hate, the whole bit. I cannot take credit for realizing that this was a great allegory. However, once I read that it was an allegory advocating laissez faire, everything seemed to make sense. There are numerous references to different types of money throughout the book. There are remarkable parallels between the introduction and the story itself. This is a great book that can be read on many different levels. Better than the movie, too."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is the best I have ever read! The movie was great and the book just enhances your knowledge! I loved it!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. I first discovered this book while in junior high. I had seen the movie numerous times, and was curious for more. Although I have had the book for about 8 years, I didn't first read it until two years ago. Boy what did I miss. It has everything in a fantasy novel you need; magic, sword-play, women, death, pirates, satire, and applys to all ages any time. I too was disapointed to find out that Morgenstern never exsisted, but, it's obvious if you think about it. Have you ever heard of a Florinese scholar? Also, am I the only one curious to know more about characters like Vizzini or Rugen? or a descriptions of Fezzik and Inigo trekking around Florin finding the ingredients for the miracle pill? Anyways, if you enjoyed the movie, pick this book up, and let your mind go on an endless adventure through time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Along with all the other books on this website, this is one of my favorites!!! The plot, in both the movie and the book, is fantabuloisticiferous (I invented that)! I hope everyone reads it at least once in their life."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"ok... i honestly thought the movie was better. i did not like how buttercup was portrayed in the book at the end of the fireswamp. she sounded terrible! however, the movie did leave out the zoo of death which i thought was a lot more interesting and fitting to the story than the pit of despair. but i love the story, and i can't get enough of it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I actually bought the paperback to take to a July 4th picnic. I couldn't put it down and kept laughing all day. Wonderful, romantic, witty and a blast to read"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"How many books can claim to be classics before they are even published? This one can, and does. Engrossing, suspenseful, and hilarious, this book takes the most basic of plots and makes it so rich that any reader can enjoy this book. Without giving anything away, the deception in the book is without bounds and brilliant, and the eventual discovery is deliciously humiliating. One of the few books that can make you laugh out loud, this book is definitely worth getting"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What a story!!! Adventure..romance...it has everything! I was enthralled with it..from Fezzik's rhymes to the droll humor in the book, I fell in love immediately. Although...I wish Goldman hadn't abridged it. ;) Only Morgenstern can talk about packing for 56 and a half pages. :"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The greatest Love story of all time - Not one couple a century is this lucky. If you read it, it will make you truly happy. The suspense, the humour, the comedy, the crying, the starlet and the psychiatrist wife all go to make this book probably the best collection of good parts that I have ever had the fortune to read.Life isn't fair, and this book tells you that but it also tells you that you should never give up trying for what you want. No matter what it is, if you want it badly enough, you have to keep trying. It took me years to find a copy - I have now bought 4 - I lend it out and never see it again!!If you haven't read this book, what are you reading this for - go buy it!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this book(and also the movie) a lot. It has charm and elegance entwined with romance. The characters literally lept off the page and into your heart. I cried when Buttercup cried, and even though I knew the story would be the same, I still try to warn her about the lighting sand or the R.O.U.S.'s.I was surprised how closely the movie was to the book. I had seen the movie before reading the book and when the familiar lines I'd heard in the movie came up so often in the book I could imagine the setting, the characters, and even the mood.I love this book because it is funny, romantic, heartfelt, witty, and so unbelievable. The unrealistic side to this book is another reason I love it so much, it takes away from the reality and monotony of the days and gives you reason to believe that true love exists and if it is really true, nothing can possibly stop it, not death, not anything."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman works some great magic in this book! He tells a story within a story. And the comical and romantic fable at the heart of the book is truly irresistible, with, as he advertises, the most beautiful woman in the world, the bravest man, true love, absolute courage, and all the best and worst, brightest and darkest, and a ton of action and adventure. But beyond that, the book is full of witty commentary, and ironic observations, as well as a gentle moral lesson produced by juxtaposition with Goldman's real life. In addition, it left me with the burning desire to read the original by S. Morgenstern (yes, it is a real book!), although I know that will be hard to find"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My brother saw the movie asnd recomended it to me. I saw the movie and loved it. Since the book is almost always better than the movie, I bought and read the book. The book was wonderful! Being misguided I loaned the book to a friend who never returned it. Thanks to the invention of the VCR and video store I rented the movie many times. I found the movie and bought it for 1/3 of the price I had already paid renting it.While watching the movie I remarked, to my husband, on the reunion scene that almost made it into the book. It didn't due to the still existing state of S. Morgenstern.He replied, what book?I have been looking for this book since the fall of 1990 when it, due to ill-fate, was loaned to the wrong person. Please, please if there is anything that can be done to get this book reprinted we must try. I am sure it would sell. Look at how video stores can't keep the movie on thier shelves. I want my children to be have the chance to read this book.&quot;The Princess Bride: ...the 'Good Parts' Version, Abridged&quot; by William Goldman is a wonderful, well written book.Sincerely,Roxanne Joslin"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My first exposure to The Princess Bride was watching the movie, i'm a HUGE mandy patinkin fan now, with my neice and nephew two years ago. Then last november when walking with my new girlfriend and talking about our favorite films she told me the story of how goldman wrote the book and had everyone believing he based in an original story his father read him. Then this x-mas while shopping I came across the &quot;good parts version&quot; and had to buy it. The book was funnier than the movie. Goldman has interspersed commentary (explaining what happened in the parts he 'cut out') that make the book one the most hilarious i've ever read. If you've never read this &quot;good parts version&quot; than you've never read!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's no wonder that Goldman is one of the most sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood today, although of course anyone who saw &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; could have guessed it would happen.I first read this book shortly after the film came out, having come across a copy in the library I was working in at the time. The interleaving of &quot;real world&quot; and fantasy is the most skillful I've seen since &quot;The Neverending Story,&quot; although the style is quite different.Goldman has succeeded in writing a great story, and telling a marvelous joke at the same time. I still get a laugh every time I run across someone who believes that the so-called &quot;original&quot; exists. The wit in this story is two-fold; not only is the story very funny and convincing at the same time -- and it's HARD to write humorous fantasy and have it come off as realistic -- but Goldman's &quot;commentary&quot; adds to the story rather than detracting from it. An excellent read"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Definitely one of my favorite books, The Princess Bride is a welcome escape from most of the copy-cat fiction available today. The story is timeless, and the author's commentary is hilarious. Be sure to send for the free reunion scene offered in the middle of the book, it's greatly worth the stamp"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of those few books (Little Women, Catcher in the Rye) that I often open at random and reread. Many people will remember the movie as being for kids, but the book is perfect for any reader. It's simply magic. Goldman's writing is full of self-deprecating humor, imagination, and detail. Fantastic scenes which comprise so much of the book and provide depth to his outlandish characters were all but omitted in the film. Quite simply this book is perfect for anyone who enjoys fantasy, love, revenge, swordplay, or just an escape from the everyday."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride by William Goldman is a truly remarkable book. At the beginning of the book you think, oh, this is just another fairy tale.But to tell you the truth, I thought this book had many twists. The vocabulary is strong so it's not just another quick and childish book. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book because it doesn't just focus on one genre. Some parts of the book could be romantic while other parts are action. I was never bored reading this book. For the most part, I was filled with suspense. The Princess Bride is a book that will make you think differently about fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first saw this movie when I was just a &amp;quot;wee lass,&amp;quot; and I soon forgot it, but I guess it stayed in my mind for a while. So, when I saw the book sitting in a bookstore I just had to buy it. Soon, I was all wrapped up in its three different stories -Morgenstern, Goldman's abridging process, and the story itself. After reading it a second time, I decided I wanted to read the unabridged, original Morgenstern. So, I looked it up online to order it. Go ahead. Try it. Search for Morgenstern, search for Florin, and see what happens!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book. If you've seen the movie, you mostly know the plot. If you haven't seen the movie, what is WRONG with you?The book is hillariously written, entwining the story of the author's life and the fable, and the juxtoposition of the two is phenomenal.Finally, though, the joy of this book is its humor and swash-buckling plot line. I read it in an afternoon or two. I simply could not put it down. It's a great story and great read, well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"*Sigh* My boyfriend first introduced me to the movie and I just had to read the book! It's so wonderful... Goldman's style of writing is one of a kind! One of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you have seen the movie, this book will still come as a total surprise. I can and often do (certanly more than my friends or family would like) quote dialouge from this enormously funny story, but I did not get the half of it. The other half lies in this brillantly written book.Anybody looking for the elusive S. Morgenstern, trying to book a flight to Florin or waiting with baited breath for the sequal &quot;Buttercup's Baby&quot; have really kind of missed the point.William Goldman has created a fantasy so appealing that he himself has fallen right in.As a reader of many genres I have found that the hardest thing for an author to get out of me is true laughter. Not a smile or knowing smirk, but a good 'ol eye squirting belly laugh. Mr. Goldman had that achieved fairly early on and just kept on rollin'.Read this book for yourself, read it to your children but for cryin out loud READ IT! The story at the end of the Hardcover 25th anniversary edition about Andre The Giant and Arnold Shwartzeneager in Mexico alone is worth the price of admission.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Loved it, loved it, loved it. This book is amazing, and the sub story about Morgenstern makes it even better! You find out so much more about the characters than you do in the movie, and you love them even more. Read it if you haven't already!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you enjoyed the movie, then I definately recomend that you read this book. The movie, which is an all time favorite eludes to some facts that the book goes ahead and explains. they definately go hand-in-hand."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have had this movie for the longest time now, since I was a little, &amp; I still love the story. I know every word of the movie, but when I read the book recently it was even funnier than the movie. The left-out stories &amp; backgrounds were really good &amp; I liked it very much."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Every time I read it, I'm amazed. A lot of people seem to prefer the movie. I think they're disappointed by Goldman's supposed abridging of the book, with his many asides about cuts that were made. Some people seem to dislike the lack of the movie's sappier ending. I think the book is genius. I guess some people feel betrayed when they find out that there was no original book by S. Morgenstern. I think that's what makes it so brilliant. If the book didn't have the extra stuff about the supposed original author, the glimpses of Goldman's supposed family life, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. The story would still be great, but I was glad to find the extra commentary by Goldman in the book as opposed to the movie. It's one of the funniest books I've read. It never gets slow. It's one of the most moving books I've read. If you haven't read it, read it already. Goldman's just such a gifted, imaginative storyteller. I also recommend _Control_, _Magic_, _Marathon Man_, _Brothers_, and _Heat_. They're all so interesting and a far cry from _The Princess Bride_."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Yes, I realize I'm goring a sacred cow here. (There are readers who not only love this book--they LUV this book.) Yet this self-proclaimed \\"classic\\" completely disappointed me; I was expecting biting satire and keen wit; obviously, when it comes to William Goldman's THE PRINCESS BRIDE, I had set my expectations far too high.Look, I get it: This is a tongue-in-cheek spoof of swashbuckling/romance stories. And I'm all about tongue-in-cheek spoofing. (Can you say that legally in Kansas?) But, come on. This is sophomoric babbling that barely moves the imagination meter--incessantly interrupted by Goldman (as the \\"abridger\\") himself. (At least the half-baked author backstory was a tad more interesting than the actual story.) Contrived, bland, lackluster, lame, mediocre, cliche-driven: I could go on and on. And then Goldman himself takes lazy shortcuts by interjecting himself into the story to summarize various actions by the characters to move his plot along--a device to explain the inexplicable by virtue of pulling (metaphorically speaking, of course) nonsense out of certain aspects of his anatomy. It comes across not as witty and sharp, but as banal and tiresome. Yes, Virginia, there was no one more relieved than moi when I closed THE PRINCESS BRIDE for the last time and placed it back on the shelf. This was one 400-page (not counting the countless introductions) author ego stroke.--D. Mikels, Esq."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I admit to having been taken in by believing, as I read the introduction, this was an abridgement of an earlier novel. Goldman puts forth a convincing background tale, don't you think? Anyway, it wasn't until about the first 50 pages of story had gone by that I thought, this guy is totally pulling my leg with this Morgenstern stuff! I'm embarrassed that it took me that long, I mean look at the reviews page under the front cover. Shog Bongiorno? Come on! Anyway, Now I feel enlightened and superior for having figured the whole thing out. It's a cleverly written tale and actually, I quite enjoy his narrative interruptions. But maybe that's just me. And now, go back to the beginning and wait for Vizzini."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I came to this book after already having seen the movie. I couldn't imagine that I could love the book as much as the movie, since the movie was so incredible, but I did. The book is JUST AS GOOD as the movie, which is high praise (for both, really!).This is a fanastic story, full of adventure and danger and humor. I recommend it highly for any child who is old enough to sit through a book without pictures - 7 and up or so, depending on the kid. There are a few scary parts, and a bad guy dies, but there isn't anything that should give a child nightmares.One note: This edition of the book has a VERY LENGTHY introduction, which is great if you're already a fan of this story. But if you're new to the story, SKIP the intro. A kid isn't going to care about it at all and it might even turn him off to continuing on to the actual story. If you're the parent (or just a regular adult who is reading the story for enjoyment!), the intro will be much more interesting to you AFTER you've read and loved the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What did you think of the book? (Why this book?, New Author? Read more by author? Keeping? Thoughts on Hero? Heroine?)Honestly, I expected more considering the movie is so beloved and one of my all time favorite movies. However, the quaint interruptions with Grandfather and grandson is completely different in this novel. First, we are reading the abridged version according to writer William Goldman. He's telling us that S. Morgenstern originally wrote the book but there are these long portions that reveal that the book wasn't a story but rather a historical telling of Florin's history. So periodically Goldman cuts in to tell us what he's cut out and at time he doesn't pick up where the story left off.Then you might discover, as I did, that you care very little for Buttercup but are far more impressed with Westley (aka The Dread Pirate Roberts, Man In Black), Fezzik the Giant, and Inigo Montoya. The book in the movie parallel each other much of the time as this is the abridgement of the \\"original book\\" by the screenplay writer. So we meet many of the beloved characters and we get to read the story we've loved over the years only there are things like the Zoo of Death that we get to experience where we didn't get them in the movie. You'll also find that half the time the things that aren't in the movie are actually a good thing.Inigo's story really does carry most of the book and even if you aren't enjoying the book you can't wait to read \\"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father, prepare to die!Now, that isn't to say that the story isn't worth reading but if you've watched the movie it is highly likely you will ever need to read it. Of course, I do enjoy that at the very end of this edition there is a short called Buttercup's Baby which is essentially a small continuation of the story so you know more about what happened to our beloved characters.... but only a little more.I have to tell you. Overall the book is maddening while being great and good in parts. I only give it a 3 because it is The Princess Bride and even if the book made me want to throw it, the story is worthy. The movie, of course, gets a 5."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This one is so hard for me to review. This is one of my favorite stories of all time, but it's not the book that I'm in love with. It's the movie. I am utterly obsessed with the film adaptation of this novel. The novel itself, however, is just not my favorite. I want to like it. I truly do. But I just can't. It is too long and drawn out and the characters just get confusing. The story really needed to be pared down a little more before being published in my opinion. I'm so sad to give this a negative review, but I feel like I just have to. I really didn't enjoy the novel at all. But I HIGHLY recommend the movie!!! :)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have to say I'm a bit disappointed by the book. I saw the movie first and then read the book. The fact that he jumps in all the time with this fake back story really bugs me, as well as a lot of continuity errors.

The book is missing Cary Elwes as Westley imo, but the movie is missing the *narration* in the book. Half the book is in the narration.Good books have multiple layers. This book has three:1. It is an excellent tale of True Love and High Adventure2. It is an excellent satire on True Love and High Adventure3. It is an excellent satire on satireI second the recommendation to skip the 25th anniversary intro until you've read the rest of the book. It really should have been an Afterword, not a Foreword, as it were."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"\\"The Princess Bride\\" is my all-time favorite romantic movie, so I was reluctant to read the novel in case it didn't live up to my high expectations. But reading William Goldman's novel gave me even more to love.The novel provides essential background stories on some of the key characters, which makes the movie version even richer. The book also introduces a few new people (such as Inigo's tutor and Buttercup's baby) and situations that didn't make it into Goldman's screenplay because of time limitations.Buttercup's three dream sequences, behind-the-scenes Hollywood gossip and the S. Morgenstern device take this wonderful story one step further into a dream within a dream within a dream (an idea referenced in the book and movie by the Impressive Clergyman in his \\"mawwiage\\" ceremony).Although the movie stays true to the novel, some of the dialogue from the book was tweaked a little to make it even more condensed, more insightful, and significantly funnier on film. If you love the movie, you'll love the book. And vice versa.Leslie Halpern, author ofReel Romance: The Lovers' Guide to the 100 Best Date MoviesandDreams on Film: The Cinematic Struggle Between Art and Science."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm not a person who re-reads books or watches movies twice. But I think I've read this book about 3-5 times. I first discovered it when I was a about 14, and it was about 10 years later that I found out there was even a movie about it.I literally threw the book down in moments of uncontrollable, convulsive laughter. This book has made me laugh so many times - I couldn't get enough of it.The movie disappointed me (except for Mandy Patankin and maybe Carey Elwes) and I laugh at those who think the movie is representative of the book.The book is so much better!

But do yourself a favor and skip the (totally farcical and quite annoying) introductions."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is amazing!

Did I mention I love it?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the book's out-of-place contemporary anti fairy tale humor (this was before Shrek) and whole alternate reality thing that wraps up and intercepts the story. I even believed it without questions until I read about it on wiki (this was after wiki ;)Definitely enjoyable book that I could recommend (for example to the people that liked the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy). But it contains some parts that kinda dragged so three stars seems just about right."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This was a book I read years ago and wanted to share with my daughter.

Good thing! Get your copy now and read it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is storytelling at its best. If you liked the movie, you will absolutely LOVE this book. Wesley and Buttercup make just the perfect couple but its the backstory on Fezzik and Inigo what really made this book special. \\"Hello, My name is Inigo Montoya, You killed my father, Prepare to Die\\". Simply Awesome!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I will admit I saw the movie first when I was a kid but the book is just as special. You'll recognize all the great lines plus many more. The movie was very true to the book so if you did not like the movie there is probably not much appeal to the book - but if you loved the movie the book gives you even more detail on these fabulous characters."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First of all, this book isn't really about a princess and a pirate and giant rats. That story is in there, but the book is really about the italics. It's a satire and a well written spoof. My daughter sat down one afternoon and a couple of hours later set the book aside and declared she was finished; that the book was really kind of silly and boring. \\"No way!\\" was my response, \\"Did you read the italics?\\". She had not and she had missed the whole point of the book. She picked up the book and read it again, this time with the italics. I heard frequent giggles, snorts and all out guffaws. The \\"story\\" is just what you see in the movie; cute, fun and plenty of adventure. The italics show you how brilliant William Goldman is in creating an abridged version of a book that never existed.This book was my selection for the monthly reading in my book club and we had a great time discussing this book and everyone's reaction to the story. Many of the people in the club had to Google William Goldman and S. Morgenstern and still could believe it was \\"ALL\\" fiction.If you want to read an incredibly well written spoof on a historical book that never really existed, read this one. If you want to read a fairytale about giant rats and princesses being rescued, check out the children's section."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"With over 500 reviews already on the board, there is probably very little to be added in praise for this wonderful book, so I will try and keep it short.This is one of the ten best books written in the twentieth century. You may think such a brash and monumental statement to be somewhat inconceivable, but it is true. There have been few books better in the last hundred years.This book has one of the best plot devices ever conceived (an abridgment of an older, and entirely fictitious, work allowing the author to interject himself into the story at will), one of the best romantic speeches ever written (Buttercup to Westley pgs. 51-52), one of the best and cathartic action sequences ever penned (Inigo vs. Count Rugen with that amazing &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya...&quot; line for punctuation), one of the best concluding lines of any novel ever (I'm not giving it away...you'll have to get to it for yourself) and, finally, one of the most quotable and heartrendingly true quotes ever put down on paper, &quot;Life is pain, anybody that says differently is selling something.&quot; (Spoken by Westley to Buttercup in the movie, but by Fezzik's mother to her gigantic son in the book).Somewhere along the way we all grow up and lose that innocence childhood affords. The myths give way to harsh reality and the fantasy is buried by the real world. The genius of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is in acknowledging this fact rather than glossing over it and moving on through to the other side. And it does so in such an engaging and entertaining way that a little bit of that wonder is returned, even in the midst of the darkest fire swamp. So if you, like many of your fellow wanderers on this earth, find yourself mostly dead, you owe it to yourself to read or re-read this marvel of modern literature and regain a little spark of laughter and life so precious in these precarious times.As a last note, the 25th anniversary book contains new material that you missed the first time around and is just as sensational as the original book itself.Like I said in the opening, one of the ten best books...And I Mean It..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is an excellent book, as long as you don't go into it wanting a conventional fantasy novel. At some points during the reading, you will realize that Goldman did not write the book intending for it to be a pure fantasy, but perhaps more of a satire of reality. His entire point in writing it was to show readers that they are in the real world. The characters and happenings are so far fetched because Goldman wants us to realize that life isn't a fantasy.If you've seen the movie, read the book to get more out of the story. If you haven't seen the movie, read the book and then see it. If you've already read the book, why are you looking at reader reviews?--I mean--buy the movie.Oh yeah... there are plenty of reviews here saying that this book is so horrible because Goldman cut hundreds of pages out of S. Morgenstern's original Princess Bride. Do not pay any attention to these reviews... these people have been misinformed. S. Morgenstern was a fictional writer invented by Goldman. He is just a character in Goldman's story. This story is not abridged, as it may seem(The 'Good Parts' Version). It is just a tale that Goldman made up, or maybe his father made it up, or maybe his father's father... the point is, the tale was never WRITTEN anywhere else until Goldman came along, so you are not missing anything in reading THIS version. Please do not go and try to find S. Morgenstern's original... that would be an impossibility, as well as a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"(My Abridged Comments:)I saw the movie when I was very young, but (much to his annoyance) I kept getting my Father to stop the tape when I felt the movie was taking unfair turns for the worse. Though he threatened several times to return it to Major Video right then and there, I finally shut my trap and persevered, and boy am I glad I did![Cut from this section of the review: some Florinese ranting about how glad I was.]Thenceforward the movie had already etched itself an irreversible position on my all-time favorites list.(...And being so young, it just may have been the first movie on it! This was long after all-time favorites lists, but only shortly before Nintendo would forever claim my soul in exchange for Dad's hard-earned money.)Then a year or two back (as a Holiday gag-gift,) my sister bought the book for me because she knows I don't know how to read -- but this book literally *spoke* to me!Thanks to Mr. Goldman (aka S. Morgenstern) and his talking book, I've turned my life around, learned to walk, and had my copy bronzed!Soon thereafter I bought another copy.The book, so incredibly and cleverly crafted, has certainly taught me one thing...Thank you for that one thing, Mr. Goldman, and finish that sequel!!!*.........*(Believe it or not, this actually is one of my favorite books, ever. But both the literary & theatrical aspects of the P.B. Experience were heightened moreso than I could have ever previously imagined upon the startling revelation that the mysterious & wonderful S. Morgenstern was all a fabrication of \\"Abridger,\\" William Goldman! This very revelation, my reluctant & most likely non-existent audience, occurred within the past hour for me, and is what prompted my review! *you're welcome* ...The lateness of the hour is probably what tempered my sarcasm, despite my undying love for this story.To reiterate every review thus far, with the exception of one troll I stumbled across: \\"If you haven't seen this movie or read this book, choose a medium or two and get to work! Just thank me later... with cash. ...and a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee.\\"I may have just altered the \\"Average Review\\" in adding those last few statements, though.)G'night, you've been great!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has played an important role in my life. I bet there aren't a lot of people who can say they graduated college because of _The Princess Bride_!Mind you, I agree with some people that the book has its problems. For instance, people look at you funny on a Greyhound when you're reading something and start laughing nearly uncontrollably. And other people, who have never read any fantasy in their lives are like, &quot;How can you read this stuff? Aren't you too old for stuff like this?&quot;As a matter of fact, no. I love this book. As a young woman with very little prospects in the way of love, this book gave me hope that, someday, some guy would look at me and see what was truely going on inside my head. So long as I kept saying, &quot;As you wish.&quot; :)But what I really love is the blend of 'in character' and 'out of character' that Goldman does. It's an interesting narrative technique that I have never seen used outside this book. For the record, Goldman's family wasn't like that at all. He doesn't have a son, he has two daughters. And I forget what his wife really did, but she was nothing like the woman he describes in the book.This book is fiction. Of course, no names were changed to protect the innocent. In this book, nobody is innocent. Except maybe Morgenstern, since he had absolutely nothing to do with it.Oh...and how did I graduate college because of this book? I wrote my senior paper on _The Princess Bride_ and the narrative structure found within it.Don't laugh. I got a B+."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman has said that he told these stories to his daughters, and was then inclined to collect them in one longer prose work. Only he couldn't get turned on by the parts in between the exciting action. The 'boring' parts, as it were. So what does he do? He eliminates the 'boring' parts altogether, by assembling a fictional 'best parts' version of someone else's tale! What a great idea. Sometimes I reveled in the fact that I didn't have to slog through seventy pages of Morgenstern's views on the socio-political history of Guilder and Florin, or how best to plan a royal wedding. It actually made the 'best' parts that much better.I love Goldman's authorial voice. His pieces for Premiere magazine on the state of the movie industry have always struck me as very wise, common sensical, and conversational. That same voice is utilized to great effect here. The characters you loved in the move have been fleshed out even more, and even though it sometimes proved a distraction when a scene differed from its twin in the movie, sometimes the change (I know, the book was written first) was for the better.A caution, though (**spoilers**): my two favourite moments from the movie (Man in black suggests Fezzick &quot;dream of large women&quot; and Westley offering the Dread Pirate Roberts persona to Inigo) aren't here. I guess you can't have all your best ideas at once.Still, a truly engaging work, and a near perfect piece of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a delightful entertaining film and this book in which it was based on is good too and written by William Goldman who also wrote the screenplay for the film. It is funny how so many reviewers were fooled into actually thinking that there really was an old classic by S. Morgernstern when in fact there was no S. Morgernstern at all. S. Morgernstern was just a figment of William Goldman's imagination. He created him for his book. I also have to laugh that so many people were fooled by the review by the guy claiming to work for the estate of S. Morgenstern and since he's not even a real person that guy was obviously pulling your legs people! Try doing a web search for S. Morgenstern and it will lead you right back to William Goldman and The Princess Bride!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It took me awhile to find the \\"right\\" version of the Princess Bride. The description of \\"Princess Bride\\" tells of William Goldman abridging the original by S Morgenstern. I was constantly confused with Goldman's talk of Guilder and Florin and Morgenstern's original version. But, there is no Morgenstern! There are no countries of Guilder and Florin. (But Goldman's commentary at the end talk about him visiting Florin and the real Cliff's of Insanity). It is all part of Goldman's imagination. The preface and commentary talk about Goldman's struggle with Morgenstern's estate is also made up. Everything about the book's publication and legal battles are fictional. I wish I would have know that before I read the book, preface and all. It would have made more sense, but discovering this after the fact, I found it quite dissapointing.As to the actual story: I grew up quoting the Princess Bride movie. I have most of it memorized. So, it was quite fun to relive the story. Goldman also wrote the screenplay for the movie, so it follows the book very faithfully. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the movie.Vizzini: \\"Fool. You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is 'Never get incolved in a land war in Asia,' but only slightly less well know in this: 'Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.'\\"Classic.\\"Inconcievable\\". \\"You keep using that word! I don't think it means what you think it does.\\"\\"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya (btw it took me forever as a child to learn how to pronounce that); you killed my father; prepare to die.\\"The book did explain in more detail the background of Inigo and his father's death. The part about Wesley's torture is pretty grusome, so skip that part. Goldman's commentary is also quite boring and contains lots of swearing.This version contained a preface and Goldman's abridgement of the first chapter of the sequel \\"Buttercup's Baby\\". I did not like it at all. Btw, there is no sequel. Goldman never got past the first chapter. And remember Morgenstern is fictional, so the abridgement is not an abridgement but Goldman's original work."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"On of my favorite movies to sit down and watch or come into the middle of and pick it up at that point is The Princess Bride. Ahhhh, such a tale that everyone loves. Who doesn't have a favorite character (or two). However, this review deals with the book that the movie was developed from.The book of The Princess Bride is self described as the abridged telling of S. Morgenstern's classic tale of true love and high adventure. However, rather than being an abridged story, this is the full story (sorry if you're looking for Morgenstern's tale, a little lie). That said, the tale is told as a writer who's abridging a classic tale from his youth that his dad read to him when he was sick. In \`abridging' Morgenstern's work, Mr. Goldman inserts his own comments, whether it's his memory of when his dad read the story to him or when he explains why he removed part of Morgentstern's work.The GoodThe book follows the movie (or is it the movie follows the book, a little hard to say) very well. All of the scenes you love in the movie are in the book. Additional data is provided usually, but it doesn't hurt what we saw in the movie in the least. In addition, we're given additional back ground data on Princess Buttercup, Wesley, and all of the major characters. I was particularly happy with the additional information on Inigo and Fezzik. While I enjoyed them in the movie, the book brings them forward! Especially when you learn what Fezzik went thru.The BadSometimes Mr. Goldman is a little long winded. I know he was trying to capture a writing style, but I think he took it a little to far. Particularly when describing the Prince and his Zoo of Death. As a matter of fact, this caused me to put the book down for a little while.The RatingBoy, on the front half I was only thinking 3 stars. I mean it was a little slow, Mr. Goldman spent a fair amount of time coming up with the idea of abridging the book, acquiring the book, and writing the abridged work. However, once Princess Buttercup is kidnapped the story picks up and the story steps up to 4.5 stars. Given this, I'll call this one a 4 star book. The strength of the book is what we've seen in the movie, quick action with an excellent story that everyone loves."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This story is delight in any form; hardcover, paperback or film. My favorite by far, though is to read the hardcover version with the alternating text colors (indicating the story that's being told and the experiences of the child to whom the story is being told).Sometimes, I want the hardcover version of a book simply because I want it to last, but in this case my recommendation is because the story is actually better with the colored script."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As sad as this may sound, I have read this book at least once a year since I was in 5th grade. (I am now presently a senior). William Goldman does a great job telling this adventureous fairy tale love story! The characters are unforgettable and lovable."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"When I was 15 years old, I loved a boy two years older than I with a passion that can only be understood by a bespectacled, gangly, brainy teenage girl. If this boy had asked me to climb the tallest mountain, ford the deepest river, fake stupidity, donate a kidney, I would have done it just for the chance to be around him.Anyway, he had to read The Princess Bride for english class (this was 1977, and progressive reading lists had finally hit upstate New York.) He went on and on about how funny this book was, how clever, and that it was &quot;the bestest book in the whole wide world.&quot; Needless to say, I had to read it. I borrowed his copy (touched by his very hands! read by his very eyes!) and devoured it in two days. And yes, it was funny, and yes, it was clever. But the part that really hit me (and not until years later did I realize how hard) was the scene where the old lady tells a young Billy Goldman that life isn't fair.I had the same sort of epiphany that Goldman did in the book - all of a sudden, things made sense. I might have the most beautiful soul and intelligent mind in the world, but until I lost the glasses (senior year in college) and got a decent haircut (still working on it) and developed a killer bod (still working on the haircut), I was not going to end up with Westley. And that was just the way things were. And it was o.k.Because of William Goldman, I have had a very happy, satisfying life because I stopped looking for fair (that comes from outside) and started working on contentment (that comes from inside). And that is why The Princess Bride is the bestest thing in the whole wide world. Except maybe for cough drops."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride, S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, The \`good parts' version Abridged by William Goldman.I suppose that says it all, and it does, except for the part about the movie. I know what you're thinking, \\"Well, I've seen the movie...\\" and yes, but you haven't READ the book. The movie, which follows the book so closely, is a wonderfully outstanding companion to the novel because it follows so closely at times even to quote the dialogue. There are some slight changes with the dialogue and narrative, perhaps the title of the movie should have been:... Abridged by William Goldman and Further Abridged by Hollywood. As I was saying if you loved the movie you'll the love the book and if you like the movie then at least (shirley) you will love the book and if you didn't like the movie or even hated it the book has such funny moments you'll probably forgive it for being so similar to that movie you couldn't stand. There is one paragraph in the book that begins towards the bottom of page 47 and ends towards the bottom of page 48; I only mention this because it was by far one of the funniest passages I have ever read. The movie simply does not do it justice, the scene where Buttercup tells Westley she loves him. I won't say anymore for fear that I should say too much and ruin it for you. Back to my point about the movie being a fab companion for this book. The scene with Miracle Max and his wife is out and out better in the movie, but the book has greater detail than the movie, so it is rather quite interesting. The additional details in this book really make it the \\"good parts\\" version and the movie while good has its limitations. Of course the book has its limitations too. One of these is the lack of Cary Elwes. Another limitation is the decided absence of hearing the Archdean's speech impediment, \\"Mawidge\\". A greater limitation is that some of the lines in the book are not as funny as the movies or are better when delivered by one of the actors, but the way around these problems is to play the movie when you feel like taking a break from the reading. You can even time it to see your favorite parts after you've just read them. Really though, the best part of this book is the stuff about the kid and how William Goldman found the book in the first place and all the details about what he cut out. I don't intend to rag on Fred Savage's performance or the producer's, director's, script writer's, costume designer's, casting's, go-for's, or even the extra's but the stuff in the book about the kid is actually moving. In the movie it's all, \\"Yeah, yeah the kid is sick, amazingly clever plot device, now! Get on with it.\\" I mean do they expect us to buy all that serious crap about being sick, first he's sitting up playing a video game, second I've been sick and if you haven't let me tell you he don't look it, and thirdly it takes, what, a day to read the book and he's all apt with attention, not even a break for a nap. If he could sit up and stay that interested all day then he should be in school. Don't get me started, but I digress. In the book the illness is real and serious and you feel what this kid is going through, trying to pay attention, wanting to hear more despite having to go to bed, and boy when he gets frustrated and pisses his father off, whew! At this point, if you're like me when the review is boring and too long and the writer obviously is more interested in what she or he has to say than ever getting to the point you've skipped to then for the sum up, is this book good enough to buy or even worth dragging my lazy bum to the library? A simple yes, definitely. Do so right now, you're one click away from laughing so loud as to get strange looks. Here follows the paragraph you were skimming for.Buy this book, buy it now, or regret it later and for the rest of your life until you finally buy the stupid thing and be done with it already. Trust me, I can feel the (buy book) little nag back in your mind just where the hard skull is preventing you from (buy book) scratching at it. The other great thing is that if you buy the new edition you get the first chapter to the sequel, which everyone is overtly anxious for. One more quick note I could quote \\"I had such rhymes for you...\\" about how love is true \\"You're not going anywhere until I know those rhymes\\", to be had if that sort of thing makes you glad let your guide be Goldmanread on, read on! readon!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Very, very, very few movies are better than the book. Having watched The Princess Bride approximately 546 times, I thought it was high time to read the actual book. I thought it was high time to read the actual book. A few years I go, I took the leap and assumed, of course, it would be just as riveting.It is still inconceivable to me that the book was such a far cry from the magic of the movie. After I finished reading it, I almost cried. No, wait, I actually did cry.The book and film essentially tell the same storyline. The author writes two stories in one; one tale is a archetypal fairy tale adventure, the other one is a contemporary story of how such timeless fantasies keep us spellbound, no matter our age, location or shoe size.The Princess Bride has includes so many themes it's hard to keep up, but that's part of the adventure. True Love, Revenge, Giants, Poison, Brave Men, Beautiful Women, Rodents, Torture.Let me sum up. Princess Buttercup and servant boy Wesley embark upon a true love story. Life circumstances initially draw them apart, yet ultimately they come together in fairy-tale romance style through a series of clever trials and tribulations. Inigo Montoya and Prince Humperdinck excel as supporting antagonist characters, contributing to the witty banter that ensues throughout the movie and film.Things happen along the way. Miracle Max comes to the rescue to revive Wesley after he is tortured and supposedly dead. Ant then finally, Buttercup and Wesley are reunited because nothing can stop True Love.Essentially, the plot and themes of the book and movie are the same. What I could not cope with was Goldman's use of the fictional tale of the author. Yes, those parts were italicized, but if I wanted to go from one \\"scene\\" to the next, I had to wade through 50 pages just to get there. Major detraction. The only stylistic credit I'll give to Goldman is his masterful use of the run-on sentence.Come to think of it, I think I'll do a review soon that is a 500-word run-on sentence and see if anyone notices.No, reading The Princess Bride didn't put me off books forever. It just reminded me that I had to go back to the beginning.Check out my other reviews at: http://laurareviews.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was in the hospital for five days.

When I got my Kindle, I remembered the part in the movie where the grandfather said to the boy, &#34;The Princess Bride, S. Morgenstern's tale of true love and high adventure&#34; so I'm like &#34;I wonder if it is a real book?&#34;. I checked it out and suprisingly I found it! And it has been the greatest book I have ever read. I thought it was going to be totally off from the movie since they always change things but every point was the same. The characters said a lot of the same things. I love the parts where William Goldman interjects with his points and little stories too. My favorite character is Inigo Montoya. &#34;Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.&#34; My favorite line next to &#34;Inconceivable!&#34; All time favorite in my heart."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first watched, \\"The Princess Bride,\\" about ten years ago. A friend was appalled that I had never seen it and promptly sat me down to watch it. I enjoyed it quite a bit. If you are a fan of the movie, I will tell you now that the book reads almost exactly how the movie watches. \\"Just the good parts.\\"Just to clarify; there is no S. Morgenstern, and this book isn't an abridgment. It was written by William Goldman (as was the screenplay to the movie, which is why they are so similar). Now that is over, let's focus on the contents. This book is without doubt true to it's title in saying it's a tale of \\"True Love and High Adventure.\\" If you enjoy sword fighting you'll probably adore the Cliffs of Insanity section as it's not too overly detailed. There are a few gore filled parts, but nothing too excessive.It's a book I will definitely read to my children.Pro'sThe villain is classic, being beyond evil.Fast pacedCharacters are interestingCon'sThe first chapter is a little stale, but provides a base for the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I picked this book up for $1 at the local Goodwill store. Sure, I've seen the movie a few times; it's pretty good. I wouldn't ascribe \\"cult classic\\" status to it personally, but it is fun to watch. The book had been on my wish list for some time, so I snatched it up when I had the chance, figuring the book would also be a fun read. Plus, I could check the book off my list.Boy, was I ever wrong.Within the first ten pages, I was hooked. From the outset, it was obvious that this was a case in which, as usual, the book is better than the movie--but in this case, it was much, much better. I won't spell out the plot for you; I assume most people have seen or are familiar with the movie. I will comment on why the book is better.Basically, the book contains a much more robust storyline. Author William Goldman offers a detailed--and hilarious--introduction in which he describes the \\"events\\" that led up to his \\"abridging the original book\\" by (I assume) alter-ego Simon Morgenstern. This immediately allows the reader access to the mind of the author, which I think allows for more interaction during the course of reading. Goldman--er, Morgentsern--also delves more deeply into the back stories of Humperdinck, Inigo and Fezzik than the movie could do. I especially enjoyed the book's treatment of Inigo. His subplot is much fuller in the book and even goes into detail about the man his father was. After reading that section, if I were Inigo, I would devote my life to pursuing his killer, too! This, of course, made the actual duel between him and the Count all the more intense. The book also contains several scenes that were cut out of the movie entirely, including Inigo and Fezzik descending the levels of the Zoo of Death. The simple, short ending of that pericope is a masterful example of understatement as humor. Finally, someone who only watches the movie will miss out on all of the funny little asides that are strewn about the pages of this book.Instead of a book I thought I would read once, and that mainly as a \\"check the box\\" activity, I ended up with a book that kept me up late several nights and a book that I will definitely reread several times in the future. Indeed, as I read, I kept asking myself, \\"Why have I waited so long to read this book?\\" I encourage you, then, to learn from my mistake and read this book soon!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This was hilarious! I've been reading a lot of screenplays lately and was curious what Goldman's novel was like compared to his movie. Although the funniest dialogue was in the movie (\\"'Inconcievable'- you keep using that word. I do not think it means, what you think it means\\"), the novel adds its own richness that the movie doesn't include. For example the narrator is a grandfather character who has this whole complicated life that augments the princess story, and the voice is so frank and friendly you feel like you're being told a true story. His matter-of-fact retelling of how Buttercup moved from the 20th most beautiful woman in the world to 18th and then finally to the top is such original comedy.The thing I enjoy most about his humor is how it lovingly mocks human flaws. And while Goldman's creating these lovable, larger than life, totally messed up characters (the giant is an insecure idiot, the master fencer is an alcoholic, the hero is dead), he's also totally aware of his obligations to the reader: the promise to entertain and to keep the story moving- tasks he fulfills admirably."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup, the beautiful and slightly unintelligent girl, her lover Westley, and the wicked Prince Humperdink. It is a story of romance, brave adventurers, sword fights, monsters, villains, and true love.Goldman' s writing style is simple, but effective. Dialogue is used sparingly but to great effect, as is description. If Goldman were a painter, he would be one who could convey the greatest amount of meaning with the fewest brush strokes.(This is me, the author of this review, and I'd just like to point out something. Every so often, or more often than that, the author William Goldman will interject his own thoughts and opinions into the middle of the narrative. The story goes that he is actually abridging Simon Morgenstern's \\"original\\" Princess Bride to have only \\"the good parts\\", and the constant asides tell the reader more about the other version. Or about how his father read to him. Such comments happen frequently and are usually a little jarring, which keeps you from really taking the story seriously. The author never truly lets you forget that you are reading a book.)Even if you have seen the movie a thousand times, the book is still worth a read. Characters are given much more depth than they were on the silver screen: Inigo Montoya and Fezzik both get lengthy flashbacks to fill out their backstory (for example, you get to see exactly what happened between the Six-Fingered Man and Inigo's father), Buttercup is a more rounded character, and even Prince Humperdink and the Count get personalities.This isn't the best book I have ever read. The story is a little too simple, the author's comments are a little too intrusive, but the book does have plenty of charm. From Fezzik's simple-minded obsession with rhyming to Vizzini's insistence that there is not a man following them up the cliff (he's just a sailor with a passion for rock climbing at night!), there are many unforgettable moments.If you're looking for a light read, you can't go wrong with The Princess Bride."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Ever since I first watched the movie the Princess Bride, I have loved and watch it still. Now that I have read the book, I love the story even more. It is the only book that I have found that makes me cry and laugh at the same time.

If you've seen the film, then you may not want, or need, to read it (although I found it to be a useful addition). If you haven't seen it, then buy the book; it has the works, amost every old-time swash-buckling fantasy adventure element is in there - real Erol Flynn stuff this - and it never stops (if you ignore the Goldman/Morgenstern between-brackets interjections).Funny, camp, exciting and predictable (yes you can have both at once!) this tale just carries you off on a ride."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I picked this book up at a sale to help the Lynnwood, WA library.

While the book doesn't have much more plot elements than the movie (save for a longer look at the characters younger lives), it does bring William Goldman's whimsical writing style. That style is approximated rather well in the movie, but is very fun to read. I especially loved the interludes where Goldman ostensibly interrupts Morgenstern's original story with some of his own commentary.Unfortunately, since the movie is so well known I won't rehash this much. The conclusion is that this is a wonderful story to read on a sunny Saturday afternoon with a glass of lemonade or iced tea in the park."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

There are vital things that aren't played out in the movie. For example Buttercup's parents and her upbringing were not even mentioned in the movie. The history of the most beautiful women in the world was completely skipped over. Being a vital part of the book, the zoo of death was not portrayed at all. The movie used a tree for the torture setting, that just wasn't right. In the movie Fezzik and Inigo clubbed the albino to find Westley. Then Inigo used his father's sword to find the tree. That never happened in the book, they listened to the screams and followed them to the zoo of death. Fezzik and Inigo had to go through much more hardship to find Westley in the book. They had to fight all of the floors of the zoo of death before they reached level five. This created alot of suspense that was lacking in the movie. Overall the book was more suspensefull and surpassed the movie by far!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a book about plain and clear true love. It tells the story about how much two people can love each other. A young girl named Buttercup becomes the most beautiful girl in the world. She can have any man she wants but she chooses a poor farm boy named Weasly. It may sound like a silly choice but she loves him as much as he loves her. Then a tragedy occurs and her love is thought to be lost forever. She dies in her soul and decides to marry a rich but evil prince.What has happened to her love, Weasly. Will she marry the evil prince? What lies ahead in Buttercup's future? This book will make you laugh and make you cry. The author blends humor with love to make a wonderful and touching story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Anyone who says they disliked this book should be institutionalized. It is a beautiful, yet quirky story with highly evolved characters. You become attached to it the minute you open the book. I could live without William Goldman's narration, and I'm still questioning the truth of his supposedly non-fiction excerpts, but still, this book will change your life."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman is a great screenwriter and an OK novelist. His novels I can generally take or leave, but this book I just have to own. It combines the novel and screenwritting techniques and the product is uniquely enjoyable. I usually read all the way through it in one sitting, totally neglecting all other aspects of my life until I have finished it. Few books grip me that way, but this is one of them. It is a fairy tale with some unique elements that make it hilarious and breathtaking. It doesnt take itself too seriously, allowing for some great humor and unexpected sequences. Even so, you care about the story and the characters, and the humor doesnt make a mockery of larger themes in the story. This book is unlike anything else in my collection and I reccommend you add it to yours. Of course, the movie is really great too. Of course, you should try to find the unabridged version by S. Morganstern, and while you are doing that you can can book your cruise to the country of Florin and visit Morganstern's childhood home. Wink, nudge."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"When I was much younger, I saw the movie and fell in love with it. I wanted to read the book, but I couldn't find it in print. Thank goodnes they release the 25th anniversary edition of the book. Lucky enough, my husband gave it to me as an anniversary present. If you love the movie, read the book. IT ADDS to the experience. Only one thing.. good luck finding the &quot;reunion scene&quot;. Otherwise, this book doesn't disappoint. I recommend it for romance and adventurers everywhere."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Revenge, pirates, damsels in distress, vicious animals, good guys, bad guys, giants and a couple of guys who are pretty darn good with swords, this book's got it all. Whether you're a fan of the movie, or just happened upon this book, I can guarantee you will like it,no matter if you're a fan of romance, action, suspense or comedy. William Goldman combines all 4 into one story you'll want to read over and over - I've gone through 4 copies, myself......GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Buttercup is a pretty young woman who orders her family's farm worker, named Westley, around until she realizes she loveshim, and he loves her back. They plan to get married, but Westley is too poor to support Buttercup, so he joins a ship to make some money. His ship is attacked at sea by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who takes no surviors. Buttercup goes into mourning for five years, until Prince Humperdinck decides he wants her as his bride. Buttercup accepts, because though she still loves Westley, he is dead, and besides, you can't really refuse to marry the heir to the throne. Buttercup gets engaged to Humperdinck, but on a ride in the woods she gets kidnapped by Vizzini, an wicked Sicilian who wants to start a war between Florin (the country this takes place in) and Gilder (a neighboring country). A mysterious man in black follows Vizzini, and the results are very surprising. The journey takes place through the Cliffs of Insanity, the Zoo of Death, and many other interesting places.This is one of the best books I have read in my entire life! From the review, it seems serious, but this book is anything but that. The author interrupts the story a few times with personal remarks (which are all made up, by the way) about when he was a kid and his father read this book to him, and remarks about the original \\"S. Morgenstern\\" version (which also never exsisted). This book is so great, if you don't already own it, you should rush out and buy it immediately. It is definately worth the [money] you pay for it, and you will read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is one of the top ten books (my list) of all time. I first read it as a child, then in college and many times since then, and now my son will soon fall under its enchantment. Forget the movie, which wasn't too bad, and get a copy of this truly astounding piece of literature and you'll cry tears of anger, of joy and of terror. Everything is here, from the world's most beautiful woman, to the greatest swordsman in the world, to terrible and evil bad guys, funny ones, dead heros and many more pages full of great words that no movie can aptly describe."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was introduced to the story, like many, many others via the movie. My husband and I (just dating then) fell in love with it so much that we even have a line engraved in our wedding rings--&quot;As you wish...&quot; For our anniversary one year, I bought the book for him and we really, really enjoyed it. It was probably the most romantic gift I ever gave him. There's something for everyone in this book--fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, true love, you name it. I do not enjoy romance novels, but even someone who indulges in something as trivial as that genre will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is one of the best books I have ever read. Once I got started I found it hard to put down. I have never been a big reader, in fact I hate to Read. But I found myself cought up in this book. I read in 3 days. It is a great story of True love and how people fight to hold on to it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am 14 and this is my favorite book. It has everything a book should, and on top of that the writing could not BE any better! It's exciting, it DOES have a plot, a very good one at that, great heroes, great villains, and Great Humor. In a few words: The Best Book EVER!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a great book. Better than the movie; it goes into more detail."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This has got to be one of my all-time favorite books (and movies!) The dialogue and background text is snappy and smart. The action flows smoothly and the descriptions are vivid. My only complaint is that it ends - will there actually be a sequel sometime? I certainly hope so."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I really liked the beginning. Buttercup reminds me of myself. The book is about girl who falls in love with the farm boy and becomes the prettiest in the whole world and then becomes a princess. I really don't have a Favorite part yet but I just adore the book. I recommend this book of feelings to everyone. It is so good that I can't wait to get to 1st period to listen to my teacher read it out loud."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Now, don't get me wrong, I love the movie version of this novel, but there is so much humor an wit in the novel that can't be translated in the movie! The way Goldman treats his story as an update of a forgotten classic is so clever, and I loved the way he kept &quot;interrupting&quot; the text to chip in his opinion. I especially like the way the characters are developed more deeply in the novel, and how there are aspects of Buttercup and Westley's relationship that aren't presented in the movie. I think that any age could enjoy this story, although some younger readers might have problems discerning the story from the &quot;editor's comments&quot;. This is a great book to read out loud, since it is so enjoyable for all involved."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The story in this book is excellent, one of the best in its genre. However, I don't like the way that the author toys with the readers regarding the supposed origins of the book. Clearly Goldman wrote this book himself, not the misterious Morgenstern, and it's not at all abridged.Anyone living in Europe knows that Florine and Guilder are not countries, but Dutch currency. It was fun at first, but after hundreds of pages of clear lies, I got fed up with it. He goes way too far, involving Stephen King as supposed abridger for the followup, and lawyers suing him for profeting on the non-existant Morgensterns work and so on.If he would have left out the abridgement parts this would clearly have become a classic book, and I would have given it a 5 star rating.Buy it - read it, but skip all the abridgement comments."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've followed the literary career of William Goldman ever since &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;, &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Boys and Girls Together&quot;. This extraordinarily gifted novelist/essayist/screenwriter has done more to open my mind and warm my heart than anyone or anything over the past three decades.Since I was already familiar with Mr. Goldman's work, I grabbed up &quot;the Princess Bride&quot; when it hit the local library in 1973 (many, many years before Rob Reiner's movie version). I was expecting an enjoyable tale, filled with wry humor and pathos and the kinds of intricately woven twists and turns of plot that are his trademark. However, none of his previous novels prepared me for this book... I was, quite simply, blown away.The only regret I have is that I never got to read Bill's version of the reunion scene between Buttercup and Westley (blame it on Kermit Shog and the Morganstern estate).*sigh* Well, life isn't fair..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What I found most sad about this book was that I COULD have liked it so much. I did enjoy it, very much, but because of one main flaw, I'm unable to give it more than two stars. William Goldman, for all his comedic ability, is sexist.I am not the sort of person to denounce people as sexist at the drop of a hat. But Buttercup, as the main (only?) female character in the whole work, is constantly portrayed as stupid, Westley-dependent, helpless, useless, and above all utterly irritating. Westley is constantly deriding her intelligence (not that I blame him) and you can almost hear the author snickering in the prose whenever he mentions her. Westley is the hero, and he loves her passionately -- but why, exactly? She's pretty. Absolutely nothing else. A pretty face with an empty head does not a good wife (or person) make, especially when it's supposed to be True Love that somehow transcends petty things like, oh, actually enjoying the company of the other person.I liked the movie, I must say that. (Though I was about to scream when Westley was being attacked by the R.O.U.S. and Buttercup is standing there, her hand over her mouth, in something that I'm sure was supposed to be terror but ended up looking more like \\"Oh dear! My love's getting killed -- I do hope he manages, and that my skirt won't get splattered with blood!\\")As I said before, I am the last person to denounce someone as sexist on a whim. Maybe Goldman thought it would be funny to create such a stupid character, but if it were a parody he should have at least included another female character to parallel Buttercup. As it was, I finished the book feeling annoyed, angry, and cheated.Rating: Average"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read the 30th anniversary edition. In my opinion, this book would have been far better if the authors interjection's had been about half. In each release, he add a bit more, so perhaps the first edition would be the best version to read. Alternately, just skip the italicized script. It only detracts."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I had never read the book that was the inspiration for the classic movie starring Cary Elwes and Robin Wright. Finally, I was able to borrow it from my school library about a week ago today and a month or two after a friend of mine bought the movie for me (please see my review of the film for my take on it). I skipped the lengthy and unneeded prologue (that was fine for novels like \\"Waverly, Or 'Tis Sixty Years Since\\" or books like \\"A Walk To Remember,\\" \\"Message In A Bottle,\\" \\"The Guardian,\\" etc, but for a book like this that has a massive following thanks to the movie-PLEASE! Skip to the good stuff). SPOILER ALERT! The book fills in the circumstances surrounding the characters & the backstories that we either don't see (it's explained through dialogue in the movie) or discarded altogether for the film. It does a good job of that. However, I HATED the scene in Humperdinck's bedroom when Westley calls Buttercup\\"Baggage\\" and a little later when he asks her to tie the prince up and she asks why, '' 'Woman,' he roared, 'You are the property of the Dread Pirate Roberts and you will do as I say.' '' ABSOLUTELY UNNECCESSARY, as well as several bits involving Miracle Max and his wife (\\"I have to belch my witch,\\" etc). The movie was MUCH BETTER. In short, read it if you want further details that the movie leaves out, some neccessary and some totally extraneous & chauvanistic. Rated PG for some violence."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is an honest and old-fashioned adventure. The bride of the title is Buttercup, the most beautiful girl in the world, soon to be married to Prince Humperdinck - too bad she's in love with Westley, the farm boy. Before you reach the end, you've come to know an evil Sicilian criminal mastermind, a Spanish fencing wizard, a gentle Turkish giant and many other memorable characters.It's not just a funny adventure, there's an additional metafictional level. As the story goes, William Goldman didn't write the book: it's an abridgement of a book written by S. Morgenstern. Every now and then Goldman pops in the story, interrupts and discusses some details of Morgenstern's work he disagrees with and has cut off. I'm fairly sure some people will dislike that, but to me, it was the thing that made Princess Bride shine.It was good, but not spectacular - I don't quite get the amazingly good reviews at Amazon, for example. It was funny, definitely, but not hilarious. The book is oozing good one-liners, that I admit. So, if you're looking for adventure, romance and excitement, The Princess Bride is certainly a good choice."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's great that people appreciate the book for what it is, but somehow I think there is more to it than true love and adventure. It's a satire, right? SO what is Goldman really saying about fairytales? Buttercup is as fickle as any, yet her \\"true love\\" is the type that can conquer death. It's about our ideals, what we have made them. I'm not saying you have to agree with me, I'd just like you to think about what Goldman is really saying about love."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"THIS IS AN EDITED VERSION WHICH I GUESS I WASN'T AWARE OF. I DON'T MIND THAT THIS EDITOR IS TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM READING PARTS OF THE BOOK HE FOUND BORING BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE READ THEM. READING THIS BOOK IS JUST LIKE WATCHING THE MOVIE. THIS MAN IS THE SAME MAN THAT WROTE THE SCREEN PLAY FOR THE MOVIE SO ALL THE THINGS HE FOUND INTERESTING ENOUGH TO PUT IN THE MVIE ARE ALSO LEFT IN THE BOOK. EVERYHING ELSE HAS BEEN REMOVED. HE'S ALSO A SPOILER. IF YOU'RE READING THIS BOOK AND DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE STORY YOU WILL NEED TO SKIP ALL THE INTERUPTED EDITOR NOTES THROUGH OUT THE BOOK. HE TELLS YOU A LOT OF WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF YOU READ IT FIRST THEN DESCUSS IT. I OVEER ALL THOUGH THE BOOK WAS GOOD BUT ONLY THE ORGINAL PARTS THAT MORGENSTERN WROTE HIMSELF. MY ADVICE IS TO GET ANOTHER COPY OF JUST THE ORGINAL, NO THIS ONE."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book not only deserves 0 stars...IT DESERVES NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS! This book is the absolute worst book I have ever read! (Just for your reference... there is NO love and NO high adventure in this book!) It only has stupid interuptions from the author. There is only one good thing about this book: the characters are so unrealistic that they are funny. Many times, I found myself laughing becuase of the stupidity of it all. Read this book if you want a laugh. Otherwise... Please, please, please, for the sake of the sanity of the world DON'T READ THIS BOOK! I guarantee that you WILL regret it. (Another thing just for your reference... this book has no plot)Do yourself a favor...DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the movie then I had to read the book and fell in love with it. I raved about it to any friend who would listen. The book has an extra special quality that is hard to describe to others. Of course I knew Florin was not real and I suspected something was amiss when I received Goldman's letter but I swallowed the whole Morgenstern story hook line and sinker. I can't believe it! I have been searching for the S. Morgenstern book for years in used book stores. I am SO sad. I don't know how I will ever be able to read the book again with this new knowledge--the italics were almost the best part of the book. Would a really good novelist out there please consider writing the original S. Morgenstern's book for me. I still can't believe Goldman made the whole thing up."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Some people say that the movies is better than the book, and some say the books better, but personally I think they are both the best ever made. Speaking as someone who can recite every word in both the book and movie, READ THIS BOOK! Then go out and rent the movie. The emotional attachment that you have with every character in the book is remarkable. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life and will want to read over and over again. I have! (Ten times in four years.)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's been some time since I read this book, but I browsed these reviews when I recognized the title. Goldman writing is excellent, and yes, its a good story, but you can get the story from the movie in under two hours. The book is quite complicated with an excellent, almost cynical theme. It deals with an adult's reflections on the fantasies of his childhood from the perspective of the grownup world. Life isn't fair, and everyone lives happily ever after, until. . . . Still and all, the narrator feels obligated to tell the &quot;good parts&quot; of this fictional history, showing the continuing allure that our youthful fantasies still hold, and our wish that life could be a fairy taleJust for the record, of course Morgenstern, Guilder and Florin aren't real. Where did you learn history and geography?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!!

However, did none of you notice that the book came out in 87, when the movie came out in 87 as well? The &quot;book&quot; was a screenplay first, then turned in to a book. Second: S. Morganstern NEVER existed. &quot;Why can't I find the 'first' addition of The Princess Bride?&quot; you ask yourself. It's because William Goldman wrote the whole story, and the history, give him the credit that is needed!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is one of my favorite books.

I'm only 18 1/2, but I've read since I was 3 years old. I discovered the movie long before I discovered the book, and I love them both soo much! I didn't think anything could surpass the film, but the book had more of everything. The story truly has it all, and makes you laugh over and over, and over. Buy the book, see the movie, and enjoy yourself immensly!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Princess Bride surpassed my dreams. I grew up watching the movie, but not until recently did I find that it was based on this novel. It gave a shred of hope in a society where life is confusing and nothing is certain. It promised life wouldn't be fair but that it would be fairer than death. This has helped me stop waiting for life to help me while I make sure life helps others. This is the greatest love tale of all time, an epic adventure and a laugh-out-loud til you make a fool of yourself book.

The soundtrack is sooooo relaxing. I call them my calming trio. I'll read the book with the soundtrack playing (soothing music) and then put in the movie when no-one is around.

Morganstern's classic really exists."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman has found the balance between a good storytelling and commentary. If you're a fan of fairytales, this is the book for you. If you are a fan of adventure, this is the book for you. If you are a fan of romance, this is the book for you. In other words, this book can fill whatever need you have. Light hearted and funny, it incorporates a thread of the importance and constancy of the oral tradition without making an issue of it. Boys love it, girls love it, and I certainly think that you will love it, too. The movie was great, but the book is ten times better. Don't pass this one by. A quick note...send for the free reunion scene, it's great"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I managed to see the movie about two years after it came out. It took me over four years to find the book, but I finally suceeded. If you can manage to avoid the whining and crying of Goldman, then the book will be a welcome addition to your library. Perhaps some of us would like to see the full Morganstern version. Morganstern used a wonderful blend of comedy and subtle sarcasm to make it always entertaining. The only reason why I give The Princess Bride a 9 instead of a 10 is the slaughter of the book by Goldman. How many of us really wanted to know he didn't love his wife, or his son was fat. It had nothing to do with the book. Possibly when he is dying alone and unloved, he will realize what a waste of human flesh he is"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman's novel of true love and adventure is a classic &quot;play within a play&quot; that touches and amuses at every level. His 20th century life dilemmas (fat kid, cold wife, starlet impotence) are played out with Goldman's typical biting humor. The touching remembrances of his immigrant father reading the &quot;good parts&quot; version of S. Morgenstern's classic political satire is such a sensitive juxtaposition to the thrilling adventures and passions of Wesley and Buttercup that the reader is constantly torn between the gripping drama and the need to get back to whichever level of the book is not being addressed. Will Wesley survive? Will young Billy recover? Not to be missed.p.s. A decent movie endeavored to capture this magic, but as with most great books, it fell short of that goal. Read the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"When the news came that Westley was dead, Buttercupthought everything was over.

It was, bar none, the finest, funniest fencing scene I had ever read, and I burned to read it. I searched nonstop for 6 months, haunting used bookstores and calling in favors from multi-national friends before I finally found a dog-eared copy with half the cover gone.It was fantastic. Everything I had hoped for, all the humor and adventure and even some deep stuff in there about the human spirit and True Love, combined with the flush of discovery and triumph.A year later the movie came out and the book was everywhere. Ah, well.If you enjoyed the movie you cannot help but fall in love with the book. It remains one of the few I re-read every year and I continue to loan them out to friends and family."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have no problem admiting that \\"The Princess Bride\\" is my favorite movie of all time. I was a little skepticle about reading the book because I didn't want to ruin my love for the movie. Boy, was I ever wrong.This book is just what the doctor ordered for any fan of the movie. It has all of the character background information that the movie lacks, not to mention continuing past the end of the movie....until the birth of Buttercup's Baby. It is true that the book is much darker than the movie (i.e. Pit of Dispare = Zoo of Death), but it's not distasteful. After finishing the book, I put it away with a new love for the story, but I did not loose any love for the movie since it is so different in mood and detail that the book.I have read the book a few times now and every time I do, I then immediately watch the movie with equal zest. The book is a fabulous read for anyone with a passion for a great story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of those books that makes the next book you read automatically forgettable. I suspect that people of all ages would enjoy it, although I'm only one age so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.Like many people, I saw the Princess Bride movie before reading the book. The movie, of course, is a classic as well, and anyone who liked it should like the book even more. Unless you're an idiot.The book and the movie share the same lightness and humor, but the book gives more detail on the backgrounds of the characters, and also has more developed \\"present-day\\" parts. The interruptions by the author in the narrative are hilarious and remind me a bit of Nabokov's Pale Fire, although not with so much digression. Maybe it only reminds me of Pale Fire because that was the last book I read before The Princess Bride."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The first section of this book is a little difficult to get through when you are expecting the adventure to begin. Realize, Goldman is laying the satire on thick. He is describing a book from his youth that does not exist - it is the book he is writing for his daughters. Given all of that absurdity at the beginning I was only too happy to finally get into the story itself about - you guessed it - the Princess Bride.While the Zoo of Death was enjoyable (especially Inigo's and Fezziks adventures there) and I did like the background stories on the characters I found the book a little full of itself. While the movie pulls it off with the interruptions (dialog between the boy and his grandfather)the book just sort of comes off with this smug feeling - yes Goldman we get the fact that you are lampooning overly detailed stories, but by driving home your point you also make us want to skim past the boring parts in your &quot;abridged&quot; version.The big lesson Goldman is trying to teach the reader is: &quot;Life is not always fair. Accept that fact and get on with it.&quot; This theme was given similar exercise in the author's &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's the Princess Bride whats not to love"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Funny, interseting and one of the greatest books in the world.

Maybe you had to read this book in the pre-ironic mid-70s for that to be a big deal, but it was for me.

It has everything: sword fights, kidnapping, romance, nasty monarchs, danger, you name it.

Read all of the reviews below that only gave one, two, or three stars. Go ahead, I'll wait here......... Morgenstern does not exist!! The entire story was written by Goldmen. Yet people keep writing, &quot;The original is so much better.&quot; What original? There isn't one. I love that. Some of these idiots are claiming that they have a copy of the full length version, which doesn't exist. They hate Goldmen for ruining Morgenstern's classic, which they love. And yet that 'classic' does not exist, and the parts that they love so much were written by Goldmen, whom they hate. Now that's irony. As for why Goldmen did what he did: it's art. Read this book, if you don't like Goldmen's comments, good for you. But if you do get it, get the 1998 hardcover. It includes the first chapter to the long lost sequel, &quot;Buttercup's Baby....&quot; I pray that Goldmen finishes the sequel."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the book... it was great, it was wonderful!

Morgenstern. Like many other people, I have to admit, I felt rather betrayed and let down when I discovered there was no Morgenstern. But it makes me admire Goldman all the more, having his own private joke against the many many readers of this story. As the description says, it's about everything. Suspense, wit, humor, and romance saturate this story. It would be interesting to have a &quot;Morgenstern copy,&quot; just for the sake of owning an &quot;original.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A wonderful book filled with amazing characters, an interesting plot and a wonder streak of wit."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read this book in 1976, long before Rob Reiner ever thought of making it a movie. Though I typically love the written material that he chooses to make movies of, this one was special. I was a senior in college, and suffering from the insomnia that accompanies graduation to the real world. The parties, the fun, the last-minute cramming - it was a world of it's own and it was ending. The Princess Bride is the book that gave me insight into the next real world I was facing. The one that William Goldman states is unfair. Bad things happen to good people, etc. etc. No surprise there. But, the other half of the equation, the most important half, is: life may not be fair, but it does go on. Life goes on, even with the bad - and people survive. The way to live it is with a sense of humor and optimism. Sometimes wiggling a finger is enough! If you are going to graduate college this year, or if you need to regain a perspective on the reality of life and the importance of humor or if you want to appreciate why wiggling a finger is enough - READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"it was a fast paced high scale adventure of monumental proportion"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If someone asks me what my favorite book in the whole world is I look at him and say: &quot;Why, The Princess Bride, naturely.&quot; After purchasing the movie and watching it for no less than 200 times (memorizing it by heart) I finally understood that what I had been focusing on was the short version of this hilarious tale. I then purchased this book and after lending it to someone I purchased it again, and again, and again. To date, this book is so precious to me that no one gets to have it but me!!!

I haven't been this disappointed since I bought The Natural, (another screenplay that out did the original). William Goldman wrote the screenplay so I have no fault with him but where the movie was sharp and crisp, the book was too wordy, and (apparently only to me) lacking in virtually all I found romantic and exciting in my pre-reading the book experiences of The Princess Bride. I'm sure no one will find this review helpful but atleast I know that Mr Goldman can write a damn good screenplay from a subpar original story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"OK, so am I the only one who's actually been to Florin? It's a lovely country with the most beautiful women in the whole world.If you are ever there, go to the library and check out Morgenstern's original. Since every Florinese person has read the book hundreds of times there are a ton of copies at the library and you can always get one. Unfortunately, there's not enough demand in the US so they won't export it. The original is SOOO much better. Goldman seems to think he has all the answers to what's good and what isn't. The long section of all the festivities before the wedding is dripping with sarcasm and hilarity and yet Goldman feels we Americans can't read it because we'd be bored. Well boo on Goldman! I loved that chapter!Anyway, the original would get 5 stars if they'd ever export it to the US. Save yourself the anguish in this shameless abridgment and spend a few hundred dollars and fly to Florin, you'll thank me later."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As much as I truly love the story, I can't reread it often. The actual bits of story are delightful and inspired, with brilliant humour and heart-pounding action. It's not the story itself, or the writing style that I have a problem with- it's the author's endless injections.He goes on, sometimes for a page and a half in places, at times just when you were getting into the story, or during the action. And all he ever does is whine. I'm quite tired of hearing about his loveless marriage and fat son. And that's not the worst of it. The worst is his condescending \\"life's not fair\\" speeches EVERY TIME he has to butt in. He gets incredibly preachy, and it's frustrating. After reading it, I felt kind of cheated. The story is so wonderful, and his interruptions ruin it for me. If the made a version without, the whole thing would be much improved."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This abridgement was acceptable, though he did leave out some of the best bits. At least he quoted the original from time to time. Though I'm not sure I like his characterization of the original text."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The \\"Princess\\" is Buttercup, a beautiful young girl who lives with her parents on a farm in the fictitious country of Florin, where old Lotharon and Bella are King and Queen. She falls in love with her family's \\"Farm Boy\\" named Westley, who also adores her. He then leaves to seek his fortune in America so they can marry, but she later receives word that his ship is attacked at sea by the Dread Pirate Roberts and assumes that Westley is dead. After several years, Buttercup agrees to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, the heir to the throne of Florin. But before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a trio of outlaws, the Sicilian criminal genius Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the giant Turkish wrestler Fezzik. However, a masked \\"Man in Black\\" follows them up the Cliffs of Insanity. In the ensuing battles, Inigo and Fezzik are defeated and Vizzini is killed. But why was Buttercup kidnapped in the first place? Who is this mysterious \\"Man in Black\\" and what are his plans? And will the Prince ever find Buttercup to marry her?This fantasy novel, combining elements of comedy, adventure, romance, satire, and fairy tale, is said to be a spoof of swashbuckler movies. Author William Goldman is primarily a Hollywood screenwriter who is best known for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men. Several years ago, some friends of ours brought us the 1987 film by Rob Reiner that is based on the book, and except for one little scene through which they fast forwarded, I think because of the language, we enjoyed the movie, and I have always wanted to read the book. The plot of the novel is sometimes a little confusing with all the flashbacks, sub-plots, and Goldman's \\"commentary\\" asides. In this respect, the movie is perhaps a little easier to understand than the book because the former follows the action more directly. It would appear that Goldman is a much better screenwriter than he is a novelist. The Princess Bride is presented as Goldman's abridgment of an older version by \\"S. Morgenstern\\", which was originally supposed to be a satire of the excesses of European royalty but is in fact entirely Goldman's work. Both Morgenstern and the \\"original version\\" are fictional and used as a literary device. Goldman's personal life, as described in the introduction and commentary of the novel, is also fictional.The basic theme of the book seems to be that \\"life isn't fair,\\" and the narrative sometimes tends towards \\"absurdism,\\" a form of literature which has never really interested me. There is a great deal of bad language in the book, more than I remember in the film, with cursing (the \\"h\\" and \\"d\\" words appear occasionally), profanity (the terms God and Jesus are frequently used as interjections), and assorted crudities (such as calling someone an a**hole and a \\"son of a b****, as well as even using the \\"s\\" word once--by a kid, no less). I guess that it doesn't surprise me that a modern Hollywood screenwriter would do this and somehow consider his work as \\"a traditional piece of children's literature.\\" Uh, I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend the book for children. In addition to the language, there are scenes of heavy drinking and drunkenness, and at least a couple of threats of suicide. Children can read about how \\"life isn't fair\\" without all that baggage. The latest edition also contains the purported abridgement of the first chapter of the sequel, Buttercup's Baby. At the end are some \\"Questions and topics for discussion,\\" but honestly, even though there is an interesting story hidden in there somewhere, I really don't see anything that is actually worth discussing."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this movie!!! So when I started reading this book I expected it to be like the movie! It just didn't keep my interest."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Let me start by saying that I love the movie of The Princess Bride, always have, and always will. As I usually think that books are better than movies, the obvious conclusion would be that I love this book. Right? Wrong. The story is wonderful, just as it is in the movie, but I am totally sick of hearing about Billy Goldman's personal life from why he divorced his wife to why he hates his son. Please! Let's just stick to the story. They call this the good parts version, but the real good parts version doesn't have Billy Goldman in it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"In the movie they left out the Zoo of death which would have made the video a whole lot better, because they would have seen how good prince humperdinck was of a tracker and the pit of despair was just to dull. The albino in the movie got knocked out and didnt help Inigo and Fezzik which didnt give any credit to the albino because he was always trying to help westley. prince humperdinck should have been a fat man with a bad temper and always looked mad because in the movie he was not fat and was not mad all the time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have read the book The Princess Bride. I could not put it down I thought that is was the best book I have ever read. My favorite character would have to be Buttercup. I usually don't go for the main character. She is my favorite because she is just a charactor everyone will and does love. In the story you could almost feel like you are really there with the charactors through the exitement. I felt like crying when Westley died, and when Buttercup chose Prince Humperdink over her true love. I realy got into everyhting when the fencing went on, and the fighting, and even when the poison part came. I was realy exited at the part when Buttercup foud out that the man that had kidnapped her from her kidnappers was Westley. I realy thought that it was real clever when S. Morgenstern had made some parts in the book sound like they were real, like when a lady booed at the princess I thought that was real but it was just a dream. i like Westly to he is also one of my favorite charactors because I like it how he can never die and when he does die he comes back to life, and he hardly ever feels pain. i also like Fizzik, i like him because he is a giant an dhe is nice and i think that that is ironic, because he is a giant and he is nice and usualy when you here about giants in a fairy tale thay are big mean and ugly, not nice. Inigo is also a great charactor, he is a great fencer, and the way he helped Westley and Buttercup was realy cool. i do not like Prince Humperdink! i think he mean and i did not think that the prince could be so eveil, but, I guess every fairy tale has to have a villin or two. Vizzini is a great villin, he is sneaky and crool. Count Rugen is a good villin to he is also sneaky and crool. I think this book is great for people that like a book filled with adventure and magic and true love, i recomend this book for kids ranging from 14-older."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Oh my, Mr. Goldman is one amazing writer!!! Full of humorous scenarios, characters, dialogues and one amazing imagination!! I can't wait to watch the movie version, and well, since the screenplay is also written by William Goldman, its gonna be excellent!! Anyway let's discuss the plot!!Westley is a handsome farm boy who works for Buttercup (the love of his life) 's father. When Buttercup tells Westley that she is in love with him, he decides that it is time for him to go off to America and earn money so that he and Buttercup can settle down nicely. When he doesn't return, and gossip is spread by word that Westley has been killed by a pirate, Buttercup's heart dies too. She then is forced to marry Prince Humperdink. At this time, Buttercup is the most beautiful woman in the world, so it is not odd that a Prince would want her hand in marriage. As the days are counting down for the couple to marry, Buttercup gets kidnapped by three men. Scared, well not really scared, but worried as to how long this kidnap would take, a man in black comes to the rescue, however Buttercup does not really know this, since she is blindfolded. Well anyway, to get to Buttercup, the man in black has to surpass the three men - one at a time! First up is Inigo, one of the skinnest men out there, but an excellent fencer (he is the man that wants to revenge his father's death). A genuinely nice guy, honest, and sweet, just confused on who is the good guy in this case. Well anyway, the man in black conquers Inigo (does not kill him!!!) and moves on to the next man. Up next is Fezzik, a humongous giant, who is 100% innocent, and adorable. His strength is... well strength/power/muscle. He can knock down trees, and his arms will never get tired! Somehow, someway, the man in black surpasses him (I won't say anything it will ruin the plot!) And last but not least, is the man with the smartest brains. This guy is pure evil, not nice at all! Well the man in black is one courageous guy, and manages to outsmart him!!!! Amazing. after he saves Buttercup, she soon realizes who it is, and she is terribly happy, and soon they are trying to escape the Prince who is hot on their tail. They run into the swamp (a fire swamp - no one can get out of there alive) and come across many R.O.U.S (Rodents of unusual size), and how they still survive is wonderful and terribly romantic. However with honor and duty, Buttercup returns to Prince Humperdink, and the man in black, whom we now know is Westley is put in jail, where he is tormented by the Prince and his subordinate, Count Regen (the evilest man of all!!) How Westley and Buttercup find each other again is so sweet!! Inigo and Fezzik come back, save Westley, and all three of end up working together to beat the evil forces!!!Can't say no more, read it! You will be glad you did!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Believe it or not, the book is even better than the film.

This book is really great. If you've already seen the movie, this book is a must read. There are many interruptions throughout the book made by the author/&quot;abridger&quot; which may seem at first confusing, but these interruptions prove most useful and give information not included in the movie.

I did always wonder why Goldman's name was so large and Morgenstern's so small but now that I know that there is no S. Morgenstern I get it, I also get the rather modern twist on the classic princess story. I advise you to skip that Italic portions and just read that story. I also reccomend not buying the 25 anniversary edition, I did because I thought Buttercup's Baby was included but it was just the first chapter and even that wasn't very good. I recommend just buying the paperback or better yet get it from the Library because it is not worth the money. I really did like the movie though (which I thought was just as good as the book) and I think the story is great, but there are better books out there. My favorite line is &quot;Life is pain Highness, and anybody who tells you differently is selling something.&quot; (not an exact quote) I also enjoyed Buttercup's dumb blond personality, sorry if I offended anyone by using the term dumb blond. I don't mean to sound to negative here I really did enjoy &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; I would probably recommend for some afternoon when you are bored and want some funny entertainment because it is funny, also skip the introduction chapter (I quit half way through and went to the real first chapter) it is not worth reading.

There's only something like 7 or so chapters but it is a handy feature to have when trying to find specific parts of the story and the lack of them in this book given the previously mentioned long (and in my opinion uninteresting) prologue made it a challenge to navigate to the first chapter to begin the actual story.To clarify the story is a 5, but this digital copy is a 4."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of the most increadible books I have read in a long time.

It was an instant classic to me. It was perfectly set. It is a true classic. The story, &quot; The Princess Bride&quot; is about the most beautiful woman in the world falling in love with a lowly and poor farm boy, but when Buttercup ( The most beautiful woman in the world) is told by Wesley (The poor farm boy) that he is going to America to seek his fortune, her heart is shattered at the thought of loosing her one and true love. He says that he will return but she is not so sure, but deals with it the best way she knows how, but when she finds out that the ship, that is to take him to his fortune in America, is attacked by the one and only, &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; (That never takes prisoners) she vows never to love again (The story does go on of course but I won't spoil it for you, that would ruin the whole point of this review, which I may remind you is to get you interested in reading the book) So now onto the part about what I think is the best part in this truly amazing book. My favorite part (Which comes later on in the story) is when Buttercup is captured and destined to die, but help comes from the most unlikely place, &quot;The Man in Black.&quot; The end was great, but also in a sense..... not so great. The ending is, like most books, the way it is supposed to be, but what's up with the pill though? (People that haven't read the book won't understand this so you might want to go on, but if you want, to read it.) It is supposed to last only for 45 minutes, and then he was supposed to die again, which he did, but he came alive again. What is up with that, if someone would like to explain go ahead, cause i sure would like to know. That's, really the only reason i didn't like the ending, but for the most part it was great. This book is great, I recommend it for anyone, and I mean it.

As with any book it is easily said it is better than the movie ( which is a pretty great movie). Having not know anything about the book before I started reading it to my kids I was surprised to learn the the story is abridged. According to the editors comments made though out the book he is trying to reproduce his experience of being read the story by his grandfather while he was sick. These breaks and edits to the story are great and it makes since now that the movie was filmed the way it was. However I find some of the comments in the book run on too long and are to personal to the author. It would be best if you are going to read it to yourself. However it has been a really enjoyable book to read to the kids. It really adds to the experience to follow the edits and end the nights reading at certain cliffhangers rather than the end of a chapter. I wish now that I had read the book first so that I was aware of some of these edits. Rather than reading the editors comments it would be nice to have more of a \\"script\\" to go by that would add to the drama of the book and make the experience of the listeners more like what the editor experienced as a kid ( or the kid's experience in the movie). Fun book. I just wish I knew more about the unique style this story is being told. The original story is interesting but having the story read to you by someone who knows where to embellish, when to announce that parts are being skipped ( and why), where to pause for the evening, and taking advantage knowing the story makes this a fun book to read to others."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Let see there revenge fighting kissing more fighting magic and miraclesEach character is essential to the other.Have fun storming the castle"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Very enjoyable read. The book is light in tone, and one progresses through it quickly and easily.

I found myself skimming over those, with little to no impact on understanding the story. Further, I was a bit puzzled by the direction chosen for some parts of the story.However, overall thoroughly enjoyable book.

The Princess Bride is an epic tale of heros, villains, monsters, true love, kings, farm boys, and princesses. Although very different from the movie, the book contains the same continuous humor, action, and romance. I highly recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I had initially hoped that this special 25th Anniversary Edition was the one with the red text differentiating between Goldman's writing and &quot;Morgenstern's&quot;. Alas, it isn't. Still, it's good to at last have a hardbound copy of one of my favorite all-time books, and 23-pages of backstory leading up to the &quot;Buttercup's Baby&quot; section is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was one of the best I've read! I love the inishal story, I love when he decribes how when his father read it to him it changed his life (witch was made up by the way) I love Indigo's life story the most I love this book!The pretheses at the begining had be laughing out loud(this was after stew, but everything is when man cralled out of the primortal muck he had stew.) (This was after taxes, taxes were before stew)The whole ending was fantasic! Read this book you won't be disapointed!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I honestly loved the story line, i think it is the best plot in the world, but it can be written so much better. We could have had more on the settings as in the descriptions. The way Mr. Goldman had his italics bits were fine but it seems so strange with all the action (actually they could have done more to the action too) going on and suddenly say something rather inappropriate. The main problem was all the missing descriptions. From beginning till end I didn't find out anything about Westly's eyes except for that they were the &quot;color of the sea before a storm&quot;, and anything about Buttercup's hair but the &quot;color of Autumn&quot;. I mean, where's the imagination? I still love the story but if I were to write it I feel I could do so much better."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman wasn't content to write a fairy tale. But he couldn't decide whether to write a satire, a parody or a pastiche. So the tone of this story wanders around as he tries to do them all. You get the impression that this is an author who smirks at himself when he walks by a mirror.Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of wonderful invention here. The movie, made much later, chose the straight romantic fairy tale for the most part, with only Billy Crystal as Miracle Max sounding a sardonic note. The book wanders from tone to tone. True romance here, irony there, recurring satire scattered about and &quot;wink wink nudge&quot; parody when the narrative sags.The book is okay, but I found the clash in tones very distracting and the air of condescension annoying. Terry Pratchett can write parody without sounding smug; Goldman could not.Some of the ideas Goldman brought to the book are quite good. Everything we really know about Westley, for example, we learn from seeing him defeat seemingly invincible villains. That's new and interesting. But then Goldman undercuts his good efforts with another elbow in our ribs telling us not to take any of this seriously. It left me wishing he'd please make up his mind.See the movie; skip the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm surprised it pretty much was exactly like the movie, as most books turned into movies differ. There is a little background info here and there in it that is not in the movie. But I can't stay I was happy with the fact that the introduction was like 15% of the beginning and boring, and the last 20% was again not really the main story. The author blabbering for (%6) & the sequel \\"Buttercups Baby\\" for (%14)...and the whole finial bit was mainly the author talking a bunch of BS again. The actual story to Buttercups baby was all supernaturally done, it wasn't what I was expecting, and I really didn't care that it was left unfinished because it didn't strike me as a good story.It annoys me how the author makes up a bunch of stuff about himself throwing it in here and there. Tells us what to expect in the upcoming chapter and what not to expect. Like \\"hello just let me read the damn thing myself!\\" I know this is supposedly part of the books \\"Charm\\" but I didn't really enjoy it. BUT in some cases it does give you a little background info, furthering the story without having to tell you dozens of pages of details, which of course is the point of the author breaking through dozens of times.Overall I suppose I'm pretty satisfied with it. Not sure I'd reread it though. I definitely enjoy the movie more 3.5/5"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love the Princess Bride movie, and I love the book even more. This audiobook is all right, but it is VERY abridged, and I feel that it loses the tone of the original novel. (Note, the novel claims to be \\"abridged from the S. Morgenstern,\\" but William Goldman wrote the book, the S. Morgenstern thing is just part of the story. This book is actually abridged from what Goldman wrote.) If you've read the book before and just want something to remind you of it, this is all right (though if you're anything like me, you'll be filling in the missing parts as he reads along, and wishing they hadn't abridged it). If you have not read the book before, READ IT!!! Unfortunately there is no unabridged audiobook that I have been able to find, so you'll just have to sit down with the actual text. Sorry to those of you who wanted to listen in the car, or at work, but you'll really be selling yourself short if you listen to this audiobook before you've read the actual thing. :-("},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride, by William Goldman, is a romantic fairy tale. This story is for readers of any age and gender, as it satisfies every interesting aspect of reading. The Princess Bride is a fairy tale involving true love, hate, revenge, swordfights, torture, pain, death, heroes, and cowards. This story takes place in the kingdom of Florin once upon a time.Buttercup, the most beautiful young woman in the entire world, falls in love with her farmhand, Westley. Westley leaves the farm in search of a job that will pay enough for him to support him and the woman he loves, Buttercup. While Westley is gone, Prince Humperdinck takes the unwilling Buttercup as his princess and future bride. Everyday Buttercup hopes for the return of her lost Westley, but he never comes. One day the Princess is kidnapped by terrorists, from a nearby threatening country, that are trying to invoke a war. Just after she is kidnapped Westley, in disguise as the Dread Pirate Roberts, is trying to rescue Buttercup from the terrorists, which he succeeds in doing by: beating a swordsman in a sword fight, overpowering a giant, and outsmarting a genius. After reuniting, Buttercup and Westley try to escape the Prince, but are soon captured. The Princess is taken back to the castle and Westley is taken to the Prince's secret underground layer to be tortured and soon killed. Once the giant and swordsman have recovered from losing to Westley, they begin a search for him. Eventually they find Westley in the underground layer, only to find that he is dead. The swordsman gets the giant to carry Westley's body to Miracle Max's house. Miracle Max is special doctor that used to work for the Prince. He concocts a miracle cure for Westley, and brings him back to life. The three of them go to the castle rescue the Princess and ride off into the sunset.This romantic fairy tale tells the tale of a beautiful, but common maid turned into a princess in need of rescue, an even more common farm boy trying to win back his true love, an inebriated swordsman seeking revenge, and a gentle giant finding his own path in life. This tale shows the strength of true love and friendship, the trials of love, and rewards that come through perseverance. The introduction begins in first-person narrative and then as the story actually begins it turns into a third-person narrative. The overall setting is the Florin kingdom and its surrounding ocean and countryside.This fairy tale has many strengths. There are an incredible number of different scenes with completely different scenarios. The scenes vary from farm handing to swordfights to kissing. There are many different types of action in this story and it keeps any kind of reader satisfied and keeps them reading. The storyline is happy and adventurous and there really can't be any complaints about a young man and young woman fighting for their love.In the beginning of the story, the author writes many pages on his life and how he tried to find the original copy of this story- before he abridged it. The pages become endless and are in no way relevant to the actual story, though they are included as such. If the choice to trudge through these pages of ongoing nothingness, the story will begin. After reading about the author's ever so hard search of the book, the story is like reading a masterpiece because your mind is so bored with what it has just gone through that it will jump with excitement at the story. There is also another confusing addition to the story; Prince Humperdinck took Buttercup to his castle and they became engaged, while all this time Buttercup is hoping for her true love to rescue her. Never in any part of the story does the Prince threaten her if she tries to leave. Why would Buttercup remain in the castle, engaged to man she doesn't love, when all she had to do was go home?Reading this story is actually quite enjoyable. There are many things going on at once, but few enough characters to understand what is going on at all times. For those who have watched the movie and not read the book, be warned that the book is different than the movie. In the book Westley and Buttercup's love is incredibly shallow and based mainly on appearance, whereas in the movie they possess true love. This was surprising but not a complete turnoff from the book. Overall the book is worthwhile reading, even if just to ridicule the author for his irrelevant beginning."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is interesting, and is recommended if one has not seen the movie, but unlike most books, it is not better than the movie. Much of the movie comes straight from the book, and no imagination can come up with a better giant than Andre the Giant. The parts of the book that deal with the same events as in the movie, but differ in details, are inferior to the portrayal of the events in the movie.The book certainly is humorous, but the constant interuptions of Goldman discussing the fictional Morgenstern get old quickly. Maybe some people find this great, but in my opinion, it just takes away from the story.Still, the book contains a lot to holds one's interest. It deals with pirates, dueling, torture, love, and many other things. It is full of action."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am a Canadian living in Scotland right now and I was absolutly shocked when I came over here to discover that no one had ever heard of the Princess Bride! HELLO, its only the best story on the planet, and we even made it into a film for you so you wouldn't have to go to all the bother of reading anything. No one in my class had ever heard of Inigo Montoya, &quot;you killed my father, prepare to die&quot;, or Fezzik, the giant who liked rhyming things, or Vizzini the evil Scillian, or Buttercup or Westly or Prince Humperdink or Count Rugan or...anybody!!! No wonder they just go out drinking all the time (sorry about that).So I'm writing this to say - if you haven't read this book, you haven't lived. Don't talk to me about the best book ever until you've read this one, don't talk about favorite fairy tales or love stories or anything like that until you've cracked the cover of the Princess Bride. Then watch the movie, if you must, but read the book first.My dad owns an old ancient copy of the book, with yellowed pages and no cover. I devoured it at only nine years old, after having watched the film a million times. (The film is great, but once you've read the book, you see that the written word is much, much greater.) I've devoured the novel again at least twice a year since. This summer I invested in a new copy, becasue many of the old pages had fallen out and it was starting to crumble. At fifteen and a half, I still love this book. Its the kind of story you can't help but. You never never grow tired of it, never grow out of it.It's one of my secrect ambitions to read the unabridged version some time. Just to say I have. But I have a feeling that it won't replace the real story. Just like tofu can never replace chicken, no other book can ever take this one's place.So once again, I say it: READ THIS BOOK. Whether you already have, or have never even heard of it, order a copy now and you'll never look back. All other books take second place to this classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This has got to be the greatest book ever written, even to me, who deosn't read much fantasy. I grew up on the movie and dove right into the book when I got my hands on it in the fourth grade. By the seventh grade, my most prized possesion was the 25th anniversary copy of it that my brother had given me. From the six-fingered man to the retired miracle worker, this book has everything. Romance intertwined with adventure, deception, and suspense. Who could ask for more? It is so much different than other fantasy books for the pure fact that it may be based on history, meaning it could happen in real life (with the exception of \\"the machine\\"). I have read the book, at the very least, two times a year since I discovered it, and couldn't be more ecstatic that *there is in fact a sequel.* It is entitled \\"Buttercup's Baby,\\" and the first chapter appears in the anniversary edition. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the rest of it, perhaps it isn't published yet, but it exists. In my mind, The Princess Bride should be a required reading for school because it is a truly amazing piece of literature and art. After reding this, it is as if you have lived through it all with the characters-Please, read this book and share it with your friends-put a smile and a memory in their hands and your own."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Well, the story of the Princess Bride was wonderful! It was such an amusing plotline, interesting characters, such humour and wit, and I suspect Morgenstern was quite brilliant with the political savvy behind it all. But I just really enjoyed the cover story. However, from the little bits and pieces I could distinguish there was some interesting parts that Mr. Goldman left out. I understand he did us all a favour by cutting out all that rabble about Florinese royalty and humour, but when he casually adds that he cut out Westley's history and reasons why Max was cast out... that was irritating. I felt the Princess Bride was enchanting, but Mr. Goldman used the book more as an ego trip. He did more talking about himself, and his life, and all his griefs, and how HE personally made his son into the successful hunk he now is. Hmm. If there was less Mr. Goldman, and just the Princess Bride, I would have appreciated the book more."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Who are all these morons who think Morgenstern is real? And the people who claim that the original is better? How would they know? They couldn't have read it since it didn't exist. Unfortunately, these people never leave their email addresses, so we can't berate them as they deserve.This is a great book, as wonderful as the movie and definately a classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I thought it was a fairly good book ,despite the fact THAT THERE IS NO MORGENSTERN. That ruins the book a bit, and I thought that Goldman's introuduction was awfully stupid. I mean,there is 30 pages of Goldman insulting his family and lying about searching for the original. I think he was bold to call his book a classic. The movie was great, but the book was only okay. And Humperdinck's plan to kill Buttercup was dumb. And Buttercup was dumb to marry Humperdinck."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Oh, my God, I love this book! I am so excited just to be reviewing it! EEEEE! I quote this book ALL of the time, and me and my sister, Nicole, spend half of the day talking about it. When , in school, I am supposed to write sentances or stories or paragraphs, they are always based on this book. I laughed out loud (something I rarely do with books) when I read the part where Miracle Max says to Valerie about haw there is a giant and a spick out side the door (&quot;With scars and everything&quot;), and she returns, concerned, &quot;A giant on a stick??&quot; I have read this book about thirteen hundred thousand million times, and it just never gets old. Every where I go, the Princess Bride comes with me. I now have the ability to open up to absolutely anywhere in the book, read four words, and know exactly what is going on. I am working my way to memorization. I have introduced the movie to my friend, Jack, am in the process of getting my other friend, Teddi, to watch the movie. To my other friends, look out! You're next! I am getting the book for the two friends I mentioned for Christmas (shh! Don't tell!), and I would buy it for more, except I don't have the money. Me and my sister are so interested, we looked up both Florin and Guilder, and looked where Goldman said where the countries used to be, and, though there were no signs of a Florin (or Guilder) Channel, we did find a place that fit the description (though me and her argued about which side was Florin), and did find an island, a rather large island, called the Isle of Rugen, or something like that. I thought I would include that, just for the heck of it. Anyway, READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!!! If you have, hey!, read it again... and again...and again...and again...."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman, the man who penned the screen treatments to such classics as The Ghost and the Darkness and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, had an interesting premise and wrote a compelling, fairy tale-like novel that is quite entertaining. However, I saw the movie first. I loved the movie, the characters, the concepts, etc. It was my favorite movie and still holds my cinemtic respect. The book takes a less-lighthearted, darker and more pessimistic approach than the movie and ends in a hurried, rather disappointing manner. Probably, had I read the book first I would have thought differently. For those who are fantasy enthusiasts looking to read a book that travels the road not taken, The Princess Bride is for you. For those who are die-hard fans of the exceptional film, beware: It's not what you'd expect."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was largely unable to enjoy this comedic fantasy due to the over-riding tone - which is \\"smart-alecky\\" and self-aggrandizing (to the author). Some have termed this as witty cynicism but it certainly goes beyond that - recurring so-called \\"humorous\\" insults aimed at the author's own ex-wife, for example, begin to colour the narrative as conceited and self-important. Perhaps this is the very same \\"cheekiness\\" that people claim to enjoy so much, but I feel it goes over the line.I'm a sarcastic person myself - I assure you, I am not squeamish on the matter. There is however, a difference between cynicism and an air of crass, snarky superiority. What I found most bothersome was not the fact that it existed, even, but that I felt it had no place within the novel - what kind of author writes himself into a book through the narrative outright, in order to deliver his message of \\"aren't I clever, mouthy little boy?\\" Yeesh. I kept picking up on this throughout the book, and well, by the end I simply had no stomach left for it. I didn't want to hear his self-aggrandizing thoughts - I wanted to read the book. It feels, however, that they were completely embedded in it.That's not to say the book is not completely without merit. It portrays colourful characters and comical, entertaining situations - it feels like a spoof, a big, long spoof of fantasy, through-out. If you like that, you'll be chuckling. If you like improbable skits and ridiculous names, you'll be chuckling. But I think more recent comedic fantasy authors have been far more creative and clever, all things considered. And they don't try to pat themselves on the back with snotty commentary, either.Some reviewers have felt the book was misogynistic. While I hesitate to hurl that word about lightly, I think perhaps it's a way of bringing a plethora of ideas and images to mind without having to detail them. Goldman's portrayal of \\"Princess Buttercup\\" can be read as a stereotyped, unrealistic and rather chauvinistic portrayal of women. It could be that he was simply mocking the stock character of the genre, but the fact that \\"Buttercup\\" is the only character who feels defined by gender - that is, she doesn't feel and read like a being, she feels and reads like a caricature of a \\"stupid woman\\" - this tends to generate an upsetting feeling. I don't wield words like \\"misogyny\\" and \\"chauvinism\\" like clubs, but I have to say it certainly feels there is an insulting tone regarding \\"Buttercup\\" that perhaps betrays a narrow respect of the mind.The bad outweighs the good, for me. I really don't care if the author thinks he's the cat's pyjamas because he can make witty rejoinders to people from his past on paper years after the event - write an autobiography, and pump it full of all the snarky little comments you can manage. Why fuse that into your comedic exploration of fantasy?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride, by William Goldman, is your classic fairy tale about a love that can never be broken. It does seem fairly common with princesses, pirates and giants; but that isn't all that is going on. Possibly the reason that this story is so intriguing is not that it is so obviously fiction, but that Goldman tells us that it actually happened.Goldman tells us that as a child his father read him The Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern. But, when his father read him the story he would skip over the boring parts and only tell him the most interesting points in the story. Goldman then claims that he has never read the entire story himself, so he calls his abridgement the \\"Good Parts\\" version and only uses what his father told him as a child, because really that is all that he knows.The Princess Bride is supposedly a true story that happened once upon a time in a small country located somewhere near Europe called Florin. S. Moargenstern was just retelling factual events that took place long, long ago. But, interestingly enough, I have not ever been able to locate this country of Florin (or the neighboring country of Guilder) on any map, ancient or current. There is also no record of this author, S. Morgenstern, no one can prove that he ever existed. And, we don't know what time period these historical events took place in because the measures of time we have are as follows: before Europe but after Paris, before glamour (which is an ancient idea), and after blue jeans, which he claims were around a lot longer than people would think.Goldman also employs a technique of telling two stories at once. He is telling the actual story of Princess Buttercup, and Fezzik, and Miracle Max, while also telling his own tale about how he came to right this story. He includes a complete explanation as to how this book came into existence, why he wrote it, and the challenges that came with it. He keeps the plot of this story going with his constant interjections into the text. He must explain cutting entire sections of sixty or more pages. In this way the point of view changes between an omniscient narrator and the first person voice of William Goldman. In these interjections Goldman warns us about bad things that will happen or possible lets us in on good things that are about to take place. Sometimes this foreshadowing can be confusing because of the way that Goldman uses satire, sometimes you can't tell if these acts of foreshadowing are actually going to occur or not.The Princess Bride has many elements that make it as truly good as it is. Goldman's own personal quest to write this story and all of the hassles that he had to go through just to do so are a whole story in and of itself. We actually learn enough about the characters to make them all real to us, even the minor ones who do not make or break the story. It is the classic fairy tale with a twist around every corner, never knowing what will come next. And, we know it must be good because, after all, someone decided that it was good enough to be made into a movie (and we all know that the movies are better than the books, wink, wink)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Great seller, fantastic movie!

It doesn't even set up the story like another more favorable reviewer said. It is just a huge waste of time.

She suddenly fell deeply in love with him because she became jealous that the Countess loved him! Well anyway if you do decide to read the book, it explains in much more detail about some parts in the book (Like that Vizzini was hired by Humperdinck to kill Buttercup and all that stuff). All in all....stick to the movie!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I feel very cold towards Mr. Goldman, because now that he's made the abridgement, I can't seem to find an original copy anywhere, and most of the information he left out could have been very important to me.

It was just as fantastic as the movie - maybe more so. All week, I raved about it to my friends and one of them ended up borrowing it from me and another got it from the library. It has so many great characters. Vizzini will annoy you with his arrogance, Inigo will stun you with his fencing skills, Fezzik will make you laugh with his rhymes, Prince Humperdicnk will make you mad, and Westley and Buttercup will fill with that warm love feeling! You'll remember every character so well. (The archdean, miracle max). I mean, this book is great! The only thing that beats it is cough drops :)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the book and the movie, but while I was watching the movie I noticed there were a few important scenes from the book that were left out in the movie. One of the first things that I noticed was the fact that there was no Zoo of Death, they tried to fill this void by including the Pit of Dispare. This was a nice try by the producer to fill the void, but it didn't come close to the fear the Zoo of Death brought. Another thing that was different from the movie was the fact that the albino didn't help them in the movie like he did in the book. In the book the albino told them where the entrance was and how to go about getting Westley out and in the movie they just clubbed him over the head and found the secret door themselves. The book also puts more detail into the beginning and setting up the back ground of the story where the movie just started in about where everything starts to take shape for the plot. These were all very important scenes that shouldn't be missed, they add more to the book and the producer should have tried to include them in as much as possible. Although there were things missing from the movie I still recommend seeing it, and you should read the book too."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is terrific. Like the man in the story reading the story ( a bit confusing) says, it has some adventure, some pain, some romance, it has some of everything. It is a wonderful book with twists and turns and just when you think you've figured it out, you realize your so far from that, that you must read on. The author William Goldman is fantastic and funny, editing the &quot;boring&quot; parts, making it all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I beg all of you to not place the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; into your VCR again until you read the book. Not only is it filled with the same action, romance, adventure, horror and comedy as the movie, but it amplifies it by a million! Goldman's classic tale is indeed such, and makes for an excellent escape from the drudges of work or school. The tale practically jumps out of pages to unfold in front of you. I recommend it for any lover of reading. No matter your tastes, you'll be satisfied with &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot; I loved it so much I wanted more, and found that reading this book again and again was the only remedy! The story never gets old and is the only one I've read that brings about such a wide range of emotions. Shame to those who continue to watch the film blindly without knowing the true story behind it. Check out this masterpiece from your library today!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Only fools, ogres, and heartless guttersnipes would find this tale to be anything less than brilliant.

Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This wonderful Tale of True Love and High Adventure contains all that is needed to make a fairy tale exciting, dangerous, and fun to read. When compared to the movie, it stands high and adds the little perks only a book can add - the greater explanation of the love between the main characters, the background of the cool sidekicks, and the wonderful journalist commentary on the level of Buttercup's beauty. I highly recommend if whether you have seen the movie or not."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's useless to talk about how good is the book written, is useless write about how fast i finished it, it's useless. Just can talk about the feelings it brought me: Love exists. It's not a love novel, but an adventure book. But who said that love isn't the biggest adventure has never existed? Tears, fear, laughs,...all the feelings you forgot will come back to your soul. Anyone of us could have written that story, but William Goldman was able to awake all what rested in us. Just give a chance to Mr.Goldman to show you that also the good music can be written in a book. Dance, fight and be scared of the end of the story, the end of our story. Marc was the friend who gave me this book, now i can't bring him anyother, i love reading, but i've never reading a best story but this."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Okay, almost everyone who reads the princess bride falls in love with it, we can't deny that. There are only a few who hate it. But I think we should all know this: William goldman is a big fat liar. This is for all the people who believe in S. Morgenstern. S. Morgenstern does not exist. Florin does not exist. William goldman doesn't even have a son; he has two daughters. Stephen king will probably sue ol' bill for saying he's florinese, either that or he's laughing along with him. I don't know about Buttercup's Baby, but in my opinion, He just put the &quot;first chapter&quot; in to sell more copies so he could up his paycheck. William goldman is probably a bitter old man who enjoys tricking people -- he just happens to be a good writer. He came clean when he put together that book of 4 screenplays with essays. The princess bride was in there, and he admitted he had lied and he actually wrote the screenplay before he wrote the book. That's all. But don't let that worry you. Just read the book and lend it to your friends and don't worry about nasty ol' billy boy. It's the best book in the entire universe, that's all that matters, right? : - D"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This 25th anniversary edition is excellent. Nicely bound and -- finally -- a hardback edition. Goldman provides a new introduction plus a chapter from the book's sequel. This book is a perfect gift for any occasion.Have you seen the movie? Well, as with most movies that are book adaptations, the book is far superior. You will find that the movie dialogue is often line for line what is in the book, but the book includes important commentary and character back-story that makes the story even that much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride combines romance and adventure in such a natural way it's amazing. I enjoyed this book because it has so many different things: pirates, fencing, villians, giants, pain, revenge, kings, and torture. However, the root of the story, and the part I like most, is the love between a poor farm boy, Wesley, and Buttercup, the most beautiful girl in the history of the world. S. Morgenstern does an awesome job writing this classic tale about the lengths to which Wesley is willing to go to get his true love back.I got wrapped up in many of the characters because the author tells you all about their histories. I wasn't able to out The Princess Bride down because I wanted to find out whether Buttercup would escape from her murderous kidnappers or if the fencing Spaniard, Inigo, would finally be able to avenge his father's death.This humorous tale will keep your avid attention from the first chapter, where Wesley's ship is captured by the Dread Pirate Robersts, to the very last page, which concludes the classic tale of true love and high adventure."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was in high school (mid 70's) when I picked up a copy of the book on impulse. Once read, it immediately became my favorite book in the world. It became important to me, iin a way I couldn't explain.I, too, bought copies to give away to friends. I read it over and over again. I always told people not to skip the introduction. Now that I finally understand why the book is so important to me, it is easier to understand why the two parts of the book (introduction and story) are so integral to each other although seemingly so different.In my opinion, the book is about being a romantic in a world that has little place for romance. The romantic ideals of true love, loyalty, magick, etc. are qualities that exist in our souls. The difficulty is in making these ideals exist in the real world -- a world that is not, as Goldman points out, fair.The introduction to the book is as fictional as the story. It tells of a mundane life, one with little romance. It tells of a man whose mind and soul were opened to romance by a special book. He lets slip a chance to have transient lust, the everday world's version of romance, in order to give his son a chance to know magick. The effort fails because the real book, like the world, is too heavy with cluttered details that weigh us down and leave us unable to participate in true love and high adventure. So the author gives us the version stripped of those details in order to allow us to take part, to become knowing actors.The author never forgets that the world ISN'T fair, that the deck is stacked against the romantic. That is why the hero must die. That is why the end is ambiguous rather than an unalloyed happy ever after. That is why the unabashedly magickal characters in the book are figures of comedy rather than romance, and have been rejected by the powers of the world.Romance does win. True love happens. Yet Goldman reminds us that in order to survive, it must compromise with the real world; it will be wounded.One of the impressive parts of the book is that love is illustrated, and does not only exist between the dashing hero and the beautiful heroine. It is also shown, perhaps best, between a father and son (Domingo and Inigo Montoya), between parents and child (Fezzik and his parents), between friends (Inigo and Fezzik), between an elderly long-married couple (Max and Valerie), and so on.True love, and the process of becoming aware of the soul, are the high adventure. It does not happen easily, and it is not easy to fit into everyday life. The Princess Bride is, in some ways, a manual that helps one make it happen."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you've only seen the movie but haven't read the book, you're still missing a fantastic experience.The movie is wonderful, but the book is even better -- it's wittier, deeper, more heartbreaking and more suspenseful. It's also a lot more cynical at heart; it's not just about a fairytale, but about what fairytales and stories mean to us when we're children -- and when we grow up.The original novel of \\"The Princess Bride\\" (Good parts included) is a book to laugh out loud to (as when Buttercup is seeking beauty tips and her parents tell her a shower might do her some good, and that she should, \\"Unearth the territory behind your ears,\\" etc.) -- as well as to cry to.I love the fact that the book is about how the world isn't always what we expected (the man who is telling us the story in modern times is a surprisingly bitter man with many disappointments, and who is trying to connect to his distant young son). But still even when everything isn't perfect, Westley will always be brave, Buttercup will always be beautiful, Inigo will always be loyal, and heroes will always win.The great thing about the book is that it's able to illuminate so many things the movie could barely touch upon. There's just simply more of everything -- Inigo and Fezzik's friendship is closer, the villains are scarier, Westley is more heroic and more in love with a Buttercup who actually grows significantly throughout the book (much more than in the movie). Buttercup, in the book, isn't really always worthy of Westley. He knows this, and even tells her at one point, \\"If your love for me were a grain of sand, my love for you would be a universe of beaches.\\" He knows she doesn't love him as much as he loves her, and this adds a poignance to the story that is richer than the film.The book is also wickedly funny, satirical, and just a little bit twisted. I love the \\"edits\\" and the way the narrator is always discussing what Morganstern did in the \\"original\\" version versus what he does when editing it for his kid's benefit, etc (like how there was evidently once a whole chapter on packing that was supposed to be a metaphor for the politics and decadence of Florin, etc). It's funnier and darker. And it makes the sweet fairytale at the center that much brighter.It's interesting to note that the movie seems to be a bit more about Buttercup, to be her story. But the book is unmistakably Westley's. Because of this, to me, the stakes are higher -- and the ending is even more satisfying."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My dad once said those three words to me for years, and to my knowledge, he was joking around like he normally does, but after I got into reading. When I was 9 years old, my dad shoved this book into my lap and said that if I read this book, he will buy me whatever books I feel like. Now, years later, I still sit here with that same copy of the Princess Bride that I have read to date 5 times (Now in between books, on my 6 read through) I still love it as much as I did when I read it the very first time...The Princess Bride is a wonderful story, with giants, heroes, bad guys, pirates, fencing, death, regret, revenge, hunting, boats, sharks, torture, miracles, and the biggest draw of the story, true love. William Goldman expresses this genius with something very hard to do without a Mother Goose rhyme, make a true fairy tale.Goldman tells this story as written by \\"S. Morgenstern,\\" and has two stories in one, William Goldman as a kid read by his Grandfather, which is interrupted by fancy italics to speed up the story, or fill us in on what was happening when he was being read The Princess Bride. The other story, the Princess Bride itself, is obviously the best part of the book....With characters like Prince Humperdink, who is obsessed with hunting, taking over the bordering country when he becomes King, or his soon-to-be-wife, Princess Buttercup, who is but a poor milkmaid, who is but the most beautiful woman in the entire world, (with much detail on how she became so) set to wed the Prince, or perhaps her three kidnappers? Vizzini, the wise, and genious of a Sicilian, or Inigo Montoya, the revenge-infatuated Spaniard, who's only goal is to seek revenge on his father, Domingo Montoya. There is also Fezzik, the rhyming giant, who always plays by the rules. And finally, Westley, our protagonist of the story, who will stop at nothing to save his true love from The Sicilian Crowd (The Kidnappers)From wonderful places such as Fire Swamp (okay, not that wonderful) where nobody has gone in one end, and live to come out of the other, and the Cliffs of Insanity, where there is nothing but a 2000ft drop, and such as the Zoo of Death, this book will be sure to please (almost) anyone who liked the movie, or even just recommended it, I say at least give it a shot..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I Love this book, although the movie is good, the book is better, If you liked the movie, you will like the book. The best part is the Zoo of Death. It is very interesting."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Misogynistic? Not at all! It is, after all, a spoof on faerie tales, so how can its heroine not have a head full of fluff? Anyway, I found it to be one of the most adorable, wittiest books I've ever read. This is a treat, esp. for anyone who's seen and loved the movie, which is a lot sweeter and more romantic than the satirical book. However...despite the fact that I'm a romantic at heart and was somewhat dismayed that the book doesn't have a ride into the sunset ending, I found it delicious. Vive Miracle Max! Fezzik with his rhymes and Inigo with his swordplay--they're so cool, so unique. A really exciting read, even if you've seen the movie!PS. To those of you who wondered what happened to the parts Goldman discarded when he &quot;abridged&quot; the book, in their reviews...sorry to disappoint you guys, but that's part of the satire, too. There never was a S. Morgenstern. &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is purely and totally William Goldman's."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A timeless classic that has an additional \\"Introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition\\". The book is also missing the amazingly detailed map of Florin and Guilder. All else is the same from the 25th Anniversary edition published by Ballantine. HB size is a little larger than the previous edition. Before storming the castle one might want to check both editions out for verbiage or map preferences. True love is not inconceivable!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is the best adventure/pirates/princesses/magic book ever. And undoubtedly the funniest. For those of you who didn't like Morgenstern's comments throughout the book, you are insane. They were hilarious. I have loved this book since I was 11 or 12 years old. I had lost someone close to me and somebody suggested that I get this book to cheer me up. To that person, THANK YOU. Now I'm a freakishly fast reader and have read hundreds of books. This is my favorite of them all. One problem though, if you loan this book out, it won't come back. I'm purchasing my second copy as I have given up waiting for my own to return to me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"\\" As you wish\\" this is all Wesley ever said to Buttercup through out the first chapter and that is all he really needed to say to her.

This amazing book has fighting, revenge, love and miracles. It will keep you on your toes and pluck at your heartstrings the entire time! Though do not get the wrong idea, this book has plenty laughs in it too! I feel the message the author was trying to get across was that love if it is true, can prevail through anything. This is a book you will never forget. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"One of my favorites of all time. I loved the movie the first time I saw it as a kid and scooped up the book when I found out there was one.It is hilarious! The wit and satire of the movie is only touched on when compared with book. I just could not stop laughing the entire time I was reading it.Its a fast read, filled with wondering characters, dialog, adventure, pirates, sword fighting, and yes... even kissing.A good fairy tale for the kids at heart."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"How often do you read a book that looks like the author plain had fun writing it? THE PRINCESS BRIDE, written by S. Morgenstern (Rhoda's father, maybe), who in turn was written by William Goldman, is just such a book. A fast-paced fairy tale of derring-do (and don't), this story unapologetically pits good vs. evil as it \\"Once Upon a Time's\\" itself right out of the gate (uh, that is if you skip the introductory 30 pages where Goldman has fun talking about himself -- Goldman -- editing his own -- Morgenstern's -- \\"classic tale of true love and high adventure\\").OK, so on p. 33 you'll find Part One (and can even start here if you're sharp and want to cut to the quick). Here we have the story proper (and at times improper). To wit, we have beauty in the character of not-terribly-clever Princess \\"Build Me Up\\" Buttercup. We have bravery in the character of her true love, Westley the Farm Boy (instead of a Frog, for a change). And we have Evil Incarnate in the characters of Prince Humperdinck (no relation to Englebert, apparently) and Count (on Him To Be a Jerk) Rugen, the 6-Fingered Torture Meister. What more could a Grimms Fairy Tale Groupie ask for?The primary secondary (i.e. \\"bit\\") characters are no slouches, either. There's the hard-drinking swordsman from Spain, Iago. There's the giant (unless you're talking intellect) strongman, Fezzik. And there's the mastermind hunchback who's never prayed (or played) at Notre Dame, Vizzini (late of Sicily). Just when you thought the supporting actors couldn't get stranger, Goldman introduces Miracle Max, Maker of Miracles, and his wife, Valerie, who specialize in the Lazarus Pill (which can raise more than just Cain).Young and old alike will get a kick out of this book, and if you're a teacher looking for classroom library fare, you can safely purchase copies for the kiddies because the narrative is as clean as children's fare in adults' clothing. There are layers of point-of-view asides, what with a father reading the tale to his son and the book being allegedly created by Mr. Morgenstern and the whole crazy send-up being masterminded by Goldman. Yeah, it starts to veer a bit out of control at the end when Mad Max enters the fray, but hey, you've got to stay with the tongue-in-cheek groove Goldman creates and just go with it until the end.Bottom line: If it's old-school adventure and witty repartee you love, have fun and ride the badinage to its clever end. The kid in you will smile from worst-than-fractured fairy tale cover to cover. If, on the other hand, you can be a little curmudgeonly at times and have trouble suspending your disbelief even when the suspension bridge of disbelief spans over an obvious chasm of good fun, pass gently into the night and go find yourself a high-brow book where everyone dies and the author takes home a Booker Mann or Womann Prize or something.(It goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway: This review lives happily ever after.)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is about a girl named Butercup, who is to be married to the evil Prince Humperdinck, a giant, a fencer, a farm boy, a pirate, an evil count, a sicilian, and many more.

Want to know more, read the book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read the twenty fifth anniversary special edition of William Goldman's Princess Bride and I have to say it has been a while since I have read a book which is both charming and at the same time incredibly clever. Goldman's novel contains all of the elements of a traditional fairy tale, e.g. giants, fencing, good and evil, fabulous and dangerous beasts and settings, revenge and of course, true love. Despite these conventional elements, Goldman's work is saved from being clich&eacute; by the author's wit and unique creativity.From the very beginning of the work, the reader is lead to believe that they are reading an abridgement of an an ancient work from the country of Florin written originally by an author named Morgenstern. Florin is established as a country situated between Sweden and Germany and throughout the story, Goldman is constantly interrupting the action of the novel to make believable references to the reader about the ups and downs of the abridgement process e.g. wrangles with publishers over what scenes to leave in or out, and how the cutting of such and such scene caused riot amongst the Florinese academics. Goldman even details thirteen lawsuits which he is supposedly involved in with Florinese lawyers representing the Morgenstern estate. At the beginning of the novel, what seems as an obvious joke eventually becomes believable and you catch yourself thinking things like \\"I wonder what the original was like?\\" By the end, I even googled \`Florin City' just to make sure that it really didn't exist in some remote part of Europe unknown to me!This book really is a great read and much like JK Rowling's Harry Potter series, creates an entire other world or reality which is so believable that you may catch yourself half wondering \\"so where actually is this place?\\" Well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"it deserves much more than 5 stars, and it is MUCH better than any other book i have read, the italics just add to the creativness of goldman! and i disagree with anyone who says the opposite about this book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"True love, high adventure, what could be more thrilling?

And the world's deepest love.It's fun and funny in many parts, with sly asides about that mock the conventions of the adventure story. But it also has pathos, especially during the numerous interruptions that bedevil the ultimate lovers Buttercup and Westley and during Westley's torture.Finally, it's a book for almost all ages -- just as is claimed in the wrapping story that frames the book.

Throughout each chapter there is great suspense. William Goldman has a very distinctive style of writing. He uses simple yet meaningful words in each paragraph throughout the book. Because of this he can attract readers from any age group from teenagers to the oldest people out there. Just like in the movie, The little boy's grandfather reads the story to his sick grandson. Originally he isn't very interested, but the story escalated very quickly and he got into it. for all you grandfathers out there, take the next opportunity you get to read this to your grandson.Personally I will give this book three thumbs up because there is a character in this book with 11 fingers. I would recommend this story to anyone who is looking for a good adventure book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This was a birthday present for my 15 year old daughter, and she absolutely couldn't put the book down until it was done!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman sells \\"The Princess Bride\\" as a book of \\"true love and high adventure\\" and it's a true fact. The book is one that any fan of fantasy, adventure, and/or romance could easily find enjoyable. It's got sword fights and pirates and giants and monsters and poison and torture and oh so very much more. But the real thing that makes \\"The Princess Bride\\" unique is that it's a big, fat lie. All of it. And it's done so incredibly well that you could very easily read it cover to cover and believe that Goldman took this piece of literature and abridged the \\"good parts\\" out; you could get sucked into his reasoning for doing it and accept all his anecdotal tales that are woven throughout the book starting with the various forewords and narration notes. The fact that Goldman could write all that so well and make it that believable is exactly why I find this book so entirely brilliant.Like pretty much everyone, I found the book after seeing the film. I'm a huge fan of the film. So, I find it difficult to talk about one without mentioning the other. But if you haven't read the book, be forewarned it's not exactly the same. It's just as tongue-in-cheek as the film and in many ways the book is even less serious than the film. After all, it's a fictional story attempting to be a historically based fairy tale and because of that it is inherently not serious. Goldman spends a lot of time in his various notations seemingly justifying the historically accurate nature of this and that. Often he spends pages digressing completely from the story in a fashion that could easily be described as babbling. His timing is usually at the most integral part of action or suspense, dragging out the effect or sometimes even spoiling a major point before it happens in an effort to \\"warn\\" the reader. In any other context these things would no doubt detract from the book, but it's all so lighthearted and silly that it only manages to reinforce the fact that you this is a book best read with a large helping of salt.The tale itself is pure epic fantasy. The narrative is possibly most notable for its anachronistic slant, which Goldman often justifies in parenthetical asides that admit such-and-such event occurred well after the invention of what one would perceive as somewhat modern. In a way it reminds me a lot of Lewis Carroll in how he justifies Alice's actions and thought processes throughout her adventures, but Goldman is even more overt even to the point of mockery. The dialogue is possibly some of the best comedy every written, in my opinion, and those familiar with the film will find that many of the most famous lines actually originated from the book.Due to time constraints, the film isn't able to show the back-stories of some of these beloved characters. And while it is again an example of how Goldman drags out the plot and suspense of the novel, I can't help but be fascinated by the intricate histories of Inigo and Fezzik. The novel is, in fact, almost completely taken over by their respective histories. And while they are undoubtedly integral parts of the tale, Westley and Buttercup seem more like the secondary characters when the action really heats up. Of course, everyone -- villains included -- have their fair share of moments to shine and no one is left unexplored. If you have the time, I'd definitely recommend taking the time to watch the film again after reading the book as you will probably end up taking a lot more meaning from some of the seemingly throwaway lines.As one of my personal favorites, this is a book I find myself constantly campaigning friends (and others) to read. It's one that manages to contain a little something for anyone's interest and especially those who are already fond of the film. While fake abridgments are not Goldman's invention, his approach is incredibly unique and masterfully well-written."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What can you say about S.

This book delivers death-defying feats of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever written on a page. But it's more than that. There is substance here. At it's core, this book is about family, friendship and love (and not just that of Buttercup and Westley). The Princess Bride's real genius lies in how the story is told --- from Goldman's father to him and from him to his own son through the eyes of the fictional S. Morgenstern. And this is what makes it resonate to soundly for me.Of course, it's hard to talk about the book without so much as mentioning the film. The film is iconic. If I'm being completely honest, until very recently, I didn't even realize that the movie was based on a novel. I know, I know. For shame! Anyway, I very rarely enjoy a film as much as the novelization, however, this is one case where I can say that they are equals in every sense of the word. I think this is due in large part to Goldman's hand at writing both the book and screenplay. The storyline is left largely in tact as is much of the original dialogue, rendering it in my eyes, a whopping success. Do you know anyone who doesn't run around uttering \\"INCONCEIVABLE!\\"? I know I do. Or what about this little gem? \\"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\\" I mean, c'mon! Is there any other bit as repeated or loved as that? And maybe in some regard I do hold a bias because I saw the film first, but I can't imagine a better case of casting. I dare any of you to try and picture these lovable characters as people other than who played them on screen. Name one guy who didn't want to share a peanut with Fezzik or one girl who didn't want to swoon in the arms of the dear Wesley. Pure perfection.It is in my fair opinion that whether you choose to read the book or see the film, you are in for a magical treat. You'll be transported to a transcendent, magnificent world of folklore and believe me, it will stand the test of time. It is because of tales like The Princess Bride, that we're able to appreciate these little lessons and the stories that bring them to life.Food for Thought: I think the greatest part about The Princess Bride is it makes us think. It makes us look at the simple things and say \\"Yes!\\" or \\"That's it!\\" It makes you appreciate the magic of childhood and of true love and of the written word. It's about the power of stories and how they can irrevocably change us. In the end, you realize that anyone is capable of having a happily ever after and you will be left feeling profoundly satisfied. Inconceivable? Not even so.Rating: 5/5 stars"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you've seen the movie or even if you haven't you'll enjoy this book completely. The Princess Bride has all you could want from a story: action, adventure, romance, wit, and humor. But mostly it has unpredictable and original twists that will keep you on edge. Altogether it's a really incredible novel made to entertain and it accomplishes just that. You'll easily be captivated by William Goldman's tale.SYNOPSIS:A beautiful girl. A farm boy. In love. Death. Pain. Loss. An evil prince. A shell of a princess bride. Kidnapped. Rescued. Not rescued. Really rescued. Love again. Death. Loneliness. Unexpected turn of events."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I had never read The Princess Bride before, but I had seen the movie. I really enjoyed this abridged version of the book, but I did not know that it was not the full book until after I purchased it (guess I didn't read the info close enough). That being said, it is a great, classic story. Reading, I found myself picturing the characters from the movie and really wanted to watch it again afterwords.Even though I didn't realize it was an abridged version of the book, I am glad that I purchased it. William Goldman does a great job of cutting out the boring or unnecessary parts...leaving it \\"the good parts version\\" and he explains what he cut out and why.As a bonus, you get to read Buttercup's Baby."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my all time favorite book from when I was a child and will always hold a special place in my heart. It was written very well and the story is engaging."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It's really, really difficult for me to watch a movie and then read a book. Aside from knowing what is going to happen, the imagination required for reading is unnecessary because you already have an image of everything in your head. However, because of my love for The Princess Bride movie I decided to give the book a try. Please note, I'm going to write this review with the assumption that you have seen the movie.Something I did not know is that The Princess Bride is not an original story by William Goldman, it is actually a retelling of S. Morgenstern's story that Goldman's father told him as a child. Rather than reading like a direct story, the book reads rather informally, with Goldman giving asides in italics to justify what he has cut out of the story and why or explaining his reactions to certain parts as a boy. This is reminiscent of the boy (Fred Savage's character) in the movie whose grandfather is reading him the story. Sometimes Goldman's asides are long and have little to do with the story, but often times they are funny and give smart insight into what both Morgenstern and Goldman hope to achieve as writers through the book. I must admit, I skimmed through some of the italics, but to my credit Goldman gives permission to do so in the introduction.The story of Westley's adventure to save his love Buttercup from Prince Humperdink is almost exactly the same in both book and movie, verbatim. In fact, Goldman wrote the script for the movie, so very little was lost in translation. If you commonly read books and then see a film adaptation you know that it's very rare for everything to be left in tact. I know I may be a little biased {okay, more than a little...}, but The Princess Bride is a franchise that belongs with the likes of Harry Potter when it comes to properly executing this transition.So if the movie is such a great interpretation of the book with practically word-for-word accuracy (seriously, all of those lines you repeat from the movie actually came from the book), is the book even worth reading? YES! The benefit of reading The Princess Bride versus watching the movie is, as with 99.99% of all books, you get so much more background information that helps you to better appreciate the characters. Westley and Buttercup's relationship is illustrated in depth with some of the most touching verbal exchanges of love I've read; the murder of Inigo's father by the six-fingered man is explained along with Inigo's journey to prepare himself for revenge; and we learn about gentle giant Fezzik and how such an intimidating man could be so caring. Knowing what each of these characters are fighting for and how their love drives them through this adventure gives so much more depth to the story, even when watching the movie.Additionally, the book offers more detail in the action scenes, primarily when Inigo and Fezzik rescue Westley from the torture chamber. I was also better able to understand the political conflict between Florin and Guilder through the book's details. As with most books, The Princess Bride gives a more well-rounded picture of the whole story that are limited in film adaptations due to time constraints."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Recently I've been working on a sort of epic fantasy parody called Disenchanted, and I was feeling in need of inspiration, so I decided to see how William Goldman handled a humorous fantasy adventure story in The Princess Bride.I have, of course, seen the movie, and yes I love it. How could I not?The book is quite good, and while many scenes in the movie follow the book verbatim, there are a number of differences, and I think that in those cases the moviemakers made the right call. Maybe I'm biased, having seen the movie before I read the book, but I think the movie holds together a little better. The book is a bit darker too.I had also heard that the book was an abridged version of another book by someone named S. Morgenstern, and I will admit that I was duped into believing Morgenstern was a real person until I read the afterward. (I got suspicious when Goldman explains that the Morgenstern estate wanted Stephen King to write the sequel.) It's an interesting narrative device, pretending to be writing an abridgment of another book, but I'm not sure it actually improves the book. Goldman is so deadpan and convincing about it that it hardly qualifies as satire. It's more weird than anything else, reading about Goldman's (fictional?) marital problems in between passages about Wesley and Buttercup.Still, an easy and enjoyable read overall."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"\\"The Princess Bride\\" is storytelling at its best: a classic love story told with humor, adventure, intrigue, wackiness and a whole lot of imagination. Everyone I know that saw the movie and read the book agrees that the book is better. The characters are fresh, interesting, endearing and funny. The dialogue is spot-on, and the descriptions just made me want the book to go on for another thousand pages. Encore!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've been in love with the tale of The Princess Bride since I was eight years old and just hope that William Goldman sees fit to finish \\"Buttercup's Baby\\" one day for all of us die hard fans who still wait to hear the story of Waverly and her protectors."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is perfection.I imagine every writer who ever lived wishes they could get inside a story, and bring characters to life the way that William Goldman does in this book. I know I do.I had to force myself to put it down and \\"get some work\\" done. I find myself dreaming about his characters and wondering about their lives.I laughed, I cried, I worried, I rejoiced.This is a treasure of a book. Although I have only written a few fiction stories, this book is moving me to the thought that perhaps one day I will be able to come slightly close to what is found in this book.Here is one of my little Perception Parables about love ..Love's Silent Sweet Secret: An Adult Fable About Love (Perception Parables)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Since I read this book as part of a challenge that stipulated also watching the related film, I'll be discussing both the novel and the movie in this review.I did really enjoy this novel, Goldman's story-telling skills and humor make this a highly entertaining and enjoyable read. The fact that he also wrote the screen-play for the movie speaks highly to the fact that the movie follows the novel very closely with only a few omissions and changes in order to provide a better flow to the film due to time constraints. That all being said however, the two being so closely related does seem to diminish the overall experience of whichever format an individual happens to encounter second. By that I mean, that if you've read and loved the novel, there really are no real surprises in the film and (as in my case) if you've seen the movie multiple times, a large chunk of the book is immediately recognizable even down to word-for-word conversations between characters.The main things that I took out of reading the novel for the first time were the background stories of Fezzick and Inigo which really fleshed out their characters and were a wonderful addition to my previous knowledge of the film. I also enjoyed the information and adventures contained within Prince Humperdink's private zoo which in the film is reduced to only a \\"Pit of Despair.\\"Overall, I did really enjoy both the novel and the film and if you have only been exposed to one or neither of them, I would highly recommend becoming familiar with both as they are both top notch."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Being a fan of William Goldman andThe Princess Bride Film, and with no sequel in sight, it progressed naturally that I would want to read the story on which the film was based. I was at first tempted to write a tongue-in-cheek review of \\"Morgernstern's work\\" to parallel the book, but a glance at the reviews shows that there is still a lot of confusion about this book, so it would probably be best to clear some things up first:- There is no author named \\"S. Morgenstern.\\" The Princess Bride was written in 1973 by author and screenwriter William Goldman, the same person who wrote the screenplay for the film. Morgenstern serves the same purpose as the opening narrative from the film - to create a fairy tale atmosphere and allow the author (Goldman) to interject his own commentary into the story at will. It is a narrative device that is not used often, but works well for the film and the book.- It is labeled as \\"abridged\\" but there is no \\"unabridged\\" version. This is another lyrical device intended to reflect many of the fantasy classics by Dickens and Dumas that are frequently abridged. The text of the main story is the only version that exists.- The story is written with extensive commentary inserted by Goldman, much like that which was used in the film. Most of this commentary and the information provided by Goldman in his introduction is fictional.- The 25th anniversary edition includes the first chapter of the sequel, \\"Buttercup's Baby.\\" While it is a full chapter, there are no additional chapters that have been written by Goldman.Since most people coming into the book will have seen the film first, I can say that the novel is about as close to the plot and structure of the film as possible. Unlike most novels, there is not a lot of additional plot and dialogue in the novel that is not already in the film, and it is difficult to make a comparison between the two. Goldman has a very unusual and original writing style that many people might be turned off by. The true beauty (Buttercup notwithstanding) of The Princess Bride is not the story (although it certainly stands up in its own right), but the structure of the book, most notably the commentary and introduction by Goldman. It allows for an additional entertaining and lighthearted layer to the story that I think many fans will enjoy.In the edition I own (the 25th edition), Goldman mentions a scene he left out of the original text, which featured a reunion between Wesley and Buttercup. Unfortunately, he exclaims that he was not allowed to include the scene by order of his publisher, and you could obtain it by writing a letter to them and requesting it (a lot like when you write a letter to 221B Baker Street - the residence of Sherlock Holmes). While none of the details surrounding this were true, it was a clever game to play with the readers. I'm told that the later 30th anniversary edition included a link to a web site where you could view the letters, which is unfortunately defunct. As such, I've included all of the letters in the comments below.The Princess Bride, the novel, isn't for everyone, even die-hard fans of the film. Although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I've also been an admirer of William Goldman's other novels and I am used to his writing style. My best advise would be to read the first chapter for free on Amazon and if you enjoy it, consider getting the book. It's a very short read and offers another layer to this \\"Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure.\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My first experience to the story of the Princess Bride was through the indulgence of the movie. I first saw it as a child, and I was like... this is a great movie. I still watch it today, because now I understand some things I didn't before, the more subtle humor that is carefully placed for adult ears only...But enough of the movie. This is a book review! I decided to pick up the novel after I finally found out it was a novel. And yes, at first, I too fell to the prank of the S. Morgenstein joke. I'm so naive sometimes.As I began reading, I couldn't help but appreciate the sarcastic and light tone of the author. The wording is humorous and free, and while it is not exactly of literary greatness, it is fun to read. I think that is the point that Goldman is trying to get across - humor. This book is simply meant to entertain, and that it does.True, true, I am sympathetic to the fact that Buttercup is a true weakling who must be protected by her one and only Westley. I'm not exactly a feminist... but I don't exactly appreciate things like that. However, I can see the angle the author is coming from. He's writing a fantasy, a fairy tale. And let's face it, back in that age, women were not exactly treated like they are today. It all fits into context, so I am not completely angry at that fact.I think the reason this book is so successful is because Goldman takes the cliche of the ordinary fairy tale and basically ridicules it in a way the reader can appreciate. I guess one could call this book a pun on fantasy. In doing this, Goldman has created a world in which not only those fans of humor will appreciate, but also those who are fans of the traditional fairy tale. People of all ages can appreciate the light wit that is contracted into every page of this novel, and the discrepencies from the ordinary. But people can also cherish it for the classic storyline it follows. This is truly a book for all people of every age of every time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm a male, and I read this book in high school. When I first heard the title, you can imagine what I was thinking. Boy, was I wrong. This book is one of the best adventure novels I have ever read. It kept my attention extremely well, and the plot line did not ever disappoint. This is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Buttercup becomes the most beautiful woman in the world once she falls hopelessly in love with Westly, the horseboy she had ridiculed so often. The Princess Bride has two main themes love and loss. When Buttercup discovers that Westly had supposedly been killed because his ship was ambushed by pirates that falls in the category of loss. When she then swears to never love or marry again that falls into the same category as well. Until prince Humperdinck arrives.Prince Humperdinck will soon rule the land of Guilder that is once he finds a bride. The count of Guilder, count Rugen, recommends a gorgeous milkmaid in the land of florin; Buttercup. At first, she refuses his offer even when he threatens to kill her if she doesn't accept. Except then she begins thinking \`It wouldn't kill me. We don't have to love each other.' Little does she know that's exactly what it will do. When Prince Humperdinck rules he wants to rule alone and that was exactly what thinking when he planned the kidnap, although it didn't quite go according to plan.He had hired three perfect men for the job. There was Fezzik; a muscular giant, Inigo; maybe the best swordsman in the world, and the Sicilian; a genius, the brains and leader of the group. Their plan was flawless; although that was before the mysterious man in black appeared. He seemed to out due and beat everyone's greatest skills. When the mystery man reached Buttercup he forced her to run with him hours through the forest; while the prince and his army was on their tail. When they had reached the bottom of a cliff the man in black took off his mask to reveal Westly; love. Unfortunately the prince captured the lovers and did the worst thing he could possibly do in that situation: forced them apart. He took Buttercup and prepared her for their wedding and captured Westly to torture him: loss.The morning of the wedding Prince Humperdinck became so fed up with Buttercup's talk of Westly he killed him. Although she had no recollection of this happening so she believed her true love would save her. Fortunately, the kidnappers, Inigo and Fezzik, sought out a new leader after the Sicilian was killed, and who better than the man in black who had surpassed their greatest skills. Once they find him dead they are forced to bring him to the one person who could awake the dead, Miracle Max. But time is running out, the miracle man does not wish to help them, the wedding is in an hour, and Prince Humperdinck has Buttercup's murder all planned. Will the love story end in love or loss?An S. Morgenstern supposedly wrote the \\"original\\" Princess Bride, and this book is the cut version by William Goldman. Supposedly The writing is un-touched and all that Goldman did was \\" cut out the boring parts\\" and comment on Morgenstern's writing, although I wasn't convinced. I wondered why Goldman would get the credit when Morgenstern wrote everything. So I did some research and found evidence that Goldman had actually written the whole thing and that Morgenstern was a pet name like Mark Twayne.I liked Goldman's writing it was very detailed but gave just the right amount of information. Although I think sometimes he gets a little of the topic. Like in the beginning he writes about the most beautiful women in the world at the time, which was going to lead up to Buttercup; although He writes a little too much on the most beautiful women and not enough about Buttercup. The rest of the story was very nicely written.I really enjoyed this book. I just couldn't put the book down. It's compact with a lot of different stories squished into one masterpiece. I liked everything except I thought the ending ended a little too abruptly. Everything is so detailed and perfect and you get to the end thinking are they going to escape will they get away and all of a sudden it stops. But you want more. This was a great book and I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman's abridgement of S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, The Princess Bride is just awesome. Before I read it I had heard about the movie a lot, but I still hadn't seen it. Finally it was played on TV so I had to sit down and watch. I really enjoyed the movie, so I couldn't help but to read the book. To tell the truth, the book just utterly blew the movie out of the water. It gave the background to the movie, which I didn't know when I saw it. This cleared up most of the movie for me. The detail and excellent technique used in writing the book was just spectacular. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am 71 years old and have been a \\"reader\\" all my life.

Morgenstern's original charactors are unforgetable and should part of every child (or adult) reader. I am positive you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I cannot explain how much I adore this book. I had seen the movie several times before reading the book, and enjoyed it, but there can be no comparison. The wonderful humor that Goldman uses in the book cannot be found in the movie. The characters are so lovable, and I particularly enjoyed the not-so-intelligent Buttercup of the book. I've read The Princess Bride too many times to count. It has so much more flavor and fun and humor and character than the movie. Any fan of the screen adaptation must read this book. You don't know what you're missing out on."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman's novel, \\"The Princess Bride\\" is a must have for fans of fantasy, romance and adventure. Tinged with sophisticated humor, parody, satire and fairy tale elements, there is no literary work quite like it. William Goldman has written for the movies (Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid, The Stepford Wives) and \\"The Princess Bride\\" itself became a popular film in 1987. There are, in the market, two versions of the novel- paperback and hardcover. This hardcover edition boasts on having \\"the good parts\\", abridged so that only the more appealing aspects remain, alluring its reader to the fabled classic by S. Morgenstern. S. Morgenstern had written prolifically and abundantly on court etiquette and a history of the fictitious European kingdom of Florin. Goldman proceeded to abridge the long novel and leave only \\"the good parts\\"- fencing, poison, daring escapes, true love, hate, revenge and good guys versus bad guys.Of course, this is merely to attract the impressionable and excitable young reader. There is no S. Morgenstern, it is all William Goldman's fabrication. But the idea works in this novel. The novel is written in comprehensible diction, it is not stuffy, not eloquent or lofty in language. It is dramatic, exciting and very convincing. The novel, after all, is a parody of escapist fantasy romance. Buttercup was a farmer's daughter who fell in love with the field hand Wesley. Wesley went to America to seek his fortune but never returned. Thinking he had died or was captured by the \\"dread Captain Roberts\\", an evil pirate, Buttercup mourned his absence and vowed \\"I will never love again.\\" Wesley, however, is not dead, and returns to Florin to seek his true love. Nevertheless, he finds that Buttercup has become betrothed to the wicked, odious Prince Humperdinc.Humperdinc is a vain, conceited and sinister man. His motives for marrying Buttercup were never those of true love. Being the villain, his real goal is to have her killed. I will not give out the rest of the story for those who have not read it. As always, my advise is to read the novel first, then see the movie. But you will be greatly satisfied with the novel. The characters are rich, unforgettable and highly entertaining- we are amused by the witty repartee of the genius Italian bandit who captures Buttercup, his sidekick the less intelligent giant, and the brave and daring Spanish hero, Inigo Montoya.This novel is romantic, witty, humorous, exciting, and never dull. The novel is a welcome collection in your bookshelf. Kudos to William Goldman for his creative genius on this very literary and sophisticated work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has so much that the movie left out.

I don't understand the high ratings. I never saw the movie and didn't like the missing parts of the present author.

My conclusion is that it is not better than the movie, or worse, but different. The movie captured the essence of the book, but there is so much more. The metafiction in particular which the movie only touches on superficially - the idea that the book is an abridged version of a work by an S.

If you've read the book: SEE THE MOVIE."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a book that consists of adventure, romance, and comedy. Golding begins the book with a 30 page intro to how the book came to be. Buttercup is a beautiful girl who has fallen for the farm boy, Westley. Westley has always loved Buttercup but she has just found this out. Westley has set out for London to seek success. Buttercup receives news that the ship Westley was on had been attacked by pirates and here were no survivors. This news put Buttercup into instant depression. Buttercup is soon visited by the King of Florine while he is looking for a wife for his son, Prince Humperdinck.The main conflict of the book is Buttercup finding her true love, Westley, but being torn apart continuously by her soon to be husband, Prince Humperdinck. Westley attempts to save Buttercup after she is captured and he single handedly takes out a big and strong giant who loves to rhyme, a swordsman who has a heart for revenge on the man who killed his father, and a smart, cunning, and cocky psychic. Another main event that happens is when Westley gets captured in an attempt to save Buttercup and is locked up and tortured for a long period of time.The main Characters are Buttercup, Westley, Vizzini, Fezzik, Inigo, and Prince Hunperdinck. Buttercup is a smart and beautiful woman who is arranged to marry the prince and loves to ride her horse. Westley is physically strong, mentally strong, determined to be with his true love, Buttercup, and a charming farm boy who turns into one of the best swordsman. Vizzini is a smart and cocky man who is out witted by Westley. Fezzik is a loving giant who loves rhyme and Inigo. Inigo is one of the best swordsmen alive, and is seeking revenge on a six fingered man who killed his father when hee was a boy. Prince Humperdinck is a ruthless and selfish prince.I, personally, enjoyed reading this book very much. I enjoyed it because Golding stops wherever he is and writes little side comments to make sure that you know what is going on, making it an easier read than most other books. I also enjoyed The Princess Bride because it has a lot of adventure like the zoo of death, the ravine, fire swamp, snow sand, duels, and kidnapping. I also enjoyed that each of the characters are thoroughly revealed to you. For example; Inigo is introduced to you as a child and you are taken through his childhood. He is then introduced as one of the best swordsman in the world having challenged almost everyone he met and beating them. What I enjoyed the most were the relationships that were formed throughout the novel: Buttercup and Westley; Westley, Fezzik, and Inigo, even Buttercup and Prince Humperdinck's relationship."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Princess Bride - one of the best movies and books of ALL TIME.ONLY fault: William Goldman has this weird third voice threading throughout the story meanwhile being the pseudonym of CS Morgenstern.

It is primarily an adventure story, injected with plenty of humour from Goldman. Be warned - this is not some swoony love story. Yes, the two lead characters do have a powerful (and somewhat obsessive) love for eachother. But this book is humorous, full of sarcasm and dry wit. The story is affectionately mocked by its author, to great effect. Certainly it is a wonderful book for escapism...it takes you away from your world and totally captures you from beginning to end.Interestingly, many many people appear to believe that this really is an abridged version of some 1000-page novel by a S. Mogernstern...I would like to ask these people why, then, the tale is told in the same style as Goldman's frequent interruptions (peppered throughout the book in italics)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was about 14 (21 now). Humorously (well, only if you've read the book) I was in a hospital very sick when I first read this. I was there for about a month, and there was NOTHING to do. I've never been big into t.v. unless Star Trek was on, so of course I read. I've always been a book worm and read most things I can get my hands on, but I usually can't stand reading a book more than once. It just starts to bore me. But this book, The Princess Bride, I've read about 10 times now, and everytime I read it, I get something new. Something I didn't get before because you need to know something in advance to get it. Something that I get only with age and more experiance. I've even read it out loud to someone else and STILL got something new from that! To this day it remains my favorite book of all time, and I still read it over and over. :-)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is just amazingly written, with very clever asides and brilliant narratives. I am one of those who saw the movie first, and this book just adds so much more. There were some minor changes between the book and the movie, but both stand on their own two feet solidly.Very highly recommended. I was even finding myself wondering if Florin and Guilder were real, DESPITE having a pretty good grasp of European history and countries."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a delightful story of true love that conquers all. It has action, adventure, death, cool fighting scenes, love, hate, giants, everything you can ask for in a fairy tale. That is exactly what it is. Everything you think of when you hear 'fairy tale' is included in this book. When I first read it, I was hooked. This is an epic portrayal of love lost and refound, bad guys perceived by their black hats and too many fingers, miracles, and revenge.What I do not understand is how some people (Okami) can say they have read the original by S. Morgenstern, when he does not even exist. That's part of the story. Florin does not exist. Guilder does not exist. And neither does S. Morgenstern.This book is a great read, and I suggest it to all of you. I know you will enjoy like I have."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is actually two stories in one and that made the book so much greater for me. I'm a little chagrined to admit that Goldman actually almost convinced me that an S. Morgenstern wrote the book. I KNEW there was no such country as Florin but Goldman's so convincing! And I just found out the guy doesn't even have a son! The book was even funnier when I reread it with this in mind. Talk about a multi-layered book!Great characters, great plot. I like the book better than the movie which is funny considering that Goldman wrote both the novel and the screenplay. This is a childhood story for both adults and kids and I highly recommend it to anybody interested in fantasy and satire."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A wonderfully written book. Goldman's introduction alone made me laugh out loud numerous times and makes the story all the more heartwarming. I think the best thing about the Princess Bride is that it can be enjoyed by girls and guys of all ages. A true classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Who cares about the \\"real\\" author?!?!?! Just enjoy the book and the movie and get over it!!!!! It is the best book ever written and everyone is too concerned about the author. No one is paying attention to the greatness of the book and movie. I have read this book at least 50 times and watched the movie even more! I grew up on The Princess Bride. Back then we did not care who actually wrote it. We knew a good thing when it came along!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"In my opinion The Princess Bride is the greatest story evertold. I say story because the book and the movie, while sharing many similarities, have a substantial amount of differences. However, the things that stays the same in both versions are the unconditional love, high adventure, and wonderfully created characters that are so likable you'll never forget them.The hero Westly, and princess (Buttercup) are everything you would expect from main characters in a fantasy story, and then some. Westly has a certain sense of confidence that is never shaken, even in the worse circumstances. This admirable arrogance is wonderfully displayed by Cary Elwes in the film version. Fezzik is a loveable gentle giant who is too stupid to make a thought, but whose kindness and loyalty to his friends all but makes up for it. Inago Montoya (my favorite) is a classic example of how the sidekick, and not the hero, is what determines the greatness of every story. The hero will always have certain qualities that cause us to like him, but a great sidekick can make any story interesting. Inago is fearless and loyal. His honesty and sportsmanship is straight foward, and wonderfully displayed in the famous duel scene with Westly.I am a huge Goldman fan and love the way he creates his characters. The good guys, as well as the bad guys, possess all the qualities they should have, along with a certain sense of silliness that we all can relate to. This story is a great read, and what makes it truely great in my opinion is the fact that it can be enjoyed by anyone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you are to read one book in your lifetime this one has it all. Love, death, duals, rivalry, passion. I watch the movie every christmas eve and have always wondered what the book was like and now I know. IT IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER! I recommend this to anyone who has a hard time getting into books because once you are in this book you will never get out. It is also Great to read to kids. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute....Is this a kissing book?&quot; Well, yes and no...you'll just have to read it to find out for yourself.William Goldman is a legend in the world of screenwriting, known for his clever, crisp dialogue and engrossing narrative, so why should his novels be any different?Utterly charming, 'The Princess Bride' combines action, adventure, plenty of swordplay, and yes, some kissing....Those of you who only saw the movie (also writen by Goldman -- see my DVD review) are missing out on many of the delights of the book, notably on the developed backstory of the characters and the clean, wry prose.Here's a bit of trivia: First, there is NO S. Morgenstern -- he is made up, fictitious, a red herring...accept it and move on. Second, Mr. Goldman will send you a lost section if you write to his address and request it (the one of mentions in the book)! When I first read that 10 years ago, I wrote to the company mentioned in the book and was delighted to receive my bonus section! (Hey, Mr Goldman if you are reading this, I lost my copy 3 years ago when I moved to LA! Could you please send me another one? ) :)Cherish this book and keep it to share with your children."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have loved this book for years (I think it may be my favorite) William Goldman is a talented author especially with dialogue. This is a wonderful spoof/homage to old fashioned swashbuckling romance.I noticed that a lot of people believe this book is an abridged version of the &quot;original&quot; S. Morgenstern book. Actually, Morgenstern does not exist, just try looking him up on the library of congress. He was just made up as part of the joke. Think about it, isn't a bit ironic that Morgenstern and William Goldman write EXACTLY the same way. This is supposed to be abridged, not rewritten. Plus, if Morgenstern existed, then Florin must too. Actually, Florin and Guilder were coins, the names were just borrowed. You'll never find the countries in your history book.This is the Spinal Tap thing, the joke is done with a totally straight face so that there are always people who aren't exactly sure if it's the real deal. That was the reason Rob Reiner was chosen to direct the movie version.Read this book, enjoy it, it is one of the best you will ever experience. The diaglogue is unforgetable (every sylabub!)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The greatness of this book is truly, in the word's of Vizzini \\"INCONCEIVABLE!\\" What's this book about? Fencing, fighting, true love, strong hate, harsh revenge, a few giants, lots of bad men, lots of good men, pain, death, brave men, coward men, escapes, lies, truth, passion, miracles. It's hilarious, heart breaking, and terrifying all at the same time. If none of that sounds good to you, or if you've seen the movie and didn't like it, don't read the book. If you liked the movie, the book is twice as good!Who's the genius behind this incredible book? The answer is simple, William Goldman (which is another whole story in its self). If you look at the book you'll read: \\"S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. The \\"good parts version\\" abriged by William Goldman.\\" In Goldman's introduction he explains how when he was a ten years old and was home sick with pneumonia, his father read him the book. (Sound farmiliar? If you're remembering the scene between the grandfather and the boy in the book you're right.) His father was a poor, English struggling immigrant from Florin, the setting of the Princess Bride. His father explains how Morgenstern was a great writer in his country and that there it is a very famous book. Goldman obviously loves the book.As a man, Goldman decides to give the book to his son, Jason for his tenth birthday. After putting in an enormous amount of time and money to track down the book, to his shock the son hates it. In turn, he decides to re-read the book for himself. What he discovers is that his father didn't actually read him the whole book, he only read him the good parts. The book in fact was not even really focussing on the story he heard, it's actually all about the history of Florin. Goldman decides to abridge the book with only the \\"good parts.\\"Everything I have just told you is a lie and it will drive you crazy the whole book! William Goldman did not in fact \\"abridge\\" the book he wrote the book. He invents Florin, he invents Jason, he invents everything! Why such a brilliant writer would completely give all the credit to another writer who never existed I will never understand. The book is filled with clever and hilarious \\"abridgement notes\\" from Goldman. Not only are they funny to read, they keep you on top of things so you never are confused or find yourself searching back for explanations. If you don't like this sort of thing, don't worry they're written in a way that can be easily skipped.You can read about all of the plot in any other review, but in a couple of sentences: Buttercup falls in love with the gorgeous Farm Boy. He goes off to America to seek their fortune. Buttercup learns that he dies. She is forced to marry the awful Prince even though she vows never to love again. Buttercup gets kidnapped... this is just the beginning! If I go any farther I'll give it away! If this sounds like a stupid fairy tale to you TRUST ME its not! Sure, it's about love, but in between revenge, poison, a man obsessed with human pain, death, duels, well I think you get the idea.As if all of this isn't enough! There is something special about this addition you can't find anywhere else.If you want to read a great story about true love, victory, defeat, pain and if you want a book that will make you laugh out loud, cry, or tremble with fear this is THE book. I truly think I can honestly say there is no other book like it. I would would put it against any of the great fantasty story writer, Tolkien, C.S. Lewis anyday! It goes ten times faster than any of the Lord of the Rings and is in my opinion just as exciting if not more. One tip, if you haven't watched the movie READ THE BOOK FIRST! It's got so many exciting turns and such an incredible ending, don't ruin it for yourself like I did."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles. GREAT LITERATURE.There's not a whole lot that's not in this novel. It succeeds at being maybe the funniest, most exciting, and satisfying stories yet written. Plus, the novel contains startling depth.The writing of the novel is so superb. The prose is smooth and light. It is really conversational, and word-play abounds. The novel also (as the Amazon review pointed out) serves as a satire of adventure and fantasy novels of the past and comments on the differences between fantasy and reality. The structure of the novel (with the hilarious first chapter, the flashbacks, and the author-commentary) serves to frame those bits of insight Goldman is trying to get across. Consider the line &quot;Life isn't fair, it's just fairer than death, that's all.&quot; There's a lot in those words, and throughout the story, Goldman hammers home real truths about the nature of pain, death, and grief. And yet paradoxically, out of those truths The Princess Bride emerges as a story to give its reader reaffirmation in the greatness of life.As you may can tell, The Princess Bride is my favorite novel. I've read it numerous times, and each time I read it, the book is better. I know that everybody watches the movie, and yes, the movie is great. Even a masterpiece. But the novel goes far beyond that. Read it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"OK, I really liked this book. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been mentioned already, but having scrolled through the one- and two-star reviews, I'd like to throw my 2 cents in:A) There IS NO original PRINCESS BRIDE. There is no &quot;pre-Goldman&quot; version. Goldman made the whole shebang up. B) Therefore, there is no S. Morgenstern. Did you think it was coincedence that their writing styles were exactly the same?C) There is no Florin &amp; Guilder--that's what makes it a fantasy novel. Didn't you notice that the historical quips all contradicted each other?D) For those of you who were upset by the first 30 pages where Goldman rips his family--they too are made up. The author has no overweight son; I believe he has two daughters. He has a wife, but I assume (for Goldman's sake) that she isn't as bad as the novel suggests.Naysayers--read this novel for all its different levels...The fairy tale...And the larger theme of a Romantic coming to terms with a world where happy endings don't always happen."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read this book when I was fifteen. I've gone through four copies (mostly due to unreturned loans), and I've practically memorized it over the past fifteen years. The book has a great premise of being written by Morgenstern and read to the author as a child, and a wonderful message for anyone who wonders what happened to the fairy-tale endings they never found when they grew up.Goldman's conversational style gives the book an intimacy. The reader really feels like they *know* him. I've read almost all of his other books, and this seems, to me, to be the most polished and sensitive. It's very subtle and charming, and then--wham!--a line like \\"Life isn't fair; it's just fairer than death, that's all.\\" That's one of my all-time favourite quotes.The movie did a good job of giving a cartoon-like, fun feeling to the story, but I thought the author's interjections and his cynical observations were quite moving, especially when contrasted with the happily-ever-after flavour of Westley & Buttercup's romance.The movie caught the basic \\"good parts\\" storyline, but the book has more to offer. I recommend it for anyone who's wondering \\"Hey...is this all there is??\\" Somehow, Goldman's book, The Princess Bride, makes you feel better about the answer.(P.S. - I've got the \\"alternative reunion scene\\" if anyone wants to read it...)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This 1973 book is fast becoming a classic, and the movie version has done much to popularize it. Goldman takes the conventional tale of romantic adventure featuring a kidnapped princess who is rescued by a gallant knight. However, Goldman departs from the stereotypical mould of the romantic adventure by exaggerating the conventional roles to the point where the story evolves from a serious tale of adventure into a farcical spoof. It is not so much a contemporary version of the Sir Walter Scott type adventure as it is an exaggerated version. The delicious and distorted blend of the lofty and the mundane that Goldman serves up results in a comical buffoonery. After all, who ever heard of a princess called &quot;Buttercup&quot;, a prince called &quot;Humperdinck&quot; and a hero (appropriately just a farm boy) called &quot;Westley&quot;? And who ever heard of countries that go by the names of currencies like &quot;Florin&quot; and &quot;Guilder&quot;? And who ever heard of pirates who retire?Goldman heightens the farcical effect by writing under the guise of an editor who is merely abridging the supposed longer work by the early 20th century writer S. Morgenstern (an approach similar to that later used by Michael Crichton in &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;). Of course Morgenstern is entirely a figment of Goldman's imagination and a fictional creation, as is evident from the numerous contemporary jokes found throughout which clearly originate from Goldman, and not an older Morgenstern. This is in fact an ingenious literary device that successfully enables Goldman to get outside the story and give his own pithy commentary about the action. The fact that it has fooled some readers to unsuccessfully endeavour to discover more about the mysterious Morgenstern can only serve as a tribute to the effectiveness of this literary device!The story itself features an evil villain (Humperdinck), a beautiful princess (Buttercup), and the humble hero (Westley). Westley needs to overcome the legendary Cliffs of Insanity and the dreaded Fire Swamp with its renowned R.O.U.S.s (Rodents of Unusual Size). In what appears to be a farcical version of the three musketeers, he must also master the hired hands of his adversary, the infamous &quot;Sicilian Crowd&quot;, composed of the Turk Fezzik (a huge idiot whose contribution is his strength), the Spaniard Inigo (a tall athlete whose contribution is his sword), and the Sicilian Vizzini (a thin leader whose contribution is his brains). Just so you can picture this farcical trio accurately, imagine Fezzik as a bulk who started shaving in Grade 1, Inigo as a madman who has devoted only 72,000 hours to prepare for a single fencing battle with his father's murderer, and Vizzini as a criminal mastermind who defies anything that doesn't fit with his logic as &quot;inconceivable.&quot;Of course the mixture of strength, sword and brains doesn't faze our hero, and after he successfully overcomes the skill tests of strength, swordmanship, and brains, some of the Sicilian Crowd become his personal allies in the quest against Humperdinck. Ultimately, they are the ones who rescue him from death by forcing a resurrection pill (you haven't heard of those either, have you?) down his throat, and help him rescue Buttercup and ride off into the sunset with her on four white horses. But this isn't a typical adventure-romance, remember, so of course Goldman presents an alternative ending where there is no sunset, and the hapless hero is forever chased by the villains.The movie version sticks very close to the book, and fans of the movie will especially enjoy this book. It is marred by a few instances of blasphemy, and the glorification of Inigo's obsession with revenge. But as a farce on the traditional romantic adventure, this book can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humor, and a vague awareness of the literary conventions that Goldman is mocking. As Goldman describes it: &quot;Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.&quot; Take these ingredients, mix well with a grain of salt, a sense of humor, and a strong measure of exaggeration and farce, and you have &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot; It's the recipe for success, and this book proves it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A lot of people have seen the film The Princess Bride and would know of the book from the film. The movie has for long possessed a cult-like status, being seen as funny, warm, irreverent and full of classic &quot;love and adventure&quot;. All these things are true about the book, only more so. Like the film, the story follows the strife of the love between Westle and Buttercup, as Buttercup is set to marry the prince of Florin and all the circumstances in the world seem to be set against the true lovers from being reunited. The book has all the adventure elements of the movie such as the Cliffs of Insanity and the Rodents Of Unusual Size. It has more detail though and adds much more to the story, sepcially in the Zoo section of which the movie only took bits from as well as the backstories of the characters. The other major difference is that the wrapper story, instead of a grandfather reading to a sick grandson, is that the book is Goldman's abridgement of a classic Florinese work.The Princess Bride can be looked at from some kind of post-modern tribute to adventure stories, full of deliberate and often humorous anachronisms. But I think it's so much more than that. It seems to be the only book I've read that's both a great member of a genre (the cloack and dagger, adventure-filled, swashbuckling romance) as well as a parody of the same genre. It's amazing how it's pulled off - on the one hand it's cynical about happy endings and the classic elements of adventure stories and sends them up in an amazingly funny way and yet reading it, you still feel a part of you yearning for those classic elements and finding them marvelously present in the book.And of course, the characters are truly larger than life, from Inigo the Spanish swordsman who has dedicated his life to finding the man who killed his father to Fezzik, the slightly-slow-witted giant with a brand heart, sense of humour and love of rhymes.Many readers in the reviews were annoyed by Goldman's whole wrapper of the book being written by Morgenstern as well as the 30 page intros and digressions into his fictional struggles to get the book published. An unbelievably high number of people fell for the whole thing and are currently hunting for the &quot;unabridged&quot; Princess Bride by Morgenstern! Personally, I enjoyed the digressions very much. I think without them it might have just ended up as a more conventional adventure story and not the cult classic it is. There's something about the whole appeal to an older/&quot;greater&quot; writer as well as some mockery of the world of publishing and manuscripts (and Morgenstern's digressions!) that adds to the cynical-yet-not-cynical nature of the book. I think the reason is that the book is a story and it's also about stories and storytelling and because it has so many layers, all of them warm and filled with Goldman's quirky visions, that everyone can get a lot out of it. So don't expect a regular, uninterrupted narrative!Finally, this edition has Goldman's recent and brief return to the book, the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby (as Goldman was only allowed to do one chapter due to legal reasons, read the book!). In it, he picks up (sort of...) where the story left off and presents some fragmented visions of the characters from both past and present. I guess it's understandable that some fans wouldn't be happy as they might feel emotionally attached to the classic, which also feels like a complete-in-itself work. However, I read the whole thing for the first time (including Buttercup's Baby) over two days recently and it was actually quite good to get that little bit extra about the characters. I think if people saw the book as the classic but the supplement as quite a meaningful addition to our knowledge of the characters (especially Inigo) then it wouldn't seem so &quot;sacriligeous&quot;.This is the favourite book of many people and while it's not my absolute favourite, I think it's beyond superficial rank claims - just a really special novel."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was gifted to me by my girlfriend, and at first I was skeptical about it. I had not seen the movie, and being an avid science fiction reader and writer, the fairy tale concept seemed like a bit of a &quot;girl thing&quot;. However, once I delved into its pages, I discovered I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a fantastic novel for everyone, people of all ages. The delightful charm of the story, the epic saga it unfolds to tell, and the spontaneous hilarity covers a plethora of genres; Which guarantees a fast-paced, exciting and truly amazing book that will satisy all-comers.The Princess Bride tells the story of a common girl, who falls in love with an even commoner boy, but marries an exceptionally cruel Prince, without any choice. The boy, now grown into a dashing hero, comes to claim back his true love - but not without a vast adventure before him.This 25th Anniversary Collectors Edition in hard back is the best version to buy, and saves it as a story that you will read to your children, and them to theirs, as Goldman describes himself doing in the introduction. A timeless classic, and one that will remain as one of the greatest tales for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"One would have to have been born inside a desk drawer and lived their whole life on paper and pencil shavings to not have seen the classic movie, \\"The Princess Bride.\\" However, very few of the people on this earth who don't live in desk drawers have read the classic book. And reading this book, even looking at the name on the front cover, clues you into the true genius of this fairy tale. What the move does not fully get across is that there is no actual \\"S. Morgenstern.\\" (Sure, if you read the credits, you'll figure that out, but you know how many people read the credits? Look in a desk drawer.) Anyway, William Goldman, the true author has not only concocted the great story, but the author, the book, the father reading the book to the child, and even the child. In seamless cutaways, we go from the exciting details of Wesley's latest escape or Buttercup's stunning beauty to the Fred Savage-ish boy sitting in bed talking to his father.And then, there is the story. The verbal cinematic masterpiece that sweeps across the hills of Florin and Guilder, that navigates the choppy sea, that climbs the precarious Cliffs of Insanity, that sinks into the flaming depths of the Fire Swamp, and rises to the highest turrets of Lotharon's Castle. You won't find better character development either; Goldman spends at least 30 pages on each main character, but somehow it never gets the slightest bit boring. Every page is both enrapturing and hilarious. (The childhood of Fezzik the Giant is especially amusing.) Goldman spins the tale perfectly as the father reading only the \\"good parts\\" to his son. The plot does far more than just plod, the climax is quite possibly the most climactic piece of writing I've read since the great Finnish climax of 1858, and the denouement is simply existential. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll dance around the room with an umbrella and call it a sword, and in the end, you'll utter the famous line, \\"Man, the book IS better than the movie.\\" But hey, in another famous line, William Goldman's in fact, \\"Life isn't fair, it's just fairer than death, that's all.\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was one of those people who thought that this book was actually written by Morgenstern. Upon finding out that the entire book was the genious imagination of William Goldman (including putting himself into his own story and making up complete &#34;abridgement&#34; notes), I was in awe with how well put together this story is. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's not often that I can read a book when I've already seen the movie based off of it, but this one had just enough tricks up it's sleeve to keep me interested. I have to say, the whole story within a story within a story aspect of this story just barely works. It threw me off in the beginning and I know some people really didn't enjoy this aspect or Goldman as the narrator continually butting in to talk about his opinions on the story - but it kind of worked for me. It made me think about how you view a story you are reading versus writing and what things I like in a story and what things I don't like - and it made me laugh when Goldman would complain about a literary technique of \\"Morgenstern's\\" while using the same technique. It was clever.I read the kindle version of this book and found it to be a very good e-book - well formatted with no obvious flaws."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is William Goldman's adventure novel, even though the subtitle is \\"S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure.\\" Goldman is better known for writing the screenplays for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men. He also wrote the novel Marathon Man, which did for dentists what Psycho did for showers.Goldman frames the novel as though he discovered and abridged the fictional Morgenstern's work to make it accessible to a modern audience. This is well and good, except that Goldman's periodic interjections typically drag the novel to a halt. And his fictional, thirty page introduction to how he came across the story is downright stifling. If the reader is aware that the context for the novel is entirely fabricated, Goldman comes across as self-aggrandizing (although he addresses this in a roundabout way by accusing Morgenstern of being self-aggrandizing).Like Goldman says, nowadays, if you're reading the book, odds are you saw the movie first. Many of the clever lines from the film were lifted word for word from the book. The modern day frame of the story works much better in the film.For the record, this is not, particularly, a book for small children - it has torture, drunkenness, suicide attempts, occasional profanity, and Goldman's fictional discussion of the collapse of his fictional marriage, among other things.Some versions have the first chapter of the purported sequel, Buttercup's Baby, which comes with a tiresome 20+ page introduction of its own. The chapter itself isn't particularly good either.The Princess Bride is a very clever, very entertaining book, but Goldman, with his framing, ultimately gets in his own way.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What hasn't already been said about this book. I watched the movie first and loved it. When I found out that there was actually a book, I bought it the next day. Even with how good the movie is, the book is actually better. We get to find out more about the characters backgrounds, where they came from, and how they came to be. I guess I would say that the book is a little more darker, and not as so happy ending, but it's still a very magical and fantastic book that everyone who likes the movie should read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The movie is a classic all its own, well so is the book. The screen writer's description of how the movie came to be made is entertaining in itself. I haven't completed it yet, but I'm well satisified and happy that I made the purchase. In fact, The Princess Bride is a movie that doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth. From what I can gather with what I've read so far, it is that good."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"From the very beginning, where the author is giving us a rundown (which I have yet to figure out if it is fiction or non-fiction) of how he did this and that, I grinned. I literally ate the book with my eyes as quickly as I could. I story holds well together, the writer's interruptions (in italics) I found a great dimension to the reading (as if someone was there while I was reading it). In short, I just think this is a great addition to anyone's library or reading list."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I \\"discovered\\" this book at a teen.I fell for it.All of it.And I am not sorry.This has got to be one of the most Cleverly written book I have ever come across. Not to mention the funniest. This book outshines the movie in ways you cannot begin to imagine. Much more backstory and VERY rewarding. PLEASE do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman describes his book as 'The Good Parts' and makes you believe that he abridged it from another author's work. I think that is so funny, because it is so easy to believe that it's true! His writing is hysterical. It's so modernly comical, and to think that the story is meant to take place a century ago and have such behavior and commentary is so very humorous. You'll almost believe in Florin and Guilder and some things in the book that were not included in the AWESOME film are just as funny to imagine as if they had been in the film. I loved this book so much because it was such a change for me - usually I read the book, love it and wait for a film to come out, but this time I saw the film, never realized there was a book to go along with it, and then read the book and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended, you might laugh out loud."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this book. I watched the movie in almost every grade in school ever since the video came out and I have to say the book not only did not fail me(in comparison to the movie) it surpassed my hopes :)! I haven't read all the reviews but I have to agree with much of the praise that is given to the book.But on the other hand my criticism lands towards the end of the book, the author's narrative before the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby seemed a bit too drawn out and the author's inserts in the last chapter were bordering on tedious. Also, far be it for me to criticize poor Fezzic, but the 'doctor spirit' that took hold of him in the last chapter sort of did not jive with the rest of the book..imho.Many reviewers have mentioned the great spoof about how Morgenstern isn't real, etc. etc. and I agree that it was a FANTASTIC twist to the book, but I think we should all give props to the author who pioneered this writing style.....Cervantes' book Don Quixote. From the fictional reviewers on the first page, the author's tongue in cheek bragging of reading the great classics, referencing real world events in author's life and different author's competition for the sequel, storyline feints, down to the story that the author felt didn't fit (the one about Indigo's love) seemed to be lifted directly from Don Quixote and tailored to the Princess Bride story. It really worked great in the Princess Bride, but don't miss out on the original pioneer :)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman's 1973 novel has more \\"storytelling\\" than \\"story\\" to it. Although the popular movie version makes the adventures of Buttercup, Westley, and Prince Humperdink familiar to the reader, the novel might surprise them. The true story here is about a semi-fictional William Goldman (with fake wife and child) struggling to come to terms with the personal meaning locked inside a lumbering satire from wholly fictitious author S. Morgenstern. The fake \\"Morgenstern\\" novel _Princess Bride_, so Goldman inform us, is a satire on monarchy that he has stripped down into a romance on true love. Reading the novel, you can both embrace the innocence of its love story and enjoy the irony of how love rarely works in reality.The movie adaptation believes in true love much more than the book does, mostly because Buttercup and Westley come across as sweeter, smarter characters than they do here, where Goldman plays them into fairy tale devices (Buttercup seems quite nave and foolish). The multiple layers of the book make for a fascinating, and often damn hilarious, narrative experience. Rarely has story shown so many faces to a reader through one volume. Worth many re-readings because of its complex layers."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Shows the back story of all the characters.

Don't be turned away by the fact that it's not too serious, because the narrative will have you hooked right from the beginning. It somehow managed to be enthralling even though there is a tongue firmly in the writers cheek. I don't imagine this is a simple task! If you're a fantasy fan who's like more of the funny, then tryThe Colour Of Magic (Discworld Novels), but if you want something that's serious but still with a gripping story, tryInto The Trees."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you are a fan of the movie, or of fairytales in general, I definately recommend this book.Be warned, though, that, if you are reading this after seeing the movie, there are differences.Some of the differences are better in the book. For instance, you get more backstory on just about every character.However, while the book definately has the comic tone that was in the movie, the book is slightly darker, and I didnt come away with the same feeling of magic that I did while watching the movie.I also didnt like Buttercup or Westly as much as I did in the movie. Buttercup is ditzier here (you might even say dumb), and there are times when Westly comes off as a misogynistic jerk. For instance, he actually hits Buttercup in the book. He threatens to do it in the movie, but I never felt like he actually would.This would have almost been fine of it had simply been satire of the sexism that you do often see in fairytales. However, in the introduction, and in the interruptions that he makes throughout the book, Golding himself seems to me like a bit of a misogynistic jerk.Still, that is not the main tone of the story. The main tone is fun and funny, and even when bad things happen it seems more adventurous than tragic. As I said before, if you are a fan of the movie, or of fairytales in general, I definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book.Maybe because I am older, the book seems a little too slow in comparison to what I felt when seeing the movie.Good book anyway, would like to know if there is a really abridged book with nice illustrations for children.Gabriela"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I thought it strange at first, reading a book about someone reading a book.

And the writer does it so well.I would recommend watching the movie first then you have a bit better idea of who the Characters are.I highly recommend it.D"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have yet to read a book that is so witty, romantic, and packed full with adventure. The courage of the lead man, Westley, is enough to inspire even the weakest, both mentally and physically, of people. Never has a book revolved around love as much as this one does. This book searches inside you for your adventurous spirit and brings it to light. If you feel as if your life is in a slump, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has something for everyone: action, romance, intrigue, satire and wonderful writing, but the best way to read this book is to read it aloud, or have someone read it to you. I had the great fortune to be introduced to The Princess Bride in the 9th grade, by my English teacher. Everyday after lunch she would read a few pages to the class and soon we were enthralled by it. She kept a class full of 14 year old kids spellbound by the adventures of Buttercup, Wesly, Inigo and Fezzick. I bought the book for myself while she was only about halfway through, being very careful not to read ahead (I didn't want to spoil the experience of her narration.)Buy the book and read it aloud to someone you love, I guarantee they will love the experience as much as you do. By the way Ms. Ross if you ever read this I want to say &quot;Thank-you, you showed me the power of great storytellers, both you and William Goldman.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was simply wonderful, I devoured it in a single day. The book never had a dull moment and the snappy comments from William Goldman only made it funnier. One of the best books I've ever read, and I've read alot!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am an avid reader of fantasy novels and this one tops my list, eclipsing such epics as Lord of the Rings. For shear enjoyment you will not find a better book. From the first paragraph you are hooked and entertained. It is the one book I have recommended to everyone, young or old. I embarrassed myself terribly in public once by laughing out loud while reading this book on an overcrowded public bus. One woman, who was sitting nearby, looked at the title on the book cover and settled back into her seat with a smile, muttering &quot;Oh, that book. No wonder.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A story of for all places and all ages. Once the book has been read, it may be reread as a collection of short stories.If you have ever wondered why movies are never as good as the book, reading this will bring you to a conclusion. The imagery and imagination of the reader will never accept the version created by the director.Our imagination is our freedom, and this book assaults every sense we have."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Like many, I always loved the movie. I could never find the book in my local bookstores, however. Then, one day at a bookstore in Niantic, CT, there it was. Not only was it a copy of the original 1973 book, but it was a first edition. I immediately grabbed it and bought it. Being a first edition of a hard to find book, the owner of the Book Barn wanted what many would consider a large sum of money for a mere book. But, if you've read it, you understand. I gladly paid what he wanted, and I do not regret it. This story is a great one, and the movie, as good as it is, does not compare to the book"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Sure - I recommend books I like to my friends, like everyone else.And sure - I lend a lot of them to friends as well.What I don't usually do is buy the same book over and over again. The copy I just ordered will be the 11th I've bought since the mid-70s. More than 20 years later my bookcase still seems incomplete without a copy - and boy - does 'The Bride' have a short shelf-life.One of the joys in life is meeting someone who has not yet read it.Then - having reassured them that you fully understand that this is not what they usually read - the anticipation of the next meeting : 'So - what did you think ??' Then the delightful rehash followed by the inevitable : 'Sorry, forgot to bring it with me. Next time, right ?'Next time, indeed ...There are only two kinds of people : Those who are delighted after giving in to the story - and those who won't admit it !It should not be forgotten that Goldman wrote a lot of good stuff - and it saddens me to see that classics like 'Boys and Girls together', 'Marathon Man' and 'Magic'are no longer available from the publishers. Let's have some reprints."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have read this book over and over again. I had to buy the hardcover edition because my paperback literally fell apart from being read so often. It is a beautiful book about love. It is a daring book about adventure. It is a delicious book about revenge. It is a hilarious book about people in extraordinary circumstances. It is triumphant and deflating. It is a different book each and every time you read it. I would encourage...even plead with anyone to read this book. You will be well rewarded-it is inconceivable you would not like it"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Well, they did it. I saw the Princess Bride movie when I was little and loved it, but this tops it. This book took me about 3 nights to read, and I loved every page of it. If Goldman hadn't taken out the fifty-some pages of packing, I would have fallen asleep. If you are looking for a spectacular adventure with bits of humor scattered around in between, you MUST read this book.

Has abook ever made you laugh out loud for more than twenty times?Well, this book will let you do just that. You will be thought of amanical insane person, sitting there laughing at a bunch of words.But, you will not care. You will not turn red. You will keep reading,laughing as you go along. Does this book start to sound like ahypnotic-trance with crazed jokes? No, It is not that, it is simply agood book that no one should go to bed without reading. It will turnthat frown into a smile.

The 4 main characters have endearing personalities and an inner warmth that makes them bond easily with the readers. I found myself thinking of them on occasion, long after I'd finished this tale; I guess that's one of those unique qualities that makes a book like this so special.A funny, fantasy adventure of the highest caliber. Told with a tongue-in-cheek style, this book easily captures the imagination of both young and old. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"To anyone who seen the Princes Bride movie - it will show why the movie is so good. And for all the rest - I wish a pleasure reading. You will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite. Unfortunately maybe I'll never know the entirety of what Mr. Goldman left out, but even so it's a wonderful book. I have yet to read a book as clever or entertaining in this light hearted manner. Lastly, it blows the movie away (even though Mr. Elwes made a delicious Wesley)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I got this book from the library yesterday because I love the movie so much, and from the reviews it sounded so hilarious (the concept of a fake abridgement? Awesome.) While reading it, I was laughing so hysterically my mom asked me \\"Is it that bad or is it really just funny?\\" and I told her it was the latter. I finished it that night, and, frankly, plan on rereading it many times before I have to return it. I fully intend on purchasing my own copy of this wonderful novel.Aside from the initial adorable and magical story the book tells, which I could rave about for days, the device used to tell is so innately clever. I love the moments where Goldman talks about what he cut out. Particularly the scene in \\"Buttercup's Baby\\" where he complains about how, during this huge dramatic moment, Morgenstern rambles on about the trees, or the symbolic \\"packing\\" chapter. If you've ever read any lengthy author like Hugo, Tolstoy, or Dostoevsky, this could not be funnier, because you could really see an author like them (as presumably Morgenstern is) doing that. In fact, I remain convinced that Morgenstern is based off of Hugo, who would always go off on little tangents about things he was interested in or annoyed by.It's pretty obvious, IMO, that Goldman and Morgenstern are one in the same. Their writing styles are identical. But it still remains a great joke (and judging from reviews some people did fall for it.) The narrative is so amusing, especially the little parenthetical asides.Yet, it's not just mindless humor. There is a heart to the book, from the genuine attachment the reader gets to the characters, to the engaging romance between Westley and Buttercup, to the amazingly detailed action scenes, such as the duel between Inigo and the Man in Black. I think the book explains a lot about the movie: in the movie, for instance, Buttercup and Westley hooking up seems quite sudden. In the book it's explained quite well. As others have said, Buttercup also gets a lot of development, and by the end of the novel is quite different from the spoiled, condescending girl she was at the beginning.One thing I don't know is how \\"Buttercup's Baby\\" works... was it part of the novel all along, or only recently added? Still, I enjoyed it--apparently, I'm one of the few who wasn't depressed by its sudden ending. While I agree with a reader that Fezzik's sudden \\"doctor power\\" was not very realistic... well, it's a fairytale.So, anyway, I highly recommend this book. And for people who say you have to read it while you're young to be converted, I am a college student and I loved every page of it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm a huge fan of both the book and the movie. Surely, there isn't a better story that could be told. When you actually think about it, it has every single element of excitement that someone could want in a book. From drama and action, to love and suspense, it's all there. The humor also contributes greatly to the development of the book and is perfect for anyone to understand. Some of the cliches that were used here, were actually MADE cliches by this story. Undoubtedly, one of the best modern writtings and films that definately deserves you time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman's elevation of the classic fairy tale to something this cool is an artistic achievement. The story begins in the land of Florin (which lies between Germany and Sweden) when a simple farmhand named Westley, goes to work for the father of a girl named Buttercup. At first the beautiful Buttercup bosses Westley around and is very short with him, but all Westley ever says in return to Buttercup's terse commands is a patient, \\"As you wish.\\" (Every woman's fantasy to hear a hot guy saying that to her, huh?) As time goes on, Buttercup falls in love with the devoted Westley, who, too poor to marry his True Love, sets off at sea to make his fortune and return to seek Buttercup's hand. Alas, one day soon after, word reaches Buttercup that Westley's ship has been attacked by a villain notorious far and wide, known as the Dread Pirate Roberts. There were no survivors.Buttercup's life loses all meaning and she falls into deep sadness. One day, Prince Humperdink, son of the local ruler, comes across Buttercup as she is working on her father's farm. The Prince declares that he has fallen in love with Buttercup at first sight and commands her to wed him. Buttercup, knowing she will never love anyone but her lost Westley, at first attempts to refuse the pompous Prince's hand, but events sweep her forward into a celebrated engagement. \\"The people will love her,\\" the Prince assures his court. \\"For she is one of them.\\" The more telling in light of later events, he adds, \\"They will do anything for her, and always protect her.\\" And then...nearly on the eve of the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped while riding her horse in the forest. A trio of agents from Guilder, a rival kingdom, seem to have absconded with the lovely princess bride. But have they?Is Westley truly dead? Exactly who has kidnapped Buttercup, and why? Will the wedding take place?To get these answers, read this enchanting book and meet its unforgettable characters. And then when you're done, go see the charming film version of The Princess Bride, cause surely it's been too long since you last watched it, right?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Fencing. Fighting. True love. Adventure. What's not to like?Plus, it's really funny. The humor's sly, told with a totally straight face, but it's in there all right, on every page. Also, this book does have some truly touching moments as well. I just...really liked it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you've liked the movie but have never read the book, you're cheating yourself. The voice of the narrator is entertaining and the characters steal the story. I find the plot to be somewhat basic and generic, but the strong major and minor characters make it unique and enjoyable. Definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a very well written book. It is full of adventure; never has a dull moment. While there are many long description passages, they are not to the point of boredom. Afterall, that is why Goldman wrote this book; to cut out the boring parts of S. Morgenstern's novel. Also, the sarcasm in the book makes it funny, and causes you to pay closer attention to what is going on in order to catch it. Not to mention the love story part of the book. Throughout the entire novel you just want Buttercup and Westley to be together, but they keep running into these crazy events. Just when you think it's over and it can not possibly get any worse for the characters, it keeps on going. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to read a fun, light-hearted book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read The Princess Bride having seen the movie. The book and movie have similar feels and I think if you like one then you will like the other. They had the same author (or adapter anyway ;-). Basically the plots are the same (until the end, or am I only saying this so I won't spoil it for you?), but the book has more. More sword fights etc The feel is also different. In the book Buttercup is a complete ditz. Humperdink isn't all bad but still not the most likable guy.The writing style is very entertaining. We start with Goldman telling us how as a child he hated to read, until while he was bed ridden with pneumonia and his father read him The Princess Bride. He later bought the book for his own son on his 10th birthday only to realize that his father had abridged the book as he read it aloud. And so Goldman purports to tell us \\"the good parts\\" of a satirical Florinese history book. We follow the tale of young Buttercup, who is very beautiful, but also a messy little tomboy. When a certain boy catches her heart and sets out into the world to make his fortune she cleans up for his return and is the most beautiful woman on earth. This means noblemen want to marry her and she is caught up in adventure...This is an entertaining fun to read and humorous book. If you liked the movie or you like the genre then you will like this and laugh at the jokes."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of the most amazing books you'll ever lay hands on. Read it through once, and you've only got half the effect. Then sit down and read it to a child or loved one (Leaving out the asides, just like the movie ;) to get the best of it. This is one that will picked up and dusted off many times, and given away as a beloved gift more than once."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a book everyone can enjoy. It contains romance, adventure, comedy, and tragedy. Possibly one of the greatest storys ever written. If you read only one book in your lifetime, make it The Princess Bride by William Goldman."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is the best story ever written. It has the power to take you away with just the first sentence. I loved this book as a child and I still love this book 21 years later."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"There are three great books/types of books in this world: The Bible, anything by C.S. Lewis, and The Princess Bride. For all of you interested in buying this book, I'm going to try and make your decision easy. I've read the book several times and seen the movie at least 14 times. I've forced all of my friends to watch the movie. I quote the book at least once a day (usually more). Everyone who has heard the story of The Princess Bride loves it. There's somethign in it for everyone, from comedy to romance to action and adventure to drama to a tiny bit of gore. As the title page claims, it is truely a &quot;Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure&quot;. If you read this book, I guarantee that you'll love it-- and the movie is just as good, maybe even better."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"In The Princess Bride,Goldman makes fun of all the fairy tales and adventure stories about beautiful princesses and white knights ever written.By the end,my face hurt from laughing so much."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First of all, I found this to be a most enjoyable book, and, if Goldman ever gets around to completing Buttercup's Baby with or without the help of noted &quot;Florinese&quot; writer Stephen King, I will definitely be in the front of the line trying to buy it.This is just a theory, but while many of you are bashing some of the reviewers below for believing in Morgenstern, those &quot;true believers&quot; in the reality of Florin may be Goldman again, trying once more to get our collective goat. A wonderful practical joke on top of his original practical joke, if true."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I also have been having an amusing time reading those reviews where people didn't realize Goldman wrote the whole book himself. &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; has always been one of my favourite comedic books, but when I first read it (when I was eight; I'm now 22) I too believed there was a Morgenstern &quot;original&quot;. I think the reason why this book is so great is because the, shall we say, gullible, among us will think that there is a true Morgenstern, but upon repeated readings, one will realize the true genius of this story. I'm just glad I was able to find out for myself, instead of being rudely awakened by reviews like these!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a very good book. Anyone who liked the movie should like this. However, I write this review so that I may make the following statement.THERE IS NO S. MORGENSTERN.I am absolutely astounded at the number of reader's who actually thought that this man actually existed. Stop and think for a second. HOW could Goldman get this book published without the permission of this fictional &quot;original author&quot;? WHY does Morgenstern write exactly the same way that Goldman does? And finallym, why is there no mention of an original author in the copyright page? So, for everyone who plans to write a review from now on, I want to make one thing clear.THER IS NO S. MORGENSTERN."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book.

It was a little confusing when I heard that S. MOrgenstern didn't exist and neither did Florin, buut I'm a firm believer that they do. So hah. :o) Anyway, don't miss this book. The movie is great, too, and it's one of the few times where you can watch the movie and THEN read the book and still have a 'happy time.' Anyway, I hope &quot;Buttercup's Baby&quot; does get written, and I would buy it and read it too. Do NOT miss this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read this book a thousand times and have loved it even more each time. Perhaps it's because I can identify with the characters, perhaps because it's the perfect love story, perhaps because I enjoyed being sucked into the Morgenstern Spiral, perhaps because the book is entirely quoteable, but probably because Cary Elwes stars in the movie. ;o) An original, witty, &quot;pat the cover when you're done&quot; book. *sighs contentedly*"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. If you haven't, no doubt you know someone who has seen/read it and can't say enough about it. I fall into this category.I think the book is a bit &quot;smarter&quot; than the movie; the movie left out a lot of the themes that are in the book. It is these themes: love, revenge, the fairness/unfairness of life, and so many others that make it an intereresting and thought-provoking read. All the while, the fun plot keeps you wanting to read more and watch the characters on their adventure.I have never met someone who didn't like the movie or book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Don't read this book if you have no time to go on with it, because you don't want to stop! This is the most romantic, warm-hearted and hilariously funny book I've ever read. I've bought it as a gift for friend's 20 times and they all were enchanted immediately. It's a romantic story, but whenever you think, it's too much of romance, be sure, there's a surprising and very witty turning point. If you don't know the book, don't see the movie first! Goldman has written many good scripts for screen and I like his look behind the scenes of story-writing. But &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is still his masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is the best book and movie I have ever read or seen.

Of course, the hero does die, and the heroine gets married to the bad guy, but in the end, everything turns out okay, because, as Buttercup says, &quot;The bonds of love cannot be broken, not with a thousand swords.&quot; For anyone who loves adventure, comedy, and finding your one true love, this book is for you.

If you have any interest in books at all you will love this one written by William Goldman."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you are as huge a fan as I am of the film princess bride, you will most defintalely enjoy this. The book is more of an expanded version of the film. It has more of an involved romance between Wesley and Buttercup while on the farm. She is more bratty. Also there are large back-stories for the characters. (I enjoyed Both fessik's and inigo's. It seems Fessiks parents profited off of his size. And inigo's dad was infatuated with making the perfect sword.) This falls into the great and expansive category of fantasy. But, what a hot one. It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud while reading a story...this one does the trick!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the movie, but I love the book even more. I couldn't put it down, but didn't want it to end. I really enjoyed the style as the author flits back and forth between the story and his life.

Filled with fun, humor and romance it is a wonderfully fast read that had me craving for more.

He even goes into a long drawn-out narrative about the non-existant Morgentstern's infatuation with trees. It drove me nuts!Besides that, I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It is very orignal, very fun, and very timeless, and has taught me some vaulable lessons -- the first one being that life is pain, the second one being this:\\"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. (I think I got that wrong, but oh well) You kill my father. Prepare to die.\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"while at the store one day, I came across 'The Princess Bride' and bought it. as I began to read, I became slighty disappointed that, after only four pages in, there was an abridgement. I set out to find the original copy. alas, I found out that William Goldman is the true author of this amazing novel. I read through it once and read through it again. the story is about love and high adventure, just as the title says. I was a little displeased with the 1st chapter of the long lost sequel, 'Buttercup's Baby', as it left me hanging for more. I didn't want to stop. my boyfriend has read it, my brothers have read it, my children will have it told to them. it's a wonderful story, and will bring happy memories to me years in the future."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is simply pure JOY. I discovered the movie, then was gifted the book. The movie was great, but the book is tenfold! It's been made easy to read. Who doesn't want to curl up to Daring Sword Fights, Pirates, Princes, Kings, Buttercup and most of all a story about true love concurring all - including the fire swamp, death itself and schemes to start a war?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a classic book. After you read it you want every book to be this exciting and fun and romantic. I have read this book more times then I can remember. If you read this book you will feel the same way. This is such a great classic that will forever remain in my library."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I really have to hand it to Goldman for writing a book this fresh and inventive. It seems unfair that someone so creative was also blessed with a delicious sense of humor. I've read it aloud to a few special people in my life, and recommended it to everyone else.How can anyone call it a classic, when \\"The Princess Bride\\" is in a league of it's own."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Do you like romance? Do you like action? Do you like adventure? If you like all three of those then The Princess Bride is the perfect book for you. My teacher read it to us and we all loved it. If you don't like any of those categories still read this book. It's an exciting book about Westly......the handsome, heroic, and brave man who is deeply in love.....Buttercup.....the most beautiful girl in world who is kidnapped......Prince Humperdinck.....the evil ruler of Florin who is upsessed with war, torture, pain, suffering, and Buttercup.......Count Rugen......the Prince's sidekick and the king of torture, agony, and pain.........Vizzini.......the brains of the operation......Fezzik....the giant Turk who is very strong.........and Inigo.........the wonderful swordsman who lives to revenge his father's death.

Who cares who really wrote it?!?!?!?! Just enjoy it for how good it is and be quiet!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is my 2nd favorite book on earth. I think about it all the time, it is a wonderful book. I am very pleased with it after only reading it once. It is funny, dramatic, adventurous, susspenceful, it has everything a good book needs. The characters are all wonderful, everything imaginable about this book is terrific. I love this book!! So I ask you, I beg of you, please, please READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Something that a lot of you, reviewers included, might not know. There was no S Morgenstern... Florin and Guilder are NOT real places. William Goldman, being the brilliant writer that he is, made the story up... in an interview, he was quoted to saying that he got the name when he asked his daughters what he should write about. One said &quot;princesses,&quot; the other said &quot;brides.&quot;For those of you that are thinking of purchasing this book, I tell you this: The Princess Bride is probably one of the best pieces of fantasy that has EVER been written in this day and age. Not just the story itself, but the story behind it that has Goldman jumping through hoops to get the book published. You also get a hint of the sequel that's suppose to come soon, &quot;Buttercup's Baby.&quot;Please read it and enjoy... or, at the very least, rent the movie."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm a reader, first and foremost, and in general, I prefer books to movies. In this case, I prefer the movie. I tried very hard to like this book. Very hard. And I honestly was able to make it through 8 chapters before throwing in the towel and considering it a lost cause.Make no mistake; the writing was excellent, the humor quite dry and witty... but it wasn't what I'd thought I'd be reading. I picked it up thinking it would be a fun, action packed, fantasy adventure. What I read was the whining and moaning of a middle aged yuppie from the 80's interspersed with brief bursts of actual plot.Satirical social commentary is all well and good; in fact, I generally enjoy it. However, in this case, I felt betrayed. I've watched 'The Princess Bride' 50 some odd times since I was a child. I can quote whole scenes with the geekiest of geeks. I'm a fan. But the book is something altogether different. While well written and certainly quite good for what it actually is, which is mainstream fiction, it's not to my taste at all.Regardless of what anyone else says, not everyone likes mainstream fiction; it's a bit of a dirty word in my house. I've tried several times in the past to read \\"best sellers\\" and \\"book club picks\\" but can't get beyond the first few chapters before being bored out of my mind. Give me a Romance novel, a Fantasy novel or even a Manga and I'll be entertained for several hours. Even mainstream works from the 50's, 60's and 70's will tide me over to a degree. And I read Fan Fiction voraciously.Yes. I am a weird geek. I have no qualms about admitting that I prefer Star Trek to Friends and Jayne Ann Krentz to Dan Brown.This has not been the only book I've read after watching the movie where the literary roots bear little resemblance to the popular movie. 'Howl's Moving Castle' was done by Studio Ghibli in 2004 and I fell in love with it instantly. When I read the book, by Diana Wynne Jones, in 2007 I found they were two completely different animals; it's barely the same story. However, the story Jones told was also something I enjoyed.Goldman's 'Princess Bride' was as fun for me as... reading the collected works of Shakespeare, Walt Whitman or e. e. cummings might be for other people. In other words, a bit too dry, a bit too boring and not really all that much fun.To sum up, 'The Princess Bride' was a wonderful movie which I still love. The book was well written and quite funny for a satire written from the perspective of an aging yuppie contemplating a midlife crisis; but it wasn't what I was expecting and I felt betrayed and disappointed."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I bought this book for my kids as we all loved the movie and have seen it over and over again. I am the first one in the family to read it and I'll just say that the actual story is wonderful and follows the movie (I guess the movie follows it..)very closely.I was, however, extremely ANNOYED by the italic asides that Goldman inserted into the story and found them VERY distracting.It would have been so much more enjoyable if he had printed the story beginning to end and then had an appendix where he could give all his opinions and thoughts (and he has MANY!). An example of what I am talking about is found on page 168 where he interrupts the story with a long winded explanation of how Morgenstern bugged him by referring to his wife too many times and how he cut out those references...blah, blah, blah and so on and so forth for TWO WHOLE PAGES before he gets back to the story.Please, just the story! And this story is a great one if you can keep your temper and skip the italics!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this story. I've been watching the movie since I was 2 years old. Recently I bought and read the book after searching for a book by S. Morgenstern. I read this abridged version and I hated all the extra comments. Not to put down William Goldman or anything because I do love the story, but I've heard that he actually made up S. Morgenstern. And then there is a 30 page intro. about his life, which I realize he has the right to put in there and I also have the right not to read. But all throughout the book there are little comments and parts where he cut out stuff. I wanted to read the original version, without all his comments and without parts cut out. Now I don't know if he actually did make-up S. Morgenstern as I've heard, and if he didn't than it isn't his fault, but I am still upset that I can't find the original version. And if he did indeed make up this person, then I don't understand why he did it. All it gained him was me not enjoying the book as much as I might have and a 30 page made-up story about his life and how this made-up book affected it. As I said though, I don't know if S. Morgenstern really exists. I would enjoy reading the original verison much better, although I love the story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I LOVED the movie, but didn't like the book much. I read the book several years ago and wouldn't waste my time on reading it again! The writer makes Buttercup sooooooo stupid that it was really annoying. There are only a couple movies where I would say the movie is way better than the book, this one and Forrest Gump! Don't waste your time on it there are many other great books out there to read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The story was great. I would give it a five star rating. But it was abridged, and the abridger tried to make the book his own. He kept poping in here and there throughout the book to explain why he cut certain parts of the story. But the worst part was that he was also telling his own story at the same time. He claimed that his father read The Princess Bride to him whenever he was sick. Anyone who has watched the movie will immediately see that his story is the same exact one as the boy in the movie's story. Even most of the dialogue is copied from the movie. Another thing the abridger did was tell the story how his father read it to him, which was wrong most of the time, and then explain why his father told it that way, and then he would put the correct version in. It got very confusing. I did not enjoy this book that much. Keep your money and buy an unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I thought the book I purchased was a used book, but I do not believe it was, I believe it was damaged during production or shipping.The binding was ripped and the book is permenantly bent or concave.Definitely readable, and I would purchase from the \\"used\\" again. I just prefer the used to look worn not misfigured."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Firstly, I would just like to make it clear that there is NO S. Morgenstern. He is not real, and the pretence that he is is what ruins this otherwise marvelous book. The story itself is magnificent, and could become a classic. However, the wonders of the story are destroyed by Goldman's gimmick (and by destroyed, I mean beaten bludgeoned stabbed strangled run through a shredding machine chewed up into nasty wet clumps and spat into a volcano that a meteor is about to hit). For some unfathomable reason, Goldman made up the gimmicky idea that this was an abridged version of an existing tale, and instead of just abridging it, he rambles on and on. Some of the interuptions are amusing (mostly the ones in the film), but there are places where he will interupt and go of on tangeants for several pages. Worst of all, though, is the opening. As if the constant interuptions weren't bad enough (a pity; the story itself has a wonderful flow), he starts of the book with 30 pages of him rambling and insulting his wife and kid. 30 pages! If Morgenstern were real, then I don't think his ramblings could have been any worse than Goldman's. Actually, the worst is the ending. I know the book should be cynical, but jeez!It's sad, really, that this great story is so frequently interrupted by the author, just so he can tell you what making Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was like.I rarely say this, but the movie is better. On their own grounds, the stories are farely equal, and basically the same. The movie suceeds though, by leaving Goldman's interludes out, and it deserves to be the classic that the book isn't. Oh, and don't feel that the movie is a blasphemy towards the source material. Goldman wrote the screenplay."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Oh man, was I disappointed when I received this. First of all, the author who has abridged the story will not shut up during the story telling, he's constantly interrupting with his comments, that, while vaguely amusing about ten percent of the time, are just rude interruptions in a story. I, for one of the first times in my life, prefer the movie over the book. If only I could rip out the portions where the abridging author interrupts the original author and have that abridged uninterrupted version, then I would be happy."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The book is Ok but has some major problems that the movieavoids. The biggest problem is the author putting too muchpersonal information in. Skip both introductions, they dolittle but detract from the book. There is a little bit onpages XI - XIV about the cast for the movie that is interestingbut by all means skip the rest.Many of the author's comments in the book (the italic text) canalso be skipped, though it is not as bad as the introductions.You can skip the comments on pages 41, 171, 206, 247 and 316.You may want to read them on pages 65, 73, 83, 195, 197, 281 and96.The movie is great, the book less so. One day I may edit itand create my own 'best parts' version.Ken"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I really liked the story by S. Morgenstern, but the random interruptions by Mr. Goldman really got on my nerves by the end. I actually give this book 3.5 stars, but since that isn't an option, I rounded up. Mr. Goldman did cut out a lot of stuff I would really have liked to read, ie Buttercup's princess training. The parts I did get to read were great, I really loved them, but some day I'd love to get my hands on an unabridged version. Also, the version I had had the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby, the sequal to Princess Bride. Supposedly it was supposed to be written by Steven King, but I've yet to find it, which is really too bad, I'd love to read his version, or any version for that matter."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you enjoyed the film, the novel is worth a read. It's a cute story. The characters are endearing and the narration does a lovely job of poking fun at itself (and its genre.) My only complaint -- and unfortunately it's a big one -- is that by the end of the book, I was sick to death of Goldman's interruptions! I ended up skipping large chunks of the last few chapters only to reach an ending which, in my opinion, doesn't hold a candle to the ending of the film. The whole thing's a bit of a letdown, but you could do worse on a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman did way better with the screenplay for the movie. This book was actually pretty bad except for die-hard fans of the movie, who might want to see where movie came from. It's hard to believe the same man wrote both the book and the screen play."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I had a hard time emotionally engaging in this book. It is mainly a frenetic joke that speeds rapidly by. I love Rob Reiner as a director and William Goldman is one of my favorite screenwriters. I just didn't love this book. I have always liked the movie, not loved it but thought the book would be better. It just isn't for me."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I absolutely loved this book. But I was very angry when I heard that Mr. Goldman didn't have a wife named Helen or a chubby kid named Jason. And no Jason means no Willy. But the story is a classic, and I hope Buttercup's Baby was not just a joke, like everything else about Mr.Goldman. I love this book down to the very last sylabub!!!!! That is why I recommend it to every person, young or old."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The movie The Princess Bride was I believe my first true love back in the 5th grade. It had everything I could possibly imagine in a fairy tale. However, it was a long time though before I realized there was a book.Believe me it was just a pleasure falling in love all over again reading the pages of the story that unfolded by the words of William Goldman or S Morgenstern. ;) To me the book just described the characters and story more in detail. It pretty much sticks with the movie that we all know and love, but certain characters are a little different in the book. For me though it makes perfect sense the way the characters are described is the way they became and grew as far as personality goes. Buttercup is really greatly described; however, from memory I do wish he would have gone into more detail of Westley. I do love the more in depth story of Inigo and Fezzik. After reading the book I really had a hard time choosing a favorite between the two. Also the adventures are pretty much the same, but some are also quite different with new surprises which I will not spoil for you.As an interesting side note there is personal touches of William Goldman's stories and the creation of The Princess Bride from movie to book. They can be quite annoying at times and long winded, but I admit I became very inspired in a few parts. Especially, the admiration he has for his son and his struggles, but how he eventually became a wonderful, successful, person.The book is also a little longer than I expected and some parts where a little hard to get through. I did bypass Buttercup's Baby because I did not want to be disappointed and I liked how the book originally ended. I may one day read it soon, but some may like it and find it rather interesting. I also did not like the idea that Buttercup's Baby was not completed.All in all I loved the book. I read it within a few days, it is one of the few I can not put down and that I love to read over and over again. It is a classic in my book collection."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I bought this book a day ago, and read it from cover to cover without stopping. This is probably the most charming book that I have read. Get a copy, and read it to someone you love."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was absolutely adorable. It was interesting getting to read the story and cute little remarks about the story all at once. I remember having my mother reading to me when i was little and the little comments with the story helped me enjoy it much more because it felt like i was being told a story and not just reading it. It is an adorbale classic romance that little girls dream and are told about while growing up. I found this book absolutely delightful and made me feel like a child all over again it brought me back to a time when true love was possible, the good guys win against the bad guys, and magic is real."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"&quot;The Princess Bride&quot; by S. Morgenstern is one of the most compelling and adventurous books I have ever read. The character developments and story lines are simply outstanding and have always captured my imagination, no matter how many times I have read the book.Simply, this book is amazing. The story revolves around WEsley and Buttercup, two lover, who are separated when Wesley sails to America to find work so he can marry his love. But fate takes a hand when his Ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, and he is killed. Buttercup had married another in five years upon Wesley's return to her. But it was really untrue and they live happily ever after, even with the help of a giant, a spaniard, and a cast of fairy tale horrors."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a true fantasy classic. William Goldman describes it as a \\"good parts version\\" of \\"S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure.\\" Morgenstern's original was filled with details of Florinese history, court etiquette, and Mrs. Morgenstern's mostly complimentary views of the text. Mr. Goldman's father described it to him as a story that has everything: \\"Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.\\" Now, Mr. Goldman is publishing an abridged version, interspersed with comments on the parts he cut out.This is one of those books that is a mixture of good and bad parts. I would recommend it to any HP fan."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is the book that taught me to love reading. It was the first &quot;adult&quot; book that I remember getting at the library when I got the fabled Adult Library Card. I believe I was 12 and I devored this book in a week. This will be the book that I will one day read to my kids to show them how magical books can be. This is Goldmans best,(Yes, Goldman...not the fictional Morgenstern)and although he's written some other pretty good books, none of them come close to this one. If you haven't yet, read this and then read it to your kids. Let them end their day with Fezik, Inigo, Prince Humperdink, Westly, and Buttercup; send them to their dreams with adventures in the Fire Swamp, the Pit of Dispair, and the Cliffs of Insanity. You (and they) won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My book club chose this book, and we just had our meeting last night. Everyone seemed to like it, but decided that the movie was better. First off: you have to realize that William Goldman is the ONLY author. The whole book is a work of fiction - from him being sick as a child, to \\"S. Morgenstern\\", to his so called narration of his child/adult life. The entire book is meant for entertainment. It's actually quite ingenious when you think of how he pulled it off, and fooled so many readers into thinking that everything is true. Where his style of writing is not for everyone, he does have a gifted imagination.So, that is why there is such a long introduction into the book; and why there is so much discussion about \\"Buttercups Baby\\" @ the end. The entire book is meant to be a story, not just the middle portion about \\"The Princess Bride.\\" All you have to do is research the fictional countries he refers to (Florin, Guilder); or even go to Stephen King's website. It's all fiction - as it's meant to be.I liked it, but not enough to buy it. I will still watch the movie repeatedly, but I think this might be the last of the book for me. You should read it - with this new insite - and see what you think. (Head's up: for those of you wanting to let your children read it, the book does contain some torturing of animals and a coulple curse words.)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"What can I say about The Princess Bride? I both liked it and disliked it. I liked the story overall. For the most part it's a unique and fun read. I like that it's a fairy tale with romance, adventure and humor.What I disliked was that author William Goldman makes it seem as though S. Morgenstern wrote the book, and that Goldman's version of the story is the 'good parts version'. That annoyed me so very much!And the amount of writing that he used during the beginning and the end of the story to re-inforce this was a bit much for me. I didn't so much mind his commentary within the story, some of it made me laugh.It's funny because in the introduction Goldman tells a convincing tale about this being abridgement of an earlier novel. So I fell for it. I tend to google 'new to me authors' and anything in a book that I'm unfamiliar with, so I googled S. Morgenstern only to find out Goldman invented him. Which made perfect sense to me then because I kept thinking this really sounded far-fetched. Especially when Goldman brings Stephen King into the mix as a native of Florin who is in cahoots with the curators at the S. Morgenstern museum.Anyway, once the story takes off, the beautiful Buttercup lives in the countryside in Florin and is the envy of all the females in town because of her beauty. Long story short, Buttercup falls in love with the Farm Boy Westley. Westley tells her he is leaving for America to claim his fortune so he can return and marry her. Buttercup is overjoyed and the two finally have their first kiss.There have been five great kisses since 1642 B.C., when Saul and Delilah Korn's inadvertent discovery swept across Western civilization. (Before then couples hooked thumbs.) And the precise rating of kisses is a terribly difficult thing, often leading to great controversy, because although everyone agrees with the formula of affection time purity times intensity time duration, no one has ever been completely satisfied with how much weight each element should receive. But on any system, there are five that everyone agrees deserve full marks.Well, this one left them all behind.Westley isn't gone too long before Buttercup receives news that he has been killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. She swears to never love again. She ends up being engaged to Prince Humperdinck, but lets him know that she will never love him. One day while Buttercup is out on one of her horse rides, she is kidnapped by a Sicilian, a Spaniard named Inigo and a giant named Fezzik. Soon after the kidnapping, the trio realize they are being followed by a 'man in black'.There is so much to The Princess Bride that I can't really go into it all. I think most of us have seen the film. The book captivated me as soon as the actual story started.I really enjoyed the witty dialogue and all the characters. Besides Buttercup and Westley, Inigo and Fezzik quickly became favorite characters as well. I enjoyed how Goldman went into their story lines and backgrounds also.The dialogue was funny throughout the book. This is Buttercup's parents debating over who would go see what the Count and Countess want when they arrive at the couples doorstep:\\"What could they want to ask me about?\\" he said.\\"Go see, go see,\\" Buttercup's mother told him.\\"You go. Please.\\"\\"No. You. Please.\\"\\"We'll both go.\\"They both went. Trembling...For the most part I thought it was fun the way Goldman comments throughout the story in (parentheses) and italics. But as I said before, the way he kept going on and on about S. Morgenstern and the original Princess Bride got to be too much for me. All in all, I'm glad I read it and would recommend it. Because of the storyline, the dialogue and the great characters I gave it a 4 star rating. There's some great lines in this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My 4 year-old loves this movie. Thought the book would read as easy as it did for Peter Folk when he read it in the flick. I was wrong and will try again in 10 years. Too wordy even for my tatse."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This story is so charming and delightful. There is definitely something for everyone - humor, true love, fencing, kidnapping, the fire swamp, and the zoo of death. There is so much more detail and humor that was left out of the movie, that it was a real treat to read. Definitely a classic adventure story!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my favorite book. I like it even better than the movie (also my favorite movie). I am literally obsessed with it. I could talk about it all day. But I won't. Just read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was pleased with the quality of the binding. The map of Florin lines the inside of both the front and back covers. One thing which disappointed me was that the cool gold 'embossed' cover you see in the picture online is only printed on the dust jacket. The cover to the actual book does not look 'old-timey,' and in fact is rather plain.If you're searching for a review of the actual content of the book, see previous reviews."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of my absolute all timne favorite books, it lacks nothing, ther's adventure, romance, humor and anything else you could possibly want in a book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a great book! I really liked it and I read it in about a day and a half. I hope that the sequel comes out soon, and that it's not just a hoax. Anyway, I really recommend this book to anyone who likes FICTION adventure. I capitalized fiction because in his writing he made it sound like it was a true story talking about \\"Buttercup's farm\\" and \\"Visiting Florin\\" which isn't even a country. Also, just in case you're looking for the original because this is \\"abridged\\" this is it. This is the original book not an abridged version. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book but I have just found out that morgernstern never actually existed and william goldman made the whole thing up"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since 1997, and still look forward to reading it more. Although Goldman's little inserts get pretty annoying from time to time, he writes it in a font that you can skip over if you wish. I am truly glad that Goldman decided to edit this book, otherwise, i don't think anyone would be able to get through it! The movie follows the book very closely, but the book gives more detail and background about Fezzik and Inigo! This is my favorite book, and i hope you all enjoy it as well!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"For the first time ever, I feel the movie was better. The author interrupts constantly with comments that bring you out of the story and it is not as \\"charming\\" as it plays out on the screen.

Once I found out about the book I just had to get it!So, is it better than the movie?While I certainly enjoyed the background information on Fezzik and Inigo, this is one of the first books that I can honestly say is better as a movie. Notice, that I have given this book 5 stars, so we are distinguishing between very good and very, very good here. Still, the movie is a further abridgement of S. Morgenstern's classic tale (wink, wink) that makes the story even stronger.My edition had a wonderful new introduction the recounted some of the struggles and joys in making the movie and includes the first chapter of the long-lost 'sequel' entitled 'Buttercup's Baby.' Both are worth your time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Hello everyone. I'm just a person that LOVES fairy tales. I think every should read \\"The Princess Bride\\". I have the movie also. My mother loves it too, that is why she got the movie(after I read the book). I watch it over and over until my head spins! :) Any way, for those who haven't read this book, you should at least check it out. True love is the cause and effect. This book is about a girl named Buttercup who LOVES the farm boy, named Wesley. All he says to her is \\"As you wish\\" It really means \\"I love you\\" He left her saying that he would find great fortune in America. Westley's ship was attacked by pirates and the news broke Buttercup's heart. She then meets Prince Humperdinck since she thinks Westley is dead. She gets kidnapped by assassins hired by Humperdinck to kill Buttercup on the enemy's land so he can defeat them. A pirate named Roberts follows and defeats the 2 assassins, letting them live and killed the first with a odorless poisonous powder. that is my favorite part, Well, the whole thing is mly favorite.

Although you can get a little clarity on certain parts of the movie, its not that entertaining. Its more comedy than the actual movie and tends to get a bit tedious to read. I did enjoy hearing a little more about each of the characters and their pasts which makes the book worth getting if you are a fan of the movie. Usually I would recommend skipping over anything that is a William Goldman insert since it usually takes away from the story more than it adds."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Someone please tell me where to find the original S. Morgenstern book! I love the Princess Bride, but I just want to read the original, unabridged book, not all the stuff William Goldman says. I know that it is funny and all but I like to read passages uninterrupted, without him putting in his two cents about his family or teachers. Besides that, it is a wonderful book and a great movie too. Does anyone know where to find a copy of the real book?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"i read this book in one of my classes. It was an excelent book. most of my fellow students also liked this book. superb."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Great characterizations. I had trouble liking the Princess Bride but it had it's good moments. At some parts it was extremely boring."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a good book. I especially liked the beginning, with all the accounts of the most beautiful women in the world. The ending is also enjoyable and exciting. But when you're wading through everything else nothing can compare to the movie. I can see why many may dismiss the movie as cheesy, but it's one of those things that is so bad it's good. And it is involving and exciting, and the humor is a lot more prevalent than it is in the book. I got bored halfway through the book. I don't know why - the movie and book are very similar. But the author's interruptions annoyed me after a while - they were never as entertaining as the scenes with Fred Savage and the grandfather in the movie. And while it was nice to get more behind-the-scenes information (i.e. what happens when Inigo and Fezzik wake up after being beaten by Westley). But in the end I only realized why that was cut from the movie; it's not really necessary to further the story, and remains more interesting without it. Anyway, it is worth reading, especially if you're a fan of the movie."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The only thing I can say is: The movie is bad compared to the book. I watched the movie IMMEDIATLY after I read the book, and I felt it was ... blech. But it did have some of the exact same lines as the book. And yes, it's kind of an old movie. It may be just me that hates the movie.All in all, one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love The Princess Bride since I watched the movie some years ago. I remember it as a very funny, romantic and adventourous one.So, without a second thought, I bought this book and, from story side, my opinion still the same. Except...I know, Mr. Goldman did a very good job in abridging the heavy book, which if I ever got the change to read the real Mogernstern's, if the description is right, I will throw it or put it somewhere I won't see.But, there are something I still want to know in detail like Westley's youth story, since he is the main goodlooking hero character, it is reasonable to be wanting to know more of him, not just about Fezzik and Inigo.So despite of the story, which I am gladly give a 5 star, I gave Mr. Goldman's a 4 (and a half, but there's no halves in comment tool).And I also very much want to read the rest of Buttercup's Baby. The first chapter is very intriqing."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"At the beginning of the story, I kept thinking &quot;So what?&quot; as Goldman spoke of his childhood fascination with books. When &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; started, it was a total relief. Highly entertaining and funny. (The best parts are before Westley leaves to seek his treasure.) I even began to like Goldman's interruptions with his own thoughts and ideas. The end kind of falls apart. Still, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is a wonderful fairy tale and worth rereading."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just couldn't put it down and when I had to go somewhere I couldn't wait to read some more"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Hey to all you readers who look for a good laugh and a scheme of passion, romance, giants, chases, escapes, true love, and of course miracles. I could not recommend a better book for this. Mind you, the humor is dry, so don't expect to be immediately hysterical. Overall, this book has always been my favorite fairy tale since the 5th grade and even if you have already seen the movie, the book is twice as fantastic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have read this book so many times, it's not even funny! This is the most hilarious and best book in the world! I also love the movie, but it's not as good as the book b/c it has so much more description! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A terrific story! So what's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True love. Strong hate. Cruel betrayals. Harsh revenge. A few giants. Lots of bad men. Lots of good men. Five or six beautiful women. Beasties monstrous and gentle. Some swell escapes and terrific captures. Life, death, lies, truth, miracles, tragedies and a little sex. In short, it's just about everything."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read the Princess Bride for the first time as a Junior in High School. Along with many more serious works, this was included as required reading in Lyle Daniel's Vashon High Jr. English class. It was nearly 10 years later that I saw the movie. I highly recommend the book, although the movie was done quite well. If you are looking for a story to build a love of reading in a young person this is it. I am thrilled to find copies of the book available through Amazon. I recently went to the King County library to check out a copy to read to my neices and nephew and found they only carry the movie. I may have to buy and extra copy or two to donate!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Does anyone know if the sequal to The Princess Bride, Buttercup's Baby, does exist or is it fictional just like &quot;Morgenstern?&quot; I would really like to know."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Well, I love this book. I saw the movie first, and the book is better. The parts about the zoo of death in the book are way better then the movie. A book is usually better because you can go sit down and watch a movie for two hours or you can watch and live it for weeks or days. A book grabs you and makes you part of the story. I recommend this, but I won't hate you if you dislike it. I do have a request to make. IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT PROOF OF MORGENSTERN, WETHER REAL OR FAKE PLEASE TELL ME. I don't know what I believe, but I would like to know the truth. It makes the book so good either way. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Humor and adventure, down to earth facts and witty inserts. This book can hold the attention of anyone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"all those who claim that moregenstern doesn't exist obviously don't realize that it happens to be part of william goldman's middle name. just as morgenstern exists as part of mr. goldman's delightfully warped tale. bravo to his book and his screenplay."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was looking for my copy of this book last week and was very disturbed that it was no where to be found. How glad I am that the publisher has re-relased the book in hardcover. I will never tire of this book. What a shame that the movie left out my favourite scene in the book where Fezik and Inigo descend into the Zoo of Death. All the brilliance of the book can be summarised with the tension and humour of that scene. Loved this book![regarding discussion about abridged v. unabridged versions: Are there really SO many morons in this world?!]"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my favorite book, I've given so many as gifts. When I was a kid I used to act out the characters with my brother. We would go over who we'd cast in the movie (way before the movie was done)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I found this book highly readable and almost completley captivating. I say almost for one simple reason - the stylistic conceit of pretending to abridge someone-elses work started to get a little silly. Come on people out there, you cannot seriously believe there's an original out there, being jealously guarded by the Shog lawyer clan? Style complaints aside, it's got rapiers, princesses, silly one liners, and it's actually better than the film."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first saw the movie when I was in seventh grade, we were required to read the book first, but I skipped that assignment, as soon as Inigo Mantoya finished his famous line, I vowed to read the book from cover to cover. Three hours later I was through. I have never read anything that grabbed my heart and made me laugh and cry and stand up and cheer so often as 'The Princess Bride'. I can recite every single word!! I love this book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book. I saw the movie recently and hated it coz' the book was the only one to setup the plot magnificiently. True love ........"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Ah, to be able to read this book over and over again ... for the first time.I first read the book in 1976 or so (way before the movie) and thought it the most remarkable story I'd ever read. I was 19. I've read the story many times since then. The hyberbole used in the book ... the smartest ... the strongest ... the most beautiful ... the most evil ... it was so clear and different from anything else I'd favored until then. The plot is pure energy, the situations (mostly) over-the-top, and the characters the most fun you will ever have with a novel. Goldman's style is quick and clean and suited to his story.I must add, though, that the story is only worth four stars on it's own ... it's Goldman's vehicle of &quot;interjections&quot; and side comments that truly made the book special, and magical and fun, and truly worth the fifth star.A super story, and one that I will be reading to my daughter very, very soon. And maybe she, too, will be transported away like her dad was so many years ago."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a classic book, wonderfully funny and touching; but a few people (including a number of book reviewers) seem to be taking William Goldman's literary conceit a little too seriously. There is no such person as S. Morgenstern, and no original &quot;unabridged&quot; version of The Princess Bride. It's a joke, folks. We even have a &quot;reader from Detroit&quot; who dismisses Goldman's &quot;version&quot; and insists one search out the &quot;real&quot; version, when there is no such thing. This is it, and it's Mr Goldman's pure, original, and wonderful invention."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This was one of my all-time favorite books, hands down. This new edition is well worth owning (and reading!), as I don't believe that the material added at the end (Buttercup's Baby) has been published before.However, I would like to respond to a few comments that have already been posted here. In particular: there is no &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot;, and the tale of the Princess Bride (The Good Parts Version) is entirely the work of William Goldman. In fact, part of the charm and humor is what Goldman considers to be &quot;The Good Parts.&quot; As far as shameless profiteering goes: the book predates the movie by fifteen-some years (and my kudos to Rob Reiner for having the vision that this book would make a wonderful film - and then doing it).One final thought: in case you can find it: there is another work by Goldman/Morgenstern called &quot;The Silent Gondoliers&quot;, which can be found with either Goldman or Morgenstern as the author. Well worth reading, but it is (unfortunately) out of print."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"For anyone who has ever had dreams about being a princess or a pirate or a prince..you have to read this book. It is both hilarious and dramatic at the same time. You turn the pages faster and faster as you get deeper into the book. Does Buttercup marry Humperdinck or does the man in black save her? What about Inigo and Fezzik? What happens next is all you can think about. William Goldman has done an excellent job creating or abridging(Which is it???) The Princess Bride!! Read this book!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read this book as a kid and it still ranks as my favorite book ever. the character development is top notch with the most fascinating people I have ever read about. each person is given their own chapter to outline their life and give us a look into their motivations and actions. it is funny, touching, action packed, suspenseful, all rolled into a flowing story that keeps you hooked from the start."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I understand why people don't like to read. Non-readers will argue that it's not any fun, it's boring, it puts them to sleep, and so on. But none of those are the real reason people don't read. The reason is simply this: they haven't read this book. If you've read it, you know what I'm talking about; if you haven't, I can't possibly begin to explain it to you. Don't look for some two sentence synopsis of The Princess Bride in this review. You won't get it. Trying to describe the plot is an excercise in futility. It would sound stupid and silly--believe me I've tried it. Just trust me when I say this is the best book I have ever read, bar none."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A great story in which love conquers all. A must read book.

I suppose I shouldn't be reviewing it yet as I've only read half of it so far. But I wanted to slide a question in here that would greatly enhance my reading experience -- Is there really an original version by S. Morgenstern? I would love to get my hands on it, but I can't find it anywhere. Got any ideas?Well, I'd better comment on the book since otherwise Amazon.com might not publish my review.... The book's fantastic -- funny, suspenseful -- absolutely delightful. I think it is the only book I've read where seeing the movie first actually enhances the reading experience. Read this to yourself, and then read it to your kids!

The book reads just as exciting, and just as witty now that I'm 31. Fun, exciting, and a great sense of humor that I don't find in most other adventures, or most other books for that matter. When it comes to a good, fun, adventure of a read, this books ranks as one of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you were one of the many to read &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and believe that William Goldman was dastardly in his heavy &quot;editing&quot; of the book, READ IT AGAIN! You'll love the book all that much more upon rereading with the realization that the &quot;editorials&quot; are all part of the story. Probably the niftiest (and hardest) thing to pull off about the novel was in Goldman writing HIMself into the story! Magical! Also, get yourself a copy of both &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;The Color of Light&quot; (and anything else you can get your paws on!) -- the same shining William Goldman wit, panache, flair, humor and eletrifying skill at manipulating the reader (roar with laughter for 5 pages [and irk everyone around you as you are forced to read lines out loud!], and suddenly weep your eyes out for the next 2 pages, and then 2 pages later climb onto a rollercoaster and scream around all the white-knuckler loop-de-loops!!) (and the incredible thing is, ! I'! m not exaggerating!). If you've never read William Goldman, oh you lucky dawg!

Don't listen to anyone who says it's not. I read it 4 days six months ago when I was 14 and it's wondreful for any age. W. Goldman tells the story of true love, passion, fighting, bad men, good men, all in humor but also gives us a new look on life. Life is hardly ever the way you want it to be. It's not fair as Goldman says. But we can enjoy his book and others to get a way from it all. His humor with his invention of the story and S. Morgenstein is hilarious. Please, please, please read it and you will never want to put it down. I 've practically memorized the whole book and find myself repeating parts to myself at times because it is just soooo good! READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I tried to find the 'original' Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern---the genius William Goldman gives credit to constantly, only to discover (I think) that S. Morgenstern never existed and William Goldman wrote the book himself. Fine--didn't he think we'd like it? Frankly, I find the whole device silly and boring, and I don't enjoy the book as much as I used to. I still do enjoy it, especially the fencing scene, but I hate William Goldman for the stupid way he told the story. And, of course, the charming history of him as a sick boy reading this that never happened. Grow up, Goldman! But the book itself is really, really good!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"i first fell in love with the movie but when i picked up the book i couldn't put it down and read it through twice in one sitting. it was hilarious and my stomach was killing me when i finally put it down."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I always think it is astonishing when readers/reviewers become aggravated because a fantasy story is not really true. This is a delightful, fantastic, and endearing fictional fairytale that's a classic. There are so many reviews, mine is just another on the gigantic pile. All I can add: This book should be in your home library."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride, written by William Goldman, is a story of action and romance where a farm boy turned sailor named Westley risks life and limb to save Buttercup. Saving her from the Prince's wrath isn't as easy as he thought though.This story is all about the supposed history of Florin, a city in pain. Even through the troubles that overcame the land, two people were able to find love only to have it ripped apart. The suspense of this novel keeps you on your toes most of the time with the thrilling fights and fright about what is coming next, but sometimes the descriptions can get a little dull.Mr. Goldman wrote this novel in mostly an informal style. The book was supposed to be written as if Mr. Goldman's father was reading the story aloud to him. He is very clear and precise with the point that he is trying to convey. This made it easier to follow along with the storyline throughout the novel. His description of the Death Zoo is quite interesting in the way that he organizes the animals and even how he comes up with creative new deadly beasts.Most of the characters in The Princess Bride are derived from the author's imagination of the different types of people that would have lived in this era. They all come from different cultures and backgrounds, but they come together throughout the story. The characters are dynamic and all seem to follow different ways of thinking that are hard to bring together. Their personalities really shine through the descriptions that Mr. Goldman makes. He has them say specific repeated lines that show what type of person they really are and how they grow throughout the book. When Westley says \\"as you wish\\" to Buttercup, he expresses how much of a caring person he is. Through all of Prince Humperdinck's orders you can tell that he really only cares about himself and his powers in the kingdom.One of the overall themes in this novel is that love conquers all. We tend to hear that a lot with newfound lovers when they say that they would do \\"anything\\" for that other person, but it often seems that these events don't turn out how those people planned. Love is what The Princess Bride is all about. Westley loves Buttercup and when she gets snatched up by the Prince he is devastated. He didn't give up though. Even through all the torture and torment he went through, he still fought hard to rescue her from the Prince before it was too late. The central message is also to simply persevere and you will achieve anything you want. Even when the odds were against Westley and Buttercup being together, he never gave up. He kept trying until finally she was able to truly love and be with him forever."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The story itself is wonderful. A definite must read. Just as every book it differs from the movie. The only negative part of the book is how much it is interrupted but the authors thoughts. Regardless it is still a classic and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this book and my only regret is that I didn't find it or know about it for all these years. I don't need to say anything else as it all seems to have been covered by the numerous other reviews."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"While reading the book, I thought Goldman was editing a book previously written by Morgenstern. I later learned that Morgenstern never existed. Goldman used this as a device. My comments below were my reactions to the book when I was ignorant of the facts and believed what I was reading.Too frequently the author Goldman described why he omitted various pages of Morgenstern's work, and that other things he kept were in Morgenstern's original words. Goldman's comments about what he edited took me out of the story too much. The characters, plot, and action were interesting, but Morgenstern's writing style was tedious.There were a few clever lines that had me chuckling. Readers who love action, adventure and heroes with amazing powers will probably like this story more than I did. The ideas were creative and fun.At the end of this book, Goldman edits the first chapter of a second Morgenstern book called \\"Buttercup's Baby.\\" That chapter provides more details for the ending of \\"The Princess Bride\\" which is nice, but it also leaves the reader hanging because it starts a new story with unanswered questions. The writing of this chapter was not done chronologically which was confusing and made the story less enjoyable. (According to Wikipedia, Goldman never finished or published the Buttercup's Baby story.)DATA:Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: Unknown time (during sword fighting days) in Europe. Copyright: 1973. Genre: adventure fiction."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Beautiful edition of a terrific book, with several great intoductions by the author and additional material not seen in previous editions.High recommended!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First and foremost, know that I'm a complete Princes Bride movie buff; the book is \`very' different from the movie but in a very cool way. The book is a lot more dark; however should be expected; it's common for a book to be better than a movie, so get ready for what almost seems like another adventure with the memorable characters we all know and love in the movie. The only negative thing I have about the book is that the introduction is very dry reading. For those of you who want to just jump in and start reading, you'll have a HUGE set of introductions to wade through before getting to the good stuff. Otherwise, this is a fantastic book and I'm glad that I got the chance to read it; it sits on my bookshelf next to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman's 'The Princess Bride' tells the story of the true love between buttercup and Westley- and all the obstacles they have to overcome: An evil prince, a giant, a master swordsman, giant rodents and even death itself.It is a clever take on fairy tale stories. But although it is funny and plays with he conventions of folk tales in a knowing kind of way, it never descends into cynicysm and therefore remains very enjoyable.I had seen the movie first and was surprised how closely the movie followed the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the book! I have read it twice. It includes a lot more detail than the movie and the Pit of Despair scene is quite different. It is a lot more exciting and a lot longer in the book. There is also more detail in the fireswamp. You get the back story on Fezzik and a much longer one on Inigo Montoya. There is also more detail on how Wesley and Buttercup grew up together and fell in love. If you're a big fan of the movie then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Anyone who loves the movie won't be disappointed by the book. The movie followed it very closely and it's great to get some of those extra background details. Quick read and I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If I hadn't been a fan of the movie, I may not have been interested. But I very much enjoyed Mr.Goldman explaining how the rights to the book and the making of the movie came about.I like this version!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book! When you actually got to read it that is... I wasn't really fond of Goldman's, sometimes arrogant, interjections though. I think I'd rather have read the bits he cut then listen to him ramble about why he cut them. I was most of all annoyed with the introductions in this edition. First you have to get through the 30th anniversary, then the 25th... and so on. Basically, I was 17% complete before I even read the first word of the actual book. By that time I was echoing Prince Humperdink's famous line \\"Skip to the end\\".The extra 'Buttercup's Baby' chapter wasn't comparable to Princess, but added a great deal to the characters that you didn't get from Princess. I'm not sure where a lot of the back story on Indigo was going, but it got a bit stale in the middle for me.The Princess Bride story itself was fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of stuff that made it directly to the movie (of which is my favorite film of all time). I went into reading this a little apprehensively actually, I was worried that the difference between the book and the movie would be frustrating, as it usually is, but I am delighted to say they both hold their respective water!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Wow, where do I begin? Being a big fan of the movie and critical of adaptations, this book was as close to perfect as you could possibly get! I absolutely loved it! The movie stays very faithful to the book; and the book is purely awesome. The book even contained the aspect that the story was being read to a child by an adult. Goldman took it even a step further and created an entire storyline outside of the actual Princess Bride story. The whole idea of abridging the \\"original\\" story by Morgenstern was fictitious, but it had me believing it was the truth. It wasn't until after finishing the book, I looked it up on the internet and found out it was fake; it was all part of the story. Very creative, I must say.Aside from that, the main story of The Princess Bride was exciting, funny, and touching. The characters were deep, witty, and likable. It contained a great balance of romance, action, suspense, and witty humor. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll cherish the book. It gives greater detail and background to various characters not seen in the movie.This has undoubtedly become my favorite book by far. To think another story could outdo it is absolutely........INCONCEIVABLE!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this movie when it came out, and have had it in each format as it was introduced. This is one of the greatest movies ever, so when I was browsing recently and came across this 25th anniversary edition, I had to get one, since I did not until now have the book.Printing and binding is done very well, nothing loose and nothing feels like it's going to pull apart. And it's kind of like a DVD with the extras in it.For any serious fan of the movie, it's a must have."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The book met my expectations, not only for the content but also for the quality of the paperback. It was well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I gave this to our grandson for Christmas. He is a junior in high school. I was so pleased with his comment \\"better than the movie\\".And we all LOVE the movie.So there we were quoting funny lines to each other and laughing. Imagine three generations all loving and laughing at thesame book. I warned him about sharing, always have a loaner because you might not get it back."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I grew up with the movie. I had probably watched it a million times, over and over again. So when I became a book nerd, I was excited to finally read it. To be honest, I hadn't realized the movie was actually based on a book. William Goldman abridged the super long and probably really boring story known as \\"The Princess Bride\\" and turned it into the exciting masterpiece that we have all loved on the big screen.All those little comments between the little boy from Wonder Years and the grandfather were actually comments that Goldman inserted into his abridged version. Comments that actually transpired between him and his grandfather. It was amazing to read that the side story that happens right along with the main story was not something the producer had developed on their own but something that originally came from the written word.I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves adventure, romance, betrayal and a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is an abridged version of the original Morgenstern novel (ie all the good bits none of the boring stuff) It is exactly like the movie we all know and love. So glad I bought it - now my kids can grow up with it too. Brilliant, pageturning novel"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I feel so grumpy for saying it, but...the book was just okay. The movie was definitely better. And I really hope thast Goldman is nothing like he portrays himself in the book--I found that character really distasteful.Nothing wrong with the book, it was just very average."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I spent a month of evenings reading this to my children rather than watching the movie. I did for my girls what Goldman's dad did for him and abridged the story. In this case I removed all of the Goldman interjections and kept the storyline going with Goldman's adaptation of the Morgenstern.There are few stories that come close to the Princess Bride. From the cliffs of insanity and the sword-fight to the Zoo of Death, this tale had my family laughing, gasping for breath, and riding every wave of exhilaration until the very last page.As I read the last words of the story (without Goldman's interjections) to my kids I was met with stunned silence, followed by an exasperated, \\"Oh, Come on!\\"They couldn't believe that after going through so much, the end would be what it was for Buttercup and Westley.So much better than the movie! And so much better when you get to share it with your children and watch them hear it all for the very first time. A real classic.We can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I assume anyone reading this review has seen the movie. If not, go do that first. I'll wait.This is the second time I've read the book - the first was some fifteen years ago in high school, as I recall. It's an odd book in that it immediately strikes me as being enjoyable in its own way, but obviously inferior to the movie. Maybe that's because Goldman was primarily a screenwriter and he communicates better on the screen. Maybe it's that the three layers of story (the story itself, the \\"history\\" of Morgenstern et al, and the story of Goldman's life) seem to be too much. A second reading doesn't make the fake historical element seem any more justified than it was on the first time; I'm still left asking \\"Why?\\", particularly in the section where he explains that he's cut a big chunk out of the plot for no good reason (the Oz excuse). And while in the movie the boy and his grandfather were a simple, pleasant framing device, in the book Goldman's New York Jewish unhappiness is too weighty and drags on the story.The book itself departs from the movie in a number of ways; some are expected (simple added details, like the history of Fezzik or the hunting capabilities of the Prince), and some are not (like the underutilized Zoo of Death, or the brilliant countdown of the most beautiful women in the world; this is possibly the best spot in the book that isn't also in the movie). Probably the best thing about the book is that, since it contains so much more dialogue between the characters, it gives you a much better grasp of just how tongue-in-cheek Goldman is about this whole endeavor. A viewer of the film could be forgiven for thinking that Buttercup, for example, is earnest but simple, while a reader gets a much fuller and funnier picture of the limits of her comprehension (which is not at all to denigrate the excellence of the actors). Overall, if you really liked the movie, you ought to read this book. But if not, it won't convince you."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you need to read a review of this book to decide if you need to read the book, you don't need to buy the book and most likely shouldn't watch the movie. This book/story/movie is a CLASSIC and will last through the years. Need proof? It's 2012, and we're still talking about it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Yes. That's right. \\"By William Goldman.\\" I'm 99.9% sure that there was never an S. Morgenstern who wrote the original. In other words, the whole introduction is a lie. And I'm not sure if I like that. It makes me kind of uneasy that Goldman is so blatantly lying to the reader. Many people from reading it, would assume that there was an S. Morgenstern, when it was really Goldman.Most of you are probably familiar with the story from either having seen the movie or read the book, but The Princess Pride is a tale of: Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.I really like the story; it has humorous parts, and, lying aside, Goldman's asides (ha ha) can be funny. I love all of the many and varied characters, and the setting, and the plot. What more can I say? If you loved the movie, this is an excellent book, and it was just as good the second time around. One thing however, is that I really don't like how dumb Buttercup is. Even the name. Buttercup. She's an empty-headed, beautiful blonde, and being one of the only female characters, that was kind of annoying. I mean, she has some intelligence, but not much. But still. I love the story.All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a wonderful book. I have always loved the movie. The movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time. So of course, I wanted to read the book. I bought it and let it sit on my kindle for a long time because I just was afraid it wouldn't live up to the idea I had in my head about how wonderful the book should be. No Worries. The book is exactly like the movie. I realize it's reversed but in my case, this is one of the times I've seen the movie first.If you have enjoyed the movie you will love the book. But as you read the book you will realize that you have missed out on much of the back story of the characters and interesting information on the settings. You have also missed out on the engaging commentary from the author.The book is funny, touching, swashbuckling, and all things in between. There are high points and low points and times of stress and times of joy. It is without a doubt a wonderful book.Completely worth the money.Enjoy.BTW, this is not an abridgement. Other reviewers have touched on this as well. This is not an abridgement of a longer book that has more boring parts. The side comments from the author are there only to add humor and tie the joke together."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the movie and I love the book. I think I might love the book a little bit more. This is one to read again and again. The other reviews have covered the charming plot so I won't. All I will say is \\"enjoy!\\"."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Now it's one of my favorite books. If you've seen the movie you know the underlying story. Lots of times the dialogue is virtually verbatim. But, in the book, oy, so much more detail. Like who is Miracle Max? Are there other Miracle Men? Why did Max get fired? Where did Inigo grow up and how was that for him? What about Fezzig? You learn so much, and the prose is excellent. I can't say that I minded the snide commentary on publishing, either. Basically, this is just a really good book, and you oughta read it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It was nice to be able to read the original after seeing the movie so many Ike's over the years."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book. Interesting characters and subplots with such twists and turns. The only thing I didn't like were some of the prolonged scenes that could have been condensed. Other than that, this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A book about your favorite movie about your favorite book. If you're a fan of the film (and who isn't?) then this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have to admit, I only read this book because I loved the movie so much. The book is just as wonderful as the movie, but with more to it! It was funny and adventurous and epic! In addition to Wesley's and Buttercup's story, I was also drawn to the author's notes throughout the book. At first, I just skimmed past them not really interested in them but not bothered by them either. By the end of the book, Mr. Goldman had become his own character. I cared about him and his story as well. It was like two great books in one. Love this book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The best thing I can say about this book (other than it is wonderful to read aloud on road trips) is the genius of the conceit that the book written about, by fictitious author S. Morgenstern, actually exists. I worked for a lawyer once -- top of his field, Yale Law review, etc., who read this book and was so in love with it that he went on a rather extensive and expensive search for a copy of the actual book. By S. Morgenstern. I overheard him tell this story and his subsequent embarassment when he realized he misread Goldman's novel with a certain amount of jaw dropping awe, and completely fell in love with both the author and that book even more than I had already."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have to confess that I only discovered recently that The Princess Bride was originally a book. The movie is one of my all time favourites - I love the story, the tongue in cheek style, the characters, the one liners - so when the opportunity arose to use the book in homeschool English, I jumped at the chance. I'm really glad I read the book, but not for the reasons I expected. For anyone who is interested in screenplays and/or screenplay adaptations of novels, this is a must read. It is fascinating to see the transition from book to movie - to see what was left out and what was kept in. William Goldman wrote both the book and the screenplay and personally I think the movie leaves the book for dead. I think he's taken a good book and created a brilliant movie. While on one hand the book is a frustrating read if you liked the movie, oddly enough I think the book is a must read for lovers of the movie as it gives you the backstory and small details that explain elements of the movie. How did Inigo end up in the smugglers' village? Why did the six fingered man kill Inigo's father? Why does Fezzik have a holocaust cloak? And what is the significance of the four white horses? Just don't read the book if you like Buttercup..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Amazing how wonderful this book is. I'd read it 15 years ago in my youth and wass thrilled to have had the opportunity to read it again and fall in love all over again with it. Reading it brought back fond memories and many giggles. It is a truly awesome tale and i am so excited to again have it in my collection."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"First off, the book truly was incredible. After reading some of the reviews, and seeing some of the more negative reviews, I feel the need to offer my own point of view.I understand that many of you are here because of the awesome movie released quite a number of years back. I first saw the story from the movie as well. When I first began reading the book and saw all of the &#34;interuptions,&#34; I was a bit surprised. At first, I will admit, I didn't like them at all. That was, at least, until I realized that this was all a part of the story. Being used to the movie that I have watched and loved so many times through the years, it at first seemed distracting to me. After adjusting to it and reminding myself that those breakaways were all actually apart of the story, I actually grew to love them. They are so fantastically well written that there were times where I actually found myself forgetting that they were all just as fictional as the rest of the story.As for the rest of the story we all grew to love from the move? It's all there. Not only that, but the characters are much more fleshed out in the book. The story goes into far greater detail than you'll find in the movie, which I really loved.My recommendation is that you try not to think too much about the movie while reading the book. You will absolutely get far more enjoyment by not constantly comparing the two. Despite the great number of similrities, the two works have enough differences that it can ruin this great book for you, as seen from some of the other reviews. I know it will be difficult, but trust me, it will be better for you."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I listened to the Audible version on an iphone in the car and it sounded great. I saw the movie long ago more than once, but never read the book. This is abridged (no, really, abridged from the Goldman book not the fictitious \\"Morganstern book\\"). The abridgement seems to bother people who read the book. If you never read the book, the only negative of the abridged version is that it is only 2.5 hours long, and you want more. Rob Reiner is fantastic as the narrator. It is impossible to imagine anyone better. I listened to it once and then again with my wife on a road trip. I would gladly listen again. The Audible version is clear and not muddy. Highly recommended for teens and older."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Having loved The Princess Bride movie, it was sort of obvious that I would love the original novel it based upon. Only, I didn't exactly love it. Don't get me wrong, I love the story and all of the very best parts of the movie came from the book. The problem is the book is written in such a strange way, with the author being a character in his own novel, that made the reading experience not completely enjoyable.The Princess Bride movie is a modern classic, so I'm going to assume that most people have seen it at some point in their lives. The novel is better than the movie when it comes to character background and development, as most books are. We get to know all of the characters from their childhood right up until the action. More than just Westley and Buttercup and Inigo Montoya, but Fezzik, Prince Humperdink and Count Rugen as well. Favorite scenes from the movie are directly taken from the novel. Inigo's famous line, Westley and Vizzini's poison scene as well as the final battle.The movie is a condensed version of the novel and seems to have taken the very best aspects from the book. What's left, beyond the deeper character histories, is a lot of unnecessary information in a distracting format. The author, William Goldman, if the narrator in the book. He's describing his supposed personal experiences in learning of the story as a child and now writing his own edited version of the tale. He breaks the narrative frequently to explain what he cut out and why. Most of the time claiming the excluded information was boring. This is a lot like the movie, which I imagine is supposed to portray Goldman as the child with his father relating the story. The problem is the the grandfather in the movie telling Fred Savage the story is likeable. The way Goldman portrays himself in the book isn't. Explaining that he's away on business and going to cheat on his wife, never pays much attention to his kid, etc. does not endear the reader. The fact that he wants to share this story from his childhood with his son doesn't really redeem him.The story of The Princess Bride is absolutely wonderful, but in this case, I'd have to say the movie was much better than the book. I'd actually recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book for the few that don't know the story. Missing out on the character depth is unfortunate, but you'll be able to avoid Goldman's fictional version of himself. That guy's kind of an ass."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this movie- I grew up watching it. That being said, I was both excited and a little wary to read the book.I shouldn't have been worried. I was literally laughing out loud as I read this! The book has it's own personality and offers lots of backstory and character development you miss in a film. This book is entertaining, funny, and just a little sarcastic. If you love the movie,I highly recommend reading the book. If you don't like the movie, read the book anyway. I read somewhere it's the perfect \\"modern\\" fairytale and I must say, I agree."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As awesome as the movie \\"Princess Bride\\" is, the book is even better. It's funnier, even more clever, and convinces you that there really is a language called Florinese. You won't want to put it down once you've started it!But, what I love most about this edition is that it has three priceless additions: 1) the 25th anniversary introduction; 2) the 30th anniversary introduction, and 3) the GENIUS first chapter of the sequel, \\"Buttercup's Baby\\", entitled \\"Fezzik Dies\\". (The section about Inigo's youth is brilliant and enlightening.)One of my favorite books of all time! The only bummer is that William Goldman never finished the sequel. And, if you're listening, William Goldman: I am one reader who noticed the incremental increases in the amount of time we have to wait for the rest of the sequel! Heartbreaking..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Clever! I've seen the movie several times and recently discovered it was a book as well. For those that are a fan of the movie, you must read this novel!The writing is well done; it was nice to get more information on certain characters as well, but overall the author kept the movie really, really close to the book.This novel is satire at its absolute best. The author does a great job taking all elements of the traditional fairy tale and throwing them out of the window. From the names of the characters to the settings, the author really brings storytelling to a new, fun, accessible level."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I saw the movie first on this particular tale. I liked the movie, and I do like the book, although it can be exasperating at times. There is a lot of adventure, and some romance, and some humour. It is definitely interesting.Westley is a farm boy in love. His affection is for Buttercup, a beautiful tomboy that he does everything for according to her wish. But when he leaves and is later found to be killed seeking his fortune, Buttercup's world ends. She agrees to marry Prince Humperdink and becomes the most beautiful in the land. Not all is safe though, as she is kidnapped. But then, a mysterious man in black rescues her using his brains, muscles, and sword. But all he wants is to do everything \\"as you wish.\\" Now with love filling her heart, they must find a way to defeat Prince Humperdink or true love will be lost.Buttercup is a weak character and she needs to have more of a backbone. Westley is better and of course about perfect, which is what makes the story interesting. The other characters all have their own purposes and really add to the book as well. Without them, it would be a simple tale with not much action, and that's not interesting at all.The writing is interesting. I really thought it was an abridgment at first but quickly learned. However this method of writing can defeat itself as some of the author's notes are boring and others alluded to things cut out that I would really like to have read. Alas, those things were never written so it won't happen. The story parts were good and there was a lot to read that was interesting. However, I just wish there was more story and less author notes. I also read the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby included in the book (another playful notion by the author, I don't believe it is an actual book) and thought it worthless. Honestly it just seemed like something tacked on and not that interesting anyway. I wish I hadn't have read it.It is an interesting book and it was nice to read the story that goes with the movie. I found it entertaining and think that it does make a good bed time story, for any age.The Princess BrideCopyright 1973398 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is astounding, it is written in a unique form and touches every emotion of the reader. It is funny, romantic, adventerous, whimsical, deep, sad, lighthearted and passionate. It touches every aspect of what makes a book good, wether your into adventure, romance, humor etc. or anything for that matter, this book is for you,The characters are one of kind, and you get a great sense of who they are.This isnt just your average fairytale, its one with a brillant twist.This book also conveys many indepth messages to the reader, about the concept of life, death and pain. How life isnt fair, and that if you put your heart and sole into a cause you can triumph, There is always hope.I believe the book is 10 times better then the movie, not that the movie isnt good, but the book has so much more to it then the movie does.If your looking to read a REALLY good book. Pick up &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just love this book! I grew up with the movie, and almost a year ago, I found the book, and gave it as a gift to almost all of my girls (friends). And then like three days ago, I found out it's all a lie, the whole book is fiction, including when he tells about his family and the lawsuits and the &quot;actual&quot; places of Florin and Guilder. THERE WAS NEVER AN S. MORGENSTERN!!! I still love the book though, and now I know Goldman is a genius, he is either the most convincing author I have ever read, or I am just really gullible, lol. Okay, yes, definately read the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you are looking for a fun book to read, then you&#65533;ve found it. I would definitely recommend The Princess Bride. For those people that have seen the movie, I believe they would enjoy the book even more. The book is a more detail version of the movie. Each character has their own story to tell about their childhood and how they got where they are. But best of all, the book is funny. It had me laughing through almost every single page. Not only is the story itself is funny but William Goldman&#65533;s abridged notes are fantastic. He&#65533;ll break into the story every once in a while and give you a little background of what&#65533;s happening or a story of himself.William Goldman&#65533;s notes are one of the best parts in the book, but at times they can get a little long. The beginning is his longest note. I was left wondering when he was going to get into the story itself. But by the end you appreciate the notes that he makes. He does comments on them later in the book so it worth reading the whole thing.The story of Buttercup and Westley is so much better in the book then it is in the movie. There are many more details on what Buttercup was like as a child and how Westley came to be working for Buttercups parents. The reader gets to see how the relationship starts to grow over the years and new obstacles that Buttercup must over come, like her jealously of the Countess and her desire for Westley. We also get to see a more realistic couple. In the novel Buttercup and Westley get into little spats every once in a while, which I thought just made them a more believable couple.The novel also gets more into the supporting characters Inigo, Fezzik, Vizzini, and more. You get to read about Inigo&#65533;s quest to become the best swords man to avenge his father&#65533;s [life], and Fezzik&#65533;s career before he became a kidnapper with Vizzini. And Vizzini himself is much more diabolical in the novel then he is in the movie.Overall, the novel is fantastic. I enjoyed ever page of it and I would recommend it to anyone that asked. Its fun and clever and to date, my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The princess Brideby William GoldmanThe princess Bride is one of my favorite books, the torture, the pane, the stupidity, the love.

Buttercup is in love with the farm boy, but when he goes to America, Buttercup is heart broken. The gore that is fallow shall be known to the reader, And the reader only. This book is a grate you should read it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Someone once said that perfection is balance. Someone else once said that to write a book that is easy to read is darn hard. They're both right, and this book it the proof. What is this book? Is it an action/adventure story? A fairy tale? Is it a spoof of adventure books? A romance? An epic? A commentary on human nature and pop culture? All of this and more.William Goldman manages to write the perfect book. It's fun and easy to read, and the descriptions and pacing are natural and flowing. Everything is easy to picture. The characters are memorable and the action sequences are flawlessly executed. But probably what sends this book out of the statosphere is its heart, the emotion you feel in all of the characters.I once asked a friend what his favorite book was, and he said &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. I then confronted him with the fact that it was the only book he had ever read. Therein lies the magic. This is a book for people who don't read books. But it is also a book for people who love books.I never thought the movie could be better. Then I read the book. I have read many books since, but I still haven't recovered. Good books you love the first time, great books improve ever time you read them. This is a great book. But you knew that already."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"i had to read this book for my literacy class at school. the teacher read us the first 3 or 4 pages to see if the class would like it or not. i loved it instantly. i usually dislike reading and it takes me ages to read one book, but for the princess bride, i just had to keep on reading! im really glad that i had the chance to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book was fabulous!

It was great!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, in 1978. I loved sci-fi/fantasy, classic swashbucklers (I read all of Dumas, some in french, and some of which is really awful), fairy tales and puns. Well, this combines them all, pokes fun at them all, and has witty, wonderful dialogue. I laughed until I cried. It is both a fantastic spoof and a classic in the genre it spoofs. I appreciate that it is wonderfully well-written, doesn't take itself too seriously, but lets you have serious insights if you are in the mood. Read it, read it again, share it with adults and children in your life. Oh yeah, then watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read this book a couple years back, after seeing the movie, and it has absolutely everything that the movie has- or should I say that the movie has everything the book has? Well anyways, I suppose they are practically the same seeing that William Goldman took part in the making of the film also. The dialogue...characters...they are exactly the same in my opinion weather were talking about the film or the book. But anyways, this is tremendously creative and enjoyable read for a wide variety of ages either read alone or out loud! Oh, and for those who have read the book and know what I'm talking about- I actually did send a letter requesting the &quot;reunion scene&quot; and &quot;Del Rey Books&quot; did send something back. It wasn't the reunion scene but It's worth asking for just to see what William Goldman says in the letter. So, my final word of advice: If you've read the book-see the movie,or If you've seen the movie-read the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you've only seen the movie then you having really experience these Florinese masterpiece as edited by William Goldman. I saw the movie many years ago and finally decided to pick up the book. I was amazed how closely the movie followed the book in terms of dialogue and story line - very little was cut in the movie. Nonetheless, a movie can't capture everything. Goldman inserts a lot of his personal comments about editing the booking into italicized sections righ in the middle of the text. While annoying at first, I soon gained a better understanding of the work as a whole. Pole! (That's for the Fezik lovers out there.) This is a great book for adults to lose themselve in one weekend and it is better book for parents to share with their children. Don't just see the movie.I read the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby that is included with this reprint. I can't wait for Goldman to finish and release it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The actual book is good, but I think the abridgement leaves out too much.

I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But, being the idiot that I am, I didn't look at the authors name. So I started reading it and found this guys biography. Well fine, I thought, just a little authors note, so I just skipped past it. I read on. Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original. I knew these notes were more then authors note, it is this guys personal biography written into the story! I think it absolutely ruins the story. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is such a great story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you love the movie, don't bother reading the book. While I did like that it adds more of a plot to the movie, it is so painful to read that I've actually tried to finish it about six times and have never succeeded. First off, the author uses italics and parentheses in every other sentence, which gets to be really annoying after the first few pages. And not only that but they don't actually give any important information. For instance the author will write about Buttercup styling her hair and he'll write something like 'then Buttercup looked in the mirror (this was after mirrors were invented) and let her hair dry (this was before hair dryers were invented).' It does that through the entire book, no matter what the situation!!!!Then the clincher, which is when I usually stop reading, is when Westley slaps Buttercup! If you remember in the movie he almost slaps her and then he says how it was a warning...well in the book he actually does it. How very unromantic. I love the movie and hate the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read many good reviews for this book, so naturally, I had to see for myself how good it was. Well, I was disappointed. This book is definitely for very very very young kids. In fact, it may even bore some of the fantasy loving kids out there in the world. I liked the character of Westley, but I didn't really liked any of the other characters all that much. Overall, big big disappointment."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have not yet read the book but I have seen the movie which was pretty good I am giving four stars to the movie and the book was made after the film so im guessing that they are alikeu rock amazon"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Goldman is getting credit and money for Morgenstern's great epic, when all he did was cut out of it.

You'd have to go to a used or even antique book store to get a copy. Not even most libraries carry an original copy."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Given all the rave reviews, I feel the need to register a dissenting opinion. I found this book mean-spirited, misogynist, and tiresome. Not funny. Searingly dull in parts.This is the only case I can think of in which I read a book, then saw the movie based on it, and liked the movie better. The movie is cute and funny. (Actually, I'm surprised that I ever went to see the movie, given that I loathed the book so deeply.)Anyway, if you don't like this book, you don't need to feel like a freak: you're not alone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long, boring, rambling, collection of his comments about the Princess Bride story. Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter. He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me. I would never have bought this book if I had known this edition was about William Goldman and The Princess Bride is treated as a side story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride.... I use to love watching this movie as a little girl and still do now that I'm an adult. I believe that Westley began my dreams of my knight in shining armor--or rather my man in black in this case. His love affair with Buttercup (what a stupid name btw) was the foundation that set the standards in my mind. So, I sat down to read it with a smile on my face and skip in my heart. It started out with page after page of some man droning on about his life (Goldman, I guess). After it boring me to the point of leaving the book on my chair while I found something more useful to do with my time, I eventually came back to it and skipped until he finally got to the story. It started off unlike the movie, with ramblings about everything under the sun that happened the year Buttercup was born and then throughout her teenage years. I would like to point out that these ramblings had absolutely nothing to do with Buttercup or the story in general. It was crap about Duchesses and other various beautiful women... blah, blah. I heaved an enormous sigh when we finally got to the \\"as you wish\\" section (I SO love that). It didn't go quite the same either. So then there was more blah, blah about various crap then comes the part that made my heart dropped down to my feet. Buttercup realizes she loves Westley so she runs to his little hovel and confesses her love and what does he do Princess-Bride-Fans?? Take her in his arms and profess his undying love in the most romantic scene known to man? NO!! Without a word, he slams the door in her face and later comes to her and tells her he's leaving so he can make a life for them..... uh, huh, yeah seriously!Then, comes his death and then Humperdink and thank God the whole scene with the Sicilian, the Turk, and the Spaniard was pretty much the same. But the worst has yet to come. When Westley finally takes Buttercup and kills the Sicilian.... Ugh! I don't even want to say it! He slaps Buttercup. No, doesn't just pretend like he's going to slap her like he did in the movie. He straight up slaps her in the face and then threatens to do it again. Oh and I'm not done! After she realizes it's Westley, every word that comes out of her mouth is completely ignorant, as if she were the dumbest woman on the planet and... AND.... Westley makes fun of her and insults her continually!!!! I think it's needless to say that this time I put the book down and did not pick it back up except when it was time to return it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Let me be very clear: I did not have any exposure to The Princess Bride in any of its forms until the tender age of 20. After watching the film, I wasn't convinced that it was &quot;like, the best movie ever!&quot;, and found myself oddly cold toward it. I assumed that it was the kind of thing you had to see when you were really young, and that that ship had sailed for me. Then I started reading all these reviews about how the book was much better than the movie, and after catching the film once more, I thought I had been a bit too swift in my dismissal.I'm sad to report that the book isn't much better than the movie, because let's be honest here, it is essentially the entire film with perhaps a few extra goodies thrown in. Essentially, you can read the book, or watch the movie, but there's no real need to do both. If you love the film, then you'll love this. If you don't love the movie, well, then this isn't the book for you either. I don't think this will be converting anyone except for perhaps the very young for whom much of this stuff will be very cool.I do agree with the reviewer that mentioned that Goldman's interjections did disrupt the flow of the story at times, and while this is in keeping with the movie, it grates. Also, the ending is abrupt and not all that good. I didn't mind the introduction stuff however, because it was lighthearted and speaks greatly of the author's love for the story (and really adds a lot of texture and dimension to the ensuing tale)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I found and read &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; when I was a teenager (many, many years before the film version came out). I immediately fell in love with it and considered it to be my secret treasure, because no one else seemed to know about it. Years later, I loved the movie too; I consider it to be a brilliant *adaptation* of the novel. Readers like Pooky should understand that Goldman's original novel was always meant as a satire. His comments and abridgements are part and parcel of the structure of the story. S. Morgenstern's &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; does not exist outside of Goldman's pen."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If Goldman had helped Morgenstern while he was writing the original Princess Bride; if he had abridged it like he did in this version then surely The Princess Bride would rank with fairy-tale classics such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.However this is more of a spoof fairy-tale as Morgenstern mocks those childhood favourites by killing off favourite characters and allowing the beautiful Princess to marry the evil Prince. It is this originality and surprise value that makes Princess Bride such an impressive and easy read. We are helped by Goldman's notes which are genuinely helpful and often amusing though he does sometimes spoil the story by informing us of a major incident about to happen.Morgenstern had a gift for narrative and the reason he is not remembered as fondly as he should in the writing world is because he overshadowed his narrative skill with unnecessary and selfish nonsense like his wife's notes or political rubbish.I've read the 25th Anniversary edition in which Goldman abridges the first chapter of Buttercup's baby. Unfortunately Goldman is under pressure to deliver a spotless version this time and he leaves in a lot of unnecessary mumbo-jumbo. Just leave in the narrative Mr. Goldman and quickly bring out the sequel because I am itching to find out what happens to Fezzik in the next story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Wonderfully writen. The book is best the movie is right in behind. Goldman's style of abrigement is uncomparable! But, (I'm not sure if I'm the only one) I want to read the unabridged copy too. If anyone knows where I can find one e-mail: UnaCeleste@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I own both the book and the movie. Everytime I read this action pack, moving, true romance story I have to watch the movie. William Goldman did an exceptional job in abridging it. I was able to acquire the 25th anniversary addition and was able to read the first chapter to the sequel. Just the thought of have someone other then William Goldman (like Stephen King who has no business doing fairy tales and should stick to the scary stuff) truely provokes a sense of disappointment. Because William Goldman has such a strong emotional tie to the story, there is no better choice then him. If you have every read the story you would know what I'm talking about and if you have not, well let me just say, you are missing out on one of the best stories that have ever been written."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Okay, I don't have any great insights into why you should read this. All I know is that it's my favorite book of all-time. The story's just so layered and interesting that I can read it, then read it again right after without any yawning taking place. William Goldman has the greatest style."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A cute and funny parody, something you would definitely buy for your kids, but not really the classic most reviews claim it to be!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"the book was very good, the only problem with it was every time that William Goldman interupted and was babaling about his life and giving comentary it got boring when i was reading the intro...30 pages. you may think that he was talking trash about his son and wife, but then again he could be lying and making things up because he was lying about S. Morgenstern."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I know many people will terrorize our neighborhoods for saying this, but it wasn't the number one book we have ever read. Sure it was okay but it was predictable and shallow. The characters weren't endearing. So we could care less about them.This book is a mockery of romance, adventure and drama. But if you like parodies you have our blessing dive right in. Don't waste your money, borrow it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just purchased the Kindle edition of the book. Unfortunately, it is in Amazon's execrable \\"Topaz\\" format, which means that it essentially looks like an ugly, pixellated scan of a paperback. No antialiasing, no font smoothing, and terribly, hideously ugly.In other words, avoid the Kindle Edition of this book as if it had head lice, and the head lice were themselves infested with fleas that carried the bubonic plague and which, after giving you the plague, jumped into your food and pooped on it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Summary: This is supposedly an abridgement of a classic Florentine tale by S. Morgenstern, but I'm not sure whether that's true or just a device to make the story more interesting. The main tale (within the tale of the abridgement) has been made into a popular movie. It involves a romance between Westley, a poor farm boy who lives as a servant on the estate of the parents of Buttercup, the most beautiful woman in the world. When he leaves to make his fortune, she is chosen as a bride by the odious Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three thieves; Domingo Montoya, the master swordsman, Fezzik the gentle giant, and the Sicilian genius (*can't remember his name). Westley pursues them to kidnap her back, but is then captured in turn by Prince Humperdinck, who wants to finalize the wedding. The climax involves Fezzik and Domingo teaming up with Westley to save Buttercup from the prince.The Good and The Bad: Very, very little to criticize here. Some of the frame story leaves us with a less favorable image of the author; to find that he is divorced and employed \\"tough love\\" on his son's too-ample girth is not the image of joviality we're hoping for. But the story within is, basically, flawless. The tongue-in-cheek humor is employed whenever the story starts to take itself too seriously. The fight scenes are compelling and graphic, and the characters merit a lot of emotional investment."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book. Amazingly funny and just an absolute great read. I haven't loved a book this much since a very long time. I picked it up one day at the library, imagining that it wouldn't be half as funny as the movie. Let me say that I was hooked after the first page and absolutely nothing could deter me from finishing this book! It's one of the sweetest book I've ever read. This is the way a book should make you feel.The only \\"bad part\\" to the book is that it had an ending!!! I'm quite upset about this."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is great. Really, there are no other words. Wonderful, amazing, orgasmic, whatever - when you lay down the facts, it's good. Buttercup, our favorite bimbo heroine is oh-so funny in her stupidity. Dashing Westley makes a loveable hero. The other characters, Inigo, Fezzik, Vizzini, Humperdinck, are so hilarious that they will have you falling off your chair. The only thing keeping you from dropping this book during your laughing spasms is your desire to keep reading. It's has everything you want in a good novel and everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I actually read this book after seeing the movie, and I felt a little guilty for not reading it, so I signed it out. I was amazed. The only bad part is (and here I consult the paperback book) twenty nine pages about his love for the book. I think W.Goldman may have been an utter nutcase, but his good-parts-version is helpful because Morgenstern has the tendency to babble on. In these places, the extracted part is explained, so you don't miss anything. PS. If Florin is a real country, please tell me in a review. He makes it sound so real!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a great book, and I would recommend it to anyone. For all those who have read it, do you think there even is an &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot;? Or maybe it's just Goldman being humble..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love the movie... the book puts it to shame. I read this book yearly! This and &quot;The River Why&quot; by David James Duncan. Read this."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am a 24 year old teacher, I have an English degree and still I have yet to read a book that thrills me as much as the Princess Bride. What a tale!Westley is the greatest hero, Buttercup the beautifullest princess, Fezzik the strongest and Humperdink the meanest. All of the elements that make for a truly great novel are contained here.It made me start reading and as a teacher I have used it to get even the most ardent non-reader hooked on adventure stories- all I can say is thankyou Morgenstern for adding to my life!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"It has everything--who wouldn't love it?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my favorite book ever. I love fantasy books to begin with, even though most of my friends don't. However, I have made it my personal mission to make people read this book and all those who've i made read LOVE IT! The satire, the romance, everything is in perfect balance! read it!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Believe it or not - I just saw the movie for the first time a few weeks ago. I immediately ordered the book and was very pleased. The book goes into a lot more character development than the movie had time to do. I also liked the added pages at the end that extend the story.Overall the book is very good - I may have rated it higher - but I think some of the book was ruined having seen the movie."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read it when I was 14 and I am still hooked on it! It has everything a book needs! Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, true love, miracles, who could live without it? To all of those people who do not appreciate this book, you don't have the right type of brain cells, or lack of brain cells to truely appreciate this wonderful witty work of art. I feel that William Goldman should be known for this accomplishment when he dies, not just for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Everyone should read this and hopefully everyone will love it as much as I did! &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Usually when I read the book a movie is based on, I like the book better. Occasionally, I'll prefer the movie, but never before have I so loved a movie and so hated the book! The REALLY \\"good parts\\" made it into the movieThe Princess Bride; what was left out ranged from unnecessary padding to total dreck!From the stomach-churningly creepy, seemingly never-ending frame story to the charming finale: \\"Fezzik Dies\\" (a nice \\"feel good\\" moment to end upon), I was literally stunned by how awful this book was. The excruciatingly overlong back stories on Inigo and Fezzik, the continual insults regarding Buttercup's intelligence or lack thereof (and especially those uttered by Westley), the lack of anything resembling an \\"ending\\", and the at first interesting, then annoying, and finally infuriating editorial asides that take up so much space and lose most of their charm (and point) once you \\"get\\" the joke that there is no S. Morgenstern, had me struggling to finish it, hoping against hope that Goldman would pull it out in the end. He didn't. His attempts at satire ultimately fail because he's mostly wielding a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel.Amazingly Goldman also wrote the marvelous screenplay for the much better movieThe Princess Bride, and with few exceptions it's all in here, just buried under a mountain of crud. To Goldman's credit he manages to extract just about every ounce of precious metal to be had from this mound of slag, but one can only hope that at some point his ego will allow this garbage to go out of print to be replaced by a MUCH shorter version based on his vastly superior screenplay."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is entirely different than what i watched the movie yet honestly i read this book and i didnt like it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just want to say that I ordered this book a week ago and Amazon said that it wasnt going to be able to ship until 3 days ago and not arrive until next friday a week from now... they really underestimated USPS because I got the book today and it is exactly what I thought I was getting. Hurray for super save shiping :). I read this book when I was younger and now I cant wait to read it again especially now that I almost have the movie memorized from watching it so much.If you havent read this book or seen the movie you should definitely do both and you will enjoy every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Although i have seen the move \\"THE PRINCESS BRIDE\\" over and over again, i still have enjoyed it each time. It is a movie to be enjoyed by all ages, and how ever old you are, this film will make you cry, laugh and sigh all in 89 minutes! lolThe fencing, revenge, true love, escapes and the feats of bravery in this film are incredibly \\"inconcievable. &lt;--- if you have seen the film, you will understand what i'm talking about!Although i havnt been able to get my hands on the novel of 'THE PRINCESS BRIDE' it is on the top of my list of priorities! I well and truly recommend this film to anyone who has a passion for love, intrigue and fire swamps!THE END."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Everything in the actual Morgenstern edition is quality prose; Goldman did a good job on picking and choosing what to put in and his inserts are amusing. I did find it annoying when he continually refers to his ex-wife and his son-negatively. I think, if you can find it-you would be better off getting the S. Morgenstern edition and skimming the boring parts yourself."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"People, people,people GET REAL. Ther is no Florin It's just a story. This never happened ok?! Just enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I did enjoy this book. Very much. It is funny and charming and well written (whoever did write it!). However, I only gave it four stars because of the &quot;abridgers comments&quot; which I found very irritating, often giving away the next plot twist, and distracting you from the book just when you were getting caught up in it. Do read the book: just skip the commentary."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Best book ever!!! read it, no plot flaws, high adventure, puts even the well-loved movie 2 shame!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I find it just hilarious how many people actually beleived all this stuff about Morgentstern."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The first time I read this book, I loved it, fullstop. The second time I read it, I was pretty angry about being tricked, but it was still awesome. Reading it all these years later as an adult, I noticed how sexist, racist, and lazy this book is. Don't get me wrong- enough of it is still entertaining that I didn't try to set my copy on fire, but it's not nearly as good as I remember it being."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is the book that my favorite movie was based on, so I decided to read it. Even though I knew the movie by heart, this book still made me laugh. There's so much that was left out of the movie that is great to read. And if you haven't seen the movie, the book is a great fun adventure that ponders the greatest mysteries in life, while making you crack up."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'll admit, I read the book because the The Princess Bride is my favorite movie in the world...and the nice thing about William Goldman writing the screenplay is that most of the hilarious dialogue is the same. The asides by Goldman are very funny (especially the one about taxes being older than stew) but you have to read it lightheartedly so they don't get annoying. And keep in mind that S. Morgenstern never existed--it took me way too long to figure that out. But it really is an incredible book, and it's nice to get a bit more background about the movie. It helps make the characters feel even more like old friends."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read the other reviews and what no one seems to have commented on is the main theme of revenge - from Buttercup's parents' insults to Mad Max creating humiliations galore for Prince Humperdink, and everything in between. The dread pirate Robert's ship and of course, Inigo. Everyone seems to want it at one point in time or another, a payback and yet there is always the theme that life isn't fair, and that anyone telling you different is selling something. Anyone wishing for more information on The Princess Bride should check out the screenplay - I read it in a book of 4 or 5 screenplays of William Goldman's - including Misery, and Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. It explains how and why he wrote The Princess Bride the way he did. Also, I've heard that there will be a twenty-fifth anniversary edition coming out this December - hard cover. Have fun storming the Castle!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is one of my favorite movies so I decided to read the book. Even knowing the plot, this was one of my favorite books in years.Here is what you get if you already saw the movie: Goldman's short story about abridging the S. Morgenstern classic, more history on Inigo and Fezzik, a different scene when Inigo and Fezzik attempt to reach Wesley in the Pit of Despair (the Zoo in the book), and more on Buttercup falling in love with Wesley.It was all well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I own two copies of this book, one of them to keep, and one to lend out. I should probably demand some sort of kickback from Mr. Goldman, I've converted so many friends and relatives into Princess Bride fans. This book is unimaginably enjoyable, it's witty, magical, touching, and did I mention witty? A testament to the cleverness of the book is the amazing number of people who have reviewed it here that still believe S.Morgenstern's original exists. I think that explains any less than gushing reviews. They missed out on much of the delightful tongue-in-cheek humor that characterizes William Goldman. In my opinion, the italicized 'editor's notes' are a delicious addition to a timeless and truly entertaining tale. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Fasinating to find a fantasy book so well done and close to reality. Really worth the time. Glad it was edited."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Sure, I'm the type who loves all sorts of books, and yeah,I cry in a lot of them. But usually when I read them a second time.... I just don't. Not with this book! I have read it about 10 times (yes, it's that good!) and I still end up in tears everytime! Read it and find out yourself!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is perfect (or at least as perfect as anything can be in a non-perfect world). My dad used to read it to me when I was a toddler, and then again every couple of years after that. The endless &quot;satirical&quot; digressions are great, and I have yet to find a funnier phrase in the English language than &quot;morning yogurt break.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Mr Goldman wrote an absolutly divine tale when he shared with us the tale of Buttercup and Wesley's true love [&amp; mammoth misunderstandings,titanic troubles and beastly betrayals]. If one loves the extremes of good and evil and the triumph of niceness over badness [well sort of] and the gratuitous use of parenthesis then this book was written for you. Adjectives that apply are many; humourous, exciting, suspenseful, witty, compelling, witty, fun, engaging, accessable, witty and just terribly good. This is such a jolly good book I belive that anyone who has a chance should read it, talk about it, quote freely from it, read it again and then bore people by insisting that this book is sooooo good that they simply must read it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first heard of this novel when I saw the video at the age of 12. I didn't actually read the book, though, until I taught it to my high school English class last year. I found the synopsis of the book on the back cover to be misleading if you didn't know about the book before reading it. It would make you think that the book contains rough language and sexual content when it doesn't. This story of high adventure has just enough romance and sadness to interest any reader. The subtle comedy is carried throughout the novel and keeps you laughing all the way through. Many of my students said it was the first novel they read all the way through. It definitely is a favorite of mine, and I enjoy re-reading it every year. This book overwhelmingly deserves all five stars!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this book with my heart and soul! It has everything-true love, swordplay, and, of course, a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first encoutered this story, as a movie, when I was about 7 years old. Ever since then, I have grown up with it being my all-time favorite movie. I found this book 2 years ago and adore it just as much. I have just reread it for the third time. The story line is a wonderful satire of a fairy tale yet it is consistantly magical."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A classic tale that has something for everyone"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my favorate book. I really love it. the adventure put me on the edge of my seat, and the love parts practically melted me ( of course it helps that the main male character has my boyfriends name) ;)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"that S. Morgenstern never existed. William Goldman wrote the Princess Bride entirely on his own, and made up the part about S. Morgenstern. This is made most obvious when you realize that the florin and the guilder are outdated forms of Italian currency. In my opinion, though, this adds to the value of the story. I recommend The Princess Bride to all the true romantics out there."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first saw the movie at my freinds house when I was eight and immediately fell in love with the story! now i'm 11 and I ordered the book and it was soooooooooooooooooooo good!!

I fell in love with it immediately. Although it often refers to its book, I never thought to look for it until recently.It is a wonderful book in its own right, I love the side comments made by William Goldman. Reading the book greatly enhances the movie by explaining the relationships behind the dialogue. It was amazing that exact quotes were present in both.The ending disappointed me a little, but I enjoyed it all the way through. Go buy it, go read it, it's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read this book for my English class. it was really good. And it is very interesting.

The book is way better, but the movie is incredibly awesome too. My copy of the book is only about a year old, and is already falling apart. I've read it at LEAST 10 times, and own the movie.

You decide."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book has everything! A book to read again and again.I love this book above all else (except maybe cough drops)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If I try to think in components as to what makes the princess bride such an unforgettable book, I would fail miserably.. the concept, the style, the plot, the character...I really dont know. It is a book that simply put, comes together beautifully. What makes the book amazing is the fact that you realise that it is so unreal only when you try to describe to someone who hasn't read it,(and fail miserably in the attempt). A review on the book therefore seems presumptuous, but a reaction to the Princess bride is simply.... well, actually, it's not simple at all.... and that is what will keep it on my bedside for a long long time."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The best book I have ever read. Don't take it all seriously if you read it, 'cause he's making up the part about S. Morgenstern, so don't be stupid like many of the people who reviewed this book and say that Goldman butchered a book, because the original was never there. &quot;Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. passion. Miracles.&quot; And much much more."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I haven't read this book since before the movie came out, I loaned it to a dear friend and have not seen Suzy since! I was very disappointed with the movie the first time I saw it,because it could never be as good as the book. It was not romantic as the book, oh how the speech Wesley makes before going to America still leaves me breathless. It was not nearly has dashing and exciting as the book was, and American moviegoers still are not ready for the real asides in the book, how Mr. Goldman refers to his whole family is too painful to be funny anywhere but on the page, but when I read it I was wiping tears from my eyes, laughing out loud.Over the years, having not been able to refresh my memory of the book I have grown to appreciate the movie, and have enjoyed sharing it with my son (who loves it). But I was thrilled to hear that now i can read to him the whole story!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I first saw the movie and thought it was great. When I saw that it was based on a book I when right out and bought the book. The book was even better. My favorite part is when it firsts describes the man in black. It's just great."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you thought that the movie was funny, try reading the actual book. Although many movies stray from the book they're based on, the movie stayed almost true to the book, but had to leave out some of the good parts (like the Zoo of Death) probably due to time. So read it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman has written a timeless masterpiece, which no doubt I will read to my grandchildren. It will also be fun to try to convince them of the existence of Florin and the supposed author Morgenstern. The book is far far better than the movie, and Goldman's asides throughout are delightful. This is the first book which I have actually enjoyed reading the preface and introduction, and all of the asides. I truly hope that Goldman decides to finish the work &quot;Buttercup's Baby&quot;, the beginning of which he presents here in the anniversary edition. My only complaint is that I did not read this book as a child, even though I did greatly enjoy it as an adult."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I really loved this book. It was humorous, romantic, dangerous, and fun. I found Goldman's notes to be a hilarious addition, and I'm glad I read the abridged version, though I will eventually read the original. It's one of those rare books that you just can't put down and just sit curled up until your finished. It's a must read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Dear Mr. Goldman,I think I love you. Your book makes me want to be rescued. I'm surprised so many people liked the movie more than the book. I loved the movie, but I LOVED this book even more! this is such a great read, just thinking about it makes me want to read it again.Who should read this? EVERYONE!!!!!!!! That means you, too.As you wish,LM"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've loved this book since I was 16 years old--it changed how I viewed books then, and for all the years afterward. I think now, 30 plus years later, I have spent my life trying to find it again in all the other books I've read. Hasn't happened yet. It's laugh-out-loud funny, quirky, absurd, romantic, exciting, brilliant, heroic...just a wonderful spoof of a book. Whenever I am feeling down, I can pull it out and re-read the Zoo of Death scenes (with Fezzik and Inigo descending) and it never fails to brighten my mood and bring a smile. It's familiar and warm, and how many books can do that for a person? I only wish there had been a real sequel to it...but, perhaps perfection should stand alone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love this book. It is very complete but very easy to read. It is very true to the movie but with extended dialogue and more information about certain scenes. I love it!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman, an American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter, was born in 1931. He has won Oscars for his screen plays and Edgar Awards for his novels. He wrote \\"The Princess Bride\\" in 1973, successfully adapting it for the big screen in 1987.Although Buttercup is clearly destined to become the most beautiful woman in the world, she couldn't care less about her appearance. Born and raised on a farm in Florin, all she's interested in is riding her horse - imaginatively named \\"Horse\\" - and abusing the farm boy. The farm boy is called Westly - though Buttercup tends to ignore the fact that he has a name of his own. Yet Westley is devoted to her and, the second a serious rival turns up, Buttercup realises she loves him too. Unfortunately, when she tells Westley of her love for him, he fells honour bound to go and seek his fortune - in order to provide for their married life together. Unfortunately, he's captured by the Dread Pirate Roberts - the most terrifying pirate in all the world, who never leaves survivors.Although it took a while for Buttercup to realise how beautiful she was - the local boys had been pestering her incessantly, which led to the local girls refusing to speak to her - her fame spread far and wide. Before long, the rich and the influential were stopping by for a glimpse...and, in time, Prince Humperdinck himself turned up. Every good story needs a villain, and Humperdinck is it : his one great love is hunting, and he has gathered together an impressive Zoo of Death to keep himself battle-hardened. Unfortunately for the Prince, he'll soon be taking over as King - his father is on his last legs - and this means he'll have to take a bride. After a single glimpse, Buttercup is who he settles on. She agrees to the marraige, as she believes Westley to be dead...though she makes it quite clear that she'll never love Humperdinck. He, in fairness, doesn't give a rat's arse : apparently, he only wants a male heir. But things aren't going to be simple : Buttercup is kidnapped by a muderous Sicilian, a Spanish swordmaster and a Turkish giant. Luckily, there's a mysterious man in black in pursuit.However, there's a little more to the book that a straightforward story - and it starts with an introduction of how Goldman came to write it. He claims his own father was Florinese, and had actually read him \\"The Princess Bride\\" - written by one \\"S. Morgenstern\\" - when he was ten. However, when he re-read the book as an adult, it turns out his father had only ever read him \\"the good bits\\" - and so, he decided to abridge the book himself. (He chips in, throughout the book, with the occasional footnote and aside). None of it's true, of course - there was no Morgenstern, and the Princess Bride is entirely his own creation. However, the ruse adds a great deal of humour. He even includes the beginnings to a proposed sequel..unfortunately, thanks to (totally fictitious) legal difficulties with the (non-existant) Morgenstern estate, he isn't allowed to abridge the whole story.A very enjoyable, easily read book : one with its tongue firmly planted in its cheek."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a female friend of mine and she simply love this book.

Great book to appeal to all types of audiences, has action, adeventure, romance, comedy and importantly with their new found popularity these days, pirates! You will not regret a purchase of the book or the film!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I suppose that The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure by William Goldman isn't strictly a fairy tale but it has an outwardly, vague similarity to that genre: a handsome prince ostensibly falls in love with a peasant who is the most beautiful girl in the world... and they live happily ever after right? Wrong.The prince is, to quote the book \\"a son of a bitch.\\" The peasant girl is in love with a peasant boy/pirate. You have a kind-hearted Turkish giant who loves to rhyme, the smartest man ever, and the finest swordsman who had ever lived. Not to mention the fire swamp and its R.O.U.S.Everything about The Princess Bride is genius. First the framework of being a tale, within a tale, within a tale. The central story is that of Westley and Buttercup. But Goldman inserts himself or a fictional version of himself as a kid who had been read this \\"classic\\" story by his immigrant Florinese father, as written by the great Florinese writer, S. Morgenstern. That fond memory, he writes, is what prompted him to buy the book for his own son. He realizes that his father had made S. Morgenstern's story better by leaving out the long, drawn out sections. To rescue S. Morgenstern's classic, Goldman decided to make his own \\"good parts\\" version, just the way his father told it to him.The book alternates between Goldman's \\"personal\\" narrative and that of Westley and Buttercup. He inserts parenthetical digressions like pseudo-historical footnotes and how his editor was going crazy editing his draft because of all his parentheticals. There's even a long parenthetical where he says that Morgenstern purposely did not write the reunion scene between Westley and Buttercup (after the fall down the ravine and before the Fire Swamp) and how he, Goldman, wrote his own, but due to legal issues, he is not allowed to put it in the book. So to appease those who want the reunion scene, he gives an address where one can write and get it sent to them.Of course, it is all made up. There is no S. Morgenstern. There has never been a Guilder or Florin. Goldman was never read this story as a kid. He doesn't even have a son. And how much do you want to bet that there are thousands of unread pleas for the nonexistent reunion scene? (Psst. But I hear you can e-mail the publisher here and get it sent to you speedily.)But all that made up back story, with Goldman's humorous and wiseacre voice to tell it, is actually what makes The Princess Bride refreshing and original. I don't think I've ever read another book that has been written this way. It's rather daring to call one's book a \\"classic\\" before it's become one. Or maybe Goldman knew what he had written.Because if you've grown up with it, as I have, whether with the movie or the book or both, it has become as familiar as Cinderella or Rapunzel. To imitate Goldman, I will digress with a little story of my own:I share a large office with a wall made out of a glass next to a balcony which is sometimes visited by sparrows and squirrels from the neighboring trees. One morning, I glance up from my computer and see a rat-like animal the size of a dog, with whiskers and a long tail slowly ambling by on the balcony. My startled shriek brings in the boss, who happened to be nearby, and another co-worker. \\"What is it???\\" my boss asks. I point to the balcony, \\"It's a Rodent of Unusual Size!\\" He looks confused. \\"You know, from Princess Bride.\\" (Like, duh, boss.) When his face remains blank, I describe to him what I saw. \\"Oh,\\" he says, confusion cleared. \\"You saw a possum. You must be a city girl,\\" he chuckles as he walks away. I feebly protest being called a \\"city girl\\" with its connotation of, I don't know, being a complete idiot, but flabbergasted that he didn't get my reference. I tell my friend later, who is the same age as I am, that I thought had seen a R.O.U.S. She is appropriatedly horrified for me and, more importantly, she knew exactly what I was talking about.I was initially ecstatic when I found that in the 25th anniversary edition of The Princess Bride, Goldman included an \\"excerpt\\" from the forthcoming, \\"long-lost\\" sequel called \\"Buttercup's Baby.\\" Upon reading it, where as promised in the ending of The Princess Bride, all the surviving characters become old and inevitably decrepit with age, no longer the most beautiful, the strongest, the finest, and Buttercup's baby falls into danger and other unsatisfactory outcomes, I realize that Goldman had done it again. To answer what must have been a great demand for a continuation of the original, he wrote the rather bleak \\"excerpt\\" from a sequel that never will be ---- and never should be, for sequels tend to disappoint.Is Goldman laughing at his readers? Is the fictional back story, the tease of the pretend sequel all a big joke? I don't think so. I think it's to make us aware of the power of fairy tales and our need to believe in them despite the intrusion of a reality that contradicts them. The best fairy tales contain truths so powerful that they become real - and so whatever the intent, The Princess Bride, as Goldman declared it from the beginning, a beloved classic, a \\"hot fairy tale.\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you've seen the movie, don't think that this means that you don't need to read the book! There's quite a few differences, and the narrative style of the book includes the author's own comments (which were not included in the writing of the movie)While the story contains various elements of a fairy tale, it is made unique by said author's comments which intersperse the text for a bit of humor and comedy relief, as well as passages of information that were not included in the film.

Others have specualated (and I believe) that he is the author of this book and S. Morgenstern is a fictitious nome de plume. Even the abridged comments made by Goldman mirror Fred Savage's interruptions of his character's grandfather.Which is not to say that this book is word-for-word a mirror of the movie. Both Indigo and Fezzik have chapters devoted to them. If you've seen the movie, your mind puts them in place. There's a chapter about Humperdink and another about Buttercup. Details which are so quickly passively presented in film are described in the necessary detail of the written word. Doubtless, the written version adds dimension to our characters and what trials have led them to where we see them in the film.So like I say, read the book, out loud, with someone special under a tree or by the firelight.

There's the fact that the \\"good parts\\" is all a joke (if you don't know the truth, go searching; it's very fun/ny), and the funniness of the book itself... Really, this book is just brilliant.There are great, dramatic, and funny characters, all of whom have their happy moments, and their sad, dramatic times. The storyline itself is about a girl who gets chosen to be princess. She is meanwhile mourning for her love, who died at sea. Then she gets kidnapped, and everything really starts there, with hilarities and lots of interesting adventures. Every once in a while, Goldman will cut in with his \\"notes\\" on various bits of nonesense, sticking in lots of very weird stories that leave you thinking, \\"Oh... kay?\\", and ultimately result in a very short and abrupt giggling fit.This book is totally worth reading. It's fun, exciting, and does have some excellent sword fights.

Sometimes it's hard to read a book after seeing the movie since you already know the outcome but it didn't matter with The Princess Bride.The book in no way diminishes the movie or vice versa. The book fills out and enriches the story for the movie-viewer. It provides additional detail, background, backstory.

Then, when you get a chance, take an afternoon to read the book and ponder why the book included the \\"Zoo of Death\\" rather than the \\"Pit of Despair\\" and how Humperdink the wimp from the movie was so much more amusing than Humperdink the gorilla from the book.Then why, you ask, does it get three whole stars? Because it basically is the same story, it includes the same plot, the same ideas, the same wit . . . but watch the movie first. The movie is the classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Years ago, I was asked one of those silly questions that readers ask each other: &#8220;If you could be any literary character, who would you be?&#8221; Without hesitation, I replied, &#8220;Princess Buttercup.&#8221; After all, what woman in her right mind wouldn&#8217;t crave a life of true love and high adventure?I have no recollection of when I first read William Goldman&#8217;s beloved novel, but I can tell you that in the decades since, I&#8217;ve read the book and seen the film at least a dozen times. It is very high on my list of all-time favorites. I never grow tired of it. I can pick this book up and start reading on any page and get sucked in immediately. And as soon as I&#8217;ve finished it, I could easily start reading from page one all over again. It is a case of true love.Now, you have to have been living under a rock for the past few decades not to have an idea of what this tale is about. It&#8217;s the story of the beautiful milkmaid Buttercup and her love for the dashing farm boy Westley and all they go through in order to be together. Additionally, the novel uses the author&#8217;s life as a framing device. In what is purported to be a series of forwards and abridger&#8217;s notes, Goldman reflects on his personal history with &#8220;S. Morgenstern&#8217;s Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure.&#8221; He speaks candidly (and entirely fictitiously) of his family life, and perhaps somewhat less fictitiously of his professional life. And he tells the story of how his father first read him the tale when he was ten years old. When he asked if there were any sports in the book, the man replied:&#8220;Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautiful ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.&#8221;I ask you, what more could a reader possibly want?The one thing Goldman forgot to list is humor. What has made this tale such a classic, in addition to the fact that it contains one of the five greatest kisses of all time, is the novel&#8217;s adroit humor. It ranges from sophisticated to glib to farcical, and it never fails to make me smile. Because of the brilliant film adaptation (also written by Goldman), many of the novel&#8217;s lines and passages have become cultural touchstones. Have you ever cried, &#8220;Inconceivable!&#8221; in a Wally Shawn lisp? Mandy Patinkin doesn&#8217;t go a day without someone coming up to him and proclaiming, &#8220;My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!&#8221; Does the phrase &#8220;As you wish.&#8221; just give you chills? These characters are indelible, and Mr. Goldman&#8217;s humor has held up for 40 years. I believe people still be chuckling over this novel a hundred years from now. Shakespeare, Jane Austen, P.G. Wodehouse&#8212;some humor is simply timeless.Clearly, I love a feel-good story, but most suffer from diminishing returns. Maybe it was awesome the first time you read it, pretty good the second, and less so on successive reads. Not so, The Princess Bride. If anything, I think my considerable affection for this novel grows with each successive reading. And I&#8217;m still spotting new things! On this read, for the first time, I spotted the fake blurbs at the front of the Kindle edition. (One was from &#8220;Shog Bongiorno, professor emeritus, Mid-European Literature, Columbia University,&#8221; LOL.)Twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversary editions of The Princess Bride have contained new forwards that continue the story that Goldman uses as the novel&#8217;s framing device. And after the novel&#8217;s end, there is a lengthy introduction to a substantial sample of the novel&#8217;s fictitious sequel, Buttercup&#8217;s Baby. I&#8217;ve read it all except for Buttercup&#8217;s Baby. I can only read that for the first time once, and I&#8217;m just not ready to experience it yet. Besides, maybe one day Mr. Goldman will elbow out Stephen King for the job and will finish the abridgement of the sequel. Hope springs eternal. And isn&#8217;t that the nature of true love?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I could not get into this book but I have watched the movie on DVD at least 20 times.

I particularly like the way that the narrative is interrupted by the author for his outside the story story, and it makes for interesting reading all by itself. this is one of the few books where reading the authors notes at the begining, before the story starts even, is an improtant read and an enjoyable part of the entire ensamble. I find that I can read this book from cover to cover, just the interrupted narrative, or just the narrative, and it is fascinating in each of these ways. The story of a lowly farm boy who finds true love, only to lose her to the evil prince...well I can't tell more without a spoiler alert.

Well words like wonderful, superb, and outstanding only just begin to scratch the surface on describing how magical this book really is.Printed in 1973, Goldman's classic novel is supposedly an abridged version of The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. But good luck finding the original unabridged version. Wink, wink.Sadly I've had this book sitting on my shelf for well over ten years and have never once read it. Until now that is. With a bit of urging from author Sarwat Chadda, I finally decided to unearth my copy from its dusty nook and give it a read. And I'm glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Course, having the movie version playing out in my head as I read my favorite scenes helped.Honestly this book is brilliant. The characters are memorable, the humor is rich and laugh worthy, and despite the fact that I found the author interruptions to be jarring at times (and by the way, the author himself says you can skip these if necessary) I really enjoyed reading the book. Actually, I'm rather ashamed that it took me so long to finally read it. Especially having grown up with the movie version, which I will review momentarily.Yes, reading this book brought everything that I loved about the movie back to me, but with extended scenes and added events.What ever happened to Fezzik and Inigo after The Man in Black defeated them? What made Prince Humperdinck choose Buttercup to be his bride? What is the point of the rhyming game between Inigo and Fezzik, beyond humor that is? Why exactly was Miracle Max fired?All these questions were answered as I read. Plus I had an extra scene with my two favorite characters, Inigo and Fezzik, as they journeyed through The Zoo of Death, which in the movie is called The Pit of Despair. I don't know why this scene never made it into the movie version, but I found it interesting.In the end, I fear that as much as I enjoyed it, I can only give it four paws. If I had to be honest with myself, of which I am, most of my enjoyment came from my previous knowledge of the movie. I found myself anticipating when I was going to be reading my favorite scenes, or envisioning the characters as I know them from the movie, voice and all. Plus I really found the author interruptions annoying. I think that should I ever decide to read the book again, I will skip these moments.So if you are trying to decide which to do first, I would suggest reading the book before seeing the movie. This way you can envision the characters in your own way and then be surprised at just how perfect a job the movie does in depicting the characters."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Do you want your heart to be awed?

Inigo Montoya is the best swordsman in the world. His father was killed by one of Prince Humperdink's men, Count Rugen, and Inigo has been on his own personal vendetta ever since. Fezzik is a giant man, but is very caring. Fezzik used to be a champion fighter in his country and loves to rhyme. Count Rugen is Prince Humperdink's partner in crime. He has six fingers and loves torture and spends most of his time studying it.Here is a scene from the book. This is when Inigo and the Man in Black are fencing with each other.[Fencing]Inigo Montoya: You are wonderful!Man in Black: Thank you; I've worked hard to become so.Inigo Montoya: I admit it, you are better than I am.Man in Black: Then why are you smiling?Inigo Montoya: Because I know something you don't know.Man in Black: And what is that?Inigo Montoya: I... am not left-handed![Moves his sword to his right hand and gains an advantage]Man in Black: You are amazing!Inigo Montoya: I ought to be, after 20 years.Man in Black: Oh, there's something I ought to tell you.Inigo Montoya: Tell me.Man in Black: I'm not left-handed either.[Moves his sword to his right hand and regains his advantage]This is a very famous quote from the book:Inigo Montoya: Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.One more quote from the book shows some of the humor:Inigo Montoya: That Vizzini, he can *fuss*.Fezzik: Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream at *us*.Inigo Montoya: Probably he means no *harm*.Fezzik: He's really very short on *charm*.Inigo Montoya: You have a great gift for rhyme.Fezzik: Yes, yes, some of the time.Vizzini: Enough of that!Inigo Montoya: Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?Fezzik: If there are, we all be dead!Vizzini: No more rhymes now, I mean it!Fezzik: Anybody want a peanut?Vizzini: DYEEAAHHHHHH!!After I saw the fantastic movie The Princess Bride, I sought to find if the movie was based off the book. My search was a success! I found the book. The book was written by William Goldman. I quickly read the book and was in love with it. It is better than the movie, but the movie is very well adapted and there are few changes from book to movie.I would recommend this book for young adults and up. I would give this book four stars.This book will dazzle you with its humor and suspense. The characters in a book are what make a book good and in The Princess Bride; the characters are some of the best parts."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved the movie (1987) so when I saw the book in my favourite used bookstore, I thought I'd pick it up to see how it compared. For that person who doesn't know &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, the plot centres around the kidnapping of the most beautiful woman in the world by her fianc&eacute; so he can start a war with the neighbouring country. That kind of makes it sound like an intriguing drama but it's actually a romantic comedy. So, now you know.I was very surprised at how well the movie followed the book. I suppose that is the result of Goldman's history as a screen writer (&quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;). Of course, he also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. The book, however, has much more of the S. Morgenstern background story. According to Goldman, the book was actually a history of the country of Gilder written by S. Morgenstern read to him as a child by his father.This is a great book for young readers as well as older, cynical readers. The humour is both obvious and subtle at times. The wit is variously sarcastic, satirical and ascerbic. The S. Morgenstern device is creative and adds an another dimension to the story that makes a good book better, as well as sucks the younger reader into Goldman's constructed reality."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Like most other people, I was familiar with the movie The Princess Bride before I came to the book. The main question I had was, \\"Will it still interest me, even though I know the movie by heart?\\" The answer is an overwhelming YES! Yes, it is very much like the movie, but there is so much more; there's all the backstory; the funny asides; the bits about the abridgement. This is a book to make you laugh out loud.There are some things that may turn readers off. Before the story proper starts, William Goldman includes a long preface (two, for the anniversary edition), plus a preface for the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby at the end. These get a little long. Also, Goldman is callous when describing his son's weight problem, and his ex-wife. I felt that way until I found out that the real William Goldman doesn't have a son. For those of you interested, look him up on Wikipedia. Also, if anyone out there wants to travel to Florin for the summer, or talk to Professor Bongiorno of Columbia about S. Morgenstern's abilities as a writer, you are going to be in for a disappointment.Early on, Goldman professes his love of adventure novels. He has succeeded in creating a great one. It's inconceivable."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my all time favorite book. I fell in love with it at the age of ten and have read it more times over the past twelve years than I can even count. The movie is beautifully crafted, that I won't deny, but there is SO much more to the book. Back stories like you wouldn't believe on Buttercup, Wesley, Fezzik and Inigo. Even more if you pick up copy which contains the first chapter to Buttercup's Baby, the sequel Goldman promises within the next five years. For anyone who loves these characters and can't get enough of them on screen, the book is your next logical stop.While it is true that the book isn't always you typical sugar-coated, one-dimensional fairy tale, its still just as fun and far more thrilling than the movie. Goldman doesn't shy away from portraying his character's flaws, which makes the whole story all the more endearing. Read thoroughly though. Anyone who walks away with the impression that all the characters are timid or that Wesley is portrayed as the village idiot clearly has taken every word at face value and ignored the rich satire, OR simply stopped reading after the first two or three chapters.I found Golman's interruptions, glimpsing into his \\"real life\\" (which is as fabricated as Morgenstern himself), wonderfully fitting to the text as examples of how a story is never just a story. Some reach deep into our lives and effect them in ways we would never expect."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My 8th grade summer reading list, I knew, wasn't very exciting. There were some really boring books on there! I chose carefully which books sounded O.K. or good, and I read the ones that I chose. The Princess Bride by William Goldman was amazing. Even though it is over 300 pages, I read that book in one day. I just couldn't put it down! All the twists and turns were so unexpected and exciting. It is a story about true love-- finding it, wanting it, losing it... all the characters are so colorful. You just can't resist reading on. I really recommend this from ages 10 and older. Adults, I'm sure you will love this book too. If you get the 25th Anniversary edition, you can ever read the first chapter of its long-lost sequel, Buttercup's Baby. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A great book. All in all, a great story. Tells of love, commitment, risks, pain, deception, everything!!! If you read the &quot;good parts&quot; abridged version, by William Bell, you can read the first chapter of the long-lost sequel, Buttercup's Baby. It's a truly amazing book. Even GUYS'll like it!!!! :P"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I personally don't see how anyone can possibly dislike this book. It's charming and funny, and a lot more. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes fairy tales and adventures. (Though a lot of events in this book are completely ..impossible, but that's where a lot of the humor comes from.)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I recommend this book to every young woman I know with the advice that it's about the perfect man. My boyfriend (now husband) heard me say that and read it too. But it's not a &quot;romance&quot; novel. Instead, it's a comic adventure novel / fairy tale. I'm going to read the &quot;good parts&quot; to my 7-year old son. The movie's good, the book's better. I love the &quot;story within a story within a story&quot; structure, the wit, and the oh-so-quotable dialog."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"How did I get here? Right...I was reviewing the Princess Bride. Well, anyway, I read this a while ago and thought it deserved much more recognition than it already has. With a mixture of sarcasm, satire, romance, action, and humor, The Princess Bride brings its readers a feeling of content with every word, as if the book were not JUST a book, but a book, cup of hot chocolate (or coffee, depending on your preference), complete with marshmellows and whipped cream. (Cream and sugar for coffee fans.) In short...read it and like it and recommend it. You'll love it. I guarentee it. (Oh great, now I'm sounding like that person who does the Men's Wearhouse commercials!)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Do you like romance? Do you like action? Do you like adventure? If you like all three of those then The Princess Bride is the perfect book for you. My teacher read it to us and we all loved it. If you don't like any of those categories still read this book. This book is about Westly......the handsome, heroic, and brave man who is deeply in love.....Buttercup.....the most beautiful girl in world who is kidnapped......Prince Humperdinck.....the evil ruler of Florin who is upsessed with war, torture, pain, suffering, murder, and Buttercup.......Count Rugen......the Prince's sidekick and the king of torture, agony, and pain.........Vizzini.......the brains of the operation......Fezzik....the giant Turk who is very strong.........and Inigo.........the wonderful swordsman who lives to revenge his father's death. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"One of the greatest books i have ever read. It si truly amazing. There is so many aspects to it that make it what it is. How there is love, action, death, pain, captures, and escapes. William Goldman does a great job putting all of these ascpets into this book with out making it too complex or confusing. The moive is one of the best ever made, but it fail is comparison to this masterpiece of a book. I highly recommend this book, if not more then anyting I have ever read. Read it, you will be truly spellbound"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is not a book for reading in public (i.e. the bus, train etc.) unless you don't mind people looking at you when you involuntarily burst into laughter and, trust me, you will. I first read this in 1976 and have returned to it over the years, it never fails to make me laugh and even the film is sufficiently sympathetic so as not to intrude and spoil the images. In fact Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya positively enhances it. Whatever your age, read this."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"William Goldman spins a good yarn! I loved the way he wrapped the story with the narration of how it came into being...from his father reading it to him to having his own son try to read it. AHA! His father had been abridging it the whole time!The story had elements that were different from the movie (which I've seen dozens of times), but the storyline itself was still the same. I enjoyed the more detailed backstory on Inigo and Fezzik and would have liked to see the same treatment for Vizzini...but I guess Morgenstern decided not to include it :) It's full of swordfights and suspense that keeps you turning pages. I could not put it down...finished it in a couple of days. I just had to see what happened next even though I pretty much knew from the movie. That shows just how well it's written.This isn't one of those deep, epic fantasies that occur so often today (Jordan, Goodkind, Martin). It is, instead, rather lighthearted (most of the time anyway). This makes it unique and a wonderful read. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I saw the movie version of this at a young enough age so that when I came upon the book, I did not remember most of the plot. I am quite glad of this, because it didn't limit my perceptions as much by forcing them into the reality of the movie. (I am not saying that the movie is bad.. FAR FROM IT! Just that I'd suggest reading the book first, THEN seeing the movie..) The little interludes between sections were my favorite parts of the story, and I simply loved the extra background on Fezzik and Inigo. All in all, I would count this book as one of the great works of our time. Perhaps it won't be counted up there by academia, who unfortunately decides which books get taught in most english classes (Dickens? Blech! ) but it is a book that I think will always take up a little corner of our mind... And every so often we will encounter something in life that makes us think: Oh! that's sorta like that bit from The Princess Bride... I love this book =)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is story-telling at its best. With giants, evil spiders, true love and whatever one could wish for. As almost everyone else, I saw the movie before reading the book and was suprised at how closely the movie followed the film - until I noticed that William Goldman wrote the script for the movie to.For those that saw the movie I recommend the book, it is a must! The same characters, but more fleshed out with more background and feelings. The poor, rhyming giant Fezzik is one of the best characters ever created, although Inigo is my favorite. In my issue, from Bloomsbury Publishing, 1999, there was also a chapter of the followup &quot;Buttercup's Baby&quot; that ends with a literal cliffhanger. I hope it will be published soon."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've seen the movie so many times I lost count. I can almost act out the whole thing. So when my cousin let me borrow the paperback copy of the book (which she first read in her novels class), I gladly took it and read it. I loved so much that when I saw the 25th anniversary edition, I bought it (even before I had finished the reading the one she gave me). Goldman does an excellant job of making you believe that S. Morgenstern is a real person, Florin and Guilder are real places, and that there is an unabridged version. I just wish he would finish &quot;Buttercup's Baby.&quot; I can't wait to see what happens in it! I loved this book so much that I am buying copies to give to friends and family. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The story itself is a good one. Everything in the movie and more. It actually explained a thing or two that the movie was unclear on.The \\"literary device\\" of the fictional S. Morgenstern, and the fictional missing chapter, and the fictional tale of the author detracted from the story, for me. Luckily he put all that \\"stuff\\" in italics and it was fairly easy to skip around. However, you had to bypass 50-60 pages at the beginning just to get to the story. Then there is more scattered throughout the chapter. The ending \\"after the ending\\" had a lot more to wade through. Easily 100 pages were wasted on me.I hope others enjoy the \\"literary device\\".Regardless, the story itself is very worth reading."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The book gives you everything that the movie, The Princess Bride, did (other than the excellent soundtrack): high adventure, great characters, classic conflict, and oh-so-memorable and quotable dialog. But it goes even further, with added layers telling not only the story of the sick little boy being read (parts of) the book, but an amusing and convuluted tale of how Goldman came to write \\"the good parts version\\" of the original, lengthy novel by the fictitious S. Morgenstern and what Mrs. Morgenstern had to say while the book was being written. Be sure to send in a letter for the \\"missing\\" reunion scene (you'll see. . .). Believe it or not, decades after original publication, the publisher will still send it out (at its cost). It's a great joke on the reader and the publisher. Inconceivable!!! Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"To sum up, I totally agree with the reviewers below who say loud and clear:THERE IS NO S. MORGENSTERN!I just thought that I would say it again as many of you doubtlessly lack mouse scroll wheels that make seeing multiple reviews easy.Back to ranting. I checked the Library of congress, William Goldman is the only listed author. To repeat, there is no other version, this IS the unabridged version. This one is all there is. Anyone who wants to (or claims to have) read the unabridged version should forget it. No more ranting about Goldman gutting Morgenstern's prose or some other psycho chatter.I mean, if Morgenstern really existed, do you imagine his heirs would put up with the slashing and heckling that Goldman allegedly does to the man's &quot;masterpiece&quot;? Not in out society, that;s for sure.By the way, this is my favorite book too. Anyone who says otherwise obviously didn't get the whole joke behind the book. Reread it and try again, this time remembering, THERE IS NO S. MORGENSTERN!Read it.PS, all those who claim to have read the origional, please present such origional text to a publisher for reprint so the rest of us can enjoy 70 pages of dress descriptions.

I was a huge fan of the movie for years, before I came across the novel, and now my favorite film is far and away my favorite book as well.(Unfortunately, I gave my blue copy to a guy that turned out to be a real jerk...but that's a different story all together...)This fairy-tale is the perfect blend of romance, farce, adventure, fantasy, humor and character development. Indescribably wondermous.I beg you in the name of all sacred books, *PLEASE* get yourself a copy of this book! Read it to yourself, read it to your significant other, read it to your children, read it to shut-ins, read it to strangers on the street! It doesn't matter...just read it! Share the joy that *is* the Princess Bride. Share the joy of Westley and Buttercup and Inigo and Fezzik and Vizzini and Prince Humperdink and Count Rugen and the Fire Swamp and Miracle Max and Valerie and the white horses and the Pit of Despair...This is what people mean when they talk about wonderful stories. And after all, what girl isn't looking for her Farm Boy to simply answer &quot;As you wish.&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A witty and elegant subversion of the fantasy genre.**********It astonishes me that some of the reviewers below never figured out that the book of which this one purports to be an abridgment /doesn't exist./ There never was an S Morgenstern, nor were there kingdoms of Florin and Guilder (the names of medieval coins, not countries.)/The Princess Bride/ is a novel about the relationship between a sick boy and his grandfather. The grandfather emigrated to America as an adult. During the boy's confinement, the grandfather reads him their fictitious ancestral country's national novel, cutting and reworking as he goes to transform it into a straightforward adventure story the boy will enjoy. The problem of teaching a child born in America to identify with his national heritage is a difficult one; after all, people from the old country smell funny, eat weird things, talk with accents, and don't know anything about baseball. I imagine that Goldman himself comes from an immigrant family. In that light, this book is in part his response as an adult to his memories growing up, and it is warm and engaging.But Goldman manages not to let this turn into treacle by combining it with an adventure story so good that they made a movie out of it. The scenes with Fred Savage in the movie are not extraneous, they're vital to the book's unique quality: naive self-consciousness. It's a book that's basically about someone reading a book (take that, postmodernism,) but it uses the metatextual conceit to add to the story by giving it a deeper social significance rather than to detract from it by making it the object of games with meaning. We accept both the realistic world of a boy coming to terms with his family and heritage, and the fantastic world of ROUSes, Holocaust Cloaks, and Humperdinck's life-suctioning machine.You can read this book simply for the adventure story, which is what many people appear to have done, but in my opinion, there's a better novel written around the adventure story than in it. Whichever you prefer, I suppose."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have been reading this book since 1979. I have given this book as a gift more times than any other book. This edition is differen from the editions I have read/purchased in the past. It has additional material beforend after the original text. I was so impressed that I will be ordering a copy for myself!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it, I saw the movie in the theater many years ago."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I grew up watching The Princess Bride. It has always been one of my favorite movies. For awhile now, I have been wanting to read the book to see how it compared. Finally, I purchased the book and am currently about halfway through. So far, I have not been disappointed.The movie follows the book very closely, so while reading I am able to envision some of my favorite scenes. With that said, there is enough of a difference that reading the book is not a waste of time. The book spends much more time describing the characters' backgrounds, making the already interesting characters more three dimensional.The writer's style is interesting as well; William Goldman has added a layer of fiction by pretending that the story was originally by an \\"S. Morgenstern\\" and that Goldman is merely providing an abridged version of the original story. There is an introduction in which Goldman recounts the tale of how he was read the story as a child. Goldman's voice appears throughout the story to comment on the story, similar to how the grandfather in the movie steps in a couple of times to explain something.Best of all, the same sense of humor that is in the movie is present in the book. All in all if you are a fan of the movie you will most likely enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A good book to read to kids of a certain age, not too alarming as far as today's standards go."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I would have given the story a 4 or even 5 star rating but didn't like the ramblings of Mr Goldman throughout the book. Very distracting and unnecessary. I finally figured out I could just skip them without losing any of the context of the story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"There is really no better way to describe this book. It's amazing and appealing to every group. Exceptionally well written that an adult doesn't feel silly for reading it, it isn't a tale that would go over the head of a youngster reading it. Moments of hilarity proceed death defying duels. The fair damsel in distress finds her backbone and chooses the quality of love over the quantity of coffers. And a simple giant's heart is revealed to surpass the strength of his arm."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I am a HUGE Princess Bride fan - I mean HUGE. I have read the book several times and can't even tell you how many millions of times I've watched the movie. When I saw the book was available for kindle I just had to have it. The introduction to this edition is hysterical and insightful. I love Goldman's background to his research and experience with the movie crew. It just brings so much more nostalgia to the experience of PB. I would highly recommend this read - even if you've read it before. It's the perfect escape from reality :) Action, adventure, love, mystery, suspense. What's not to adore about this book? Go read it.

Rent the movie and sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As a fan of the movie, I figured the book must be even better. I was right! It's amazing. The dialog, humor, and overall wit of the author blows me away. Worth reading more than once!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As a die-hard fan of the movie, I wanted to read the book. The book is good, but the writing style trips over itself at times and can get a little annoying. For instance, the &#34;in-joke&#34; about the edits to Morgenstern's original version (which doesn't exist) starts to get old pretty fast.Also, there wasn't quite enough new stuff in the book to fully justify my reading it. I'm glad I did, but the movie is definitely paced better and has some of the more boring stuff cut out."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"...it's as funny as the rest.Before the movie came out, thisbook was quite hard to get.

But this is still a book you'll want to share with everyone you know."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just found out that this book was not abridged.

My lit teacher told us that we would read it next year. When we finished the movie I couldnt wait to read the book which was incredibly funny and witty but i can understand why they left the humperdinck/ wind/ hat blowing away part. That was hilarious! I totally recommend this book to young and old people"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is a great book to read if you are bored, because you won't be able to stop reading it. It moves at a fast pace, through scenes of high adventure, true love, and swashbuckling men in masks and capes. It has unusual characters of all sorts, from the eccentric Miracle Max to the evil Count.This is the abridged edition, meaning that the 26 pages where a woman packs her hats has been omitted, as well as the 13 more pages of unpacking after the trip. William Goldman has added his own prologue, which is well worth the read, and small italicized paragraphs throughout the book, telling what he cut, etc....The abridged version is probably a better read than the full version, although if you read the abridged version, you will probably want to read the full version. But reading the full version without knowing the story can be tedious, due to all the boring descriptions and history. But if you, like I, have read the abridged version, and like it so much that you would want to read the full version, you would have an easier time and a more enjoyable one."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you were one of the many to read &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and believe that William Goldman was dastardly in his heavy &quot;editing&quot; of the book, READ IT AGAIN! You'll love the book all that much more upon rereading with the realization that the &quot;editorials&quot; are all part of the story. Probably the niftiest (and hardest) thing to pull off about the novel was in Goldman writing HIMself into the story! Magical! Also, get yourself a copy of both &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;The Color of Light&quot; (and anything else you can get your paws on!) -- the same shining William Goldman wit, panache, flair, humor and eletrifying skill at manipulating the reader (roar with laughter for 5 pages [and irk everyone around you as you are forced to read lines out loud!], and suddenly weep your eyes out for the next 2 pages, and then 2 pages later climb onto a rollercoaster and scream around all the white-knuckler loop-de-loops!!) (and the incredible thing is, ! I'm not exaggerating!). If you've never read William Goldman, oh you lucky dawg! Love your movies, Mr. Goldman, but come on, get back to your genius (even if it IS hard work), your first love, and remember, the reader will always appreciate your soul more than the moviegoer (even us odd freaks that love both!)..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A nice, happy, funny, romantic book that is completely good-intentional and totally enjoyable. A very relaxing and involving book that makes you feel good. But after reading all of these reviews---AARRRGGGHHH! Am I psychic or is everyone else just dopey? I knew from the very beginning that Morganstern was fake as well as Florin and Guilder and that William Goldman had written the whole story himself. Is it really that hard to figure out? I don't understand how confused everyone is and how shocked they are to realize Morganstern is fake. I knew all a long I guess. But a good book anyway. Goldman is a gracious and decent writer."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you were on an island in the middle of nowhere with only this book for company, you would laugh the last of your withering body's moisture through your tear ducts without regrets."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I made the huge mistake of watching the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; over and over before I read this book. Since I read the book about a week ago, I cannot stop raving about it! Both Morgenstern and Goldman write with such a personal touch that I feel like I know them. It seemed as though they knew what would make me laugh and cry and what would make my heart ache for the characters. Morgenstern has a way of involving you in his characters' lives. I had never heard the whole story of the importance of the six-fingered sword until I read the book. I never knew the importance of Westley crying after being tortured until I read the book. I never knew how Fezzik ended up unemployed in Greenland until I read the book. The description of how Snow Sand suffocates makes Buttercup's mishap all the more exciting. Westley's attempt to save her with a rope that is barely too short makes that &quot;breathtaking&quot; adventure all the more exciting. The touch of humor by both authors, the interjections on Morgenstern's part about what his wife thinks of the book, and many other personal touches make the story and its author(s) seem all the more real to me. Anyone who has the opportunity and the means should get a copy of this book and read it today."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"As most of the people who've read this book say, Princess Bride is delightfully entertaining, using every possible angle - from horror to romance to action adventure - to tickle your fancy. Anyone who is daring enough to pick up this 500 page classic will find it was over all to quickly; every bit of it's funny, interesting, and plot-twisted crazily.William Goldman, who wrote the script for the equally wild movie, does a great job here, and if the rest of the reviews haven't convinced you, here's another recomendation. Literally every type of fantasy lover can find something for them here; if you like it, you can't get enough of it. The only complaint you might have could be about the hefty explainations - sometimes, Mr. Goldman takes his time with character histories and little interuptions in the text. I didn't mind them though; a light reader might. Enjoy! It certainly is a classic."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This probably sounds a little corny, but the Princess Bride is my most favorite book. 500 pages of exitement, mystery, romance-anything you would ever want in a novel, I couldn't put it down. Just imagine yourself as one of the characters and you can go down to the most bottom level of the animal cages in Prince Humperdink's castle or through the firey swamp as Westley and Buttercup escape once again. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages who are willing to go on a wild adventure"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is my favorite young adult book. It's a grand adventure and it's full of sarcasm and wit. I admit the female lead isn't quite as strong as I'd like her to be, but still, this is a fun, light hearted, book. It's a good book to read when you want to relax and unwind after finishing a political or religious book. The Princess Bride is worth reading over and over once every summer."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I usually find that if I read the book first, I like that better, but if I saw the movie first, I like that better. Well, with this one I saw the movie first, and liked it -- why else would I read the book? -- but I like the book better anyway. There's a lot of jokes in the movie that just work better in writing, or jokes that are in the book and had to be left out of the movie.The book is totally funny. Both parts, the story of the princess bride and the &quot;annotations,&quot; had me laughing out loud. And where if this were supposed to be a serious novel, the kind of hurried backstories given to many of the characters might be a little alienating, here they're perfect, because they do convey the feeling of having been condensed out of something much longer. This book is just a pleasure to read throughout."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you loved the movie, you will probably enjoy the book as well. I have owned the movie for a couple of years now and really can't explain why I hesitated for so long in getting the book since it has even more details on all the main characters like Fezzik,Inigo, Westley and Buttercup. William Goldman delivers a great Fairy Tale with a great lesson in reality and Fairness. His tone is harder and sterner than in the movie. He really wants the point of \\"Life isn,t fair\\" to stick in your head. The satirical humor is also one of the great elements of the story, as well as the heroic struggle of True Love. All in all, I would recommend this to any fantasy afficionado as well as anyone who enjoys humor and adventure. I only gave it four stars because I think Mr. Goldman perhaps spends too much time trying to convince us of the \\"Reality\\" of the land of Florin, as well its most famous author, S. Morgernstern (FYI he made him up as well as Florin). I felt it defeats the purpose of making a wonderful Fairy Tale, to then go and spend so much \\"book space\\" on things not related to the story ( most of it is his struggle to get the movie made and his battle with \\"Hollywood Executives\\"). He also spends too much time talking about his wife (and his lack of love for her) and son (whom he seems disappointed with), and his life in general(he does this in many little side narrations throughout the book). However, If you have always wanted to have a Fairy Tale book to read to your children when they have a cold, or just feeling a little scared, not to mention have something with which you can bond with your child and hopefully pass on as a Legacy, the Princes Bride is just such a book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"O.K., so S. Morgenstern is not real, and the story at the beginning of the book about Goldman's life is a sort of lie. Or is it? I'm not suggesting that Florin and Guilder are real countries-they are named after coins of different denominations, but it could in part be true. It's part of the fairy tale, when to separate the fact from the fiction. S. Morgenstern could be in essense Goldman's father, and though the story did not come from a book, it could have been passed down by mouth through the generations, only to be rejected by Goldman's son. If, of course, he indeed has a son. The fairy tale is still there, don't discount it just because of the absence of a true Simon Morgenstern. One of the things that makes it such a great fairy tale is the believeablity of the story. The prince is evil, the pirate is good. The kidnappers didn't want to kill anyone, it was their ringleader. And the princess isn't even really a princess at all. Am I reaching here? Maybe, but this is the last true fairy tale. Don't get too caught up in facts. And don't try to figure out why Goldman decided to write it this way instead of just coming out and saying it's not a true story. It is a true story. It happened some time after Paris was discovered, but before America. And, it is the greatest thing since cough drops."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've grown up watching the movie over and over- guess it's because it is my favorite. I never even knew there was a book that it was based on until just recently. My best friend said I had to read it and I'm so glad that I did. Honestly, I like the book over the movie! There are many parts different but all in all I liked the book version better. Not really a fantasy fan, this book has much more than an average fairy tale. That's another reason why I liked it so much...because it obtained everything....adventure, romance, fighting, and it just down right had me rolling! Seriously, I laughed out loud many times and that's saying alot...I thought the book was funnier than the movie actually. Morgenstern, if that's a real man, was brilliant and if not him than Goldman was. And for all the excerpts that Goldman kept putting in, I read some reviews saying that they didn't like them. I admit they did get in the way of the story a few times, but I found them humourous and insightful. Everyone has to read this book...it truly is a must. And this is coming from someone who doesn't read alot more than magazines and the newspaper!!!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"metafiction SYLLABICATION: metafiction PRONUNCIATION: mt -fk shn NOUN : Fiction that deals, often playfully and self-referentially, with the writing of fiction or its conventions. -DEFINITION : &quot;metafiction&quot; (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.)If you look for the one trend that most sharply defines modern literature it would probably be the use of metafictional techniques, those which seek to keep the reader constantly aware of the existence of the author and of the fictional nature of the tale. Of course, what's bizarre about this is that the novel, from its very beginnings in Cervantes' Don Quijote--in Part II of which, Cervantes refers to people having read Part I--has often utilized these techniques; when you get right down to it, there's really nothing modern about at least this one aspect of modernism.However, the use of these techniques, even if they are nothing new, has certainly become much more pervasive over the past century. Nowhere is this more evident than in children's entertainment. In everything from the old &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; on the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show to the televisions in the bellies of the Teletubbies, the culture assumes that even kids are prepared for self referrential irony and are alert to the wholly fictitious nature of the stories they are being told.This trend received perhaps its ultimate expression in William Goldman's very funny novel, The Princess Bride, and the fine movie based on it. Think of how many layers removed from &quot;reality&quot; you are by the time you get to the film, which is after all based on a book by William Goldman which ostensibly abridges a classic tale by S. Morgenstern, which Goldman's father used to read him; the abridgment having been made necessary by Goldman's discovery that his father significantly abridged Morgenstern's story himself, so as to make it more enjoyable for the boy. Suppose for just a moment that some genuine occurrences inspired some &quot;original&quot; story, by this time we're awfully distant from them, aren't we ? There can't be many folks who actually need further authorial tricks and devices to clue them in to the fact that we're in the realm of fiction.But here at last we stumble on the key ingredient that makes The Princess Bride such a success : Goldman isn't so much trying to alert the reader (viewer) that the story is fiction, instead he's trying to convince us that it's real, or at least that there is an S. Morgenstern and an original version. He wants us to appreciate, even to love, Morgenstern and his Princess Bride in the same way that he did as a boy, at least fictionally or at least books like this one that the real William Goldman recalls from his real childhood. And this is the little-understood secret to any effective parody/satire/what-have-you : before the irreverence begins, you have to approach the source material with reverence. It's just not very funny to make fun of something that no one takes seriously in the first place (which perhaps explains why comedy is so completely the province of conservatism and why liberals have no sense of humor--taking everything seriously but reverencing nothing, they find no amusement in irreverence). Princess Bride is so funny precisely because Goldman has been so careful to follow the conventions of the fairy tale and because he's obviously thought them through so thoroughly. Thus, for all the fun he has at the expense of the genre, in the end the good guys win, the bad guys are dead or vanquished, true love has been vindicated, and we all fondly recall having our father or grandfather read to us.Thankfully, there is now a hardcover version of The Princess Bride--for a long time you could only find the paperback movie tie-in--and you can get a copy to read to your kids and your grandkids. There's some kind of cosmic irony in a send-up of classic children's literature becoming a classic itself, an irony which probably galls the modernist apostles of irony--which is all the more reason to enjoy the story, which, even without this additional inducement, is an awful lot of fun.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I read most of this book in one week. I could barely put it down! I was reading it every moment of every day... until I got to the end. The description in this book was thourough, but not boring. Even the intro was interesting! I saw the movie before I read the book and was surprised at how much movie was based on the book! Almost all the diolouge was the same and all the scenery was to the letter! I think that having already seen the movie and being constantly astounded at the similarities was what kept me glued to the book.The only part of the book that I didn't like was the ending, which was like walking off a cliff. One moment you're in the middle of a sword fight and the next, the story's over!This is a really great book for any not-yet-ready-to-grow-up people, adults OR kids and I recomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I may be only 14, but I read about a book a day. I found this book to be quite interesting. It was one of the few books I enjoyed &quot;front to back, cover to cover&quot;. I've probably read it a million times. If you don't know if you want to buy this book, go check it out of the library, I'm sure after reading it you'll be convinced.(I'm looking for the unabrided copy, which is nowhere to be found, if anyone knows where to find it, please email me @ katnc24@hotmail.com. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Action packed and mind tickling. Always something you want to read out loud to a friend so they will understand why you're laughing out loud in a room by yourself!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Love reading this classic and looking forward to sharing it with my children when they get older. Although the movie and book are similar, the book lets your imagination bring the characters to life."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I fell in love with The Princess Bride when I was in my teens, after a good friend recommended the movie to me. Granted, I was a little dubious at first, given the somewhat sappy title, but my fears were quickly dispelled as I became engrossed by this quirky fairy tale. Now, about 25 years later, I finally have a copy of the book, and quickly devoured it (well, my eyes did...had I actually eaten it, I'd no doubt be suffering from indegestion right now rather than writing this review....but I digress)The tale is primarily about true love, more precisely between a commoner and the farm boy who helps out at her parents' farm. When Buttercup (the commoner) realizes that she is in love with Westley (the farm boy) and informs him of her love, he announces his intent to go seek his fortune in the world so that they can start a life together, as he also loves her deeply. Westley's ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never takes survivors, whereas Buttercup is given the \\"choice\\" to marry the Prince of the realm or be killed. I'll say no more as I fear I'll give too much of the plot away. Suffice to say, aside from true love, there's master fencing battles, giants, miracles, etc.If you have seen the movie, I strongly urge you to read the book. It will give you greater insight into the characters - I loved learning more about Inigo and Fezzik. There are also some interesting changes, such as the Zoo Of Death. So just because you've seen the movie, doesn't mean you won't gain anything by reading the book.The interesting part about the book is Goldman's insistance that this book is an abridgement of a rather lengthier story written by the brilliant Florinise author S. Morgenstern. The catch? Florin doesn't exist, and S. Morgenstern didn't either. And yet Goldman does a solid job trying to convince us that they do/did exist. He relates the tale of how his father read him the book when he was a boy, how he also hunted down a copy for his son (and later realize how dreary it was, hence his decision to \\"abridge the original\\"), and even puts in notes throughout the book alluding to the original by Morgenstern. So the joke's on us, the reader...and yet Goldman does such a convincing job, I'm guessing many will take it as the truth.Funny, fast-paced, well written and very addictive - I highly recommend this book (and the movie too)!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Ignore those people who gave this book 1 star, the charm of the book is not ruined by Goldman's dialog and I think it gives your mind a break and a chance to fully appreciate all the detail in the main story. I've read this book since I was in seventh grade and have read it completely from front to back at least once a year and watched the movie so many times I remember every quote in detail and both are amazing in there own ways. The movie is very much the \\"good stuff\\" portion of the story and the story told my Goldman gives you a lot of back story and necessary drama which makes this love story so different from he rest because it speaks the sad truths about love and betrayal. I must admit some parts do get dry in the book but even Goldman admits this himself and does his best to make it better. I suggest if you can find a copy with the added Buttercup's Baby story it's a little bit of interesting story not necessarily important to the main book but if you are a fan of the dark side of this love story you'll enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"If you haven't read this book, then all I can tell you is to go out, get it, and read it. Now. Don't bother with the rest of this review, you'll thank me later. It has:Fencing.Fighting.Torture.Poison.True Love.Hate.Revenge.Giants.Hunters.Good men.Bad men.Beautifulest ladies.Snakes.Spiders.Beasts of all natures and descriptions.Pain.Death.Brave men.Coward men.Strongest men.Chases.Escapes.Lies.Truths.Passion.Miracles.For a start.It's one of the greatest love/action/revenge stories ever abridged by a modern author. Well, it seems that Mr. Goldman felt that the original story, as written by the immortal S. Morganstern, was a little too dry for public consumption, as well as damaging to treasured childhood memories, so he went through it and put together this \\"good parts\\" version, and the world is a better place for it. [1]Of course, the big gag is that there never was an original version of the book. There never was an S. Morganstern, the greatest of the Florinese writers. Goldman's father may have read books to him as a child, but he never read this book to him. The entire thing is a fiction, beginning to end, but Goldman sells it really well. He tells the tale of how he blossomed as a boy - going from being a sports-obsessed disappointment to a ravenous bookworm, all thanks to this book. He talks about trying to give the same gift to his son, who manages to make it through one chapter before giving up in exhaustion. He talks about the great shock of discovering that his father had done something utterly brilliant - he had skipped the dull bits and left the exciting parts intact.Knowing that all of this is false certainly doesn't detract from the story. It's a story about a story, and the effect that a story can have on a young mind. Or any mind, for that matter. It's about how stories can teach us lessons that only later we understand - such as how life is not fair - and how stories can change us in ways that we never expected. It's about our relationship with fiction, and with the world around us. In his fictional childhood, Goldman learned more about the world from the process of watching the story unfold than he did from the story itself. And so this book is a story about stories. The actual story is just bonus.Which brings me, of course, to the film. Let me say that this is one of the very, very few instances where I will put the movie up on par with the book. 99.9999 repeating percent of the time, the book is better than the movie. This is one instance where they are equal in nearly every measure. I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the fact that Goldman wrote the screenplay for the film, so not only is the story intact, but a great deal of the dialogue is almost verbatim from the book. It was gold in print and gold on the screen. The hardest part about reading the book is trying not to hear Andre the Giant, Christopher Guest, Robin Wright and all the other fine actors and actresses in your head as you read.So, whether you read the book or see the movie, you're in for a treat. And as you read, just remember the books that molded you into who you are today. Think about the stories that taught you life's lessons before life got around to doing it. Think about them and appreciate them, and remember that every book is a lesson, one way or another...."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This was a great book. I absolutely loved it!!! It was so, so funny, a lot like the movie. I will never forget the moment when Westley told Buttercup that she never was too bright - something that I had definitely noticed in the movie! NOTE: When you reach the footnote about the reunion scene, DO follow the link, and DO submit your e-mail address. It's great."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I was afraid to read this book and avoided it for many years. I so dearly love the movie and I just didn't want to be disappointed either way. If the book was better, as is usually the case, then my movie experience would be tarnished. If the movie was better then I'd be wasting my time with the book.Well nevermind to all of that, because I LOVE this book and now the two separate entities will forever positively reinforce each other in my mind. There are some significant changes from the movie which should help separate them.I love the inclusion of the character, \\"William Goldman\\". Oh, he's not a character you say? He's the author? Well he's one of my favorite parts of this book. I love the interaction between the characters, especially Fezzik and Inigo who throughout the book had me in all kinds of tears: of laughter, of joy, of sadness.I read every word of \\"The Princess Bride\\" and I'm usually a big skimmer and skipper."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"One of my all-time absolute favorite books. Like most of the world, I fell in love with the movie (which is one of my all-time absolute favorite movies) first, and then delved into the book. The book is essentially the same (as William Goldman wrote the screenplay), with all the wonderful characters (my favorite has to be the tormented revenge-obsessed sword wizard Inigo Montoya), great Monty Pythonesque humor, incredibly clever adventures (the Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp, the Pit of Death) and the beautiful romance between Buttercup and Westley. Sure, it's not the deepest book ever written, but its so much fun. Probably one of the greatest modern fairy tales/fantasy stories. But there are a few things that the books as that the immortal film lacks. First of all, more information (particularly concerning Inigo and Fezzik). Probably most obvious is Goldman's clever style. The fake abridgement allows him to make comments on this beloved story from his childhood and to make (depressing) commentary about how real life just isn't as good as sword fights and elevated love. Ironically, he's also satirizing fantasy authors that use their stories to tell some sort of political message--ruining the great fun of an exciting story. Goldman's voice and prose is also definitely worth the read. He writes an exciting and climatic and humorous tale seemingly without effort. He plays a great game with the audience. But the best thing that the book has (in the later editions), is a chapter from Buttercup's Baby. This chapter--all about the events after PB, some wonderful flashback having to do with my favorite Inigo, and dealing with the birth of Waverly and the death of Fezzik (that's the name of the chapter, so I didn't spoil anything)--makes me thoroughly eager for the sequel, if it should ever emerge."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"There are so many reviews already written for this story, I'm not sure what I can add. This is a classic story that shouldn't be missed by any avid reader. Even if you have seen the movie, you should read the book. I was surprised at how closely the movie mirrored the book. But it is quite an enjoyable read.I would recommend this book to any who enjoys a good story with some humor in it. You will find yourself laughing out loud."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"\\"Has it occurred to you that I have gone to great effort...to reach this point\\"Buttercup is a milk maid; Westley is a farm boy. One day, Buttercup realizes she is in love with Westley. Westley immediately leaves for the Americas, to make his fortune and return to wed Buttercup. But the Dread Pirate Roberts attacks his ship and leaves no survivors. The most beautiful woman in the world is then wooed by Prince Humperdink, is captured by a Sicilian, a giant, and a Spaniard, and is chased by a dreaded man in black.I Liked:This is the second time I've read \\"The Princess Bride\\". Being let in on the secret that there is no Morgenstern and that the story of Goldman's family is a lie makes this almost better the second time around.What Goldman is able to produce with this is humor...and satire, which he jibes \\"Morgenstern\\" for having. He takes all the \\"fantasy\\" and \\"adventure\\" cliches and turns them on their heads. Damsel in distress? Check! Masked hero? Check! Scary bad guys? Check! One note sidekicks? Check! But...Buttercup is a damsel in distress, a hideous one and one that is frequently mentioned how brainless she is (instead of the copious movies and books that say the heroine is so smart and then proceed to have her stand around, doing nothing). The masked hero is so perfect and manly, his perfection is hyperbole at its best. The bad guys are deliciously aware of their bad guy-ness and don't bother to conceal it (it's only because everyone else is so dimwitted that they can't see it). And the sidekicks? Inigo is a sword wizard, but don't ask him to think, it'll take an hour or more! Fizzik may be able to tear down walls with bare hands, but don't ask him to use his brain, he'll go into a panic. And thus, the whole point of why this works is because Goldman is so aware of his surroundings, so genre savvy, it actually is funny.In addition, I actually did enjoy when Goldman interjected and stated what \\"Morgenstern\\" left out or what happened to him in his non-existent childhood. I felt it took the story that one more step, past stereotypical fantasy into a different plane. The story became a satire of the doorstopper fantasy stories (I can only imagine what he'd think now!); the story became a heart-warming tale of a child enjoying a tale his dad told; the story became a subtle jab for anachronistic writing (Westley wears blue jeans?).And enjoyable to read! Goldman (or \\"Morgenstern\\") writes in a breezy manner, very easy on the eyes. I found myself flying through the pages, and I'm a very slow reader. Good description, good word choices, good flow.When talking about the book, it's impossible not to mention the movie. And the book is definitely different than the movie--not all that much, since Goldman worked on the screenplay of the movie, but enough that it makes reading the book somewhat worthwhile. We learn Inigo and Fezzik's backstories. We learn more about Miracle Max, Dread Pirate Roberts, and even dumb things like where the heck Fezzik got the holocaust coat at the end (it's dumb, but it's here).I Didn't Like:Buttercup is an idiot. The author basically states she is all beauty and no brains. Heck, even Westley basically tells her she can barely think. And although all characters are poked fun at (Humperdink, Fezzik, Inigo, Miracle Max, even Westley), I still hate seeing the only female character treated like a incapable moron.In fact, most of the characters' faults are picked on. I hated seeing Fezzik being brainless, Inigo being only wiry, and Humperdink only interested in war.Also, the book is very much like the movie, only without the brilliant actors giving their performances. This made particularly Miracle Max's parts stay kinda flat for me.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild.Buttercup fears that the Countess is interested in Westley. Boys chase Buttercup; girls follow Westley.Inigo's father dies. Fezzik's parents die. Westley is tortured. Humperdink hunts animals in his Zoo of Death (different name from movie). Swordplay. Chases. Betrayal. You get the picture.Overall:Upon a second reading, I found I liked the novel more. Yeah, so Buttercup is a moron; but all the characters are really idiots. Do I think it's better than the movie? For once, I'm going to say \\"no\\". Most of the time, I find the book better than the movie, but not in this case. The movie stuck more along the lines of the typical fantasy (while also being highly genre savvy); the novel has a slightly different bite to it. Plus, the book is missing the great actors that really brought life to the movie.However, if you have ever watched the movie, you definitely need to read the book. In fact, I highly recommend everyone to read this book at least once. It's definitely a good summer read.OLD REVIEW:Before I began this book, I was unsure of how close it was to the movie (how much artistic license the producers took when creating the film). I was a little surprised to see that most of the movie is in the book.Plot:Buttercup and Westley were to be married until Westley apparently dies at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup then becomes engaged to the Prince Humperdink, who wants nothing more than to go war with Guilder, the neighbor of his kingdom, Florin. What ensues is the paradigm of action/adventure/romance/comedy.Good:I love the sarcastic humor of this book (as I did with the movie)! I also enjoyed seeing more about Fezzik and Inigo. And seeing Humperdink actually hunt something and kill it makes his character a lot more scary and real than it was in the movie.Bad:I am not sure if I quite like how Buttercup first realizes she likes Westley. While it is amusing as a play on girls who have crushes on guys, it almost makes Buttercup look like an idiot while exhalting Westley. This leads into my next statement: there are comments in the book that personify Buttercup as the typical dumb blonde, which quickly grow old.Also, although I tend not to be like this, I found that the movie was better than the book. The book is pretty much exactly like the movie, except for a little more character development and strange and not necessarily better deviations (like the one about Buttercup).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Little or no foul language. No sexual situations. Sword fights, brawls, torture, etc.Overall:I, like many others, fell in love with The Princess Bride movie. The humor is unique and classic. The characters are real and courageous. The situations are unbelievable yet intriguing. The book follows much of this, though it is more than a bit lackluster (though it would make a good summer read). 3.5 stars rounded generously to 4."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I don't want to spoil this for anyone who is not familiar with William Goldman... but I must say that there is more to this book than meets the eye.

I first read it when I was eight, and it's still the best. It really is a Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure. Some people believe that this really is an abridged book. I think that I should say- there is no Florin. Or Guilder. Or S. Morgenstern. Goldman made them up. This story is 100% his. I love the way he claimed Morgenstern wrote this. It was funny and clever. And I love that he really had almost everything in this story. Fencing, fighting,true love, strong hate,harsh revenge, a few giants, lots of bad men, lots of good men, five or six beautiful women, beasties monsterous and gentle, some swell escapes and captures, death, lies, truth, miracles... I would have givin it an eleven, But I couldent. It derseves one. In general, this book is the best."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I've read this book many times, seen the movie enough to be considered an addict, and I still love them both. The book is more descriptive than the movie, and there are many parts that had to be cut in the screenplay. The Zoo of Death is a wonderful addition that you miss if you only see the movie. And for those of you that are wondering if Simon Morgenstern actually wrote this book, the answer is, he didn't. There is no country called Florin, and there never has been. Goldman claimed that Morgenstern and his father both came from there. The prologue was part of the story, and this shows the amazing storytelling ability of Goldman. After I'd read the book the first time, I was still under the impression that Morgenstern actually wrote it. Not until I started reading reviews of the book did I figure out that Morgenstern was a hoax. I think that rather than diminishing from the story, this fact adds to it. It shows that Goldman has an amazing imagination and can use it very subtly. Well, i've spoken my piece."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"For those of you who have seen the movie (I think it's actually better than the book), DON'T READ THE LAST PAGE!!! I think Morgenstern's ending ruins the story. This is fairy-tale like, and should have a fairy-tale ending."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Okay, I liked the movie, too. But this cult film came from a fabulously-written book. Even the lengthy prologue adds to the fun, as I have been asked whether I own &quot;the original&quot; or &quot;Goldman's rewrite.&quot;William Goldman's conversational interjections into the story do not detract from the flow, though an unattentive reader may be taken in by the consistent references to the nations of Florin and Guilder (actually two names for Dutch currency). All in all, the storyline is a fun romp through favorite cliches of fairy tales with a delightful twist on the ending. Goldman manages to balance action with humor quite nicely, thank you, and it's hard not to enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Great fun, true romance, pirates, giants, vilains, miracles, the book has it all."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"In my short life, I have not found another book that can capture ones imagination. The perfectly woven tapestry of details and adventure keep you on the edge of your. . .seat!

I can only say &quot;Thank you&quot; to the authors."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride by William Goldman is one of the best books of all time. It has something for everyone, just like the book jacket says-romance, adventure, sword fighting, humor, love. Goldman's style is familiar - you feel as if you're listening to a story over coffee after dinner. The novel completely captures you and pulls you into its world of fire swamps, the Cliffs of Insanity, the Zoo of Death. Prince Humperdinck and Count Rugen are two of fantasy's worst bad guys. The farmboy (The Dread Pirate Roberts or The Man in Black) is fiction's most romantic and heroic good guy. A must read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I liked this one a lot. I usually don't read these kind of books but this one was good. First of All I think I liked it because it was funny. Much more funny than the movie. I read it in three days. (hey. I'm not that fast of a reader.) any-way I liked it a lot. And I think the romance is cute. So go out, and get it. Well G.2.G see ya around."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"An enjoyable read, with Goldman twisting the format of the novel into something beyond satire. Reading the other reviews AFTER reading the novel has been great fun(Reminds me of the first time I saw Rob Reiner's movie, THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and half the audience thought it was a real rock documentary!). In the end, however, I was more interested in Goldman's voice than the &quot;Morgenstern&quot; story. And I thought that Buttercup was vapid."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book! I just finished reading it and really, really want to find the sequel, Buttercup's Baby, which, I believe, won't be published for a while. The story is about Buttercup, a beautiful woman, who discovers that she loves the farm boy, Wesley, just in time for him to leave for America! But then Buttercup recieves the devasting news that Wesley has been killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts! Buttercup is devasted and in her haste, consents to marry the evil Prince Humperdink. For three years, Buttercup, the once common daughter of a farmer, learns how to be a princess and future queen. One day, she is kidnapped by a band of three men: a mighty giant (the champion wrestler of 73 countries), the gratest swordsman in the world, and a tiny hunchback who happens to be the genius of the theives of Florin! However, a man dressed completely in black soon appears on the scene who seems to match all three mens' skills! This man attempts to rescue the doomed-to-die Buttercup, and you'll have to read this wonderful novel to find out what happens!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is a by the numbers story that works at times but never lives up to the adventure and romance it wants to deliver. Maybe, in a way, that is the point. I don't know. I love the film and the eccentric characters. I just think the novel reads more like a screenplay with very little emotional depth to any of the characters. I'm glad I read it because there are some good lines of dialogue. But this is hardly a 'classic'."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I purchased this book as a family book. The main book is, but there is another section at the end, entitled \\"Buttercup's Baby\\", which is NOT suitable for families. There was NO indication of this in any of the information given on the website. I was not pleased with this. I can do this book as a family read-aloud, but will not be able to put it out for my children to read on their own.

I have loved the movie since I was little and have always wanted more. This book is it. I have heard several people say how different the book and movie are, but that doesn't lessen the quality. The book does follow a different path to get to a similar end, but I love the story and narration by the author. If you're a reader and like the movie, then give this book a try. There are lots of little \\"deleted scenes\\" so to speak that are hysterical to read and you'll feel like you've gotten the little extra you've always wanted. Unfortunately you'll still want more. Does anyone out there know if the so-called-sequel \\"Buttercup's Baby\\" even exists?"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I love the movie and decided to give the book a try. Sorry, but the movie is better.Sure the book clarifies some things that the movie skipped over. And the whole Morgenstern was clever and made me chuckle once I figured it out.However, the author's interjections became more than a bit annoying. I read the 20th edition so the first like 50-100 pages were the author's comments or set up. I skipped most of this. The \\"teaser chapter\\" at the end, \\"Buttercup's Baby,\\" was a bit boring... sorry!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"thi book is freaking amazing. and for all you morons out there that gave a bad rap about it...YOURE MORONS THIS BOOK IS AWESOMNESS WRAPPED IN PAPER. i highly recommend this book to all age groups for its action, romance, humor, and amazingness.p.s. goldman is not sexist anyone that says he is needs to exam the word and the book."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm a fan of Rob Reiner's work, but his reading of this classic leaves quite a bit to be desired, in my opinion. He reads too fast and with little differing inflection, making it difficult at times to tell when he ends one character's line and starts another. This fantasy would have benefitted from a voice that could handle multiple characters and perhaps someday we'll even get a version with a full cast and music.Still, it's clearly a story that means a lot to him and to its listeners and readers, so his pace and reading style don't entirely distract from the experience...a very worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"A fantasy joke wrapped in a joke, wrapped in whatever material the covers are made out of.Perhaps you could call it a double satire, as the author makes up a framing device of falsehood to insert inbetween the adventures of the over the top princesses, swordsmen, giants and the like.Definitely funny, in parts, but not hilarious.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I only got this book from the library because I had seen the movie in my childhood and I wanted to experience it again in a different way. I realize my opinion may have been swayed only because I saw the movie first, but I liked the film a bit better than the book. However if I had read the book first, I assume I would have liked that better. But don't take this the wrong way, it's a wonderful book, and well worth reading. If you're a fan of the Princess Bride and you still haven't read this book, then you really should. It's an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"How many books can you say that about now days? It's the kind of book you'll read when you just need a good laughIt's not trying to teach you anything aside from the &quot;Life isn't fair&quot; speech and even that is done with fantasic humor!Now alittle bit on the whole real or not real thing. People look it up, a florin and a gilder are cuerency- coins! not contries! that alone tells you that this is fiction. The whole &quot;Good Parts&quot; thing a ruse!

Now it is my favorite &quot;I need to beleive in love again&quot; book. This book is a classic and has all the love, hope, hate and adventure one could hope for. I can not wait to read it to my children, and rediscover the magic of William Goldman's writting. It is soothing to know there are books that still can bring us our dreams."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"So, I love this book. I read it after watching and loving the film, and thought it added even more satire and detail to the story.Probably naively I believed the whole &quot;abridgement&quot; thing, until I read a book called, &quot;William Goldman : Four Screenplays With Essays : Marathon Man, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the Princess Bride, Misery&quot; in which he explains it was the only method he could think of to link the story, without it being ridiculously long, and bogged down in detail.To be fair, for a little while, I was disappointed, but now after re-reading, I think it adds something. It shows you his skill as a storyteller, that he can suck you in so wholeheartedly to his world.I should have spotted it really when he talks about his fat waster son. Who would really write that in a book their son was going to read?Anyway, like I say, it's still a fantastic book. Read it, and if you think it might help, don't believe a word I've said."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Read this book! I can't stress it enough...if you thought the movie was good - you'll be blown away by the book - everything falls into place when you read it - I have always had a hard time finishing books - my short attention span and busy life take away from the romance of reading - I finshed this book in one day - you don't want to put it down - there are enough new surprizes that it keeps you on the edge of your seat... This book will make you a true fan of the Princess Bride - and you'll be braging to all of your friends about your knowledge of the story - READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have read this book 4 times and still love it.

It muffled my imagination but the book still elaborated on the story making it way better!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I just love this book! The movie was awesome too! Cary Elwes is amazing! I don't understand why you people have to dog everyone else. Maybe S. Morgenstern is real, maybe he's not. Don't worry about what other people say about it! Just grow up! Enjoy the book and movie and let everyone think what they want to. By the way, Florin and Guilder are made up but that was the name of the currency they used back then.

Cary Elwes is amazing! LISTEN UP! S.Morgenstern is a REAL guy! He wrote the book. William Goldman abridged it. Don't listen to the bull from the other reviewers about S.Morgenstern being a figment of William Goldman's imagination. He's not.

It is a thrilling novel of adventure and romance. It has more of a historic romance going on. People often confuse it for fantasy. The only aspect that is &quot;fantasy&quot; of it is very small. However, it is sure to entertain people of all ages. It's marvelous. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in humorous, fresh wit and brilliant characters such as the ones in the Princess Bride. There is no such author as S.Morgenstein. It's all part of Goldman's vision. The book is magnificent."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"this book is definatelyone of my favorites- great great great book, i suggest all yall out there read it, but does anyone know how to get the rest of \\"Buttercup's Baby\\"?

And it was..for the first few chapters, but then I got into it. This book is a great read. Once I got into it, I breezed through it. All the characters are great in their own quirky ways and Goldman really knows how to draw a reader in. Oh and for all the people complaining about him cutting stuff out, It's a joke..there is no original. Buy this book if you want a good adventure novel..nothing too bad for younger kids in it either."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"Everything that was great in the movie, plus more!!! A very quick read, but the kind of book you can read again and again! Truly Great!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess BrideBy S. Morgenstern, edited by William GoldmanThe Princess Bride is a wonderful book of true love and high adventure ( as the subtitle says). It is about a woman named buttercup who lives on a farm with her mother, father and the farm boy who takes care of the farm. In the beginning of the book he is nothing more to buttercup than a fly. When Buttercup turns sixteen she is visited by the count because word of Buttercup's beauty has spread to the far reaches of the land. He comes with his wife under the pretext of studying there cows. While they are there, the countess looks at Westley (the farm boy) and Buttercup gets very angry. This is how she realizes she is very much in love with Westley. When she tells Westley this, he says he loves her too and goes to America to seek his fortune. On the way there his ship is terrorized and he is presumed dead. Throughout the rest of the book, Buttercup is kidnapped and there are magnificent sword fights.I love this book because there is a little bit for everyone. There is a lot of sword fights and hunting and battles if you like that kind of stuff (this was the part for me) but there is also romance for people who like that. There is devious plotting, horrible discoveries and trickery. I think this makes this book great for every type of reader. Becuse of this I would recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm very happy to see there are many who have enjoyed this book as much as I have. I first read it in 1976 or '77. I read it many times, gave it away to friends several times, and kept buying more copies. I enjoyed the movie as well, and other books and screenplays that Mr. Goldman has written. But Princess Bride is my favorite. The film Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid is my brothers' favorite and they have the entire dialogue memorized, and can drop a line in sneakly to any non-related conversation flawlessy. Reading Goldman's earlier books, and looking at them in comparison, I find he is capable of much more variety than most authors. He can be dark and light, tragic and funny better than most that I can think of. Wish I could sit down and shoot the...with him someday...."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is one of the funniest books and movies ever. The book is very light reading and very similar to the movie, which many people have seen. If you are looking at this because you liked the movie chances are you'd enjoy the book. However, don't expect too much extra detail or chapters more of new information. To the reviewer complaining about the &quot;abridged&quot; version-- there is no original version by S. Morgenstern, so really the problem is not an over-abridgement but perhaps not as much development as you would have liked."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"My familiarity with the Princess Bride has always been with the movie, a fun takeoff on fairy tales. Now, I have finally read the book and in certain ways was surprised at how things are different.For the most part, the book and the movie are very similar, which isn't surprising since William Goldman adapted his own book for the movie. In that sensee, there are no real shocks; even the movie's framing story of a grandfather reading the book to his sick grandson has its origins in the book.The book offers more, however, than just the movie on paper. Goldman has also created a whole fictitious history of his work and even included the beginning of a sequel. The history and his occasional asides are pretty clever; the sequel - Buttercup's Baby - is actually a bit of a disappointment, with stylistic differences from the main story that was written over two decades earlier.Overall, this is a great book, but fans of the movie should be cautioned; this book is more cynical than the movie. Buttercup, in particular, is both shallower and dumber than in the film and the true love that she shares with Westley is also much shallower than in the movie. That doesn't subtract from the quality of the novel, but the irony in the book is much more pronounced and it could disappoint those expecting essentially a novelization of the film."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High AdventureTHE PRINCESS BRIDEAbridged by William GoldmanSince as early as I can remember, my favorite movie of all time was (and still is) The Princess Bride. I always loved the story, the characters, the wit of the jokes, the genius of Westley and Vizzini. Every aspect of the story has always intrigued me, but it never occurred to me that the book that the grandfather read the child in the movie was a real book. For years now, I have been meaning to read this book. Finally, I sat down and just started reading it. The version that I am reading is the abridged version of S. Morgenstern's classic, abridged by William Goldman. Let me tell you, I have never been a big reader, but it seems the only thing I have done for the past week is read this book. I have loved every page. Not only does it depict my favorite story of all time, the one that I have grown accustomed to over the years through the movie, but it goes it to so much detail about the characters. It goes in to the background of Inigo, the Spaniard whose life was dedicated to avenging his father's death, about Fezzik, the giant who was the size of a normal, 85 pound boy by age 1, about Vizzini, the Sicilian, the genius, the leader of the two previous characters, about Westley and his undying love for Buttercup, who was the most beautiful woman in all the world. William Goldman also does a brilliant job summarizing the book. There are parts where he kind of \\"butts in\\" to the story in italic text, and tells little stories that have to do with the text. The author also has a great sense of humor, which just makes the book that much more entertaining. Goldman also wrote the screenplay to the movie, so naturally, the book parallels the movie, but the book goes in to so much more detail. If you have ever seen The Princess Bride, I think that you definitely have to read this book. You can not just see the movie and say that you've gotten everything out of this story that you will get. I can quote the entire movie, but this book has still had my interest on every page. This is definitely the best book that I have ever read, and I highly suggest that you read it as well."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride... these words stumped me, well at least the first 2 chapters. She was a pretty girl who though nothing of boys, beauty, people in general. The only thing she ever did was ride her horse, called horse. Horse was her in life. She never even bathed either. That's just gross!...This book I would really recommend because on how much I can relate. For she knows what she wants. Doesn't take \\"no\\" for an answer..."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I loved this book! I didn't want to write a review but I felt I needed to because some people didn't realize that S. Morgenstern ISN'T real!- and gave bad reviews because of it. People- why don't you research things before you write your opinions- so you actually know what your talking about!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have never liked a movie better than a book until I read the Princess Bride. I loved the movie so much I couldn't wait to read the book. Although the book scene in the Zoo of Death was excellent (I wish that entire scene would have been included in the movie), Goldman's overall presentation of Buttercup made her out to be less than desirable (not in physicial appearance but in personality and mental capacity), the ending left me with an uneasy feeling, and I don't understand his need to create S. Morgenstern? However, if he ever completes Buttercup's Baby, I would read it (and probably see the movie as well)."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I Loved this book! I couldn't put it down! All the characters showed so much courage, the ood change of events made the story fascinating! The characters are almost real people! I LOVED this book"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I liked this book a lot, but I really think it would have been better if Goldman had dropped the &quot;Morgenstein&quot; idea. For the record, there is no Morgenstein (haven't you ever wondered why you have never seen Florin on a map of Europe?) It is bad enough he wastes the introduction with a fictional story about how his father used to read him this story as a kid and that he felt it his duty to &quot;abridge&quot; the work of the fictional author S. Morgenstein. Then he really detracts from the story by adding these pointless editorials throughout the book. (One last time, there is no Morgenstein. Goldman made him up).So how good is the story? It certainly is worth the five stars I gave it. But I would like to one day see a version of this book with just the story and Goldman's pointless introduction and remarks abridged."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"The Princess Bride is a fantastic adventure into a fantasy world filled with intrigue, comedy, and most importantly true love. It is an exciting read for both children and adults and makes the perfect bedtime story. Goldman shows a spectacular ability to portray the true love between Buttercup and Westley without all the sexually explicit scenes that are so prominent in most romance stories. From the loveable Fezzik to the abhorable Prince, the characters in The Princess Bride sweep you along on their tidal wave of revenge, deception, and love. This book is for anyone who is a hopeless romantic looking for their own fairy tale. Through laughter and tears you can share the lives of the characters as they take you to the inevitable happy ending."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"One of the best books I've bought and read in a long time!! Although much abridged, this version of The Princess Bride brought me as much pleasure as the movie. Critics and scholars may disagree, but from the moment I opened the book, I was again brought into Morgenstern's world of mayhem and fairy tale. This is something I would read to my children and my children's children. It is absolutely fabulous."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This book is so good! I love William Goldman's little joke about Morgenstern and his jokes about fairy tales. By the way...THERE IS NO S. MORGENSTERN! If you try to find his unabriged version, you will be most seriously dissappointed!"},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I'm a really big fan of the movie, but the book was soooo much better. There's not enough I can say. I took this book with me on vacation, and spent a lot of my time reading it. It took me two days. Couldn't wait to get to the end. Then there was that sad feeling that you sometimes get when you finish a great book. THIS book is great; it's imaginative, a wonderful fantasy story, a sappy romance tale but that is standable, and it has a little bit of adventure. I think this book takes you back to a place that a lot of people have lost: our imagination. Our brain is telling us that this is stupid and it could never happen; our imagination is telling our brain to shut up and enjoy the story. And that's what everyone should do when reading this. Don't look into it anymore than it lets you and just enjoy the wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Princess Bride","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I just read it again this weekend. It took me a mere two days; it's an amazingly fast read. I still admire the movie for being on par with the book--Rob Reiner did the book justice. And kudos for letting Billy write the screenplay...he preserves most of the dialogue, and even one-ups the book in some parts (Personally, I think the &quot;Shrieking Eels&quot; sounds more foreboding than the &quot;sharks.&quot; I think his book is brilliant in completely fooling the reader into believing what he is reading is an abridgement. Flawless. His commentaries lend his abrdigement &quot;credibility.&quot;Get a clue people: there is no S.

In this case I felt COMPELLED to write one. I bought this book wanting it to be great and having high expectations based on the reviews I read. I doubt many of the reviewers OR the EDITORS read this book very closely. There are so many mistakes (small and large) and examples which flat out DON'T WORK, that the book has almost driven me mad. I've wasted HOURS trying to get things to work the way the authors described. The errata posted on the oreilly.com site lists maybe 1/4 of the errors. There is ONE posted review on Amazon.com which took notice of this, but all of the others seem to miss it completely. Kudos to Raymond Smith!Two perfect examples (in case you want to save yourself a few hours of struggle):1. The Invoice Finder tutorial on page 372 simply doesn't work using the \\"minimum amount\\" field as they describe. It will work using the date range criterion, but when you add the minimum amount match, it fails. I built a file following along with the text and thought it was MY file that was broken. Then I tried the files supplied with the Missing Manual \\"CD\\". The authors' files don't work either. They SEEM to work with the data already in them, but if you add an invoice, it doesn't work. And if you simply open the \\"options...\\" definition of the Total Due field on the \\"Invoices\\" table, then OK the dialog box, all the existing data fails as well. It must be some kind of indexing problem, but the fact that it slipped by the editors is almost impossible to believe.2. The Repeating Fields for Multiple Results on page 417 is totally wrong. The formula they supply will not work at all, and in fact, unless the \\"Price\\" field is a repeating field as well (which they don't mention at all), you can't do any calculations using the \\"Get(CalculationRepetitionNumber)\\" that will work the way they describe. Not to mention the fact that in the second mention of the calculation they call it \\"Get(CalculatedRepetitionNumber)\\" which is wrong and won't even take. The text suggests that you \\"test this calculation with a few numbers\\", but I doubt that any editor tried it. AND THIS IS LISTED IN A POWER USERS' CLINIC.I don't know if this is an author problem or an editor problem, but either way, it is a REAL problem for readers.What a disappointment and a waste of many hours... Don't listen to the majority of reviews on this book. They have clearly come from people who read it but were not actually trying to learn from the DOING the examples in the text. The book is written in a friendly easy style, but there are too many errors to make it valuable. And it's been out for TOO long for these things not to be listed in an available errata or supplement."},{"Title":"FileMaker Pro 8: The Missing Manual","review":"I found this manual to be easy to use and understand. Easy to follow with wonderful illustrations and examples. Walks you through each feature and begins with a basic explanation of relational database theory. Uses a systematic design approach, building on each foundational design process while incorporating functions and features. The extra tips along the way are very useful. Light and humorous at times, making it enjoyable reading. Thorough step-by-step processes. If you are a seasoned FMP programmer, this makes a great reference for new features found in version 8 but lacking in coverage of all features. It was void of giving definitions to all of the new functions and operators introduced in version 8. It is also weak on publishing via a FMP server via the web. Only gave an introduction. I had to go to FMP to get PDF documents on specifics for publishing via server on the web.

This review is from a person with a basic understanding of database programs.I'm about halfway through this book and it has been a great guide to learning about FileMaker. However, it is soooo frustrating that there are many errors in the examples used throughout the book. With all the dry, technical speech (the author does try to lighten it up some) my ADD may kick in a little causing me to read it wrong while thinking about something else, but there are many times when the book tells me to do something with the example file you download with the \\"missing cd\\" and it just doesn't working right. For me it doesn't matter if they have updates on misprints in the book available online. I'm the kind of person who would prefer it be printed correctly the first time and not have to check everything against an online list of typos. That said, and taking the examples with a grain of salt and just getting the concepts behind them, I really do think this book is a good resource for becoming familiar FileMaker pretty fast. I've not read any other books but this one has to be one of the most comprehensive ones."},{"Title":"FileMaker Pro 8: The Missing Manual","review":"Very good - somehow this book manages to cover the basics and get to the more complex aspects in clear understandable terms. I'm sure for the power user there's stuff missing but for a mid skill user who (for example) wants to use portals effectively it's very clear."},{"Title":"FileMaker Pro 8: The Missing Manual","review":"As the title, and most of the reviews (save Mr. Strauchs') suggest, this is the manual that doesn't exist in print. It's a nice alternative to the Help menu as it's written in a personable style that offers more direct and real-world applications for the basics of FileMaker.However, as someone who has developed in FileMaker since version 2, I was hoping for a bundle of \\"tips'n'tricks\\" that were updated for FMP 7 & 8. But there's not even a simple explanation for a self-relation to find duplicate records (there is on the FileMaker site, but it's not documented in the TOC for Help; and it's more or less unchanged from the version 6 documentation). I'm wondering, with all the new features and new structure of FMP included in versions 7 & 8, how much is really new? It's nice to know that all the familiar tools are there to create field, layouts, and scripts, but I was hoping that the FileMaker redesign might save me a bit of time and make my scripts and calculations a bit more lean. But you won't find that here.[I empathize with Mr. Strauchs, as I've had similar experiences with MS database products. But, at least superficially, he must have missed a Help menu item in FileMaker about importing Excel files. This may be covered in the book, but, alas, the index is of no help, and importing (or even opening Excel files from FileMaker as on page 630 of the book) is a basic operation not adequately cross-referenced, and a topic that many new users and cross-platforms users would love to know about].My overall impression is that this is a hasty rehash of FileMaker (FMP) updated for the current version. It lacks a depth of organization and example that would make it an exemplary guide, but it covers every damn bit of the basics completely and, sometimes, without much real imagination."},{"Title":"FileMaker Pro 8: The Missing Manual","review":"This is what a technical manual should be. Well written in a style that avoids jargon. Well organized so that it covers every major point of the application, without endless excuses that certain subjects are beyond the scope of the book. Carefully indexed. Well edited. Profusely and intelligently illustrated. And, finally, designed for readability.FileMaker beginners will find that this is a true tutorial and covers far more territory than most casual users will want to travel. FileMaker pros will find this a handy reference for the inevitable moment when they can't remember something or need to explore a function new to them.This edition has been outmoded to a degree because of the introduction of FileMaker 8.5, but it is still eminently useful.In short, this truly is the \\"missing manual\\" for FileMaker Pro 8 and should be considered an essential book for any user.

Unfortunately the manufacturer's provided help is too filled with \\"jargon\\" and not enough explanation. It becomes necessary to \\"reverse engineer\\" the provided examples to understand how much of the program can be used, being time consuming and filled with trial and error. And since there is no printed version, there is no where to put the notes and comments always gathered as one learns a programHaving written software on a professional basis for the original PCs in assembly language and being a regular user of such systems as SolidWorks parametric software I have a proven ability to understand. But the documentation that came with FileMaker was insufficient to grasp too may details needed to make the program usable in creating one's own databases rather than use a \\"canned\\" template.The book is well written and gives good examples. In addition the authors are available by email to help really serious problems, but don't abuse that by constant pestering. I doubt if I could have gotten good use of the program in any reasonable time without this book. I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I think it could be made perfect with a few more actual written examples of the scripts or commands as the user would type or use them in the program.

I would consider myself an advanced computer user and intermediate in working with programs like FileMaker. (Though database programs I have used before have had less features). This book uses an example of building a database throughout the book that involves customers and invoices, etc. The problem is that in later chapters the ongoing example database begins to interfere with the presentation of the material. If you have the time to work through the example database in detail (for a few hundred pages+) you might have a decent understanding of Filemaker-at least within the context of the example. Or if you have that kind of time, you might just want to take a class. I started with the beginning of the book when I began to build my database (which does not involve customers and invoices). After doing the initial planning/building work, I tried to skip to other parts of the book that were relevent to what I needed to do. Unfortunately, most of the descriptions are based on the original example--this made it difficult to apply the information to my own project. If the functions had been just described clearly at the beginning of each section, without relying on the example it would have been much better. There are a few mistakes as well-small but they cost me a bit of time. E.g., the book states that the \\"missing fields\\" problem can be fixed by changing a setting in preferences. This is not necessarily right--in my case it turned out to be a layout issue. I've had better results with trial and error than on relying on most of the book. Also, the language is not as clear as it could be, and precision is important in a book like this, especially for those of us who are not advanced users. Most importantly, I would have preferred a book with more straightforward descriptions and instructions."},{"Title":"FileMaker Pro 8: The Missing Manual","review":"This book was a great help when I decided to take on the task of developing my company's database!

That is what seems to have happened to Mona Abaza, when she wrote what was apparently intended as a comparative study of the approaches to the Islamization of Knowledge in Malaysia and Egypt. A social scientist connected with the American University in Cairo, Abaza has not only extensive research experience in her native Egypt and Malaysia, of course, but she has also worked in Germany and the Netherlands. In addition to that her writing betrays familiarity with French literature and an impressive knowledge of general intellectual discourse in the Muslim world, as well as the debates in the field of Islamic Studies. The flaw of Debates on Islam and Knowledge in Malaysia and Egypt is therefore certainly not a lack of data, but quite the opposite. Although the book's title suggests a sufficiently narrowed-down theme, Abaza seems to have been unable to fight off the temptation to include everything she came across during her investigations.The author's musings on Islamized science, the juxtaposition of Egyptian and Malaysian cultural landscapes, and the position of Muslim intellectuals in a globalizing world are all suitable topics for the introductory reflections of part I. But it is somewhat of a mystery why Abaza allows hers story to derail in the second part, dedicated to \\"Biographies and Travelling Ideas\\". Why include Isma'il al-Faruqi, a Palestinian who taught in America, in a book on Egypt and Malaysia? In the same section we find a chapter with the title \\"Henry Corbin, the absent centre\\", only to discover that it is not so much about this immensely profound French philosopher-mystic, but the exiled Iranian perennialist S.H. Nasr. This is not to imply that these thinkers are not relevant, but Abaza could have better prioritized what should be in the book and what not. Indeed, the section also contains two interesting chapters comparing the intellectual output of Malaysia's al-Attas/Alatas brothers, but it sorely misses a chapter on an influential Egyptian intellectual.In the third and final part, Abaza appears to have rediscovered her bearings. She opens with a lucid exposition on the Islamization of Knowledge debate in Egypt,including appropriate cross-references to examples of institutional cooperation and intellectual exchange between Egypt and Malaysia. In \\"Cultural Invasions\\" she puts the anti-Orientalist onslaught on Western scholarship concerning Islam into a proper perspective, with discussions of the viewpoints of Sadiq al-Azm, Georges Anawati, and Georges Tarabishi - who have charged those jumping on Edward Said's bandwagon of throwing away the child with the bathwater. \\"Counter Images: Secular Responses\\" certainly is the book's strongest chapter. Here Abaza subjects the proponents of the Islamization of Knowledge project to a very critical examination, not shying away from strong characterizations like \`charlatans'. Identifying the \`Saudization' of many Muslim societies under the tandem influence of 'Salafi' thought and petro-dollars, she presents the work of the late Zaki Nagib Mahmud as a welcome exception to the rule, although he was also not able to avoid some of the simplifications he accused the Islamizers of. Abaza has also taken care to include a contemplation of gender issues in the Arab world and in Malaysia. Apart from observations on the 'usual suspects', like Nawal al-Sa'adawi and Fatima Mernissi, the author also shares some of her own experiences with the 'Sisters of Islam' - a women professionals group from Malaysia.Finally, the book's \`Closing Remarks' are just that; Abaza does not present a coherent round-up of the theme(s) she has explored. Probably this would have been impossible anyway, because of the wide range of topics she has chosen to address. Briefly touching on the impact of the Iranian revolution, Said's Orientalism critique (again), and Leonard Binder's seminal study of Islamic Liberalism, her remarks regarding the connection between Islamization of Knowledge and the earlier mentioned influence of Saudi financial prowess are more to the point. Abaza also returns to the anxiety among young Muslim scholars regarding the dim prospects that international academia holds for them. In relation to this, she could have elaborated a bit more on the interesting distinction she makes between 'cosmopolitans' and 'transnationals', as well as the phenomenon of intellectuals turning into \`bread writers' for the Arab press. The same applies to some very valid observations concerning the alleged anti-rationalist stance of many Islamizers of Knowledge and the apparent similarities that can be detected in certain strands of Western metaphysics and spirituality. After drawing attention to the polemical tone of the controversial Egyptian scholar Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd's charges that both moderate and extremist Islamizers/Islamists demonize all their intellectual opponents without discrimination, Abaza's final lines express the hope to have illuminated some of the diversities in an apparently very homogenized Islamic discourse.In spite of the earlier mentioned shortcomings, Mona Abaza's engaging style provides the reader with plenty of stimulation for further readings in contemporary Muslim thought."},{"Title":"The angel of the revolution: A tale of the coming terror","review":"Ok ive read it a few times and it was just ok.

I found it in a dollar pile at a book fair and it was one of the greatest things I've spent my money on.I cannot remember the last time I was so moved by a book. Bishop's discription of this day has a rare quaility of being both objective and emotional. Such events in human history are bound in emotion, but there is one other way to present this material except objectivily because of its power and meaning.\\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\" was one of the only books that caused me to weep while reading it. \\"The Final Hours\\" are presented with such digneity and grace that; while events occured over 150 years ago, they are as moving if they had happened 5 years ago. I would say that it has been 15 years or more since I have been so affected by a book. Bishop gives the reader an oppertunity to be apart of history and not just learn from it. You feel as if you are part of the crowd at Ford's Theater or at the Peterson home.This is a great find and an important read for anyone who cares about human history."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"My grandmother loved this book back in the 1960 when she read it.

Not that I'm saying that Bishop's facts are in error - I imply nothing of the kind one way or the other - but the absence of sources puts this work outside the historical realm. When Bishop put quotes around sentences in a conversation, how do we know where he got them? Are they accurate, or is the author creating them? Any book claiming to be historical that fails to source its data is worthless. However, TDLWS is so well written that I advise you to read for enjoyment if nothing else, but never cite it as a data source on a paper or in your book."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This is a classic book on the Lincoln assassination. Anyone contemplating a serious study of that fateful night of April 14, 1865 should start with this book. Even though it was published over twenty years ago, Bishop's book has stood the test of time.What is so appalling is the gross neglect and incompetence by the government after the shooting."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT should be required reading for anyone with an interest in American History. The sheer amount of detail here is invaluable. Historian Jim Bishop has gone to the original newspaper accounts, court documents and government records to get at the indisputable facts. Contradictory reports have been reconciled, confusing motivations and events have been plainly explained, and the result is a book brimming with information but which is still easy enough for us laymen to read.The format of the material will be familiar to any fan of the television show \\"24\\". Like that piece of modern drama, the book is laid out so that each chapter is devoted to a single hour. The result is a slow, detailed progression through the day that pushes up the tension as the fatal hour approaches. The book begins at 7 a.m. on the morning of April 14th, 1865, continues through the actual assassination during the 10 o'clock hour and then concludes with the death of Lincoln at 7:22 a.m. the following morning. Of course, the similarities between this account and the much-hyped television series are purely structural - the story isn't fictitious, and we already know the ending.Two chapters interrupt this narrative. One that gives a background into the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, and another that gives us a brief history of the conspiracy. This book doesn't try to give more than a short summary on those two topics, so readers interested in those subjects should also find other material. This book is primarily concerned with getting across the actual events of the day rather than trying to put every single fact into a historical perspective. It reads like an extremely detailed journal told from an omniscient observer.One thing I didn't like was Bishop's tendency to write the factual events in an overly dramatic style. We're treated to people's inner thoughts, their facial expressions, occasional over-dramatic language, and other items that couldn't possibly be known to the author. To be fair, Bishop does acknowledge in the introduction that he does take certain liberties of that type in the name, presumably, of dramatic license. The only problem I had with this approach is that the fourteenth of April 1895 is already one of the most gripping and shocking days in American history. There really wasn't any need to make the action more exciting. More often than not, these little pieces of intrusion annoyed me, though this wasn't nearly enough to distract from the hard facts of the event.Prior to reading THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT, my knowledge of the mechanics behind the assassination was sadly deficient. This book has provided me with a lot of information behind the events of that day as well as firing up my interest in U.S. Civil War history. I hope that future books that I read on this subject are as organized and as lucid as this one."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"mr. bishop composes a must read account of that fateful day. a must for history persons"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot is, in fact, about the entire day of Lincoln's death. If you decide to pick up this book make sure you set aside a lot of time and anything else you could be doing. This book is a very detailed hour by hour account of the day Lincoln was murdered. I do give the author credit for being historically accurate. Although it was accurate, this book did not have the ability to capture and hold on to my attention. The plot was pretty straight forward and I felt as though i was reading something straight out of a history book plus what's inbetween the lines. Mr.Bishop did make a good effort and put alot of time into this book judging by how detailed it is. The level of detail however, was my biggest problem with this book. I understand that Lincoln got shot and it was tragic but I don't need to know his murderer's every action throughout the day to get to where he was when he shot Lincoln.In conclusion, reading this book was comparable only to cruel and unusual punishment and I can only hope to never read anything this horrible ever again."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot is an old book. It was available when I was in grade school, but although I entertained an interest in history at the time, I was not yet into US history. A friend recently reintroduced me to the book, since he knew I had developed an interest in the period. I must say, I am glad he did. The book is strikingly well written and very well researched. Jim Bishop was not a professionally trained historian, but he was a writer with an interest in history and a methodical manner of approaching his subject. According to the introduction, the author kept notebooks on each of the major participants of the drama of Lincoln's last days, adding to them whenever scraps of information came his way. When he finally put pen to paper he had such voluminous data in anecdotal form, that he was able to untangle events in a way that no one before him had been able to do. Although he puts speeches into the mouths of his subjects, this dialogue is reconstructed from information from diaries, printed speeches, trail transcripts, and other documents from the time, that give credence to the author's construction.The book is written on an hour by hour basis, departing from this format only to add a chapter on events that immediately preceded the fateful day. The author follows the activities of each of the major participants, describing their behavior, interactions, and words, creating a drama every bit as riveting as a novel or play.I had read a biography of John Wilkes Booth that had raised the possibility of a conspiracy by Northerners to remove Lincoln and his more conciliatory approach to reconstruction by using a misguided Booth as a pawn in their political designs. At that time, I felt that there was a distinct possibility that this might have been the case. Bishop's book, however, made it apparent that this theory is not new but has been around since the events themselves. The author discusses the theory that the Secretary of War Stanton may have been behind such a scheme, but dismisses it as misguided, though I'm not entirely sure that his reasons for doing so are any more valid than the previous author's were.One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is that Bishop doesn't leave one hanging at the end. Lincoln isn't just dead as the finale. The author details some of the fates of those who participated in the events. We are not only told what happened to the perpetrators of the murder, but what became of individuals like Secretary of War Stanton, Vice President Johnson, Surgeon General Barnes, Ulysses S. Grant, among others. We are even told of the fate of the Ford Theater and its owner. The wrap up is very good.The book is a delight to read. It's full of information and colorful detail. It's clearly and understandably written, and would make entertaining reading for anyone from 5th or 6th grade reading level to the adult."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"Jim Bishop is an outstanding writer and his format using hours of the day (i.e., 7:00 am, 8:00 am, etc.) took you to where everyone was at that time--Lincoln, Booth, Johnson, The Surratts etc,. His research was in-depth and made you never question its validity. I lived in the Washington D.C. area for eight years and have visited the Ford Theater and the Boarding House Lincoln died in--after reading the book--I go visit those places everytime I return--and picture Jim Bishops clear explanation of events. After reading this book and visiting the Ford Theater--you will envision the actor John Booth jumping from the balcony and tripping as he took his last step on a theater stage. Not only will you sit in the low lighted rooms and learn of the intricate details behind the assassination--but will also learn many facts about the city of Washington D.C. during that period of time."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"Bishop writes a good book. The story is well researched, full of fascinating details, fast paced and never dull. Although you know the ending, the tale is constructed in a way that has you hoping someone will make a move in the story to avoid the awful destiny that must unfold.My only quibble is that the author takes a lot of license with what the various players were thinking. This certainly helps flesh out the story but does the history a minor disservice by going beyond what can be known with certainty. Still, enjoyanble and recommended."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"\\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\" takes the reader through an minute by minute account of the events involving the principal characters involved in the Lincoln assassination. The story actually starts weeks before the assassination and traces the Booth conspiracy, first to kidnap, and then to murder Lincoln as well as Lincoln's activities amid the rumors of conspiracy and murder. The roles of others, prominently Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, are artfully woven into the book. Author Jim Bishop skillfully switches between Lincoln and the conspirators while relating the events. Although I have long studied Lincoln Lore, I learned new things about the tragedy, and was reminded of other things which I had known. Never did my attention drift from the story. This is first class, minute by minute history, at its finest."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"I am getting tired of reading fiction, and I saw this in Borders one day and didn't hesitate to buy it. Thank God I did. This is a really good book. It lets the reader know all the characters involved and what exactly happened on that fatal day in April of 1865. Also, there are lots of facts that I learned...for instance, that Lincoln lived for another nine hours after having been shot.If you like the era of the Civil War or are curious about Lincoln, buy this book. It will probably make you want to buy a biography of Lincoln afterwards."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This novel helps with the understanding of the events that led up to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Unknown to him adn his family it started off as a regular day and ended as one of the most tragic days in the history of the United States.This book takes the reader through the minds and plans of conspirators and helps with the reasoning behind the assassinaton. For example, taking the president as a hostage to try and get what the Confederate states wanted out of the war.On the day of the assassination, President Lincoln had received notice from the people who were to accompany him to the play that they would not be coming. As a faithful president, he still attended the play to show his support, not knowing that it would cause his death. This book also helped to show the arguements that Lincoln went through with Mary Todd about pubilc appearences and even going to Ford's Theater that night.Taking and hour by hour look at Lincoln's life helps to familiarize the reader with Lincoln and his family and his usual daily tasks. It helps show Lincoln as the man that he is instead of just the president."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"All history books should be written by Jim Bishop. He is able to bring the past to life with wonderful story telling that doesn't lose any details. This book taught me more about Lincoln than I have ever gotten out of classes and lessons. I had no clue that he disliked his wife and that John W Booth had failed so many times in his attempts. The deep research involved in such a writing must make it almost impossible to create history books in its image. Yet, we could do with less encyclopedia-like accounts of our past so that we keep our heritage instead of trying to wade through it. I will make sure to add Bishop's other masterpieces to my collection as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. A masterpiece in the sense that it reconstructs the day Lincoln was shot. You will live that day in the 21st century by reading this book. Hour by hour all the actions and conversations of all key personalities have been dissected and presented. This is a great historical forensics book."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"For lovers of history. This book places you in the tumultuous society of the American Civil War. The events surrounding the killing of President Lincoln are brought to life in the style of a modern CNN report. The questions who, why, where and how are well covered. This is an excellent historical account most appreciated by those that lived through the JFK killing."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"A few months ago, my grandmother said she had too many books and to come grab 'em up. So I went. And grabbed. A lot. Old MAD magazines and books nonfiction and fiction, of all genres. I've read six of these books so far and rated some on Goodreads (I particularly liked \\"Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair\\"). But this is my first written review of a book from that stash. \\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\" by Jim Bishop touched me in a way that is hard to explain. It probably has something to do with a president cut down in the middle of his glory. This is an old edition, by the way, copyright 1955 and with an 85-cent price on the front.I recommend this book to anyone. You don't like history? You don't like politics? No matter. This book transcends history and politics (subjects I love, by the way). This book has it all: suspense, so much so that when the moment of the assassination arrived, I had to distract myself and then squirm a few minutes before getting on with it - I did not want Lincoln to die! - murder, conspiracy, colorful characters, accidents of history, and yes, even romance. Okay, maybe not romance per se, but the bond between Lincoln and his wife was touching, even if she was a bit (maybe more than a bit!) of a tyrant.I would love to give this book five stars, but alas, it gets four. The postscript needed to deal more with John Wilkes Booth's capture. Sure, yes, the book is set from 7 a.m. to about 7:30 a.m. the next day (basically Lincoln's last 24 hours), and Booth was not captured in that time frame. But a one-sentence postscript after going through agonizing pages of his plotting and his getaway was not satisfying. The postscript where Booth was concerned should have been at least two pages.This is a fine book that brings Washington City and history to life. It perfectly balances action and the need to get history across. No boring textbook, this. True crime at its finest.-Q. KellyAuthor of \\"Strange Bedfellows\\""},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"I had read this book years ago, and I remembered it being easy to read, and full of information that kept me glued to the book as a kid. Since then I've read plenty of other books on Lincoln and the Civil War, and thought I'd go back and check this out, and I wasn't disappointed. I was in Ford's Theatre once and one of the guides there recommended this book also, you can't go wrong here, well done indeed."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"In high school I was obsessed with reading about Abraham Lincoln. This was the book that started it all. Very detailed description of the day that changed the United States."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"Jim Bishop chronicles 24 hours in the life and death of Lincoln. It is history of the finest kind: gripping, detailed and well written.This genre was so successful Bishop spent most of the rest of his writing career doing \\"day of\\" books.You won't regret this read.It has been noted by several historical authors of late that there are some factual errors in Bishop's great work. It's true, there are some discrepancies that cannot be defended. But this is popular history, written for the masses and not intended for scholarly peer review. As such, it more than fills the bill. Over the years I have read this book ten or twelve times since I first encountered it in the late 60s. I've bought and given it to many people, many of whom said they didn't like history but loved this book. In that regard it is without doubt one of the best Lincoln books."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"The book was purchased for my 16 year old son for a US History project. He has gotten the needed information from the book. Project underway, let's hope for an \\"A\\"!"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This book will keep you awake all night. Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This is a very entertaining book. Bishop draws the reader into this familiar story from the start and holds our interest. It is by no means the definitive account of what happened (for example, there are those historians who believe Mrs. Surratt was quite aware and involved with the doings of her boarding house) but it's a good read and it brings an important chapter of American history to life."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This is a tremendously suspenseful and thorough depiction of the last day of Lincoln's life. Bishop chose to include only the minimum of details that led to Lincoln's assassination (reading David Herbert Donald's &quot;Lincoln&quot; beforehand proved helpful to me), and barely any details of what the conspirators faced afterwards (I followed this book with Gene Smith's &quot;American Gothic&quot; to complete my understanding of what happened to them). The payoff is a book that allows the reader to see the movements of the principals in a suspenseful, clock-is-ticking fashion. You couldn't have paid me to put this book aside!"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"A wonderful read about Lincoln's life in the last 24 hours and the conspiracy that resulted in his assassination. This is a wonderful book, and one only grows to admire Lincoln after reading it. One also sees how Booth and his assorted idiots planned the killings. A determined effort by the government in protection for key members could have prevented this. The President's bodyguard went off to a bar, along with the other staff. Bishop researched this book for twenty to thirty years before writing it. The only criticism is that the beginning drags a little, but otherwise a great read."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"&quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot; is a must read for anybody interested in history, particularly in the civil war. This book draws the reader into the action as if they are in the booth at Fords theater on that fatal night when President Lincoln was shot at point blank range in the back of the head.This book provides a detailed account of what occurred before, during and after the shooting and provides details of the emergency work performed by doctors and the Strong but withering will of Mary Todd Lincoln.As mentioned earilier, this book is a &quot;must read.&quot; My review alone cannot do this book justice. I have had this book before but it was destroyed due to flood (I swore that my children would read and benefit from it). It is difficult to find and thank god Amazon had a listing for it."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"Jim Bishop was a terrific newpaper columnist of the 50's and 60's who wrote the prize winning book, &quot;The Day Christ Died&quot; and followed it with this one during the Civil War Centennial. It is well worth this re-print edition. An absolutely relentless march of the men, women and events of the last 24 hours in the life of Lincoln. The detail here does not slow the history. Indeed it is the life blood of this enthralling book. Meticulous research brings the story to full color. You will feel the heartbeat of Booth as he approaches the President's box. You will suffer the shock of Mrs. Lincoln when she realizes her husband has been wounded. You will weep for Abraham Lincoln. Seldom is history as truely revealing as this. You do not read this book really. You breath it. Scott Brundage"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"On my long commute to and from work, the audiocassette version of this book kept me thoroughly engrossed for days. No detail escaped Bishop's notice in this suprisingly gripping account of Lincoln's last day. An eminently satisfying piece of historical reconstruction."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This is one of the best historical books I have ever read. I know everyone has heard this before, but I could not put this book down. As you read the hour-by-hour account of Lincoln's last day, Bishop makes you feel as though you are there on the fringe watching as the minutes tick away. You can almost hear every conversation, observe their non-verbal cues, and feel the emotion as the cabinet sits around the table talking about what to do after the war is over. I strongly recommend this book to anyone regardless of age."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This book, though somewhat dated now, is still a great read. Dramatic and informative, if you enjoy Civil War/Lincoln materials, you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"What a great glance at such a powerful point of American history. I wish the author had finished the story past the 24 hour mark. I would have liked greater details about the capture of the conspirators but just the same I enjoyed the book immensely."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"In this book Jim Bishop does an hour by hour telling of the events leading up to, including, and after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It is quite readable and is history brought to life. I did find myself at odds with the author over his assertion that the man shot at the farm was John Wilkes Booth. Recent evidence seems to run contrary to this, but at the time the book was written, this evidence was not known. Still, it's a great book, and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"An excellent presentation of how things came together to allow Booth to assinate Lincoln. The book also provides period context that allows you to put yourself in the time period. Highly recommended for those interested in Lincoln history."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"As the title suggests, this is a chronological time frame of the day Lincoln was shot, taken hour by hour, among the different participants of the tragedy that day. This format allows the reader to get a grasp on the whereabouts of each person at any given moment this day. The book starts out describing Lincoln's breakfast, which consisted of a biscuit and a cup of coffee. I don't know why this struck me the way it did, but it summarizes the detail and the matter of fact approach in which the book was written. I have since read other books and come back to this one in that it gives the events in a way in which you can keep everything in perspective as it happens. I understand the author did another book on the Day Kennedy was Shot. I highly recommend this book to anyone beginning their study about the events surrounding this day."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"Strange that this book is still in print while Bishop's other book about the murder of a President, \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot,\\" is out of print. That book similiarly examines the day Kennedy died as this one examines the day Lincoln died, and both are stellar examples of the researcher's craft and the storyteller's art. Oddly, another book which minutely examines the day of Kennedy's murder, William Manchester's \\"Death Of A President,\\" is ALSO out of print. Conspiracy? At this point, who knows? Who even cares anymore?JFK asked Bishop to write an article about him on the basis of having read this book about Lincoln; the original article was titled \\"A Day In The Life of a President.\\" Kennedy suggested Bishop expand the article into a full book, which Bishop was in the process of doing when JFK was killed, and so the book turned into a sequel of sorts to this one about Lincoln that the murdered President loved. In the words of William Shatner, \\"Irony can be pretty ironic sometimes.\\"I have no idea why the Kennedy book is no longer in print. The Lincoln book is still out there, but \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" has apparently fallen out of favor. Strange.So why a minute-by-minute examination of a single day, even a day as momentous as this one? That's not necessarily an easy question to answer; it is a kind of subset history genre, the close examination of Kennedy's death, or Lincoln's, or Christ's, or 9/11, or D-Day, or Hiroshima, etc. On first blush it might seem of value only to the researcher writing from a larger historical perspective, but in fact a work of history with this kind of focus can be far more interesting than any other approach to the subject. In the case of JFK, for instance, the incredible tension that builds naturally from a chronicle of the day he was killed makes for a more thrilling story than a novel on the same subject could ever hope to achieve.The book follows not only Kennedy but all the players, Jackie, Oswald, his mother & his wife, LBJ, RFK, J.D. Tippett, and so on. At times these separate strands converge, but mostly they're followed separately and Bishop does a masterful job of keeping all the threads tight. It's hard to imagine the amount of research and organization that went into telling this story so cleanly, because it is certainly one of the most confusing, contradictory days in world history, but Bishop makes it look easy. He is a brilliant storyteller, and anyone will tell you that is what a great reporter has to be. It's not just the facts, ma'am, it's the narrative drive, and this one moves like a supercharged Hummer.So why has it fallen out of print? And why has another book on the same topic, William Manchester's \\"Death of a President,\\" also fallen out of print? I'm not much on conspiracy theories; there's nothing in either book that the \\"military-industrial complex\\" would find terribly distressing. Bishop does mention several eyewitnesses who saw or heard shots coming from the famous grassy knoll---as, incidentally, do the live news accounts of November 22---but by far most of the evidence Bishop (and Manchester) collects points squarely at Lee Harvey Oswald. I think this excellent book is out of print now because people just don't care who killed Kennedy anymore, and they certainly aren't interested in a blow-by-blow account of the assassination.To say this is \\"too bad\\" would be an understatement of biblical proportions. Every day, every hour, we are losing our sense of wonder and curiosity about our world, and we are most particularly forgetting the lessons the Sixties taught us: don't trust the official story. They may be right (in this case, I think they actually are: I believe Oswald did act alone and the \\"coverup\\" all these years has been the CIA, FBI, Dallas police dept., etc. covering up how incompetent and ineffectual they were protecting Kennedy that day), but you should ALWAYS look into the story for yourself. Books like \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" (and Oliver Stone's masterwork film \\"JFK\\") help us do that, by marshalling all the available information into a powerful narrative thrust. If we forget, or more importantly if we simply cease to care, then the ones who want us to sleep our lives away have won before we're even out of the starting gate.Read this book, not just because it is about one of the most important days in American history, and not just because it is a remarkably well-written thriller, but also because it is important, SO important, that we never forget this man and how he died and the lessons his death taught us."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"This book sat on the shelf for too long before I picked it up. Too bad for me, because it is a gripping narrative that holds the reader's interest right up to the final page. I found myself wanting Bishop to keep going after Lincoln's death, since the book was such an absorbing read. Bishop says in the forward that the book is \\"pretty much a journalistic job,\\" but acknowledges that some of the quotations are reconstructed rather than direct. It is up to the reader to determine how much faith to put into Bishop's details, as in this account of a chance meeting between John Wilkes Booth and a co-conspirator on the afternoon of the assassination: \\"Atzerodt, drunk and brazen, said that he 'enlisted' for capture, not murder. Booth sneered at the carriage maker called him a coward.\\" The reconstructions are plausible, and it appears all the important quotes and activities are based on thorough documentation. This hour-by-hour recounting of 24 hours and 22 minutes of April 14 and 15, 1865, will appeal to general readers as well as history buffs."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln was Shot","review":"an excellent write on the last day of lincolns life. you can tell jim did a lot of research on the subject. the book makes you feel like you were there. other excellent books by mr bishop are the day christ died and the day kennedy was shot."},{"Title":"The Book of Scsi: A Guide for Adventurers","review":"This was a great book in its time.

I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN: 1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)"},{"Title":"The Book of Scsi: A Guide for Adventurers","review":"The Book of SCSI provides a very thorough introduction to the implementation and operation of the SCSI bus. It covers all of the SCSI operations, including signal timing on the bus, and clearly differentiates between SCSI features that normally confuse users. If I was doing anything with the SCSI bus, this book would be on my desk.The only drawback from my perspective is the heavily PC-oriented focus in the implementation section (more Unix information would be nice). An update providing more current information on SCSI-3 would be helpful."},{"Title":"The Book of Scsi: A Guide for Adventurers","review":"This book is easy to read, but the information provided is very old (in computer years.)

The addresses also center around the theme of freedom and the brotherhood of humanity.It is said that Abraham Lincoln read this book as a child. But perhaps the most famous contribution of this book to American history is that a young slave named Frederick Douglass purchased this as his first book. A play in this book entitled \\"Dialogue Between a Master and A Slave\\" (where the slave has a battle of wits with his master who ends up freeing him) inspired Douglass to understand that he could fight for freedom with his MIND, thus leading to his career as a freedom fighter to end Americna slavery.I have often used this story (that is mentioned in David Blight's introductory notes and in Douglass' various bios) to inspire young people to use the power of their minds. This wisdom for the ages will inspire you also. Take a look at what made great minds like Lincoln and Frederick Douglass tick."},{"Title":"The Columbian Orator","review":"Can I give more than five stars? If I could, this book would get it!If you are doing research on Frederick Douglass, this book is a must. Along with his four autobiographies, this book provides insight into the academic and intellectual development of the man who is considered the template for African American leadership. Most well read people have a favorite book, and a book that influenced them significantly.This is both for Douglass.The introduction by David Blight, which presents a sociological study and history of the originator of this 19th century American standard is worth the price of the book alone.You may even want to buy two-- one to write in, and another to keep when the first one is beat up and the pages are falling out."},{"Title":"The Columbian Orator","review":"Touted as Frederick Douglass' favorite book, \\"The Columbian Orator\\" is a great deal more than that. This collection of speeches presented in two parts, (the first part consisting of the original collection and the second part a bonus consisting of modern speeches added to the original collection) not only is a very fine collection in its own right, but also was the book used to teach Douglass to read and then to go on and become one of this nation's finest orators. But more than that, it also served as the foundation for the art of forensics in the U.S. for more than a century.Douglass acquired it for fifty cents at a time when it was illegal for blacks to either buy, own, or read books. But not only did he buy it. He read it and put it to maximal use: He virtually slew slavery with it! There may be better examples of the power of one book having an impact on the world, but none have had such a direct, immediate and profound consequence in doing so as this one. I had always wondered how an illiterate slave could master the art of public speaking with such skill and with such style and flourish as Douglas did and as is exhibited in all of his speeches, but especially in his masterpiece of American oratory \\"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\\"And now I know: He used the \\"The Columbian Orator.\\"If one reads the speeches in part one of this book carefully, it then becomes clear that Douglass, not only read them, he imbibed them; remembered them; could recite most of them from memory; and then he used them and their vocabulary; the style, and the logical construction of their arguments, as a template for developing his own style and verbal defensive skills against slavery. One can see clearly an outline of how for instance Perkins' speech on the \\"Eloquence of Oration\\" must have had a profound affect on Douglass's sense of style. Or how Everett's speech \\"Slavery as Barbary, a Drama in Two Acts,\\" helped him immensely to hone his ideas about America's contradictory attitudes about slavery, etc.Many people cite Dr. Martin Luther King's \\"I have a Dream\\" speech as the finest of American oratory, but I believe nothing in the annals of American oratory even comes close to Douglass' \\"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\\"For anyone contemplating becoming an orator, he can do no better than to begin with this very fine volume. Every speech has something to offer. Plus there is a lot of history embedded within them, and the contexts surrounding their presentations.

I would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Winter of the Dead: 1609 (Young Founders)","review":"Although this book was very informative and taught me a good deal about the first few years in James Towne and the hardships the colonists suffered, I found that it was overly dark and scary. I appreciated the historical accuracy, such as when John Smith was injured, but, especially nearing the end, I found it very horrific. I know that this is what it was really like, but to have John Ratcliffe tortured to death, Nicholas Skot cannibalize a fourteen-year-old boy's corpse, and Peter Scott tortured into confessing that he murdered his wife and then burned at the stake all in quick succession, while myriads of people are dying all around them all the time was simply to much. I am thirteen years old and didn't sleep well at all after I read this book. I would recommend it for those who have a strong stomach."},{"Title":"Winter of the Dead: 1609 (Young Founders)","review":"I live in Yorktown and am in middle school and my favorite books to read are historical novels. This one is about Virginia history but also American history. It is about two boys who come to Jamestown in 1607 and settle with the other men like John Smith. Nathaniel, the main guy who was an orphan in England, likes to be left alone. He is strong and brave when terrible things happen to him and to the colony. John Smith, who he likes at first, really gets on his nerves but I won't say why because you need to find that out yourself. Nat learns a lot of things and even falls in love when a new ship comes in 1609 and a new girl arrives. The author makes everything seem really real and I think anyone would like this book, and all ages."},{"Title":"Winter of the Dead: 1609 (Young Founders)","review":"I was so pleased to find this book! As a teacher, I found it compliments our study of Jamestown and the infancy of what would, in almost two hundred more years, become the United States perfectly. Although a fictional account of one of the boys who did, in fact, come over with the first three ships, it includes actual events faced by actual historical figures...Smith, Archer, Newport, Radcliffe, Pocahontas, and more. The book is well-researched and engaging, with lively dialogue that hints of old-style conversation, excellent detail, action, and adventure. My seventh grade students found the story fascinating as we read it over a period of two weeks. They were as interested in this as much they would be any well-told tale. They learned about the hardships, the struggles and occasional friendships the English forged with the Native Americans, the reasons for the English settlement and the fear of the Spanish, the terrible death of Archer and the wounding of Smith, the sickness and starvation in the \\"Starving Time\\", the desperation of the settlers -- all true events -- while feeling an empathy for teenaged Nat and his efforts to become a man in a foreign, difficult world. Some of my students even asked if there was a sequel to this book, so I directed them to history books that picked up after 1609, and they dove right in! What a way to get kids hooked on history! I highly recommend this for teachers of early American history or students who are looking for an teen adventure set in American history!"},{"Title":"Winter of the Dead: 1609 (Young Founders)","review":"I purchased 1609: Winter of the Dead thinking it was going to focus on the winter of 1609. If this is the reason you are purchasing the book, know that the book tells the story of first two years of the settlement of Jamestown leaving the winter of 1609 for the last few chapters. While the book iself is interesting- especially as the characters were all real people -it is fictional as the lives are recreated on known events filled in with speculation on what could have happened. It is a good companion to Blood on the River: Jamestown 1607 by Elisa Carbone. The book focuses on Nathaniel Peacock, a young boy recruited by John Smith, who has bought into the propaganda that America is filled with gold that can be picked up without any work. In reality there is no gold only hard work and severe hardships. Nathaniel does survive to adulthood as documented in historical evidence but we will never know what kind of boy he was. The thing that I did like about this book as it does bring out that the boys were brought over not only to help with the work but to be traded with the Native Americans as peace offerings. Overall it was a good book."},{"Title":"Winter of the Dead: 1609 (Young Founders)","review":"I am so very disappoiinted with this book.

I found this book peaking my interests in how our charkas align with our everyday thinking and actions. The discussion concerning how we \\"pretend\\" not to be one with God really hit home because it made me know who I really am, and the power, love, and wisdom that is inside of all of us."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"James' presentation of the material and solid examples of the subject matter are worth many times the retail price of this book. Any devloper who works with a team of developers will see results and value in implementing even just a few of James' suggestions. Even if a developer is not in a team environment, implementing standards will allow the code to be easier to understand to others or to the same person in the future when changes will need to be made.I wish more developers would follow the suggestion of the book to take steps to increase the readability and maintainability of their code. Being in a position where I have inherited numerous projects from numerous developers, i can only dream of the hours I would have saved had their code been formatted in a similar fashion, and using a standard for variable names would have been like winning the lottery!This book is a great foundation and starting point for the Visual Basic Developer (new to programming or with experience) to begin to implement Code Standards and increase the readability and maintainability of their code.I cannot express eloquently enough the relief I felt in finding a standards book aimed solely at Visual Basic since most standards books are aimed at C/C++.I highly recommend this book to every Visual Basic Developer and believe that every developer should keep this book within reach at all times in their developing environment.A sincere thank-you to Mr. Foxall for taking the time to do what we all *know* needs to be done in standardizing our code and releasing his findings to us in such a well-designed format and proving his assertions with real code blocks to show the incorrect vs. a more correct way of accomplishing the task.If you are a Visual Basic programmer, you *NEED* this book. The e-version of the book on the included CD-ROM is just awesome and makes this book even more useful since you can have an electronic copy at your disposal when you need it."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Thank you thank you thank you! As a person in charge of 5 programmers, I can tell you that managing code of 5 people sometimes feels like I'm managing 5 different projects in 5 different languages.Mr. Foxall has put together a book that will now allow code to be written consistently and efficiently. Now, if someone quits, it will be so much easier to have someone else take over their code. That isn't to say that it's going to be easy to get our older code up to using these standards. Actually, it will take a bit of work (we should have been doing these things all along, but never knew exactly what to do). I'm going to get a copy for all of our developers.Kudos!"},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"The author has obviously written Visual Basic code for a living. His work has a definate 'been there' feel to it. He offers practical advice on writing better code and creating better user-interfaces.I found the chapter on architecting modules and procedures particularly helpful. While most books don't lend themselves well to an on-line format, this book's on-line format on the CD is exceptional in that it makes it easy to reference the material - which you'll want to do often.I keep mine with my staples: Code Complete and Dan Appleman's Guide to the API.b"}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},G={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",G,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(S,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-7159054d"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/18.md","filePath":"library/18.md"}'),H={name:"library/18.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(j)]))}});export{E as __pageData,D as default};
