Every serious poet has had to come to terms with the power of language to express its own meanings apart from, or even in opposition, to the poet's own intention. The Language poets seem to start with this experience. It is not too much to say that they cultivate a distrust of language and that their poems often frustrate the \`basic' function of language to narrate, to explain, to describe and to import knowledge or wisdom.&quot;I should point out that every serious poet should be burned with a Buick Regal's cigarette lighter and thrown into the Duwamish until they learn that the basic function of the human throat is to howl. The \`basic' function of language is to frustrate this impulse.Eighty years ago, in Zurich among a population of international outcasts and deserters from the Great War, a group of artists exploded what had been German Expressionism. They protested Western Civilization (the whole ball of wax), a society whose devotion to a coldly analytical and rational language had wrought Verdun and the Somme. Remembered largely now as the foundation for Surrealism and trivialized for their jokes, such as Marcel Duchamp's urinal, La Fonatine (1917), The First Texts of Dada revels in the serious anarchy and the subversive antics that gave birth to Dada.Hugo Ball -- one of the principal perpetrators of Dada and the author of the only Dada novel, Tenderenda the Fantast, included in this book and which of course bears absolutely no resemblance to what then passed for a novel and often doesn't bare clear resemblence to any known language -- believed that under the &quot;influence of Kant and German idealism, as well as Lutheran sobriety, that language had been made abstract and thus had been debased into a utilitarianism that allowed it to be plundered by jingoism, literary professionalism, journalism, and intellectual vacuity. It had become a tool for upholding the ruling value system.&quot; Ball made it his mission to purify the word. He saw Dada, which was initially performed at the Cabaret Voltaire as a fusion of sound, drama, and painting; a cacophony of contradiction, music played on found objects (known as Merz performance, the philosophy that any sound or text can be incorporated as material into a performance), monologues of gibberish, that is an art free from any concrete constraints.This book charts the inception of Dada and more importantly presents three texts in their confounding entirety. This is not a book about art history; it's a handbook for subversion and a champion of the vitality of art as terrorism. It is not much to say that Dada cultivated a mistrust of language; they burned every scrap of it they could find."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Baja California Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map)","review":"If you are looking for more detail than most Baja maps, this is an xlnt choice.

He struggles against the punishment and his father slips and hits. \\"The combined electricity in the wire he held and that of the electrode, raced through his body.

He developed a drug named Prevamonamine, \\"a breakthrough drug that changes brain wave frequencies by the manipulation of the neurotransmitters in the brain.

I got about halfway through it, and just couldn't pick it back up. The characters are likable enough, but they're very one-dimensional and predictable. I'd rather re-read GOOD books than try to slog through this.

He's rich, he's powerful, he's able to do absolutely anything. Everything he owns is the biggest, fastest and most technically advanced. All his friends are the biggest, smartest, strongest, and most connected. Therein lies the problem. He's just too everything. Bell's books are decent for casual reading when you don't want much of a challenge. There are two things that bother me about Bell's writing: 1) notwithstanding Hawke's amazing abilities, he still abysmally stupid at times, and 2) the little technical errors scattered throughout the book. Examples: Speed at sea is measured in knots, not knots per hour. A sniper does NOT put his eye against a scope. 9mm cartridges don't come in belts. A 327 is NOT a big block Chevy. Tomcat F/A 18 Super Hornets? What is it, F-14 Tomcats or F/A-18 Super Hornets? Aircraft carriers and navy bases are not commanded by admirals - that's a captain's billet. The propellers on the Lincoln turning 2,000 RPM? That's about 1,570 MPH at the tip. Ridiculous!Unfortunately, these small errors are distracting, rather like walking into a closed door when you're preoccupied. I read Bell when I'm up for mindless entertainment, not when I want a real story."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"My God this was horrible. I got half way through and had to stop when it was becoming obvious that the bullets would always narrowly miss our hero, wound his sidekick in the shoulder, and kill the bad guys.However, I loved the author's description of France:\\"A demented version of Italy.\\""},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Sorry to say, but Pirate isn't very good. Bell has come up with a thrilling plot, but the narration is just awful. Maybe I am over critical but I find the narrators voice to be annoying. The narrator 'changes' depending on which character has the lead in which chapter. When following Stokely, a ghetto refugeee cardboard cutout figure, the narrator throws around vulgarities \\"and sh**t\\" and generally pitches his \\"voice\\" to mimic the inner city. When following Hawke (half English, half American) the narrator is always shaving the differences. \\"Rather\\" was used to qualify descriptions three or four times on one page of narrative.The characters are all cardboard archetypes. Spy- conflicted, brilliant, irresistable, and talented. Cop- virtuous, dogged, refined. Big man- uneducated, wise, gruff, loyal. Villians- evil, evil, evil and evil. Prostitute- hidden heart of gold etc. under pressure from evil, but desiring to be a good guy after all.The reality is just bizarre. One character can tell if a handgun is loaded by the weight in his palm. Jet Rangers are \\"big\\" helicopters. I guess that is small stuff, but it takes away from the 'thrilling' elements."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was ridiculously bad. And yet, like a train wreck, I found myself continuing to read it, which is why I'm bothering to review it. Since there are all kinds of \\"bad\\", I'll clarify what I mean: it's written in a pulp fiction style--the characters are more stock caricatures--the foppish english detective, the swashbuckling hero, the former-NY-cop (who was a former navy SEAL and former NY Jets football player) African-American=giant-who-kicks-ass, megalomaniac villains from China, France and Germany. The prose is as purple as it gets. The action always takes place under dark-and-stormy skies. Nobody works hard at anything (or accomplishes much of anything).And yet...I kept reading. I'm a sucker for plot and loved the premise--that Bonaparte's heir teams up with the Chinese to take over the world's oil supplies. I lfound it silly, but kept forgiving, hoping that it would gel and live up to the promise. I forgave characters having a broken leg in one chapter, then walking into a room a few days later, apparently right as rain. I let it pass that a world-class espionage agent didn't know that the woman he slept with, daughter of the Chinese military leader sworn to kill him, has a twin sister, or that both women are military agents. Apparently, he's a world-class agent who doesn't do any research on his target. I kept letting things slide. My mistake.In the end, I was disappointed in myself for sticking with it. There was never any real sense of danger, never any challenge that our characters had to use wits to overcome; things that didn't make sense were swept aside and forgotten; even the final moments with every villain in the book took place OUTSIDE THE STORY. Seriously, someone would walk into the room and say \\"I had to kill so-and-so\\" or \\"they found the body of bad guy x. apparently he'd been shot by...\\" Or, the military would just show up and save things. The reviews that compare this to Bond do Ian Fleming a disservice.Apparently, the publishers have given up having editors edit for this to so miserably fall short of the promise. For that, someone should be keelhauled."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was the first book by Ted Bell that I have read - I selected it based upon the reviews and Amazon recommendation based upon other books I have bought. While the storyline was really good, the writing was not - there are too many attempts at \\"clever banter\\" along with details that contribute nothing to the plot. Additionally, some areas of the story are passed through very quickly while others go into long, unnecessary detail - I ended up jumping through several sections of pages without missing anything. I also did not care for the abrupt ending - I actually thought my Kindle download was missing pages. Based upon the writing style - and not the plot - I would not recommend this book which is too bad because this could have been a really good book!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"As a BIG fan of well-plotted spy/adventure yarns, I have been frantically searching for someone, ANYONE who could fill the HUGE shoes left by Robert Ludlum after his death. Without a doubt, Ted Bell IS the man to do it. However as a reviewer also mentioned, he is too unique in his own right to assume somone elses spot. He has created his own place in the world adventure/fiction, and he has done it quickly and he has done it very well.Just a few minutes of reading any of Bell's 3 novels and you can sense he just writes differently than what you normally find in this particular genre. There is almost a harmony to how the sentences flow. All I can say is in this case, Different isn't just good, it's GREAT.With Pirate, we see Alexander Hawke on his most daring mission yet. A crazed decendant of Napoleon has a plan to unite China and France together against virtually any and all nations in order to pull off a frightening scenario that includes the Middle East and the one thing they produce more of than almost any other place on earth: Oil. At first I thought that nobody in France or China could be stupid enough to pull off such an insane stunt, but trust me as you read Pirate, you will be utterly shocked at not how realistic it all is, but just how downright PLAUSIBLE it is. Shockingly realistic.Do yourself an immense favor and give Ted Bell a shot. You will NOT be disappointed. Yeah, I know I've heard that one before and it certainly SEEMS like an overused cliche, but in this particular case, I simply cannot endorse this guy enough. But if I could also bend your eye for just a few moments longer, if you take my advice, begin with 'Hawke' and then move on to 'Assassin' before reading 'Pirate'. NOT because you must read them in order, they are ALL excellent, but they simply get BETTER. I cannot WAIT for Alex Hawke's next outing. Yes, the book is THAT good."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Ted Bell extends his tale just a little too long. But it is good adventure for the arm chair tough guy.

Throw in a 4th rate James Bond, using the Ian Fleming style of product placement, an extremely silly plot - the French! the Chinese! World Domination! - and some hack writing and here you are.The wooden villans can not shoot straight (although they are armed with machine guns). Our hero never misses. His character is lacking. For example, (spoiler alert...just kidding) to rescue the tortured CIA agent he is able to walk onto a Chinese ship (in the harbor of Cannes - Thank God the Chinese decided to hang out with their captive) after stabbing two men. He then rushes the pilot house (oh yeah, best place to keep a captive, a place with huge glass windows). There he is overpowered, but luckily one of the villans decides to monologue. The friendly Navy Seal (I hear that they are great to have around in times like these) intervenes. Our hero has a moment of thought when he sees the villan on the ground - he hates to kill in cold blood (um, what about the two guys on the dock?). Our hero continues to look for the captive and finds him in a closet. One of the bad guys is shooting at them, but the hero is able to shoot him, whipping his Walther out in less than a second, from a rubber boat before his friendly Navy Seal (who is slow to respond to a machine gun - I guess he was sick that week in training) is killed.If you have time to kill, and do not require much besides the occasional \\"blow stuff up\\", this is the book for you. If you require that the author writes proper English, creates characters, has a sense of place and setting, then pick up someone else. This one wanders off into French-hating, evil Chinese, and a plot defined by twelve monkeys and a typewriter."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I am not going to repeat other reviewers discussion of the lack of character development.My issue is with the lack of basic research. One incident has Hawke's Zodiac being fired upon by a French Patrol Boat's missile. Bell uses the Harpoon missile as the weapon. The French have their own very effective ship to ship missile in the Exocet. Very unlikely that the French would use an American made Harpoon. Later in the novel, Hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest VTOL aircraft, the F-35. The catapult fails and Hawke is put in grave danger. My problem, this is a VTOL aircraft, which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe. Why would there be a \\"cat shot\\" at all. VTOLs are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight, which, again the author describes. Also this scene has nothing to do with the story. Just another \\"Saturday Cliff Hanger\\" episode.This is my second attempt at a Ted Bell novel, ASSASIN being the first. There are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to waste my time on this type of thriller. I believe the author has the ability to create a very good novel. I wish he would cast aside the unbelievable and go with something a little more creditable."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was my first novel by Ted Bell and I can't wait to read more! \\"Pirate\\" was a spellbinding, edge-of-your-seat, awesome adventure from page one. With a wide assortment of interesting, complex characters and situations, this book is anything but dull. It spans several continents and jumps back and forth from various story-lines which are all clearly connected. There are twists and turns galore and the ending will not let you down!Ted Bell is an truly exceptional writer which is so refreshing in this genre where most authors tend to be creative yet not particualrly talented. The book is intelligent, the characters practically jump off the page and the diaglogues very well-written. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"There is some good writing in this book, but it is limited to about 100 pages out of 600 pages. The main character, Alex Hawke, excuse me I mean Lord Alex Hawke, is a magical combination of James Bond, Austin Powers, Batman and Superman--he can do it all...around the world in a day. He is friends with the President of the US, he's a British Lord called on to rescue a hostage from the Chinese, rescue the Sultan of Oman from a fortress, rescue NYC from a nuclear bomb, fly a $50 million stealth jet on loan from the USA to a US aircraft carrier. Apparently the US Navy Seals, US pilots, etc don't exist in this book, as the Pres of the US, the CIA, Scotland Yard, etc rely solely on Lord Hawke to save the world. Hawke is apparently in his young 30's too.In the book, there is also the ego-maniacal descendant of Napoleon who murders his way to the top of the French Government. There is also the Chinese version of Hannibal Lecter who is an assassin and total freak, The German industrialist Neo Nazi who are all scheming to take over the world. They all meet with anti-climatic ends.And of course Sir Alex Hawke gets the girl, a beautiful Chinese spy, actress, singer, diva, etc who, after one night with Sir Hawke, betrays her country, kills her evil twin sister, almost kills her father, betrays her ex-boyfriend, helps Hawke's friend Stokley, the 6'5 260lb ex Jets running back who sneaks into all of the enemies' lairs to help Hawke save the world.The tone of the book varies from life and death serious to total tongue in cheek; it makes me think that even the author doesn't believe what he's writing.Bell's new one is on the best seller list. I guess that is what marketing can do for you."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"It is probably too late, but I've decided that when I grow up I want to be Ted Bell. You can tell from the opening page of any of his Alex Hawke thrillers --- be it HAWKE, ASSASSIN, or the newly published PIRATE --- that the guy is a marvelous, unique talent: he has a canny understanding of how apparently disparate events and facts are connected, and a unique way of providing explanations for them --- so much so that his novels, taken collectively, could be subtitled \\"How The World Works.\\" He is also married to a woman who, while not a household name, is possessed of one of the most brilliant minds on the planet. Lest you need any further endorsement, keep in mind that \\"10s\\" don't marry \\"2s.\\" Bell's most significant literary asset, however, is that he understands people, so that while his excellent novels are plot-driven, there is always a set of living, responsive hands firmly at the wheel.PIRATE is the third and best of the Hawke novels, an already brilliant series of derring-do and contemporary swashbuckling that contain more action and interesting characters than most books do in three. Hawke is brilliant, wealthy and talented; notwithstanding all of that, he is quite believable, even as he executes every task flawlessly, from (almost) single-handedly rescuing a hostage who possesses knowledge that threatens the free world, to carrying off a seemingly impossible escape from a technological grave with the coolheadedness and collectiveness of a Harry Houdini.The secondary characters are a delight here, ranging from Stokely Jones, who is guaranteed to save Hawke's bacon at least once per novel, to Hu Xu, who may well be one of the most unique villains introduced in recent fiction. Indeed, Xu, a cross-dressing assassin and expert interrogator, is guaranteed to creep out a reader from first appearance to last, as much for what he does as how he does it. His ingeniousness and depravity put me in the mind of Fu Manchu, a brilliant pulp villain from the early 20th century; as bad as the guy is, you can't wait for his next appearance, as he plots to...Well, yes, there is a plot to all of this, and a great and timely one it is! Luca Bonaparte, the ruthless descendant of Napoleon, plans to seize control of the reins of the government of France in a daring, de facto coup d'etat. His aim is to restore France to its 19th century status as a major world power. Bonaparte forms an unholy alliance with China to achieve this goal. China, with its nuclear arsenal, and France, through the use of an otherwise benevolent alliance, plot to occupy and control a sovereign, oil-rich Middle Eastern nation in order to utilize its most abundant natural resource for its own purpose. Hawke is brought in to provide clandestine support to the CIA in an attempt by the U.S. to thwart this alliance of convenience and the deadly nuclear confrontation it represents.It isn't entirely all Hawke's show, however. Stokely Jones is heavily involved as well, as he squires a beautiful, enigmatic Chinese actress across Germany while attempting to unlock the secrets of a wealthy German industrialist, hidden away in a mysterious and magnificent fortress near the Untersburg and Waltzmann mountains. Bell, never without his masterful touch, switches back and forth among various and precarious events, keeping the reader consistently off-balance and constantly entertained, from the first page to its thrilling, countdown conclusion.Bell easily could be considered the rightful heir to the throne of Robert Ludlum, but he is too talented to assume the chair of another; he brings his own to the table with unique and considerable talent. PIRATE and its predecessors are unbeatable.

The pace is relentless and the action keeps the reader in its grip right up until the very end. We go to some exotic locales with Hawke and his merry band of mercenaries while they attempt to save our world from the terrors and bad people that have cruel designs on it. We even get a truly nasty villain that it is our pleasure to \\"love to hate\\".The book breaks off into about three or four different story lines, but that does not seem to fracture the plot. It just adds whole new dimensions to the pace and to the tension. Hawke is a wonderful new \\"James Bond\\" type of figure who gets into and out of more scrapes than we can imagine. His entourage led by Stokely Jones (my favourite character), Brick Kelly and the indomitable Ambrose Congreve mange to get into and out of a lot of trouble all on their own. I highly recommend this series if you like political thrillers, but be prepared to stay up late trying to finish each book. This particular book is over 500 pages, but it doesn't seem that long once you get into it."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is billed as a Hawke novel, but there are two other great main characters that fill out the book. This is the thriller blueprint for beyond the year 2000.Starting with Lord Hawke - he's the 21st century's James Bond. His sidekick Stokely is the 21st century's Hawk (to Spenser). The inspector is the 21st century's Sherlock Holmes.The three team up (with help from other equally good side characters) to meet and beat a conspiracy of Chinese, German and French megolomaniacs that have a plan for Chinese domination that fits the 21st century as well. These bad guys are perfect Moriarties/Dr. No's, etc. for this century.To cap the comparisons, there is the understated British humor throughout - that rye, dry look at the world - that Hawke and the Inspector exhibit that is reminiscent of Bond. Stokely's humor is American all the way - a black Spenser rather than a tight-lipped Hawk. You can't help but enjoy these guys.There is non-stop action and thrills (of many varieties) for the full 500+ pages. Like all of this genre, you know the good guys will win. However, every scene poses a different challenge, including the possibilities of moles and traitors. The expected outcome never diminishes the tension or excitement.This is highly recommended and I will be rushing to Bell's other Hawke novels."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I have been a fan of James Bond for many years.

If Patterson continues to praise fluff like this, he''l lose all credibility. Where does one begin? A laughable plot line, cartoon characters, and dialogue unfit for remedial English class. I especially enjoyed Bell's one black character, whom he so cleverly named Stokely. After a few lines of Stokely's dialogue, it seems pretty clear that the only black person Bell has ever spoken to is the guy who serves him mint juleps at the club. Bell's back cover bio tells us he used to be in advertising. Ted, do youself (and us) a favor, see if they'll take you back."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"The fall of the Soviet Union caused a real problem for the writers of spy stories. All of a sudden there was no more big, bad KGB to go do nefarious things. For a while we had a really hard time finding stories with a credible bad guy. Most of the writers have turned to terrorists. You can go save the world from the small group of bad guys that want to nuke New York or whatever.Not so with this novel from Ted Bell. He has leapfroged the terrorist problem to what just might be a really big problem in the future. China is becoming hooked on oil, just like the western countries. China is now the second largest importer of oil in the world. And with a billion people trying to become industrialized, where's that oil going to come from.Enter France, always difficult to determine where France is on the world stage. But clearly France has an oil problem. (The reason she didn't support us in Iraq was that she was selling Iraq proscribed weapons in turn for a more favorable price on oil.)So can France and China get together and ... It will take Ted Bell's hero, Alex Hawke, and his co-hort Stokely Jones to solve this one."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I was beginning to despair of finding a new author in thisgenre. No more. This book and the prior Hawke books completely restored my belief that you canbreathe new life into a tired format. Everything about the whole series feels alive and fun. A great read you won't want to end.Finally. The thrill is back!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Alex Hawke is James Bond with an attitude (and a title) He seems to be turning up at trouble spots around the world either on a jet fighter plane, his own super yacht or other various and sundry means of transportation and when he does so he is forever putting monkey wrenches to the plans of the enemies of freedom. In this case that would be the Chinese and the French.The French? Mais Oui! Always an easy country to concour in the last two centuries, they are taken over from within by a direct decendant of Napolean, one Lucas Bonaparte who has schemed his way to the presidency that he considers his birthright (except he wants to be Emporer) by crushing all who stand in his way.The Chinese are simply the last really bad guys on the planet with the wherewithal to make things dicey for the forces of good and they have convinced Bonaparte to join their cabal.Add some delicious characters such as Stokely Jones, Jet and her twin sister along with a few others and enfold them in several ongoing crises and you have the receipe for a barn burner of a thriller novel which is written with a touch of elegance and a whole lot of imagination that will keep you turning pages and burning electricity into the wee hours until truth and justice prevail. You never doubt that will happen, although the path to that outcome will look very problematic from time to time. Ted Bell has done it again!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"An exciting story and hard to put down...

As a once Cussler fan I got bored with the sameness and the venture off into the Sci-fi arena. Ted Bell does it a little better and it remains to be seen if he continues on this path.

'Do I keep reading or cut my losses?' This is by far one of the most poorly researched and unrealistic \\"thrillers\\" I have ever read. His editor should also be taken to task in allowing whole chapters to remain in the book which serve no purpose other than to raise his word count. (The now infamous F-35 carrier scene being exhibit A in the indictment) The miraculous outcomes at every turn give new depth to the term daux ex machina.

Nothing like Preston and Childs, but fun. Most disappointing were the four and five star reviews given by Amazon \\"top reviewers\\". Such ratings dilute the value of reader reviews. Even books that don't presume to be great literature should be rated according to their purpose. In this instance, the genre is international thriller, espionage. If this book is worth four or five stars, then what is Clancy's best work to be rated? Not all books should be rated four or five stars just because one will bother to read them. This book is readable -- even enjoyable at a certain level -- but it is not an example of the best of the genre; it's just something to read until something better comes along."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Ted writes a fine thriller dealing in some of todays most compelling topics.

Nevertheless I am having problems putting this book down.Take this book for what it is worth, fictional entertainment.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is the third Alex Hawke Book I've read and my feeling for it, is the same as for the other two. There's potential there but it rarely lives up to the hype. I was amazed that Hawke let himself get so stupid over Jet in this novel. And I really couldn't understand why Jet would all of a sudden be in love with Hawke and willing to betray everything for him. There was no real development of that story. It felt like there were too many side plots in this novel - Ambrose falling in love? That was hooky. Hawke almost dying in that new plane? Really what was the point of that. I keep reading his books in hope of him finally getting it ALL right. So far it hasn't happened. So I'll probably wait until the next Hawke book hits my library instead of wasting money on it here."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This novel really gets going with an interesting bang. Ted Bell sets up an interesting James Bond type who has seemingly met his match and in a few pages manages to grab the reader with a well told remminice of past events. However, Bell then goes and adds several other interesting characters who manage to overlap one another. Quickly we are accosted by two other James Bond types, one of whom is also a primary protagonist. It all becomes a bit ridiculous after about 50 pages with swashbuckling rancor.My main beef is that Ted Bell goes wayyyyy over the top here. He has a nack for terrific writing, and well fleshed out characters. But sadly he over does it by a multitude of twenty and turns what could have been great into a silly comic book. I kept thinking that 'Pirate' had all of the ingredients to become a modern day Sabatini adventure, but instead it falls on its face with James Patterson-ites.Perhaps what was most disturbing to me while reading this, was the way the chapters were set up. He has so many characters rambling about here that it at times takes six or seven chapters to get back to the one in question. I am used to the modern day second person story telling that jumps back and forth between protagonists. But Bell has a nasty habbit here of leaving a chapter in a cliff-hanger moment. You want to know what is going to happen next, your into the plot, and then you have to hurry through five chapters that also simmilarily set you up in the same manner to find out what happens next. Only by then you probably are exhausted by so many climactic moments that you have put the book down and an hour or a day has passed.I really like Bell, and I hope his next one puts to rest my main beef with Pirate. I think that if it does, Bell will be up there at the top of his field."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"It took a little while to get through the 600+ pages of the paperback. Not that it was hard reading, it wasn't, just the sheer number of pages.It was worth the effort.Pirate opens with a spy, caught by the Chinese, on a slow boat back to China. The spy, however, has knowledge of a Chinese conspiracy to directly get oil from a Middle Eastern country with the assistance of France. He is the only person privy to this information. The CIA sends in Alex Hawke to rescue him, and thus begins an excellent novel. The novel takes you from Cannes, to Taiwan, Paris, New York, and England. Along the way, you meet a very unsavory cross-dressing Chinese agent/assassin, very deadly, twin female assassins, and a megalomaniacal French politician (a direct descendent of Napoleon Bonaparte). Pirate brings all of these characters together for a very believable plot concerning Red China pulling the strings of France to get direct access to oil, access to Taiwan, and subplots concerning super tankers doubling as atomic bombs and a 30-year old murder. The whole point is to crush America's standing as an economic powerhouse. And to sever their ties with Middle Eastern oil.The heroes of the novel, including the main character, Alex Hawke, are well drawn and believable. Bell does a great job of not making the secondary characters two dimensional. He also is able to tie all of the subplots together in a fashion that doesn't seem rushed or contrived. But you have to know that Alex Hawke gets himself out of some jams that will remind you of a Cussler novel. But not as quickly (hey, it is 600 pages - and it was a paperback!)This is the fourth novel in the Alex Hawke series, and I will have to go back and read the others, before reading his latest novel, Spy. This is one of those times when you are glad to have picked up a novel, without knowing that it was a series, and are happy to find that you have additional books to fill in some of the backstory.Another highly recommended series."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Grabbed this in a (poorly stocked) airport bookshop. $8 down the tubes.Ted Bell is an accomplished guy in other fields, but this is book is to classic spy fiction (early Ludlum, Forsyth, Le Carre, etc) as paint-by-numbers is to the Mona Lisa.The characters are awful stereotypes. The English characters are typical of what bad American writers make of British characters -- their mouths full of locutions from British movies of the 1930s and 40s that are heard nowhere in the British Isles of the 21st century.The characterizations are so inconsistent as to be laughable. We're supposed to accept, for example, that a Scotland Yard detective with a legendary reputation suddenly is struck dumb by the beauty of a suspect he's about to interrogate -- so stricken in fact, he begins to act like a schoolboy, unresponsive to others.I confess that this is the point at which I stopped reading, somewhere around page 125. Giving up on a book, like walking out on a movie, is something I almost never do -- I'm a persistent guy, and I'm usually curious enough about the plot to keep going. Hell, long after Ludlum lost his orginiality and became a factory, I bought and read all his non-ghost-written novels. But Ludlum at his most tired, \\"I-signed-the-contract-so-I've-got-to-churn-it-out\\" worst is better than this.If you want good contemproary spy fiction, try Daniel Silva instead."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"What happens when you have a rugged good-looking, quick-witted hero named Hawke, dangerous beautiful women, international intrigue, terrorism and the open sea.........TED BELL is what happens, Pirate: A Thriller is the result!!!Ted Bell puts together a fast paced intense story where the future of the free world is at stake. His characters are unpredictable and cunning. The mission is impossible. Failure is definitely not an option. The action is intense and lightning fast. The romance is heavy and dangerous.

I like the spy/thriller genre, and I like the premise of France and China collaborating to counter the United States. But I can't stand it when an author doesn't even take the time to check his facts. If he had reviewed his manuscript with any number of 14 year old military buffs, he could have gotten some easy improvements. Not to nitpick, but Lear Jets can't land on aircraft carriers. The Navy doesn't fly CIA agents and their rich British friends around on prototype fighter planes. Harpoon missiles can't be launched from yachts.

Far too much time was spent on Ambrose and his love affair and other fluff. There really wasn't much story with our hero Hawke until the end.

Not literature, but a fun thriller."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"The third installment in the Alex Hawke adventure series is easily the best book yet, though there were still a few wrinkles that needed ironing out. Sometime spy Alex Hawke is called in to rescue an American spook who has fallen into the hands of the Chinese. The Chinese, who have become close friends with France, are up to something big, and it somehow involves beautiful actress Jet Moon, whose bed Alex is roused from when duty calls. Jet's father, General Sun-Yat Moon, is in league with her dubious boyfriend, Baron \\"Schatzi\\" Von Draxis. The French, the Chinese, and the German shipbuilder are up to no good, infiltrating the Arab empire of Oman as part of their plans. While Alex's ex-Scotland Yard investigator pal, Ambrose Congreve, travels to New York to hunt for witnesses to a decades-old murder related to the French-Chinese plot, armoire-sized Stokley Jones rescues Jet from her angry boyfriend and travels the world gathering clues with her, figuring out what the French and Chinese are up to. Meanwhile, Alex has to infiltrate an impregnable fortress to rescue a sultan and his harem from their enemies. There were a lot of loose ends to tie up, and just when it seemed like things were winding down, they kicked into overdrive, and Alex suddenly found himself in a race against time to save New York City.Though the book wins points for handling a multi-faceted mystery, I have a few small complaints. First, though Ambrose Congreve is a charming character who adds wonderful texture to the back story, he was given far too large a role. Pages that were spent describing his fondness for the finer things would have been better spent on Alex, whose role in the book was minuscule. Alex is recovering from severe heartbreak, which is a challenging aspect to add to an adventure yarn, but merely leaving him alone for the bulk of the book made me feel cheated. I like Alex! This would have been a good time to delve into who he really is, maybe have him get back to some hobbies he had let slide in his grief over his wife's death, but he merely played a bit part instead. Stoke's part was just about right, and I always find myself smiling when he's on the page. My other complaint is about the action. Though Bell can write a pretty good action scene, this book had a tendency to leave the action when it was hot and not return until the dust was settling, cheating us out of the juiciest bits of the story. These scenes are utterly vital in an adventure novel, and he's doing well up to a point, but the final quarter of the important, tense scenes needs work. Two scenes I sorely missed in their entirety were Jet's family dinner that ended badly and the final takedown with Stoke and one of the bad guys at the very end. Shame on the editors for not insisting on a few more pages there.There was a great deal of character development going on here...for Ambrose Congreve. The rest of the characters, especially the star, needed a little more attention. Bell is still relatively new at this, and he's taken on one heck of a story with this book, which was a smashing success. Its few imperfections mar the overall product very little. He's created a great cast of characters; so it's natural that I want to get to spend more time with some of them. Alex Hawke and friends are climbing the ranks, and they're high on my list of favorite adventure heroes."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but not as much asHawke: A Thriller. It is a roller coaster, page turner book for a long weekend or a sunny day on the beach.

A thriller doesn't have to be realistic to be good but it does have to have internal consistency. This one doesn't. Time after time, our hero(s) get caught in unescapable situations. You turn the page and they've escaped. No explanation, just escape. it's sort of like trouble, trouble, touble, oops miracle occurs, no more trouble. No explanation, just no more trouble.Next is the writing. Mr. Bell's bio says he was the former creative director of Young & Rubican. Presumably, he was a former art director, not a copywriter because his writing is awful. Other than our three heros, characters flit in and out and back in to the book with no explanation or depth. And the quality of the prose is astounding. I could fill page after page with examples like \\"Moon's sidekick, a nasty little horror-show featuring a bald head with greasy black locks, leaned casually against the sweaty bulkhead, whistling a pretty ditty.\\" I could go on but some readers may have sensitive stomachs.Finally, the details. Mr. Bell, Ile St. Louis is west of Ile de la Cite not south; Hong Kong Shanghai Bank is abbreviated HSBC, not HKSB; von Draxis's sloop cannot have three carbon masts because a sloop, by definition, only has one mast, etc. etc. etc.I'm generally against book burning but I'd make a exception in this case. I'd give negative stars if I could."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book is another roller-coaster thriller ride from Bell featuring his protagonist Alex Hawke, who again must contend with crazed madmen hell-bent on world conquest and destruction.

This is a fun read with tons of action as our espionage hero Hawke takes it to those smarmy French and gives them \\"what for\\". Have fun, I sure did! Nothing quite like a vicarious pounding on the French to make you feel better about your day.Bell's prose is taunt and experienced in this his third outing and his character development is becoming convincing and enjoyable. The pace and writing crackle with Bell's trademark electricity and he deftly ratchets up the tension and odds in each successive scene leading to the spectacular denouement.

It drove me nuts! I'm in my early thirties and started thinking \\"What have I done with my life?\\" Hawke is personal friends with the President of the US who utilizes Hawke and his team to figure out this French / China connection; Hawke is trusted enough to fly a brand new design of a US fighter jet where he is known by the US Navy from previous exploits; His friends are Vietnam Vets and senior Scotland Yard detectives; and he travels around in his personal yacht converted over to a personal battleship.

I will rememeber this book whenever he recommends something in future.The premise is imaginative, but the execution is formulaic and in dire need of editing. The characters are cliche, and a good portion of the action had me rolling my eyes. The way the characters behaved was so unrealistic; I tried to suspend my disbelief, hoping for a twist but none came. The tempo was uneven; I expect a thriller to be hard to put down, but that was not a problem here. There were some well-written action sequences, but there were a lot more scenes that were mired with long explanations as if the target audience were teenagers (and not very bright ones at that).There were a lot of situations with Hawke and Congreve (God help Britain if Scotland Yard detectives are this dim) that left me wondering how they ever survived. There were too many situations in which spies just boldly walked into situations and started interacting with the bad guys as if an unwelcome American or British intruder wouldn't be shot first and interrogated later (if he survived).If the author had grounded the fanciful plot with realistic action and believable characters, this novel would have been truly terrifying. As it is, it is mediocre and way too long.

He also has to prevent the plot from being fulfilled.At times the plot is a little far fetched, but it written in a style that prevents you from second guessing anything you are reading. Bell convinces us that anything is possible just by writing it down strongly. The story is always interesting and keeps you involved.Hawke is clearly the next generation James Bond. Hawke has fewer gadgets and focuses more on brute force and hard action tempered with high society intrigue. Which in my opinion makes it a much more enjoyable read. It is a great story written with great style."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Being a fan of Cussler, DuBrul, and Rollins are am always wary of a new adventure author. And I must say after the first few chapters of this book I was a little worried it would be terrible. But once you get used to the writing style (which is a little strange because the narrative takes the flavor of the current character), I was pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be a very good adventure read. I have just started reading SPY and can already tell that the editing is better.Keep it up Ted!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book was very much like a summer blockbuster action movie, both for the good and for the bad.There was very little character development, pretty much everybody seemed the same to me. I got kind of tired of the bullets flying right next to our heros without hitting them, or them jumping off the boat just as it explodes. Just like an action movie, this type of thing happens over and over.There seemed to be a lot of things just thrown into the plot just for random coolness value. For example, an antigravity train appears for one chapter, bringing our hero to safety and shielding him from bullets with its antigravity field. Then we never hear from the train again. Huh? I sort of expect that something that fundamentally breaks the laws of physics to play a more significant role and have some kind of backstory. There were other things like this but this was the worst.On the other hand, the action was pretty exciting and the plot was fast-moving. I got it for a long airplane ride, and it was perfect for that situation. When I got home, I finished the last few chapters. Reading it at home, where I'm less demanding of action and demand higher quality, the book felt pretty silly."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Far and away the best of the Alex Hawke series and by far the best thriller, period, this summer! The story just hums and the characters (good guys and especially bad guys) jump off the page and into your mind for good.I can't imagine a better way to while away the last days of summer...Highly recommended to say the least!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Ted Bell is a new author to me; my brother-in-la sent some other books in the series and I wanted to read them all and in order so I ordered this to fill a hole.

Still an excellent action/adventure read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I just finished the book (unabridged audio version)and found it to be an OK thriller provided you can overlook the major faults with the weapons and tactics used in many places in the book. There are more problems and plot holes with this book then there are with a book by Clive Cusler.For example the US military loans Hawke a preproduction model of the F35 to fly into a hostile foreign airfield to test the status of the now fly zone and how they will react to the US. First he's not really trained on the plane which even the author admits flies substantially different than less advanced fighters, but the bad guys (foreign nations) would just about do anything to get a working version of the plane which he had planned to land in their laps. Later in the book there is an insane (from a military standpoint) intent to use a super gun with 120+ mile range to cover the 20 mile wide Strait of Hormuz. Not only wouldn't it be appropriate to use it there the installation parameter and the relatively flat trajectory the gun installed where it's supposed to be would negate the effectiveness and range of this gun which was in the real world is intended to launch it's shell in a ballistic trajectory. Beyond the faults with the weapons there are other problems that our hero solves in impossible ways or in impossible time periods. The damage to the auxiliary engines latter in the book is just one glaring example.The book is like a James Bond movie. It works if you don't care about the details. This was the first and will be the only book I read by Ed Bell."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I heard Rush Limbaugh rave about Ted Bell's new thriller Tsar, and decided to get it. Thought I would get some interesting background about Alexander Hawke by first reading Pirate. Getting Pirate was first my Ted Bell mistake.

I hope the decision to buy Tsar was not also a mistake."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Looking for a fun, summer, beach read--I picked this one up. It started off pretty well. Very interesting plot line, a couple of interesting characters...but then it fell flat for me. I ended up dropping it about 3/4 of the way through. Too many cliches, characters that were caricatures and a lack of understanding by the author of the military, CIA, etc. Not terrible, but not that great either."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I was so excited to read this book after my mother gave it an excellent reivew. However, I did not enjoy it as much as she did. I found the prior Alex Hawke books were far better than this one. It seemed to drag on forever, trying to make it exciting. An ok read, but not recommended"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"The typical airplane 'thriller', but on the long side, andunfortunately not thrilling. The author hates government,hates the French and the Chinese, and has an overdevelopedsense of sadism. The tone is flip/cool but the author lackseven the modest talent of an Ian Fleming to pull it off. Thehero is infallible, independently rich, and invariablyattractive to beautiful but dangerous women, which onlyadds to the dullness. There are much better books out there.It is a sign of trouble when the gushing inside-the-coverreviews are from Booklist, Library Journal, a few paid sources,and the Shreveport Onion-Harvester Monthly. It is hard tobelieve this was ever on an NYT best-seller list, but that'swhat they claim."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"A big let down from previous two books. Bell uses unrealistic time and distance factors that move the action and people around the world at the pace of a modern vidio game. Operations and deployment factors are unrealistic to real world military and /or special operations capabilities.A great spin but he is nowhere in the class of Clancy."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is the second Ted Bell book I've read. The first was \\"Hawke.\\" Perhaps I should have cut my losses. Bell's writing and research have improved but \\"Pirate\\" is still burdened with hollow characters and jarring implausibilities. In providing fast-paced action and a lively plot, Bell has sacrificed all else.Bell's target audience would seem to be 18-year-old military enlistees with time on their hands. As for myself, I cannot suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a Bell novel."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book is a book written as a \\"formula\\" book. It has several outright inaccuracies as has been previously cited. Hawke was given the first F35 to buzz around in? Riiiightt! Come on that plane wouldn't have been allowed to be photographed much less flown by a rouge guy like Hawke. What was the point of the F35 Flight in any case?An anti gravity train? Is this Science Fiction?Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt! A pet does not show fangs and froth at the mouth.I believe several parts of this book were just stuck in for filler.To often someone shows up miraculously just at the right time to save the day.There is a great lack of creditability in this writing."},{"Title":"Angel Loves Nobody","review":"Sometimes it is amazing what books manage to fall through the cracks.Chances are you haven't heard of Angel Loves Nobody. I hadn't when I stumbled upon it at a book sale a few years back. But the description on the cover caught my eye - \\"In the locker rooms, in the parking lots, a brilliant student plans his ultimate protest: kill the faculty of Betsy Ross Junior High.\\"Considering the paranoia and cautious preventative measures taken after the tragedy of Columbine High School, as well as the number of school shootings since then, you would think a book of this nature would gain a small resurgence of attention. Considering the way the subject matter is handled by the author, the fact that it didn't borders on a tragedy all its own.Richard Miles is actually the pen name of Gerald Perrau-Saussine. Born in Tokyo and raised in Los Angeles, he spent his early years as a successful child actor (under the name of Peter of Richard Miles), appearing in films such asPassage to MarseilleandThe Red Pony, and TV shows includingMaverick (Television Favorites),Perry Mason, andThe Lone Ranger.In between his childhood acting and his adult career as an educator, Gerald Perrau-Saussine took a brief shot at being a novelist. In the short span of ten years he wrote poems, short stories, and three novels. Two of those novels, Angel Loves Nobody andThat Cold Day in the Park, won the Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award.That Cold Day In The Park] was later adapted into a film directed by Robert Altman. His third book,The Moon-Bathers, was briefly received.It is obvious when reading Angel Loves Nobody that Perrau-Saussine was inspired and informed by his experiences as both a student and teacher in the lower-class educational system. He spends an equal amount of time with both sides, exploring not only the origins of their motivation, but in some instances, the frailties of their beliefs.In the book, Tim Nielson is the new art teacher at Betsy Ross Junior High, a ghetto school with a poor reputation. Mostly poor minority students, many of the kids are troubled youth, almost as convinced of their lack of a future as the bitter and jaded teaching staff. He's picked a bad time to start his new career, however. One of the school's most brilliant yet troubled students, Angel Martine, has found a focus for both his intelligence and his inner rage. He has figured out a way to kill the entire staff of Betsy Ross Junior High and get away with it, and has enlisted the entire student body as foot soldiers in his deadly vision. But Angel's plan is as intricate and delicate as the lives and relationships of those involved. As \\"Zero Hour\\" grows near, the reality of the plan takes its toll, exposing many students to hidden emotions and desires they had previously been ignorant of.This is a long way from The Cross and the Switchblade. None of the characters are simple plot devices or paper thin stereotypes. Many of the troubled teens are dealing with the harsh realities of inner-city life, compounded by indifferent and even hostile home environments (the existence of incestuous abuse and peer rape is examined on more than one occasion). As for the teachers, their indifference and occasionally hostile behavior is not due to overt malice, but to the personal demons they face in their own lives.One of the most interesting dynamics in the story is the relationship between Angel and Tim. These two characters barely communicate until the book's climax, but these two intelligent people from different worlds see something in each other. What they see evolves with the story, and their reactions actually manage to influence each other's opinions. These are complex characters battling complex emotions, and their inner struggles spill effortlessly onto the page. Perrau-Saussine handles the myriad of characters with this level of detail and intensity, continuously reminding the reader that these are real people with real problems, the real solutions to which never come easy.Angel Loves Nobody is as relevant today as it was in 1967, and is in desperate need of reprinting. Writing of this caliber, and this heartfelt, should never fade with time."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"My school offers a full-year course in AP Biology. I joined halfway through, in Feburary, and had only three months of class. With diligent study of this text, I was able to pull off a 5 on the AP test, without taking over half the class. This is an excellent resource and I would recommend it to anyone who will be taking the AP test this fall."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"I used three AP Biology test prep books this year, and this one was by far the best. It not only helped me prepare for the AP test, but it was great for studying for tests during the year. It contained very detailed reviews of the various subject areas of AP Biology, many practice questions on each subject, and four full sample tests, which I thought were very helpful in preparing for the AP test. The book's greatest strength is the large number of practice questions. Plus, if your teacher skips over a certain section of the course, the summaries are detailed enough that a careful reading is nearly as good as learning the material in class. This book is probably best used as a resource throughout the year, and not for a last-minute cram aid. My only complaint is that some of the test questions were on topics that the AP test would never ask about (like &quot;The only living monotremes are...&quot;), and some of the reviews gave some unnecessary details. Still, this is the best AP Biology test prep book I have found."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"I looked at a lot of AP review books, and found that the CliffsAP Biology one was much better. Barron's had review questions that were way too picky, and a substantial amount of the information given in this review manual is not going to be on the test. The questions were way too picky. Most of the book consisted of practice tests, and that was not what I was looking for. CliffsAP Biology had more review and less tests. I actually bought this book and then returned it. I just took this test in May, and I am pretty sure that I got a 5 on it, thanks to Cliffs. Only buy this book if you want practice questions."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"I brought this book and it's terrible. I took the 2001 AP and I am 100% sure I got a 5, even though I didn't get the results yet. I just know bio cold. I could have written a much better book than this (now there's an idea...) The authors talk about topics that are not important at all and do a 7th grade level review of the important topics. I would go with the Cliff's book or Barron's College Review Series in Biology if you want a review book. The best advise I can give is to read the textbook, and DO NOT waste any money on this book. This book is very poorly written."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"This book was basically all I used to prepare for the AP Biology exam--my school didn't offer the course, so I did an independant study, along with classes for six other APs. The book did a great job condensing all of the information and making it quite understandable. If that was all I was considering, I would have given the book five stars. However, when I took the AP Biology Exam in May 2003, one of the four free response questions dealt entirely with the chi-square statistical test--something not even MENTIONED in this book. Although I had done quite a few practice tests and used websites that had preparation for this exam, the chi-square test was never even remotedly mentioned in this book or elsewhere. While this book claims to list all of the possible topics covered on the test, be careful, as you could be in the same place as me, relying solely on this book to prepare for the exam. Just know that this book DOES NOT cover all testable material. On a better note, this book did help me pass this test, I just wasn't able to achieve that &quot;5&quot; I'd been hoping for--moral of this story, it's a great book, buy it, study it, prepare with it--just don't use it as your sole source of knowledge for the exam preparation."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"This book's not too bad..I used it to study for the AP Bio Test along with a careful read of the textbook (we used Campbell's textbook) and a few other textbooks like Purves and Orians.. and I pulled off a 5. However, I didn't think the material was written in a clear manner. I looked at the Cliffs version, too, and I think that one's much better, materialwise. The Barron's seem to be much more better at the hard test question-making."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"This is NOT a good review book. I teach AP Biology and I can tell you that this book creates confusion. The way in which it was written is disjointed and cumbersome. It goes into WAY too much detail. In a way, the Barron's book reteaches... but doesn't review. I bought this book when I took AP Biology 11 years ago, I hated it it then and when I started teaching AP Biology I bought the new version. IT WAS THE SAME DANG BOOK!!!!!Although biology has changed much in 11 years this book was the same long-winded read! I use it ONLY as a source of practice tests. If you want to read it, go to the library.... don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"I found that while this book did help in some aspects, it could have been a lot better. The reviews are, frankly, awful. They are dry and difficult to understand. Although the number of practice tests is great, the questions themselves were much harder than the ones on the actual test. (I usually got a three or a low four on the practice test, but I got a five on the actual test.) If you do use it, I would reccommend using it with a book that explains the concepts well, like the Cliff Notes version. I used Cliff's and this one, and they balanced each other out well, since the questions in Cliff's tended to be too easy."},{"Title":"Ap Biology: Advanced Placement Test in Biology (5th ed)","review":"I got this book because it looked/seemed to be an excellent resource.

He contends that the French Enlightenment thinkers tried unsuccessfully to distance themselves from the religious mileaux from which they came. Looking back from a vantage point nearly 150 years later, it is clear that while their ideas were advanced, the &quot;utopia&quot; they sought to establish was closer to the thinkers of the Reformation period 300 years earlier than to thinkers of the latter 19th and early 20th centuries. Any serious student of this period should at least scan this author's work as all subsequent scholarship has had to stake a stand for or against his position - thus to understand scholarship in the past 20 years - read this book."},{"Title":"The heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers (Yale paperbounds)","review":"I was prompted to write this review to give some balance to what a previous review stated. I encountered this book, for the first time, as an undergraduate in a history course. I was forever grateful to the professor for requiring its reading, and grateful to the author for his insightful and important work. I think this book should be mandatory reading in any history course emcompassing the period, and any course that looks to understand the genesis of the ideologies that permeate our period. I think the previous reviewer was very incorrect in her understanding of the issues and facts brought out by the book. I think the professor was serving his class, and profession, well by requiring the book. The book gives indispensable insights into the mind, and characters of the period. The thinking of that period still heavily influences contemporary American, European, and now global, political and social thought. Most readers will be very gratified having read the book, to see where their own thinking has been influenced and formed. The book is both scholarly and readable. There are great insights made that should not me be missed."},{"Title":"The heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers (Yale paperbounds)","review":"Some of the reviewers here characterize this work as shallow, rambling, self-contradictory, and the product of a lost soul. Nothing could be further from the truth. Carl Becker's essay is a wonderful addition to the historical analysis of our culture, our changing perspectives in it, and of our evolving mindsets. I believe it should be required reading of any college student, if only to broaden their horizons and step outside the parochial and into the universal."},{"Title":"The heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers (Yale paperbounds)","review":"I certainly agree with the favorable review above. Having read Becker's work at Vanderbilt during my undergraduate years, I pulled it out the other day and traveled its pages with my underlining of 40 years ago. It is still the best work I have ever read that points to the fundamental thinkers that changed the world by sparking the 18th century revolutionary notion of the devine rights of mankind, the notion of societial freedom as the basis for productive and moral living and the notion, which is ultimately correct, that governments are evil at their very core and, as such, should be minimially powered and minimally intrusive upon citizens. The work outlines the philosophic roots of the thinking of the founders of the United States of America and the since evolved thinking of the governments of England and France. It was by these viens of thinking that the notions of representative government by election of the populace, inalienable rights, the notion of \\"human rights\\" and \\"civil rights\\" themselves were born. I am at a loss to understand how any right thinking individual could see the work as otherwise motivated--however many in our world, communities, and especially in our academic ivory towers of today have lost reason and faith in simple truth in favor of caretaker world societies and rank sensualism and materialism. They run from the notion that our rights have origin in a heavenly charter that comes from a supreme being. It is that frightened character that we so often see today snarling out of bitter university perpetuants who see life and society as unjust and unfair because their \\"genius\\" is not appreciated and awarded laurels by the whole of our society. We had these bitter little minds in schools that I attended 50 years ago, and they are still with us--and flourishing. Think for yourself--read this book. It will give you insight that you may not find elsewhere. ----JCH"},{"Title":"The heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers (Yale paperbounds)","review":"I am convinced of the books thesis \\"the underlying preconceptions of eighteenth century thought were still...essentially the same as those of the thirteenth century.\\" However, I do not find this thesis fulfilled throughout the three lectures collected in this text. 1) The so-called \\"heavenly city\\" of St. Augustine (from where the title of the book is derived) is never quoted, 2) St Thomas who is quoted once, is used as a convenient metonym for all that is representative of 13th century scholastic philosophy. However, even this allusion to St. Thomas,the author cautions us that his writings appear to the modern \\"us\\" as \\"non-sensical rigmaroles\\" and his arguments are \\"unintelligible\\" which we can never \\"meet its arguments on their own ground.\\"(11 )Beckers assumption is that each period of time follows the a climate of opinion \\"I am limited to the preconceptions of my age\\", which Becker carefully defines our own through the use of entropic physics. 3) What follows from this, is a typical early 20th century, historian craft elitism in such statements as \\"no serious scholar would now postulate the existence of God....No respectable historian any longer harbor ulterior motives...of a transcendent interpretation....would straightaway lose his reputation....\\"How does one prove the thesis that \\"philosophes have a debt to medieval thought without being aware of it.\\"(30) when the latter period is \\"unintelligible\\" and history is always \\"an imaginative reconstruction of vanished events....\\" Another 13th century scholastic philosopher who Becker forgets, Dun Scotus once argued \\"how can we define the relationship between terms if one of the relata is unknown?\\"Maybe this book deserves to be read alongside Gilson and other apologists for Aquinas and Medieval Scholasticism of the 1930s and 40s, although, even this honor, is probably unmerited since Medieval Scholasticism is absent from the entire text. Rather, we receive an unhistorical work filled with artful analogies and resemblances between the general medieval world view and the enlightenment world view. His argument in general follows this formula: General Christian ritual, belief, X (without any sources referenced), was substituted with Y in the 18th-century. So, \\"posterity is for philosopher what the other world is for the religious.\\" \\"For the worship of God, Diderot has substituted posterity.\\" \\"for the love of god, they substituted love of humanity\\" \\"celestial heaven...to be rebuilt on earth\\" etcI think my cynical side, agrees with another reviewer here, that this work fails as \\"proper' history, with its internal contradictions and superficial cursory comparisons between the two ages. Clearly, the judgement of posterity for a work such as this, is \\"let us laugh at him.\\"(40)"},{"Title":"The heavenly city of the eighteenth-century philosophers (Yale paperbounds)","review":"Carl Becker once unknown to me became the bane of an entire class of students as we explored in horrifying depth how Becker writes about the 18th and 19th centuries. In this book you are subjected to a historian who tries to catalogue philosophy and the philosophers of the 18th century in a poor blend of factual history and intepreted philosophy. The book is laced with so much cynicism that it becomes hard to scry which sections Becker stands behind and which he pokes fun at. After the unfortunate ordeal of reading this book you will see that Becker had a loss of faith at some point in his life and feels that everything around him is now meaningless, therefore he turns to the past to seek new meaning and redemption of his now useless life. What we find instead is a convoluted text which seems to be hailed as wonderful by religious zealots for its admonishments of science, philosophy, and history as empty in the grand scheme of the world. He contradicts himself so often that only after you pore over his text can you even decide what he supports. My opinion: skip the book and bash your head into the wall.

Corbett isn't satisfied to say, \\"I shot the man-eater;\\" he must explain why that tiger's old paw injury forced her to substitute humans for her natural prey. And as you go on in the book, you begin to sense that Corbett is not a hunter who kills to bolster an inadequate ego; rather, his great joy springs from his natural affinity and long years of association with tigers, leopards, and the other denizens of the jungle.It's probably worth knowing that in his later years, as the wilds of India became overrun with people, he turned to photo safaris; he wished to share his experiences of viewing these animals in their native habitat with the entire world, without doing any harm. If you, then, can sympathize with such a perspective, I wholly recommend this book; you'll come away with a new fascination with the great creatures we share our planet with."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"It's refreshing to read the memoirs of someone who was so famous yet so humble. He killed more than a dozen of the worst man-eating leopards and tigers in India in the early part of last century but never beats his chest or commits an unethical act. He was a true hunter and outdoorsman of the highest order and his stories reflect that.You won't get any fluff or exaggeration with Jim Corbett. He was the REAL DEAL and his chess matches against these infamous man-eaters are legendary. From the 50 mile roadmarches to the 2 day stakeouts to the high suspense tracking of wounded killers, this man was tough as nails.This book is one of his best and a must for any hunting/adventure collection."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was one of eight children of a colonial postmaster stationed in the foothills of the Himalaya in India. He was born in 1875 and started hunting when he was eight years old. Between 1907 and 1938, he hunted a number of &quot;man eating&quot; tigers and leopards-including the Champawat Man Eater, which was responsible for over 400 deaths, and the the Rudraprayag Leopard, which was rumored to have been responsible for over 125 deaths. When a new man eater began to wreak havoc, the village people called on &quot;Carpet Sahib&quot; for help. In this book, which was first published in 1944, Corbett tells ten exciting and enlightening stories that keep the reader turning pages to see how they turn out. Sometimes the reader begins to wonder whether Corbett will get the tiger or the tiger will get him. Listen to Corbett tell of his meeting with the Chowgarh Tigress who killed at least 64 people and maybe twice that...&quot;As I stepped clear of the giant slate, I looked behind me over my right shoulder and--looked straight into the tigress' face. I would like you to have a clear picture of the situation. Her fore paws were stretched out and her hind legs were well tucked under her. Her head, which was raised a few inches off her paws, was eight feet from me. On her face was a smile, similar to that one sees on the face of a dog welcoming his master home after a long absence.&quot;Along the way through his stories, Corbett displays amazing understanding of jungle lore and insights into the animal that probably most deserves the title &quot;King of Beasts.&quot; He also explains what causes his prey to begin preying on people. Corbett obviously admired his quarry and considered the &quot;tiger a gentleman.&quot; Later in life, Colonel Corbett gave up the rifle for a camera and focused his efforts on conservation. He was instrumental in creating India's first national park, Hailey Park, that has since been renamed in his honor. This is a delightful book by a modest teller of great true-life stories that will appeal to those interested in nature, life in colonial India, hunting or adventure."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Corbett's writing is a rare thing. It is spare and exact as any literary reader could want, and at the same time as exciting as any adventure novel---and every word is fact.Corbett was a man of decency, honor and humanity. To read his writing is to see into his soul, and to see what man can be, yet seldom is. In this age of braggadocio and bluster it is good to remind oneself that men can be more. Few of us have such dangerous work as did Corbett, but we may all choose to live as decently and honorably and, most of all, humbly.Corbett was also an ecologist, biologist and lover of nature, as odd as that may seem for a big game hunter. He both loved and respected the tigers he killed, and did much to stop their destruction. Too often, environmentalists know nothing of what they seek to preserve. Corbett knew the forests of India, the fauna and flora both."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Corbett was the finest hunter of man-eating felines ever to walk the planet. He could tell more from a bent blade of grass and some misplaced dew, than most people could if they read a book. Discover why he thinks of a tiger as a large-hearted gentleman. He was a expert naturalist as well, knowing all of the animl calls and signs in the jungle. Go with him as he creeps within 12 ft. of the Thak man-eater, who was asleep (imagine the skill needed to stalk within 12 ft of a tiger! ). Discover the fear as he faces his 1st man-eater. Corbett killed many tigers and leopards, but he wasn't blood thirsty of kill crazed, he did it so people would not be killed. Corbett had everything you could have wanted in a hunter, intelligence, skills, and above all absolute confidence is his ability. Why else would he stalk tigers who had killed 100's of people in the jungle alone, and come out the victor?"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book is about man-eating tigers in India and the man who hunted them. Jim Corbett was born in India, the son of a British colonial postmaster in the foothills of the Himalayas. As a boy, Corbett spent most of his time wandering in the jungle, and became not only an expert on tigers, but on all of the jungle animals and birds.When there was a man-eating tiger about, the government officials would always ask Corbett to track down and kill the man-eater (The tigers had HUNDREDS of victims!). It was a very dangerous business, and Corbett was almost killed many times. He would sit up all night over a human kill, waiting for the man-eater to come back. This book is a very suspenseful, exciting page-turner and a bloody good read!--Daniel Smith, 5th grade homeschooler"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I had read and heard of ahimsa (loosely translated as non-violence) as preached and practised by Gandhi. I am also familiar with the much wider concept of ahimsa one finds in Hindu philosophy : a state of mind where you cease to differentiate your self from any other being. I had also read about yogis and mystics who had actually reached such a state of mind. Vedanta textbooks say that knowledge (of the ultimate reality) drives away fear. But in all these readings I was only vaguely aware of the inherent link between ahimsa and fearlessness until I chanced upon \\"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\\". How does Corbett overcome fear? Is it just a matter of cold reason? Is it just his intimate knowledge of the terrain, the knowledge of the ways of man eaters, his ability to understand and imitate the language of most of the animals that were to be found in Kumaon ? As a ten year old boy he had his first trophy when he first wounded and then stalked and finished off a full grown leopard. As a middle aged man, during an epidemic outbreak of cholera in Mokamah, where he worked as a railway contractor, he nursed back to life a cholera victim left abandoned by fellow travellers. His deep sympathy and love for those simple folk among whom he lived and worked is inseparable from the courage he showed when called upon to stand by them; one feeds on the other. These Kumaon stories are replete with instances where the victim's own folk had panicked on seeing (or even sensing) a man-eater , leaving the poor victim alone. In one instance a villager simply shut his door when he received no reply from his wife who had, a little while earlier, stepped out of her hut to relieve herself. Ironically enough most of the victims of the Kumaon \\"man-eaters\\" happened to be women. This should not come as a surprise because most of the work in fields or firewood collecting is done by the women. It is significant that the only instance of courage in the face of danger is due to a young woman who ran, shouting and brandishing her sickle, after! the tiger which was carrying off her sister. When the predator turned its attention on its pursuer she managed to run back to safety, but the shock left her completely speechless for about a year. About a year later Corbett managed to kill the tiger and on returning with the kill laid it first at her door step; when she ran out to inform the rest of the villagers she was seen shouting at the top of her voice! Whole villages were abandoned when a man eater was reported in the area; people feared to step beyond their courtyard even to relieve themselves so that these villages soon turned filthy and unhygenic. Against this backdrop of terror, which paralysed the life of villages for miles around, Corbett realized the need to instill courage in the hearts of men and help them get back to normal life; often he would stand guard as the villagers harvested their fields or collected water from nearby streams. The next step is to track down the man-eater and this requires immense hard work - not just skill and courage - and could take months. What sustains a shikari in such circumstances ? Surely not the prize money; one of the preconditions that he sets before the Government is that the prize money be withdrawn. Reading these stories one cannot help feeling that it is something much more than the mere thrill and adventure in the act involved, that motivates Corbett. And finally the act of killing and the words that describe it never betray a sense of ill will or hatred towards the prey; what else could be ahimsa even in the act of killing itself. Such a state of mind is the mind of a yogi - at once fearless and non violent."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"There was no one like Jim Corbett. A modest, unpretentious man who respected not only the denizens of the jungle, but the people of India as well (perhaps not very common among Englishmen in those days). Bravery without braggadocio. Way better than Capstick!Young boys, who want to grow up to be men, will find no better role model than Jim Corbett."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was likely the greatest hunter of man eating cats that ever lived, anywhere. He was also a great naturalist and fortunately for us an absolutely splendid writer of his observations and feelings. His stories of the hunts, the hills, the people are mesmerizing and touching. A true master of the hunt and of the pen. Having read books by numerous hunters from around the world, I can say without any hesitancy that Col. Jim Corbett is without contest the greatest hunter of big game that ever lived to tell about it.\\\\The very best reading of its kind. Period."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Man eaters of Kumaon is a fantastic book about hunting Royal Bengal tigers in the Indian Himilaya. The author describes his thrilling hunts with great descriptive passages and when he hunts, he does so with great care and passion. In fact he shot the Pipil Pani tiger because he was eating sheep, goats, and other small domestic animals. He shot the Bachelor of Powlghar because he had attacked one of his freinds. The bachelor of Powlghar was recorded as being one of the largest Bengal tigers ever, he was ten foot seven inches over curves!I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the great outdoor and and likes tigers."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett brings you into the jungle with him as he stalks a creature capable of picking up a water buffalo and carrying it away- with its teeth!

He loved being in the jungle and observing everything around him - this is what made him such a great hunter in the first place. Some readers might wonder how somebody who loves nature can go tiger hunting. In fact, Corbett only hunted tigers or leopards who had turned man-eater, in order to protect human life. In doing so, he inevitably killed the wrong animal on occasions (something he himself acknowledged). We should also see beyond our own day and age: in Corbett's day, tigers were still extremely common in India, and the environmental movement barely existed, and yet he was one of the first to warn of the threat to tigers, becoming, without doubt, a pioneer for their preservation.Unlike Capstick, his writing is infused with calm: he does not focus on blood and guts, but explains his tactics and describes physical scenes in painstaking detail, as if to another hunter. To me, this makes his books all the more convincing. His hunting success is built on patience and a lifetime of observing jungle behaviour, not bravado. These are not macho books, although Corbett clearly must have had nerves of steel.My only criticism of this book is the quality of the proof-reading. The number of typos is frustrating to the point that it sometimes gets in the way of enjoying the book. Jim Corbett's writing suggests he was a meticulous man, so it's a pity the publishers have let him down on this."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"While first published quite a while back, that's done nothing to dispel the fear and horror of being eaten by a wild animal. Gentleman Jim Corbett, as he's been called, gives you his firsthand accounts of finding and killing man-eating tigers and leopards in India. While the author actually down-plays his own role in ending the deprivations of these much-to-be-feared killers, the animals will still give you cold chills when you realize that all too often the hunter becomes the hunted. The intelligence and thought processes of the killers will stop all scoffing that they're just \\"\\"beautiful animals\\", as they backtrack, lie in wait, and set up ambushes of their own on any unwary passers-by. The author himself admits that he loves them for the craft and wisdom that they display, along with his frank admiration for them as the top of the food chain. Definitely highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Probably the best big game hunting book ever written. Will keep you on the edge of your seat and I do not recommend reading it while camping in the woods (especially if the woods happen to be in India). Corbett describes stalking man-eating tigers and often they stalk him. These are not made-up stories nor are they self justifying. Corbett ONLY hunted tigers that the local population asked him to, after dozens or sometimes hundreds of people had been killed. His descriptions are beautiful and picture an era (India in 1900-1930) that has long since gone. I have read it many times, the first when I was about 11 years old."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book was written by not only a very brave man but a man that possessed great character and class.

And it is a very very worthy buy. With this, the reader gets a very humble and genteel but honest view of a bygone time and era on the far side of the globe through understanding western eyes. This man is a legend and he should be more widely read!Understandably loved by the few who came in touch with him, he stands in stark contrast to the cruel political oppressors who did exist or whom allegedly existed in modern history's attempts to demonize the colonial times.A fantastic window into some unique and underread history, that is both compelling and well written, making an easy and enjoyable read that offers both insight and excitement."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This was one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read. Corbett is not as dry as other British authors of the time period and he does an outstanding job of drawing you into the story. As he explains the terrain and circumstances surrounding his hunts you can almost picture the ground as it was and the locations of each character. His descriptions of actually killing the Man-Eaters are somewhat understated which adds a great deal to the respect that I have for this author. He is not trying to tell everyone about how great he is or shock them with mental images of gore; he is simply telling the story of what happened.Unlike most British colonists of the day, Corbett seems to have a great deal of respect and care for the local people he came in contact with during his hunts. On many occasions he shows great empathy for the locals and he always talks about the effect that the Man-Eater is having on the local populace. Because he was born and raised in India, he is much more a part of the area's culture than many of the British writers of Africa were. He was not just an adventurer passing through or doing a job and leaving; he was a local who knew the area and knew the people. Perhaps his connection to the people explains his extraordinary courage and his devotion to stopping the Man-Eaters of Kumaon. He does not display the elitism often seen in British authors of this time period.I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone. It is of particular interest to outdoorsmen, historians, and those who are interested in the local history of Eastern India."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This was a great book to read. Very well written in my opinion, and with an unexpected viewpoint in regard to these big man-eaters. I was expecting a lot of &#34;great white hunter&#34; mentality, a lot of &#34;destroy the pest&#34;, but in reading this book I caught quite a few signs of respect for these powerful creatures and a desire to understand why they turned toward bipedal sustenance. It was surprising to see how many of these man-eaters had been injured and crippled by other hunters before turning to humans for a food source.After reading this book I headed over to Zoo Atlanta and sat down in front of the tiger exhibit for a good half hour. Fascinating animals."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Man-eaters of Kumaon is a memoir by Jim Corbett of his hunting years in India. Man-eaters, both tigers and leopards, were not a rare occurrence in the region of Kumaon and he was asked several times to rid the country-side of these threats to both humans and livestock. His exploits took place in a different time and place. Some of his actions might be condemned as ruthless and inhumane now in a time of conservation and threats of extinction to both of the big cats found in India. But without him, many more people would have died.Corbett's narration of his exploits is straight forward and clear. He does not hate his prey, and he does admire them. He also understands them as few men have. Whether one thinks of him as a hero or a villain, his stamina and strength, both of will and body, seem amazing to modern readers. Staying in a machan (a platform in a tree sometimes consisting only of ropes tied together) at times for twelve hours or more is certainly beyond my abilities or even willingness.Hunting these cats was very dangerous, especially when one knows that they had killed dozens of people. Under the circumstances they had lost their fear of humans. And they certainly knew the territory better than Corbett did. His adventures as told in this book are interesting, historical, and are told in a calm and humble way. To the villagers whose lives were spent in fear, his ability to find and kill these animals was met with gratitude. Times may have changed, but it is still interesting to read about the courage and abilities of men such as Jim Corbett."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was a great sportsman, a humanitarian who defended helpless villagers from dangerous predators, and a superb writer. I have little to add to all the 5-star reviews - I wish I could have given the book 6 stars.

I was surprised to find that first additions are still available today through Amazon. I found that reading these tales once again was as enjoyable and exciting as they were to me the first time. They are the remarkable and true accounts of Corbett's hunts for certain man eating cats in the hill country of northern India at the turn of the century. Jim Corbett was a British man who grew up in Naini Tal in the Kumaon district and who often acted as a public servant. His skills as a tracker and baiter were much sought after to eliminate animals who had turned to humans as a source of food. His accounts are not glossed with unnecessary drama, but are straight forward descriptions of the actual day to day work that was required to find and kill these predators. Jim is humble and respectful of his quarry and never places any blame for their behaviour on the Tigers and Leopards themselves. He explains how each cat came to depend on humans for survival. He also sympathizes with the local populations and conveys quite clearly the superstition and terror these animals caused these almost defenseless people. This book is a rare glimpse into a time past, written by the man who's name was given to India's first wildlife conservation park. He is a legendary character even to this day in northern India and these are some of the best hunting stories available."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book, read first when I was 14 years old, and since added to my adult library, read and re-read again, has stayed with me like so very few other books in my life.I wont over-egg the review - Corbett wouldn't have liked that kind of lionising (good pun!) and he doesn't need it.

There is a lot of excitement in the pursuit of alleged man-eaters. However, it is not merely as a slayer of man-eaters that Corbett was famous. Very much a man of his times, he also hunted purely for sport.The stories of the Bachelor of Powalgarh and the Pipal Pani tiger, which were shot because they were particularly fine trophies, are very poignant. An older edition of 'Man-Eaters of Kumaon', which is in my possession, has a picture of the Bachelor lying dead with the proud hunter standing over it. The half-open eyes of the immense male tiger, staring in death, make me wonder about Corbett's real attitude towards wildlife. Contrary to popular belief, Corbett never gave up hunting for the camera like other, less famous men did in his own lifetime. He shot his last tiger when he was over 70 and became the director of a safari hunting company in Kenya when he left India after 1947 (at the age of 72).Corbett's book is valuable for the historical reason that it describes a richness of wildlife which largely disappeared in his own lifetime. However, his observations about wildlife are largely anecdotal and through the sights of a rifle.As George Bernard Shaw said, when a man wants to murder a tiger, he calls it sport; when the tiger wants to murder him, he calls it ferocity. The Champawat Tigress was responsible for over 400 human deaths ... but wildlife historian Mahesh Rangarajan estimates that around 80,000 tigers were killed in India alone by various methods such as shooting, poisoning, and even by the burning of areas of forests known to contain cubs, between 1875 and 1925! The extent of destruction of the tiger's legitimate prey in the same period can only be imagined. The British and Indian aristocracy did most of the tiger shooting, but the native villagers were mainly responsible for the poaching of the tigers' prey, and consequently suffered the depredations of the big cats which were deprived of their natural food supply. It has been argued convincingly in recent times that prey scarcity, more than anything else, produces man-eaters.While Corbett half-heartedly argues the tigers' case (calling them 'gentlemen'), his horrifying descriptions of man-eaters wipe out any vestiges of sympathy that one might have for the tigers. Corbett's charming portrayal of idyllic village life, or of \\"humble\\" villagers, all virtue and no vice, should certainly be taken with a pinch of salt. It is invariably humans who bring calamity on themselves by destroying the balance of nature."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I really appreciate the style of writing of Corbett - the explanations are flawless and detailed with all minuteness to bind the readers' attention. But the sad fact is Jim Corbett has killed many tigers/leopards who were not even man-eaters. I can never imagine killing an animal for sport - who coined this word \\"sport\\" for killing one of God's most wonderful creation - how can taking life of some innocent creature be a sport. It is tragic to see the picture of Bachelor of Powelgarh dead by a single idiotic bullet - God must have flawed in creating human beings for it destroyed his creation. The pipal-pani tiger who did not even kill a single human being - I wonder what explanation Jim will give for this \\"prize\\". Facts are often lost behind headlines and Jim Corbett is hailed as one of the greatest tiger conservationists but only untold-history and the fallen heroes of nature (those innocent creatures that were killed mercilessly) are the true testament of the reality."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"The book is about as insightful as reading an Englishman's take on tea. I found it to be laborious and bloated, almost to the point of self idiocy for the hunter, who was nothing but a murdering colonialist who had everything carried for him by Punjabi jungle slaves and used large caliber hunting rifles.If you really want to hunt \\"man eaters\\", then you track into the wild alone with your own gear and you use a spear or other primitive weapon. Some blathering and arrogant Englishman who shoots a defenseless beast with a 50 caliber long range rifle is hardly \\"brave\\".

Entire villages were abandoned and literally hundreds of human beings found out they weren't at the top of the food chain. In the \\"Man Eaters of Kumaon\\", hunter jim Corbett describes in vivid and suspensful detail his hunt for tigers in Northeast India.Corbett describes the perilous beauty of the jungle clad hills in the shadow of Nepal's majestic summits. He also masterfully paints an image of terror and suspense as he faces off against tigers, leopards, a bear, and a venomous snake. Even as he pursues his prey, he often comes close to having the tables turned on him. He also presents readers with a glimpse of the cultural spectacle and harsh life-or death realities in India under the Raj.Corbett doesn't come across as very prideful. In fact, he even respects the animals he's hunting and often notes injuries or situations that likely caused them to hunt humans. I will warn potential readers that there are several rather gruesome scenes ranging from finding dead or injured humans to some of the hunting itself. However, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in adventure, hunting, or both.

Colonel Jim Corbett wrote this book that is full of adventure, suspense and life of a man-eating tiger. One notorious tigress killed 436 people! While two other tigers killed almost 100 people. I love this book. It tells why tigers turn man-eater and has a natural history touch it. Colonel Corbett was a man who stopped the terror of so many man-eaters in his beloved India. In addition to his man-eater hunting, he tried to save the wild Bengal tiger from extinction. If you love adventure, man-eaters and/or hunting then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"If you love outdoors, hunting and conservation. This a must read. Corbett has the way with words, he can take you to the exact spots of each and every one of his hunts. The beautiful narration brings back to life the adventures and makes you feel as though you are walking right behind him all through it. This never gets old.. every time I read it, it feels just fresh.Excellent read!!!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I can't speak highly enough about the book. His discription of his journeys made you feel as if you with right there with he and his men. If you like the outdoors and adventure, you simply must read this classic."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett put together his experiences in the forests of the Himalayan foothills. The details are truly amazing. It does also provide a great ammount of details about wildlife. In a nutshell an epic collection. Does not get any better than this."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I got this book under very odd circumstances my friend had a box full of old books and offered me a copy of Jim Corbett's wonderful novel. I toke it home and never touched it for over 2 years until my father found it my room and to both his and my surprised exclaimed this was his favourite novel when he was young. I read the book with no idiea or knowledge of hunting infact iam mainly against hunting espcially endangered species such as tigers. That night i was completely swept away in the land of India the novel is so well detailed and so descriptive you feel you are there with Corbett in the indian jungle. Corbett was a gentleman and a fantastic hunter though he was no arrogant man who relished in bloodshed. He respected these creatures and merely killed when no alternative was available and the animals had already become maneaters. The suspense is unnerving when you read that the tiger is somewhere close at hand and Corbett is sat in the pitch dark listening for his prey and you almost want to shout at Jim to look out! The charm of these books is the pure adventure and world the author creates and somehow knowing it's all true gives it even more thrills. Read this book it is a wonderful novel and each story has it's appeal this man was a noble gentleman who weaves his stories into something charming and exciting! No need to be a hunting fan to enjoy this great book simply have a love for adventure and different cultures for Corbett pays as much attention to the lands and people as his own ventures!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and since then it has been read by my children, my wife, and most of my extended family. Most people return the book with an expression of joy and wonder saying &quot;Wow, did all of that really happen?&quot; Corbett instilled in me my love for the out of doors and hunting. I only regret that the India of Jim Corbett is rapidly disappearing.Anyone of any age who loves stories of animals and nature spiced with the suspense of a good mystery will love this book."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I first read this book when I was about 12 years old.

Only Capstick comes close to these hunting stories."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"One of the most gripping books I have ever read. After reading the book one can understand what made Jim Corbett the greatest hunters of all time. The book very well shows the respect Jim Corbett had for the man eaters."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Rivaled only by the writings of Peter Capstick, Corbett brings the reader with him to the extent that you too feel the wet grass, and smell the tiger behind you...."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"The book that opened up the great adventure of reading for me......At about age 13 I happened on this book in my grandmothers home...And this was the perfect book to accomplish that awakening....Descriptive, exciting, realistic and some insight into India of the period....Jim Corbett painted pictures with his words.....I savored reading it again....."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book, along with Col.

They belong on the shelves of every sportsman."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I have read many jungle story. This one is my favorit. When I start read it, I cannot put it down. Every page is full of excitement.It is just amazing that a man can experience all these close encounters with man-eater in one life time. With auther's explianation of the environment, I could almost imagine myself stalking the tiger in India jungle in 1920. Great book written by a great man. What more do I have to say.If you like jungle book, try this one. I am sure you will like it."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"These reviews are very good, except for a factual error. Corbett was not fearless. That's what made his adventures so remarkable. Remarkable deeds done by a fearless man are even more exceptional when a man who must control his fear to do what needs to be done. In a couple of stories, Corbett mentions that he had to leave the field for periods of time due to the strain of the hunt. He was able to master his fear.These are great stories for all ages. I first read them when I was in elementary school, and have never forgotten them."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"After reading this book I have so much respect for Jim Corbett. He truly was a gentleman and a big-hearted at that. He had so much respect for the native people he lived with. Throughout his stories he gives credits for others and never to himself. Although he hunted all alone and on foot, he never claimed himself to be the \\"Greate white hunter\\". The stories are so interesting, feels like you are with him all the time. He has even inspired me thru this book. Its worth LOT more than its price. He was such a nice gentleman, he always cared for the victims of man-eaters. Time and again he shows his concerns. He makes sure he thanks them. He talks about their courage but never once writes about his courage. He is one big-hearted gentleman just like his tigers."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read \\"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\\" many years ago, in junior high school (1951) to be exact. Corbett's book is truly unique in that it is not only a story of high adventure, hunting man-eating tigers in northern India, but it also places the reader in an era that is little-understood today: post-Victorian colonial India.Just as fascinating as the tracking and killing of the tigers are Corbett's descriptions of the devastation of the poor Indian hill people wrought by tigers who preyed upon them. It is clear that he had respect for the helpless villagers who desperately sought his help as well as for the tigers which he was forced to kill. His writing also expresses a profound love for India.One correction I must point out is that the hunts in this book took place in the northern hill country and forests, not in the \\"jungle.\\" Jim Corbett was a keen observer of his surroundings, its wildlife, and its people. It is a window into an era that is now gone.Hunting tigers is a dangerous game-- extremely so for man-eating tigers which have no fear of man. Alone, on foot, and armed with a double \\"express\\" rifle with only iron sights (no telescopic sights here!), the odds are stacked in favor of the tiger. To hunt a tiger once is to place one's self in grave danger but to do it again and again and again....? That takes incredible courage.If you have never read this book, try it. It gives you a better look at hunting tigers than the old Stewart Granger movie \\"Harry Black and the Tiger.\\""},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I am 43 years old. The first time I read this book was about 35 years ago. It belonged to my grand-dad who was a hunter and died 25 years ago. This book ranks right up there with Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe, the difference being reality verses fiction. Absolutely the best book I have ever read. The man, Jim Corbett has a love of nature and his fellow man, and the utmost respect and reverence for the quarry. Absolutely a book you cannot put down. I just aquired this book from my grandmother, who is 89 and it is just as spellbinding now as it was when I was young."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Col.Jim Corbett is the finest hunter of man-eating tigers and leopards to have ever lived. He is an immortal legend in India, where majority of his exploits are centered. The hill-folk whom he relieved of man-eaters like the Champawat tiger, which killed more than 400 people and the man-eating leopard of Rudraprayag, which killed around 125 people and to this date, is the most notorious leopard to have ever walked the face of this earth, literally worshipped him. Though his books were written almost 80 years ago, they still continue to enthrall and fascinate readers all around the world. Col.Corbett never killed, unless absolutely necessary, and in every case, he justifies his killing the animal. Though one feels that his killing the tiger known as the Bachelor of Powalgarh, one of the largest tigers ever, just for the sake of sport, was totally unwanted &amp; unnecessary. His books take you smack into the middle of the Indian jungles, and his books make up for a truly wonderful and breathtaking reading experience. A must buy for all adventure lovers, and if you're not, you still need to have this. Its not a book to be missed at any cost!!!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"In my humble opinion, in order to write, one must live well. Jim Corbett did both. He lived well, and wrote even better. At least among the villagers of Gharwal and Kumaon, he achieved sainthood from brave deeds. Words fail to describe the rapture that consumed me when I first read the works of Jim Corbett. My copy was a 1955 Oxford publication of the Man-eaters of Kumaon. My grandmother who had read all his tales told me of her trip to Rudraprayag in the late 1950's and her terror of stepping out of the traveler's bungalow at night, having read his Rudraprayag man-eating leopard accounts. Her account of the dreaded hills and recalling seeing a plaque that commemorates Corbett's killing of the Rudraprayag leopard, brought the story home for me, and had me hooked on to \\"Shikar\\" yarns, and I think for life.I was wide-eyed, mesmerized, captivated and terrified at the same time when reading Corbett's books. There were times when I wished the stories never ended. The ending in his stories were always a master stroke. He took great care employing words that granted the moment its gravity, the Tiger its stealth and reputation, the advent of danger lurking behind the hairs on one's neck or beneath the bushes conveyed the right amount of terror, his Henry rifle the only tether between life and the Tiger's jaws.The Tiger yarns described in this book are absolutely the dernier cri in adventure story telling. I promise that anyone who sits around a camp fire reading (alone is better) in a wildlife Tiger reserve in India with this book would see their manliness (nerves, guts and ability to keep calm under the dark of night) keenly tested. As the fire crackles and the embers spurt out, the soft tread of India's striped cat thinking of stalking to eat you won't be an unusual or fleeting thought. It'll be a gripping one sending you scurrying back into your tent. The book will see to that! The Tigers from the book will ruffle the nape of your neck and give you those shivers down your spine your spine was not meant to take. This book is THAT good. It created such a sensation that everyone in Britain (in the 50's) who'd read the book, from Royals (Kings, Queens, Dukes and Duchesses) to Soldiers had something to say of the impression it made on them. It became very quickly an international bestseller. Sadly it may also have contributed to Shikar trips to India to \\"bag\\" Tigers, further depleting their numbers. The numbers are now back to their 1971 numbers, in the low 1000's. I honestly think there may be fewer than 500 Tigers left in India. The remainder is just a bloated figure to keep the politics, corruption and jobs of the forest department going. But this book is as great a book as any adventure story. The power of words monsieur, the power of words...there is something permanently venerable about it. Not even the arrow of time can deflect or diminish the gloss of its character."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"To begin with, I don't agree with game hunting at all. However, if you're planning on visiting Jim Corbett park in Uttaranchal Pradesh, India, I'd strongly recommend reading this book before you go. The park is beautiful, but knowing some of the history and the insights into tiger behaviour that Corbett provides is fascinating."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Creeping through the jungle with Jim Corbett following the blood trail of a man eating tiger will make the hair on your neck prickle! Magnificently written and modestly understated accounts of the most intense form of individual bravery imaginable leave you feeling as though you accompanied him all the way. It's as close as you can get without being there."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and I loved it. I thought it was long out of print, and when I saw it was still available I bought a new copy and re-read it again. Like a good wine, it got better with time. This and the story of Shackleton's 'Endurance' expedition in 1914 have to be the most exciting adventure stories I have ever read - I sat up untill the early hours to re-read it again in one sitting. The writing is very descriptive and clear and the tension is unbeatable - Corbett literally came face-to-face with man-eating leopards and tigers, and by his reckoning the chances of surviving an encounter were about one in a hundred. The man must have had nerves of steel to run risks like that for thirty years.Corbett was a hero's heroe and he was a skilled observer and writer as well - he had great knowledge of the country and the animals he tracked and he knew how to record the information and present it so that the uninitiated can understand what is going on.A big attraction to me also for Corbett's writing is his humility and modesty about his accomplishments, there is not a hint of boastfullness. He writes about tracking a man-eating tiger that is stalking him as if the job is no more risky than going to a convenience store for a carton of milk. As a character, Jim Corbett has to be at the very top of the tree."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Corbett writes well and tells a story of life and death in the Jungles and mountains of India that holds one to the edge of your seat.Corbett is a true hero risking imminent death many times for the lives of poor Indians.He makes the average naturalist seem ignorant and has the balls of ten men.Sincerely,Rick Kowalski"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as well as The Man Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. Corbett has a real easy writing style, and it makes for a quick and memorable read."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett dedicated his life to nature. His supreme understanding of the wild, helped to go on a lot of great and dangerous adventures. Each story in this book gives you goosebumps, as this is no fiction. It actually happened. Anybody, who has been fortunate enough to witness the wild in this Northern part of India, will definitely enjoy it. And its not just about hunting Man-eaters, this book actually helps you appreciate the beauty of the Tiger.There are two more books from Corbett that I will recommend. One is the Temple Tiger and other man-eaters and the other is the Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag, which is also a classic."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Corbett delivers some entertaining stories of his hunts for man-eating tigers and leopards. When you are reading this book, he makes you feel like you are there alongside him. He gives a graphic account of how these animals kill and how they are hunted. This was one of my favorite books I have read about dangerous game hunting."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I bought a first edition at a second hand bookstore and after a quick google search I found it is known to be one of the top three hunting books ever written, and right off the bat I see why, just like the author says in chapter one this is a book meant to be read next to a campfire. For the time period it was written it is extremely graphic in its depictions of the hunt and victims. This is a great book, I would recommend the man eaters of tsavo as the next read."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book is a superb slice of history of the British in India, from about 1920 to 1940. What Jim Corbett knew about the Indian jungle, and what he did in relation to tracking tigers that had become man eaters is quite stunning and remarkable. He writes his stories in a flowing, descriptive style that is very easy to read. A truly excellent book that can be enjoyed thoroughly by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This is a great book. It is interesting and you won't want to put it down. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Corbett tells of his personal experiences with the man-eating tigers in Kumaon Division of the Indian state Uttar Pradesh. I bought the original edition in a used book store somewhere long ago, I think in Cyprus. I was glad to see it was reissued in 1993.Corbett was an animal photographer and hunter known for his photos of tigers, as well as his hunting including tiger shooting. In the 1930s, he was contracted by the residents to track tigers that had become man-eaters. Corbett recounts several instances of his quests and near-death victories over tigers who had terrorized the countryside, as well as a man-eating bear.His facile wit and skillful turn of phrase make this an engaging read, aside from its fascinating subject. This book is considered a classic, among others of tigers and hunting which Corbett became famous for."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"The author could describe each scene so well you thought you were there in his shoes. He describes nature like no other. I bought this book used for $0.25 , I wasn't expecting much - it is for sure one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This is the most popular of Jim Corbett's books and has fascinating real life stories of the man-eating tigers, in the foothill of the Himalayas in northern India, and Jim Corbett's encounters with them. The basic theme of most of the stories is the same: a tiger or a tigress turns man-eater and kills a number of people, completely terrorizing the entire population in the surrounding villages; Jim Corbett is called upon to track and kill the man-eater(s), which he does every time using his amazing knowledge of the Jungle and the animals there in; and his unbelievable courage and determination.Jim Corbett's knowledge of the jungle was surpassed only by his compassion for the people he was trying to save, and the animal he was trying to hunt. In the Author's notes, he famously describes the tiger as \\"a large hearted gentleman with boundless courage\\", and warns against the indiscriminate hunting of tigers, which if not controlled would eventually deprive India of the finest of her fauna. His skills as a writer were no less admirable, as evident in this book where he describes his encounters with the man-eating tigers in the wild in blood-curdling details. Overall a very enjoyable book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This is not a story of a bloodthirsty hunting fiend frenzied with the unquenchable lust to pull the trigger and spread carnage. Jim Corbett was a true hunter, sportsman and role model. He was commissioned by the government of India to go and kill man eating tigers and leopards that were running havoc amount the inhabitants of the small villages in remote jungles. Some of these beasts had over 100 recorded human kills. When Mr. Corbett was in the jungle hunting them, these man-eaters were often also hunting him. This was a day when rifles were very limited in their killing power, unlike the sophisticated weapons of today.Man-eaters of Kumaon contains such spine tingling suspense as a time that the author spent the night in a tree by himself well within reach of the man-eater he was tracking. Other times he would make the final approach of a tiger alone with no help or support. Most of his kills were at less than 50 yards. Some were less than 50 feet!These stories seemed so spectacular when I first read them I chalked it up to a man with an over active imagination. I started researching Mr. Corbett and reading any articles that I could find on him. To my surprise I found quite the opposite to be the fact. People that knew him well and went with him in the jungles all say that he toned the stories down because he thought if he told the whole truth no one would believe him!!After I read the book, my wife who does not even hunt consumed it in a single day (which means the house turned into a mess). As soon as she finished, my 15-year-old son started on it and finished it one day later. This is a true classic about a true hero, the kind of which we are sadly lacking in today's world."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Following the foot steps of JIM CORBETT (nowhere close to his expertice) in tracking a suspected man eating tiger for filming in central india , I am still alive and I owe my life to him (my HERO) and books which he has so beautifully written ,which can educate you amazingly in jungle lore as well as enchant you of the experiences he has written . A much too valuable wealth to miss , its a must read book by all the wildlife adventurers .

He is definately an expert environmentalist,naturalist and a very good narrator.Finally, the book takes you on an exciting journey into the deep woods and gives closer view of the life there."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was a family friend, so perhaps I am biased, although I myself never met him, the cottage he lived in in Naini Tal was leased from my grandfather Haresh Chandra Misra, it is now a museum. Many were the times my parents and us children sat around the camp-fires in nearby Sat-Tal and they told us stories of Mr. Corbetts hunting prowress, we used to shiver with fear and walks back from the lake home through the woods in the evening after 'camp-fire' were fast and nervous! What I am trying to say is Jim Corbets books are true adventure, it all happened, his writing is simple and direct. He wites of the people in India, the forests and the animals that he loved and even though he was a hunter he respected his prey and took them cleanly. Most of all Corbett is one of the few writers who wrote in the 50's but his views are politically correct even today. If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of the seat, or makes you glance over your shoulder next time you go walking in the woods, read his books!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"The world that Jim Corbett wrote about -- his life as a whitehunter of man-eating tigers and leopards in India early in thiscentury -- is as vanished as that of the Ancient Greeks. TheEmpire he believed in is gone, the beasts he stalked so relentlesslyare now themselves endagered species... But there's a reason hisbooks have remained in print for two generations. He writes withoutguile or pretention, revealing a great respect for the jungle andfor the animals he hunts, and also providing a window into theimperial mentality -- a frank paternalism towards non-whitesand villagers in particular that in these politically correctdays is as refreshingly honest as it is shocking. And one otherthing -- while Corbett is modest almost to a fault, he was a manof remarkable courage. Sometimes the only way to stalk a predatoris to let the predator stalk you. His books have no shortage ofthrills and chills."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This is an amazing book about a timeless land and down to earth people, about nature, its beauty, its cruelty and about one man who took the initiative to go the long miles, risk his health and life to help the people. The book is about life in the foothills of the Himalayas during the British Raj at what are now the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh in Northern India. Life was simple in India in those days and there was a very thin line separating the village people from the perils of the forests.Jim Corbett is at his best in writing stories about his personal encounters with the man eating tigers and leopards. The ways in which the stories proceed are gripping and the reader can actually see and feel the forest as it was in the early 1900s. His style of writing also tells a lot about his personality, his love for nature and his humble, helpful and compassionate self, there does NOT seem to be any exaggeration from the writer, the style of writing lets the reader move through the pages effortlessly. One can imagine how intense these encounters would have been and the amount of courage that this man had. There are several instances where Jim was closely followed by a man eater and if it wasn't for his super focus and knowledge of the terrain and minds of the animals (and instinct), he wouldn't have been there to write these stories.Finally for those who feel that stories of tiger hunt or any hunt are in appropriate, I completely agree with you. I felt terrible when I read the chapter on the Bachelor of Powalgargh. Such a fine tiger being shot by Jim, but one must understand that in those days there was absolutely no concept of conservation. Hunting was a very prestigious thing and India was teeming with wild life. Once you read through the book you will understand that Jim himself did not like to shoot tigers later in his life unless they were known man eaters or caused trouble to humans and their livestock. He was one of the pioneers of tiger and wildlife conservation in India and understood the importance of conservation; he took to taking pictures instead of hunting which is commendable. He set up the first national park in India which was later renamed as The Jim Corbett National Park in his honour.The same comments apply for all the books written by Jim, with the \\"Man eating leopard of Rudraprayag topping the list.An incredibly good book so I give as many stars as there are."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book had the potential to be so much more than it ended up being. The author, a devoted naturalist and sportsman, certainly experienced a life deserving of biography and saved countless hundreds of native Indians through his eradication of man-eating tigers and leopards in the early half of the 20th century.However, while the author is amazingly meticulous in describing the settings of his adventures, the paragraphs become hopelessly confusing and impossible to follow. Never have I seen writing so in need of diagrams, drawings or other visual aids to enhance the writer's stories. With the exception of one laughably unhelpful map in the back of the book, there are no such aids included in the book. A good editor or artist could easily take the author's prose and develop diagrams, and doing so would improve the reading experience immeasurably.It is also hard to believe that there is not a single photograph in the entire book, though I see reference in the comments to previous editions that did in fact contain photos. I cannot imagine the thought process that went into publishing an edition that contains neither diagrams nor photographs.Finally, the book contains numerous spelling and usage errors as well as transposed pages in some places. All in all, a very unprofessional job of editing and publishing what could otherwise be a first class reading experience."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"If you have ever wanted to enter the world of one-on-one hunting with dangerous game- this book should be your road map! Not only is the author true to form with his writing ability but his peers are in awe of his accomplishments...ask anyone who hunts dangerous big game and &quot;Gentleman&quot; Jim Corbett's name is sure to surface. This is the most gripping account of Corbett's adventures in India. He took exhaustive notes of each hunt he participated in and relives these adventures in a vivid, spell-binding format that will leave you breathless for weeks! No other big game hunter/author comes close- Not Capstick, not O'Conner, not Hunter, not Bell- this is the quintessential text of hunting- a must have!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"The story is great but the book itself looks to be a scanned version of a photocopy of the original book. There are even underlines and marks from the original owner in it that were not edited out. The quality of the text itself is awful and the pictures are worse.

I am stunned this is even sold in this condition, it feels like a scam not a real publishing."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was a sportsman, naturalist, and all around great human being. This volume tracks his exploits killing man-eating tigers in India in the 1920's and 1930's. In some ways, Mr. Corbett writes to the audience of his time and the prose reads like a \\"Boys Life\\" magazine. There is a tidy, British sensibility to it. However, there is also a timeless authenticity to the writing that still resonated when I read this book last week. His love of India, nature, and even the subjects of his hunts is apparent on every page. Mr. Corbett's accounts are wonderful anecdotes with powerful undertones of conservation, appreciation of nature's power, and the place of man in nature. While certainly a period piece, this book still holds a great deal of value to the contemporary reader."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Like all great writing, the prose becomes invisible: deep jungle pushes its way through the print until you suddenly find yourself right there alongside Corbett, stalking (and occasionally stalked by) man-eaters.

It's a riveting read, sensitively told as only Corbett can, and it will remain one of the best jungle stories of this century."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"This book is a must read. As I have said I learned more about tigers and their ways than I have from any other book. It makes you realise that man and beast can co-exist for 99% of the time, and that it is usually man who starts the argument, and that the tigers in question were only trying to survive like any other animal. Jim Corbett really bings the Indian forests to life and involves the reader from the first hunt to the setting up of his little reserve to film tigers. We the reader sitting in our cosy arm chairs can only imagine what went though his mind as he stalked his prey for weeks on end usually seeing nothing but probably being seen by you know what, and wondering if it would be his turn to have the threads of life cut as so many other unfortunates have had done to them. A simple book with a simple tail but impossible to put down once started."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Jim Corbett was, and remains, renowned as the outstanding white hunter of Northern India in the early part of this century. The irony is that he sought, and through his legacy of the Corbett National Park still seeks, to preserve the wildlife and the great cats of India. However his responsibilities towards the populations of those areas over which he had authority obliged him frequently to undertake hazardous pursuits of both tigers and leopards which were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of unfortunate locals. The stories are remarkable as much for the understated idiom of the author who makes little of the fact that he is wandering about the jungle, largely by himself and as often stalked as stalking, in pursuit of notorious man-eating big cats. But he is also deeply sympathetic towards his victims, which were often inspired to man-eating by injury or disablement, while having an almost paternalistic attitude towards his companions. To read Corbett is to learn of the twin dichotomies of the hunter/conservationist and the benevolent imperialist."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"After reading Jim Corbett's works, it comes as no surprise that the Indian government named a national park in the northern reaches of the country after him. A compilation of his experiences in the field (primarily hunting man-eating big cats) affords the reader the luxury of finishing a story in short order, but like a good novel, you have a hard time putting it down. Intelligently written by a dedicated sportsman, the stories reveal a complex man with a deep respect for the natural world around him, unique in today's world and probably much more so earlier in this century when India was still under English rule.The stories will appeal to a large audience, you don't have to be a hunter or even an outdoors person to enjoy these writings. If you're like me, you'll find yourself considering things you've never thought of before. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I read these when I was younger, and have found them again having met someone who comes from Kumaon.The stories of the hunts are absolute page-turners. Corbett is a master of detail and of his craft. He writes with the directness and absence of sentimentality that is very much of his age and genre - not a word is wasted and his observation is first class.I agree with one review that these books (and the original, which I have a copy of) could be improved with maps or diagrams, but they don't suffer too badly for that such is the care of Corbett's descriptions and they were obviously not reproduced on a large budget, which is hardly surprising.Finally - a word about Corbett. He was a man of his times and we are foolish to try and imprint 21st Century morals or thinking onto him. He was a man who hunted a huge amount of game for sport - the Batchelor of Powalgarh and the Pipal Pani tiger paid with their lives because they were great trophies. Talking of the Pipal Pani tiger Corbett weighs the balancing factors of a magnificent trophy vs. not seeing any more the tiger he had hunted for years - close to extraordinary in our eyes. In time he seems to have mellowed and become more of a conservationist - but he never completely put down the gun to adopt a 'maneaters only' approach. Those who don't hunt/shoot may find it difficult to understand, but most hunter/shooters develop a respect for their prey and a desire to preserve it and its habitat - even if for purely selfish reasons, but usually for a whole range of complex and competing reasons.Corbett did undoubtely provide a great service in hunting maneaters - one that took up time, earning opportunities, and which levied a heavy cost in terms of nerves (read the story of the Thak maneater where this is at its clearest). He deserves his credit for that.In short, his legacy is a mixed one - it is wrong to lionise him completely, he was not a saintly conservationist in the Joy Adamson mould, but its daft to criticize him as being one with a callous city executive who wonders out of London in a pink cashmere sweater and tight-fitting tweeds to wipe out low-flying pheasants in the Home Counties but whose total absence of fieldcraft means that he cannot tell the difference between a pigeon and an ostrich and doesn't care either.In my view his legacy is mostly good - he was a man of his time and there is much about him that is unattractive to today's eyes, but he did the hard work leading him to love and understand and explain the habitat and animals he lived amongst and hunted. He did do much good for conservation.One final quality which I consider is very valuable in him is his absence of sentimentality - nature is an unsentimental state and far too many 'animal lovers' and would be 'conservationists' adopt an unrealistic sentimental attitude - it leads to unintended consequences and ultimately bad conservation. It is necessary, especially in a country like the British Isles, to understand that man has more or less completely upset the balance of nature, and that we can't just any more leave animals completely to themselves on the basis that all human attempts to control creatures by culling &c; are wrong - that way the species that have adapted best to man's encroachment (In the UK - rats, crows, magpies, pigeons, foxes &c; &c;) will triumph over biodiversity. Also, the concentration by some on support for 'cute' animals over less 'cute' animals which nonetheless occupy their own important niche in the overal structure has unwelcome consequences. Corbett's insight, which he turned to the good before he died, was to see nature how it is and to want to protect it from man how it is as best as we can."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"I've must have read this book about 6 times since purchasing it 6 years ago. I like to alternate between Brian Herne, Peter Capstick and John Henry Patterson. All excellent story tellers that keep your eyes glued to every page.Jim Corbett was a true hunter and conservationist who hunted his beloved Kumaon region of India during the mid 1920's and early 1930's. During this time a hunter had to keep his witts about him along with a heavy dose of intestinal fortitude!His tactics for hunting and stalking man-eating tigers and the occational leopards is trully inspiring and sometimes bordering on insanity. To think that he would sometimes sleep out in the open knowing that a killer is lurking about! This is an amazing book that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in adventure and the outdoors. Whether you hunt or not, this book conveys to you the reader an actual sence of feeling towards the hunter the hunted and those villagers affected by the tragic occurances in early colonial India..."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"Excellent writing in a subdued style. Amazing real life stories unlike other hunting or dangerous game stories. Includes natural history and environmental aspects of India plus human and cultural views of the Indian people. Jim Corbett hunts tigers alone - no beaters, no elephants, no one else, just him on foot. Top notch for sure."},{"Title":"Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Illustrated edition","review":"\\"For a long minute I stared at this motionless object, until I was convinced that it was the tip of the tiger's tail. If the tail was pointing away from me the head must obviously be towards me, and as the ledge was only some two feet wide, the tiger could only be crouching down and waiting to spring the moment my head appeared over the bole of the tree. The tip of the tail was twenty feet from me, and allowing eight feet for the tiger's length while crouching, his head would be twelve feet away.\\"Twelve feet away.Have you ever watched a house cat patiently stalk a bird or mouse? Have you ever imagined being the mouse? It's hard to fathom an entire village or countryside living for years in daily fear of being eaten by a man-eating tiger. But during the early part of the 20th century, many inhabitants of off-the-beaten-path areas in India lived in such a state. Jim Corbett, expert hunter, naturalist, and author, performed a live-saving service for the people of India by putting an end to many of these animals in the 1930's and 1940's. He succeeded by entering the Tigers' minds, anticipating their behavior, and beating them at their own game - if sometimes only by a whisker. This book tells the tales of eight of these chess matches between masters.Corbett details both imagery and action in a vivid yet unexcited manner. His use of energetic adverbs and adjectives as well as exclamation points is sparse - the simple facts of the situation are enough to bring the reader into the jungle.\\"Without taking my eyes off him I groped with my hand on the hillside and picked up a stone that filled my hand as comfortably as a cricket ball. The snake had just reached a sharp ridge of hard clay when the stone, launched with the utmost energy I was capable of, struck it on the back of the head. The blow would have killed any other snake outright, but the only, and very alarming, effect it had on the hamadryad was to make it whip round and come straight towards me.\\"I omitted the previous text about the snake being 14 feet long.Some of the author's details seem almost humorous when juxtaposed against the matter-of-fact and bloody details of a tiger's recent kills. For example, no proper hunt would be complete without tea.\\"My forty-pound tent had been pitched in a field of stubble a hundred yards from the village, and I had hardly reached it before tea was laid out for me on a table improvised out of a couple of suit-cases and planks borrowed from the village.\\"That said, Corbett does not come across as a Great White Hunter looking to bag yet another trophy for the lodge back in Oxford. He only hunted man-eaters, and he regarded it as a service and a duty. His deep respect for the tigers comes through in his writing.My boys and I read this book as a bedtime story over the course of four months. I was a bit concerned they might lay awake at night entertaining visions of tigers breaking through the window to carry them off into the woods. But I think they must have dreamed instead of being Major Jim Corbett - stalking alone through the jungle, anticipating the tiger's next move."},{"Title":"Dunbar 1650: Cromwell's most famous victory (Campaign)","review":"Stuart Reid's latest Osprey campaign volume, Dunbar 1650, is a considerable improvement over his last volume on Auldearn 1645. Not only is Dunbar 1650 supported by better research than the previous volume, but Reid's prose has returned to its normal control of the subject. While the question of whether Dunbar was Cromwell's \\"most famous victory\\" may trouble some readers, this volume does address this less well-known campaign in some detail.Reid's initial sections on origins of the campaign, opposing plans/leaders and armies are decent. The illustrations of Scottish uniforms are much better in this volume than the previous volume on Auldearn, although there are far too many illustrations of Scottish regimental flags. The five 2-D maps are: Scotland 1650; the Carbisdale campaign April 1650; Cromwell's initial advance on Edinburgh; Cromwell's second advance on Edinburgh; Dunbar endgame. The three 3-D BEV maps are: the ambush at Carbisdale; two on Battle of Dunbar. The three battle scenes are: the fortified lines at Leith; the cavalry action at Musselburgh; last stand of Lawer's brigade at Dunbar. The author provides an unusually lengthy order of battle for Dunbar, particularly for the Scottish army.While Reid's campaign narrative is solid and informing, the Dunbar campaign is unlikely to be very intriguing for military readers. Cromwell massed his forces and smashed the Scottish right wing, then rolled up the rest of their army in short order. The battle was so incredibly one-sided, with the Scots losing perhaps 6,000 men against 30-40 English, that military readers will find little advantage in studying this affair. Thus, Reid's volume is best suited for readers interested in 17th Century warfare (from the point of view of heraldry, units) or Scottish history. However, while reading Reid's account, I noticed that there was no mention of Borthwick Castle, located south of Edinburgh. In 1995 I visited Borthwick Castle and was struck by the damage caused on one side by Cromwell's artillery (as related by the staff there). Apparently, the castle was attacked by Cromwell's forces in his initial drive on Edinburgh. Why is this incident not related in these pages?"},{"Title":"Macromedia ColdFusion MX: Training from the Source","review":"Warning!

Gentle continues to write with that mix of realism, humor, and adventure that made the first volume of this series an excellent mix of alternate history and medieval war epic with a strong, in all senses, lead character. I do not think that the &quot;today&quot;/&quot;academic discussions&quot; sections were integrated as well into the book as in the first volume as they lend less of a aura of mystery and instead almost are a second story going on and overall, with some of the mysteries revealed by the goings-on during this second book, more pedestrian. But, the series continues to be a very worthwhile read, for any number of segments of the sf &amp; fantasy universe of readers."},{"Title":"Carthage Ascendant : The Book of Ash 2","review":"Carthage Ascendent is the second Book of Ash, although this isn't a series but a tremendous novel published in four parts. It's the only one that takes place away from Ash's stomping grounds of western Europe, where the other three books are set. Here, our heroine, the leader of a mercenary company, is captured and taken prisoner, then returned to her birthplace of Carthage. She didn't know this was her birthplace, and this is not the Carthage you think it is. Oh, and she's got this twin who is the general of the Visigoth army. And if you think that isn't weird enough, there's no sun in Carthage. And now it's getting very cold.Yes, things are defintely getting beyond a straight historical fiction, but it doesn't read like just fantasy either. The story of Ash is supposedly a manuscript translation, but the editor wants to yank the project because the manuscripts are disappearing from their supposed libraries. Meanwhile the translator has joined an archaelogical expedition and is finding evidence supporting the events in Ash's life.This second book has a very different sense than the first one, since we meet her as a competent leader, and now she's reduced to a defeated slave. But with two more books to go, there are plenty more plot developments, and they are very surprising. The &quot;voice&quot; in Ash's head is not what she thought it was in Book 1, and dealing with it takes up a good deal of her worries (that is, when she isn't plotting her escape). Her husband shows up in Carthage, too, and she gets to watch the politics of the amirs here after handling European nobility in book 1. Have I mentioned that there is a lot going on here?Keep at it and enjoy. Check out the reviews of Book 1: A Secret History if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Carthage Ascendant : The Book of Ash 2","review":"This is the second part of THE BOOK OF ASH (following A SECRET HISTORY), the story of a female mercenary captain in an alternate 15th century Europe. This main alternate history story is framed by the story of a historian in the early 21st century translating a manuscript of this history. He is trying to uncover why we have never heard any of this history as it is being told in the manuscript. This all makes for a very engaging read because, not only does it draw the reader into the mystery, but we also get an extremely well told and realistic tale of a mercenary band in war torn medieval Europe. As in the first book, the reader is again deeply immersed in this reality through the author's use of vivid description, brilliantly imagined characters, and engaging plot devices.I was tempted to give this book only three stars. The first fifty pages of the book, as well as the last hundred, were exciting and very engaging reading. Unfortunately, the middle two hundred or so pages did not do much to advance the story. The problem was that not much really happened. Sure, we learn some important backstory and a lot of the relevant politics, but it was severely bogged down with superfluous scenes and interior monologues that could easily have been cut without losing anything from the story.The main reason I didn't give it three stars was the fact that there were so many mysteries that were hinted at in the first book that were unearthed in this one that it made for some very interesting reading. We learn about Ash's past, what her voice really is, as well as more of the history of the world in which she lives. In addition, the final hundred pages were so full of action and military operations, that it was impossible to put the book down. This is the type of action that I had been expecting in a book about a mercenary captain that seemed so sorely lacking in the first book. The author also hits us with another revelation and an even bigger mystery in the last portion of the book. I couldn't wait to get to the next one in the series and see if we didn't find out what was truly going on.Despite the shortcomings of the storytelling in the middle of the book, I still felt that this was a better than average fantasy story and, thus, felt compelled to give it a four star rating. If you enjoyed the first book in the series (and you'd better read it before trying this one), this one should also grab your attention. This is a must read series for any fantasy fan, especially for those who enjoy stories with a military bent."},{"Title":"Carthage Ascendant : The Book of Ash 2","review":"Had I been allowed to award half stars, I would have given this second installment of Mary Gentile's medieval reconstruction 3.5 stars. The second book continues its detailed and military reinvention of history directly from where the first book left off, and, in my opinion, should not have been separated from the first, the storyline too joined and directly linked in terms of time and plot for the division into two books to be seen as anything but an arbitrary decision likely based upon some misplaced notion of merchandising. Books one and two should have been published as a single text, as together they possess an obvious and coherent structure.The strengths of the first book continue here: a detailed and realistic portrayal of warfare in the late middle ages, and a strong characterization of the mercenary band fighting under the Lion Azure standard of the story's protagonist, Ash. The latter's character evolves further, and there are some poignant as well as harrowing moments of self-realization on the part of our tale's heroine. The evolution of her relationship with several of the narrative's secondary characters--Floria, Fernando del Guiz, and Godfrey--as well as the emerging roles of John de Vere and Ash's lieutenants are deftly done, and over all the writing seems more solid than some of the prose found in the first book.However, I found elements of this multifaceted tale beginning to become less relevant or incongruous to the tale at large. As another reviewer has noted, the ongoing and in part separate story of the discovery of the Ash manuscripts upon which the main narrative is based, being told by a modern day historian in the form of emails to his publisher, has begun to be less integrated into the larger tale, with a smaller presence than found in the first book. While I do believe its lessening presence is probably a necessary development in order to contain its inherent interruption of the flow of the narrative, its continued presence no longer seemed as relevant to the rest of the story, providing little that informed or questioned the underlying themes of history or perception contained in the first book, becoming more a separate and increasingly contrived element that intruded upon the rest of the text. Further, the introduction--or I should say development--of the voices and stone golem into a &quot;machina rei militaris,&quot; a &quot;tactical computer&quot; through which other &quot;wild machines&quot; speak with inhuman and demonic direction, introduced an modern day or science fictional element that seemed to me incongruous with the medieval realism with which the bulk of the tale is written. Combined with other elements--Carthage, relicts of ancient Rome, pyramids in Tunisia--these temporally contradictory introductions, though to a degree present and accepted in the first book, begin to become more and more contrived and preposterous within the medieval realism of the story's main setting--almost a kitchen sink approach--regardless of any earlier meditations present in the first book upon the existence of parallel or alternate histories, or the questionable basis upon which we reconstruct the past. While some fans of science fiction may find this willy-nilly approach to plot elements intriguing, I found it discordant and unsubstantiated within the structure and realism of the main story, unfounded introductions that remained only tangentially and artificially integrated.I will continue to read this tale for the medieval realism and strength of it main story, while trying to ignore its newer and less plausible elements. It seems unfortunate that the author found herself compelled to introduce these elements. The medieval reconstruction of history and the qualities she had invested in her characters and their initial conflicts were certainly rich enough on their own around which to build a compelling story. The author now seems to be throwing in additional and unnecessary motifs that add little credibility and in part undermine and distract from the main thrust of her story. Nor is this an instance of where &quot;too much is not enough.&quot;"},{"Title":"Carthage Ascendant : The Book of Ash 2","review":"Having now just finished this book, I have mixed feelings about this novel. I picked up the first book out of curiousity and I found it to be an excellent book, I had high hopes for the second one. Hmm, not too sure about that.The story continues with Ash still dumbfounded that the Visigoth General named The Faris ,whom she has a resemblance to, is invading nearly all Europe in such a hastely fashion. After a battle ensues against these Visigoths, Ash is taken captive to the heart of it all. Carthage. While there she is told and begins to unfold her being and why she hears these \\"voices\\" in her head. Thus begins the great escape.Ash is a woman with power and she knows how to use it. In this book Ash is reduced to a prisoner. She is use to being on the other side of the coin. She suffers not only mentally but emotinally as well ( as any prisoner should ). Like I mentioned earlier Ash was a headstrong captain of The Lion Azure, now her pride and self esteem are thrown out the window. And that my fellow readers is real. She begins to show signs of fear, obviously, to a point of wanting to strike a deal with the very same people trying to destory Burgundy so that she may live another day or more. She'll say anything and do anything for her life. I think thats great, a real capture of human emotion.While the book is heavily story driven near the middle and the end, I found at times struggling to get thru the book. This book nearly took me 3 weeks to finish. The first one I finished in a little less than two weeks. I admit there are some slow times in the book. At times I felt the book was getting a little overly descriptive about things and I admit I skipped over a paragraph or two from time to time.

The author brings out little details that usually aren't found in period novels, like her men always cussing and \\"scratching under their codpeices\\". Now there's something I wouldn't have thought about...And when Ash is commanding her men in battle, shouting orders, getting her men in position, I can almost smell the smoke from Angelotti's guns and hear the screams of the horses. These are the best parts of the book. The author definately knows how to present a battle scene from the perspective of a company captain.Unfortunately, there is too little action in the first two books, and especially this book. Ash's long periods of self-examination really grow boring and add nothing to the story, except a feeling of \\"hey, no kidding Ash; you just figured that out?\\". This book is about 200 pages too long. And slow. And Ashes attraction to del Guiz makes her seems EXTREMELY shallow.But despite all that, I'm still drawn to the story because, first, I keep waiting for a battle and second, I love the feeling of being dropped into the period. The author's research into battle tactics and the period itself really make the story come alive.I would recommend the book to people who like historical novels or who might enjoy the medieval mercenary setting.

At least 90% of the content this book could have been edited out without losing anything of real value. The reader is taken back through lots of funny scenes from all sorts of TV shows and movies, from the Jetsons to Top Gun, to Back to the Future, Hoop Dreams, Austin Powers, Star Wars, the Color of Money, Glengarry Glen Ross, the Graduate, As Good As It Gets, Blazing Saddles, etc. etc. etc. Lest we start thinking that the author's education is limited to Tinseltown offerings, he drops in a few references to The Odyssey and Anna Karenina near the end.The first 60 pages are spent bashing a straw man of Burnham's own creation. The efficient-market theory he purports to take down is not the theory as it is actually articulated by its proponents, but Burnham's own ill-informed reconstruction. It's no wonder he is able to tear it apart so effectively. Sadly, his take on this academic debate does not supply any tools capable of predicting future market behavior. Instead, there emerge a few well-worn themes: buy low, sell high, and avoid emotional investing. The obligatory Keynes quote that in the long run we're all dead is thrown in as well. Fair enough, but all this has been written about a million times already.In the end, the \\"truths\\" Burnham uncovers are undoubtedly true. Stock prices won't always outpace economic growth, the US won't always be able to run trade deficits, and there is a lot of money to be made in being a contrarian. Oddly enough, his truths all seem to be a variant of the idea that in the long run market forces punish irrational behavior. But I won't go there. I'll simply point out that this book, like all the others, won't tell you when corporate profits will recede, or whether that stock everybody hates will be up 20% next year or still out of favor."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

Burnham has laid it all out in a spectacularly readable and wise manifesto.This book is stunningly broad in the ground it covers: bonds, stocks, real estate, inflation, etc.; it is like the course in economics that we all wish we had in college (and again when we had real money to invest).

I always take books like this with a grain of salt when they talk about doing something like \\"Profiting from Irrationality.\\" The irrationality the author talks about is the irrationality of 'homo sapiens', otherwise known as -- you and me. For the most part, we are the irrational people the author describes. In fact, as other books have described, our brains are 'hard-wired' from evolutionary times to 'cut profits short and let losses run.' Of course, this is exactly the opposite of what one must do to profit in the market.Frankly, if you are seriously considering investing in the market or are trying to figure out ways to make your trading more successful, there are other books which will be more useful. Consider reading \\"Trading in the Zone\\" by Mark Douglas and \\"Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them\\" by Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich.The primary enemy you must conquer to profit in the stock market is --- you.

Not just the markets but real estate or business oportunities. Mr. Burnham really opens your eyes to the nature of why we make negative moves while investing and how to avoid doing them. After reading this book I made some investing decisions that he highlighted regarding the dollar and have already profited handsomely. If I could put a subtitle on this book I would make it \\"Don't follow the herd you will get trampled\\" Thank you Mr. Burnham! I wish all these Talking Heads out there in Investing Land would read your book."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"I was eager to read this book, especially given the quality of the endorsements on the back cover (Taleb's book is excellent). The author does make some good points, including the \\"Losers Average Losers\\" strategy of dollar-cost-averaging (taken from a quote by Paul Tudor Jones). He also acknowledges the asymmetries of risk aversion and risk seeking behaviors. And his analysis of the real estate market (growth rate of prices versus rents) is spot-on.But none of this is original stuff and I was expecting more from an author with such an august background. For example, his audacious conclusion that the success of US equity markets over the long term can be explained in terms of \\"survivorship bias\\" is based upon someone else's research (which he refers to but doesn't bother to analyze in any detail). Moreover, he makes light of the work of Jeremy Siegel when in fact Siegel publicly stated that the tech market was overvalued before the NASDAQ melt-down (you can link to the appropriate WSJ article on Siegel's web site). Indeed, much of his \\"irrationality\\" thesis surrounds the inflated tech stocks of the late 90s early 2000 time frame. He ignores the fact that the rest of market (excluding the tech bubble) has continued to perform along historical averages. Moreover, efficient market proponents have never stated that markets can't have bubbles, nor that investors can't behave irrationally.His movie metaphors are fine at first but soon become tiring and sophomoric. I also thought it rather risible to quote Noam Chomsky when describing the Cuban Missile Crisis (why is this even in the book?)So while there are some good and entertaining parts , I can't recommend it as a noteworthy addition to one's financial library."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"Mean markets was the best read I've had in a long time.

This is a good read on how people's fear and poor decisions can cause them problems."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"The decision to purchase Mean Markets was not pre-meditated. I was wandering around the bookstore and happened to see Mean Markets displayed fairly prominently at Borders. I was intrigued by the title and the lizard on the back. At the very least, the book looked like an unconventional investment book. Oddly, what made me purchase the book was seeing a very positive blurb from Nassim Nicholas Taleb on the back. I consider Nassim's latest book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" one of the best investment books over the last few years. In the blurb, Taleb actually says, \\"Should be required reading for anyone trying to understand financial markets....\\" I took the blurb seriously since Taleb doesn't seem like the type to give blurbs to books he doesn't like. In Fooled by Randomness, he specifically cited occasions he gave bad reviews or didn't allow blurbs. I should've taken some caution in seeing Isiah Thomas and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (former star of Saved by the Bell) also providing blurbs.Among other things, the books intent is to serve as a primer to behavioral finance and teach how to invest according to the new findings. While the book is very readable, it's not particularly innovative or useful for a non-beginning investor.The first of the three sections, \\"The New Science of Irrationality\\" is by far the most interesting. Mr. Burnham shows us that there is effective two parts to our brain: the pre-frontal cortex and the rest, which is the lizard brain. The pre-frontal cortex is responsible for analysis. The lizard brain controls our instincts and impulses. Our goal in investing should be to rely on the pre-frontal cortex and limit our lizard brains. In certain environments, such as hunting for food or playing football, our impulses and lizard brains are perfectly fine for dictating decisions. Conversely, the markets are an area that our minds are not suited for. For example, humans are notoriously bad at calculating conditional probabilities.The second section is (oddly) a primer on issues facing the US and global economy. Mr. Burnham provides the conventional bull and bear case for the global economy. The chapter tackles many of the major issues including the twin deficits, productivity, interest rates and inflation. For the reader without any knowledge of these issues, the section is very useful. That said any reader who reads the Economist Magazine or pays any attention to macro-economic issues will gain little. There's nothing new the chapter introduces. Mr. Burnham barely discusses how the new science of irrationality allows us to better analyze the global economy.The third section, very similar to the second, is a primer on the major assets classes: stocks, bonds and real estate. The only difference is that he's bearish on all three. Once again, he provides a very clear explanation on why the asset classes won't do as well. However, he again deviates little from the standard investment book or for that matter magazine article on the markets. There's no new method irrational analysis.From a different perspective, Nassim Nicholas Taleb statement that this is a \\"must read\\" isn't completely inaccurate. While there are certain topics not covered by traditional investment books, the bulk of the book really is just an overview of the issues facing the economy and the markets. For the reader who's not at all familiar with these issues, this book will get him caught up.However, the book really isn't about lizard brains or the new science of irrationality. I get the impression that Mr. Burnham simply wanted to write a traditional book. My guess is that his publishers needed some type of hook. They then inserted the lizard brain stuff. At the end of the day it's a traditional book and doesn't provide much further insight than any other book."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"Conventional wisdom about investing suggests that people are basically rational, markets are basically efficient, and nobody can earn a reward without some risk. One corollary of this conventional wisdom is that individual investors ought to own stocks. Individual investors have been acting conventionally wise - but that may be exactly the wrong thing to do. Author Terry Burnham draws on the relatively new science of behavioral economics - informed by insights into human reasoning that have been discovered by cognitive researchers - and offers investment advice dramatically at odds with conventional wisdom. Burnham, a former Harvard professor with ample experience in finance, puts his thoughts in pop language, drawing not on market studies but on movies and other references to current culture, to make many of his most salient points. What he loses in \`gravitas', he gains in entertainment value. We find that this investment book manages to be fun to read, while providing the grain of salt readers should take to temper more conventional economic advice."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"From \\"Essays on Genetic Evolution and Economics\\" to the widely acclaimed \\"Mean Genes\\", Terry Burnham has been a leader in applying learnings from sociobiology broadly. His gift is making complicated academic research accessible to all. His novel message is that our underlying human behavior, honed through thousands of years of genetic evolution, actually gets in the way of our logical thought processes when it comes to playing the stock market, buying a house, or trying to save up for our kids' college education. Nowhere are his great insights more valuable than in analyzing the problems we face when making these personal investment decisions, as he does in \\"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains : How to Profit from the Science of Irrationality\\".Professor Burnham weaves insightful personal anecdotes from his vast array of experiences (i.e., as an academic, entrepreneur, investment banker, day-trader, biologist, and United States Marine), and combines them with sound analytical economic thinking (i.e., as a PhD economist from Harvard with up-to-date knowledge of the latest thinking on irrationality). The result is a detailed description of the basis for our poor instincts in financial decision-making, as well as a prescription for improving our performance in this context. Everyone wants to make money by investing wisely, and yet few of us are able to rise above our \\"Lizard Brain\\" tendencies. This book goes beyond describing our shortcomings; it teaches us how to think for ourselves in over-riding those \\"Lizard Brain\\" inclinations.I once described \\"Mean Genes\\" as the best book I ever read. \\"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains\\" challenges that bold assertion. By simplifying a complex topic (i.e., managing your money) with new insights drawn from disparate learnings, Terry Burnham has written a most unusual kind of \\"how-to\\" book -- one that does not promise vast riches with little or no effort, but rather vast insight coupled with always practical and realistic advice. If your are looking to learn as you rebalance your portfolio, read this book."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"What a cool book! Terry Burnham wants to help his readers understand that while we fancy ourselves users of reason and rational beings we still have blind spots in our thinking and behavior that can get us into a great deal of trouble when making investment decisions. That is, unless we are explicitly aware of these problems and consciously work to train ourselves to avoid them and be continuously on guard against falling into their pit.Burnham organizes the book into four parts. The first chapter is the introduction and presents the gist of the book. What is a mean market? The fact that markets can defy the accepted bromides about rational markets and wipe out investors surprisingly quickly and without any hint of mercy. The idea of cosmological indifference comes to mind. The author's vivid image of the \\"Lizard Brain\\" refers less to any explicit structure in the brain or any claim to specific evolutionary path to brain development.Instead, Burnham is referring to the fact that we all have a set of tendencies, hard wired ways of perceiving the world, and bred in behavioral tendencies that worked well in keeping our ancestors alive in the ancient world. However, they are as out of place in our technological world as a lizard might be at the Met. For example, our brains are very good in seeing patterns. The problem is we often see patterns where none exist. On the other hand, we are terrible at perceiving frequencies. However, with training and discipline we can learn to deal with both of these natural tendencies. Without being aware of these potential problems, we too often get ourselves in trouble.The first part weighs the traditional Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) of rational markets against the oceans of evidence that people do behave irrationally. Here is where I differ slightly with Burnham. My understanding of EMH does not require that each individual act rationally or that any given price at any instant in time be the \\"right\\" price. Instead, it indicates that in the aggregate that most irrationality cancels each other out and resources get allocated surprisingly efficiently. As for prices, the notion is not that the price is free from being too high or too low, but that there is a \\"right\\" price at all that will be in the area of most of the trading with some of it too high and some too low.However, the EMH doesn't help the investor account for irrationality or how to avoid its dangers in one's own behavior or capitalize on its existence in others. And this is where the book's strengths are to be found.The second part takes us through a survey of evidence of irrationality in the American markets and the limits of growth that are so often ignored in pricing equities. The author also takes us through the uses and perceptions of money, barter, inflation, and deflation. All interesting and useful information.In part three we get Burnham's actual views on how to pull all this together in viewing Bonds, Stocks, and Real Estate for investments at the time of this book (2005). Burnham is an economist and discounts the optimism of many people who tout these products. I think he makes a great deal of sense. However, it is up to you to make your own decisions.Part four provides two chapters full of principles for us to apply in making our own investment decisions. The first chapter gives \\"timeless advice\\". That is, those principles that are applicable in any type of market at any time. The second chapter offers \\"timely advice\\". That is, advice that is market condition specific. Burnham gives us principles to apply in rising or declining markets and how to know when to use them.The issue is whether we have the discipline to apply them or will we surrender to the emotional pull of the lizard brain and find ourselves in trouble.Burnham makes this subject quite lively, is able to put some nice color to it with some good anecdotes, illustrative stories, and some actually funny jokes.Recommended."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"The new science of irrationality shows us that \\"We are built to be exactly out of sync with financial opportunity,\\" writes Dr. Terry Burnham, coauthor of the international bestseller \\"Mean Genes.\\" Writing in the same personable style that made \\"Mean Genes\\" hard to put down, Dr. Burnham accomplishes the Herculean feat of making the study of economics seem like an enjoyable pastime. This Burnham accomplishes with the help of the new behavioral school of economics, a school that holds-contrary to the classical school of economics-that humans are not rational when making economic decisions.The human brain's prefrontal cortex is responsible for most of abstract cognition. The \\"lizard brain is verbal shorthand for the less cognitive, less abstract mental forces that influence human behavior,\\" Dr. Burnham writes. Shaped in the Pleistocene era, the lizard brain thrived by seeking patterns, looking backwards, and repeating successful behaviors - three traits that can lead to failure in financial markets (and in other areas). Most financial analysts recommend looking backwards, i.e., looking at historical financial trends. That is like driving your car by looking in the rearview mirror.Even if you aren't an investor, read this delightful book. Markets affect everyone. And Dr. Burnham offers plenty of Mean Genes insights useful in everyday life. \\"When I check into a hotel, I never get the key to the mini bar,\\" Dr. Burnham recounts in an anecdote readers of \\"Mean Genes\\" will appreciate. \\"Without the key, I don't need willpower to avoid any late-night temptation to devour junk food. I have found that most temptations are better avoided than resisted.\\"I'm acting on Dr. Burnham's advice, and, just as I did with Mean Genes, I've found myself quoting from \\"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains.\\""},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"A great read; appeals to the counter-intuitive insights of successful investors and explains a lot of human nature and how destructive it can be from an investment standpoint.I found his advice at the end however strange and incorrect. He argues against adding to a position when it goes down in price. I have added to positions and this I have found to be very effective. For similar reasons, he argues against dollar cost averaging, which I have also found to be profitable. The reasons both of these strategies can be useful are that they are counter intuitive, so his opposition to these strategies seems out of place with the rest of the book. Also, in both these instances, I find his justification not to be persuasive.The author is clearly a smart guy who writes well. I would have given the book 5 stars if it were not for those 2 issues. I purchased the book on Amazon.com and would recommend that every investor read this book."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"I found my time well spent reading this book. For would be readers - it seemed to me that there really were two parts to this book:1. An investigation of irrational economic decisions by investors with roots in our evolutionary history.2. A reasoned (but somewhat superficial) analysis of current macroeconomic situation (US debt, current account deficit, stock valuations).And there are numerous references to modern studies that help debunk some of the myths of investing and finance. I particularly enjoyed learning about 'survivorship-bias'. And finally, loved the sense of humor! Memorable quotes from popular works of arts kept me laughing and makes this a page-turner from the start.On the downside, by the time I got to the end, I was more than a little tiresome of the repeated references to 'lizard-brain'. That point is made pretty well early on. And while Terry makes a convincing case that the bull market run in U.S. Real Estate, Bonds and Stocks is short on breath - this does not (IMHO) come close to justifying his 10% stock allocation advice. In this respect - not incorporating international stocks into a recommended financial strategy seems particularly glaring. Like never before, investors today have the ability to invest in overseas markets. By Terry's own theories, Japan (and perhaps emerging markets) would seem to be primed for a long bull market (coming off a long period of low growth and adverse investor sentiment). Keeping savings in declining US dollars while overseas currencies and markets appreciate seems ostrich like (if not lizard brained). Material, perhaps, for a second edition ?"},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"I think why I like Terry Burnham's thought process so much is because, although he has every right, qualification and academic degree to do otherwise, he can set academic pretention aside and still manage to make an intellectual point that is notonly valid, but relevant.While this may not be the most dense, heavily technical analysis of modern everyday economic problems, Burnham integrates social and economic principals in a way that makes them not only comprehensible to a reader of any background, but relatable to a reader of any background.As someone who gingerly sifts through endless pages of research (financial or otherwise), it seems as though most of what I've come across is pundit after pundit, each latter trying to one-up a former with their newest (and typically, tragicomically irrelevant) revelations - so a thank you to Terry Burnham for writing.He's added some 'good' to the 'common', and on a personal note, I just wanted to throw some appreciation his way.Looking forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"Do you ever invest with your heart instead of your head?

The 1st & 4th parts are a treat to read on decision making and how we sometimes unknowingly do things that are against our own best interests. This is what the author calls the Lizard Brain in reference to what our ancestor's genes were best suited for or adapted to.For first time readers on this subject of counter intuitive insights, sections (1) and (4) are an entertaining quick read and for more detailed discussions on the subject there are several excellent books like Psychology of Judgment by Scott Plous or How We Know What Isn't So by Thomas Gilovich and not forget Heuristics & Biases by Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky.For Parts 2 & 3 are some of your more basic marco economics and probability discussions on markets, bonds, and real estate but in a very entertaining way. If you like movies, many anecdotal references to keep you interested as you breeze thru the pages.One could argue with some of Mr. Burnham's conclusions, but statistics and probability are most likely on his side which is the point he is making. One point about bonds though is that even though bonds are currently low interest rate wise, statistically, they could still go lower for a statistically great increase if you were a bond owner (i.e. reference PIMCO).I would have rated this material higher if not for the fact I have read the above referenced books.

That is the case with this book.I appreciate the subject matter and the book came highly recommended to me.As a Chartered Financial Analyst with almost 20 years experience I am having a difficult time finishing this book. The author makes factual assertions without any empirical backup. For instance, he asserts that fundamentally greater wealth does not make a person happier. This is not factual.There is a great deal of current research into happiness and wealth, greater wealth suffers from diminishing returns, but suffice to say that people with double the average income are in aggregate happier than the average American.If this was the only example I would hold my tongue, but it is not.Caution: Read with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"Maybe its just oversimplification, but some of the information here is just plain wrong.

You assure her that the test is unnecessary as only one woman out of a thousand with her age and sexual history is infected. She insists, and sadly the test result indicates viral infection. If the HIV test is 95% accurate, what is the chance that your patient is actually sick? ... The correct answer is under 2%\\".IS IT? I disagree with the author's assertion, and I am no stranger to math. There is faulty logic at work here. I actually tracked down the study that they were referencing. Here is the actual question, as asked by Tversky and Kahneman:\\"If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a false positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found to have a positive result actually has the disease, assuming you know nothing about the person's symptoms or signs.\\"The author has ruined my faith in his intelligence, and I'm basically in the first chapter. Everyone knows that AIDs does not just happen upon random people the way cancer does. To get HIV you have to do something bad with someone else who has it. So the author has chosen to use the disease that most strongly betrays the original intentions of the question at hand. Furthermore, if a young woman \\"insists\\" to her doctor that she take an HIV test, this is very much a sign of AIDs given that AIDs has no outward symptoms and given that a reasonable person would not insist on getting an AIDs test if they havn't engaged in behavior that would lead them to believe they may be at risk for contracting AIDs. Also, the question at hand specifically uses the terminology false-positive. The author uses the term 95% accurate, which implies that 5% of the time there are a combination of false-positives and false-negatives. While this does not mathematically change the problem as it is presented, maybe the test has 5% false-positives and 10% false-negatives. That would make it 92.5% accurate, (if there was a 50/50 base rate; see, I DO understand the point he is making!). The author is just trying to trick the most people possible so that they go whoa let me hear what this guy has to say and dive face-forward in to the book. I am sticking by my answer of 95% in the question as worded by Terry Burnham because having a 1/1000 chance of contracting AIDs based on the actions of 1000 random woman is completely irrelevant to the chance of actually contracting aids based on the actions of 1 woman, yourself. 99% of the population could have AIDs. Still, if I don't touch any sexual fluid or blood, I'm not going to get aids. Rewrite the book, and use lung cancer and smokers for this example. She has a 95% chance of having aids, PERIOD!"},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"Dr. Burnham encourages one to \\"descale\\" one's pre caveman's intrinsic attitudes to understand the logic (or rational behavior) within."},{"Title":"Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality","review":"The book told me what not to do, but not what to do.

Life's too short to wade through specious reasoning, weak theories and cheap shots at better authors.No useful science or economics here."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I loved this book, though admittedly it reads a bit like a rough draft with several stories which are not very well integrated. In the introduction, Bronte claims Shirley is anything but a romance, and indeed the first few chapters are so dry (focusing on the very minor and not very interesting characters of the vicars and other religious personnel) that one needs patience to continue reading.Indeed this is understandable given that Charlotte's beloved sisters Anne and Emily and her beloved but wayward brother Branwell all died the year she wrote the first half of the novel, and she was shutting down emotionally and withdrawing from the world. Later when she wrote the last half, she was past the deepest stage of grief.Bronte also doesn't introduce her heroine Shirley until 1/3 of the way through the novel, establishes considerable interest in the character of Robert Moore, and then has him disappear most of the second half of the novel, and introduces another major character, Robert's brother in the last portion of the book.Finally, one sometimes has to strain to believe that individuals at this time really spoke as these characters spoke - especially the men when they on rare occasion pour out their hearts to other men in lengthy poetic prose. But often the prose of Bronte's dialogue is quite delicious and makes one wish that writers today had such a flair for such eloquent, emotionally expressive language.The strong point of the novel: Charlotte Bronte excels in letting us into the mind and hearts of her two heroines, Caroline and Shirley, as well as in painting portraits of several of other characters, especially Robert Moore. Her rich attunement to the subtleties of the inner life of feeling (especially falling in love and the roller coast ride of affectionate rapport alternating with anguish-inducing withdrawal) and the innuendos of relationships between women and women, and men and women, is notable. Her portrayals of her primary characters are so compelling that her readers begin to deeply care about them and their happiness. The relationship between Robert and Caroline is particularly engaging, and likely to lead the reader to yearn, along with Caroline, for Robert to stand firm in his affections and not retreat into his very real and troublesome business and financial concerns.The political subplot is also enlightening - a basically good man, Robert Moore, being drawn almost to bankruptcy while needing to industrialize his mill in order to remain in business, and as a result laying off workers and inciting a luddite rebellion against him. (Readers who are intrigued by this theme, might also enjoy Gaskell's North and South - and especially the BBC North and South film available on dvd). Bronte doesn't integrate the political plot very well with the novel, but socio-economic factors considerably influence Robert's motives and relationships more and more as the story progresses. They also lend historical interest to the novel, and a bit of substance beyond the local color of minor individuals, the relationships between the main characters, and the very heartfelt inner life of Caroline.Although most other readers find the book slow reading, I in contrast could barely put it down.......but did skip over the \\"boring\\" parts resulting from too many minor characters (especially of a religious nature) being given too much space in the novel. But the stories of Caroline, Robert and Shirley are so engaging that the reader may indeed find the novel truly delightful, and the conclusion likewise highly satisfying."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Charlotte Bront's 1849 novel \\"Shirley\\" really delivers on the already realized potential of her first novel, \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Though the novel is named for the character Shirley Keeldar, the novel really has no one set protagonist - the duties are mostly shared in the relationship between the fiesty and wealthy Shirley, and the lovelorn Caroline Helstone. Set against a backdrop of social and economic unrest, as the swelling ranks of the unemployed react against increasing mechanization of mill production, \\"Shirley\\" takes in a broad range of national and international issues. Even when the personal and romantic narratives seem to dominate the novel, Bront does an extraordinary job of keeping the questions of social discontent present to the reader.\\"Shirley\\" opens on a view of Briarfield, a small mill community in Yorkshire, where the labourers are restless and hungry. The mill owners, Robert Moore and Hiram Yorke, are anxious with reports of murderous actions against mechanizing mill owners elsewhere, and suffering under governmentally restricted trade. The gentry are disaffected with the mill owners, and more concerned with England's continuing conflicts with Napoleon overseas. The main concerns of the novel revolve around all of these conflicts - conflicts of interest, conflicts between classes, and the wider conflicts of nations. Bront's social vision seems to ask throughout the novel if any of the normal sorts of personal problems even matter in the face of the sufferings of the masses.Briarfield's leading citizen is Reverend Helstone; he along with a motley mix of curates accurately represents the microcosmic problem that affects the macrocosm of England in the time of the novel, 1811-12. Helstone is rigidly hierarchical in his mindset, and suffers from a peculiar affliction as a religious man - a total lack of sympathetic attachment to the community he ministers to. His niece, Caroline, who stands to inherit no fortune, is singular also, in that her social standing coupled with her lack of money places her in an awkward position with regard to her potential love interest, Robert Moore. With the advent of the wealthy and independent Shirley, who attracts the affections and avarice, respectively, of Caroline and Robert, new avenues of personal tension enter the already conflicted society of Briarfield.Gender troubles are rife in the novel - from Shirley's adoption of the tone and stance of a masculine inheritor, a military captain, and a protector of Caroline; to the rabid misogyny of Reverend Helstone, Martin Yorke, and the curate Malone, among others; and the wild invectives against marriage from a variety of sources - Bront shows that regardless of intranational or international disputes, the seeds of discord are plentiful within the domestic spaces of potentially every English home. Bront examines the lack and need for strong maternal presence, emphasizing the fact that Shirley's parents are dead, and Caroline has never known her own mother, except as the butt of foul rumours. The gender-fueled critique in \\"Shirley\\" extends even to the characters' notions of the divine - the male religious authorities are contrasted with the oracular and ancient image of the feminine sibyl.\\"Shirley\\" may, in the end, be the name chosen for the novel, not because she is its main character, but because she symbolizes and embodies the social, political, gender, and ecological complexities and conundrums present throughout the novel. For a 600-page novel, \\"Shirley\\" is an incredibly quick and compelling read. Certainly, it deserves a wider readership and pays a close attention with fuel for consideration and thoughtful discussion."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"While I loved this book, there were some things I didn't like, but none that mean it doesn't deserve five stars. This is my favourite Charlotte Bronte book. i believe there is too much focus on Jane Eyre, or perhaps even Villette. There are a few coincidences in this story, especially one, which I can't mention without giving away part of the story. However these are common in CB, Villette being overun with them, and Jane Eyre ending up on the doorstep of her long lost cousins. Shirley is more believable. Another comment it the long speeches the characters often make. Apart from these though, this is one of my most loved books. It has been neglected, I feel, by the fact that the first 50 pages are very difficult to read, after that though, the story becomes apparent, and it's worth it. Something strange is that the heroine of the title doesn't appear, and is not mentioned until page 200, although she fairly dominates the rest of the book. Perhaps 'Shirley and Caroline' would have been a more appropriate title"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Despite Charlotte Bronte's disclaimer that the reader will find this book &quot;a dinner of bitter herbs&quot; it is nonetheless a must-read classic of 19th century litterature. Many themes combine in this book; the expansion of industrialism and the dissapearance of the English countryside; the place of women in society; feminine loyalty and friendship; the conflicts of love and work, evangelism and tradition. It is perhaps the most uneven and at the same time the most interesting of the Bronte books.While it lacks the symmetrically designed shape of Jane Eyre or the clear-eyed study of obsession of Villette, it lets the imaginative reader glimpse the Bronte sisters themselves between the lines. The characters of Shirley and Caroline are based on Emily and Anne Bronte, both of whose deaths occurred during the writing of the novel. It is a tribute to sisterly love and a fantasy that lashes back at grief. Some may find the ending a romantic cop-out, but this cannot detract from the many good qualities of this fascinating novel"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"An incredibly good book. It is full of Charlotte's wisdom -- She must have been a quiet and shy person in person, but in her writing she did not hesitate to state her opinions. Which she expressed very strongly with the classic English politeness.I this on the kindle I just got (did not want one, told everybody that, had one anyway for my birthday, and I absolutely love it!). First experience with the kindle, and I like its ability to easily look up words and jump to Google and Wikipedia. Plus its highlighting feature. Very nice machine! The first time I read Shirley was a few years ago, and I kept many pages of notes.Anyway, it can take a long time to get through Shirley and that is perfectly OK. Like all Bronte books, it is worth taking slow so you can absorb it. Critics have been hard on this novel, often comparing it unfavorably with Jane Eyre. All I can say is that if Shirley is read with an open mind, it is well worth the effort. Would be good to study the Luddites a bit, first, to understand the historical context."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I usually prefer Jane Austen over Charlotte Bronte, So I was surprised at how much I liked \\"Shirley\\". I definetly think that \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Villette\\" are given undue credit, while \\"Shirley\\" is underrated. Though \\"Shirley\\" was a strange choice for a title, because the main character is Caroline. This was a perfect book with just the right amount of romance, tragedy, and happy endings."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"After reading this novel, i couldn't understand why it wasnt as highly acclaimed as Jane Eyre, or even Villette....I think that Shirley would be my favorite novel by Charlotte Bronte, her other novels were written just as well as Shirley, but i feel that Shirley treaded on deeper issues than the others. Even though this might not be as popular as Charlotte Bronte's other works, I think that Shirley should be the one that you seek out first."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"To a reader who had no knowledge of Charlotte Bront, other than as the author of Jane Eyre, the beginning of this book would present a challenge. Such a reader would be surprised at the depth of the story and its seeming disregard of all romantic notions. Instead of introducing us to some pretty, sweet heroine, we are faced with the dangers of mob violence and the harshness of the main hero, the miller, Robert Moore. Politics also makes an entrance in the first few chapters, and the reader will find that the political and religious differences between the characters play an important role in the story.This is not to say that Shirley is not a romantic story. There are passages of such longing and despair, and even of the hope of love, that actually made me weep. The romance in this story is not petty or superficial. For those who feel that the object of their love is out of reach or is uncaring, there is utter heartbreak and the danger of wasting away. None of this feels contrived, however. Both the women and the men suffer almost equally, which feels more true to life.Another focus of this book is the oppression of women. There are many characters, both male and female, that object to the idea of women taking an active role in the public world. Women were confined to the home, and they were thought not to possess the mental capacity for business or politics. The two heroines, Caroline Helstone, the niece of a misogynistic rector, and Shirley Keeldar, the independent owner of substantial property, both, in their own separate ways, rebel against the restrictions that society has put on them. Caroline, rather than waste away in her uncle's rectory, quietly strives for some purpose in life, and determines to become a governess. Shirley, due to her more elevated place in society, forces the men around her, including Caroline's uncle and her tenant, Robert Moore, to take her seriously as a participant in the defense of her property, which includes the besieged mill run by Moore. She also rejects several suitable offers of marriage, declaring her intent to marry only for love.This book definitely does not focus on any one character. Shirley herself isn't introduced until about halfway into the book, and Caroline, Robert, and other principal characters go missing for chapters at a time. The result is a deeply felt story about a certain place in a volatile time, with all of the uncertainty and danger that the characters faced. There is no lack of character development; indeed, one gets to understand all of them. I recommend this book to any fan of nineteenth century literature, or to any history buff who is interested in learning about the personal side of the economic crisis in England during the Napoleonic Wars."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"At first glance, \\"Shirley\\" by Charlotte Bronte can seem a daunting read; it is nearly 650 pages long. However, the sheer artistry of Charlotte Bronte's genius makes mostly short work of the story she weaves throughout the course of this novel. Much longer than her other works, it retains her thorough intelligence of the world around her, as she comments on the society and persuasions of the day.To say that there is one or two main characters in \\"Shirley\\" is a slight understatement. While the novel does focus on the title character, a beautiful young rich heiress who soon finds herself with marriage proposals aplenty, it also spends much of its focus on the other main female of the book, Caroline Helstone, a shy and somewhat plain girl who fears the man she loves will fall in love with Shirley and leave her destitute. The narrative weaves between these two points of view, but also of the many other characters within the book, especially the object of Caroline's eye, Mr. Robert Moore. Moore is the owner of the local mill, hit upon hard times with the Napoleonic wars stopping his means of marketing. He must also contend with mobs and rioters, upset with the industrialization that has thrown many townspeople out of jobs.In that regard, the narrative of \\"Shirley\\" is much darker than that of Charlotte Bronte's other works. Those readers who know something about the author's life will find certain comments to spring from her actual existence, especially perhaps the similarities between her and Caroline. However, others unfamiliar with her style may find her prose wearisome at times. Indeed, there are moments when she waxes eloquently far off plot for several pages before bringing the story back to its true direction. The reader must read through several wrapping-ups before the true wrap-up of the story occurs.Yet these slight drawbacks do not taint the book, but add to the legend that is due Charlotte Bronte. She was a gifted writer, posing as a male in a man's world to get her books published. \\"Shirley\\" is full of the knowledge of its timeperiod, showing the intelligence of its author regarding the world around her. Bronte is able to offer insight and provocation without being preachy or sentimental, cloaking vindication in the form of poetic prose."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"The reason for the four stars is that I think it is not as good as Charlotte Bronte's best, the incomparable Jane Eyre. But it is, compared with most novels of today, very good indeed. The character of Shirley is wonderful. It is clear that Caroline is the protagonist, and that she is based on Charlotte herself and is therefore given the lion's share of attention. I consider this one of the book's few faults. The character of Robert Moore is beautifully drawn and I disagree with the editors that Louis is not. Although the device of the diary is a bit clumsy, the dialogue between Louis and Shirley is enthralling. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I liked this book because of the way Charlotte Brontewrites about nature; the heroine's experience ofthe moon and also of nature in general when she takeswalks--she experiences her surroundings,takesher time and really enjoys nature."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Charlotte Bront's Shirley is probably her third best novel. While its style is closer to social realism than Jane Eyre or Villette, it lacks the exciting development of a central heroine that is so delightful in her other major works. Shirley, in fact, has two female protagonists that are nearly opposite in character. Caroline is timid and uncertain. Shirley is headstrong and independent. In the end, both heroines seem to meet in the middle to become more balanced characters.Shirley is set against the backdrop of worker unrest during the Industrial Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, giving a fairly balanced depiction of the labor conflict that is interesting in its own right.Another drawback of Shirley is the pacing. The first half of the book is painfully slow, but it is still well worth reading.Bottom Line: Shirley is not Charlotte Bront's best novel, but it has two interesting heroines and an interesting backdrop of early nineteenth century labor unrest that is interesting in its own right.Read more of my reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Who is Shirley? Surely, it's the name of the main character of the story. Maybe it follows her life around the cloth mills mentioned on the back? Yeah, you'd think that, wouldn't you? Wrong! It takes half-way through chapter 11 (page 147 in my book) until Shirley is even mentioned. So okay, it takes a third into the book until the main character is introduced, fair enough (of sorts). Wrong! Shirley still isn't the main character. Neither is her former governess, the Moore brothers (and the Moore sister!), Caroline Helstone, or even one of those oft-mentioned parsons and curates.So what the deuce is it about? It's about all of them, and none. It's like a soap opera, or maybe rather one of those real-life documentaries. It doesn't really have a plot, it just sort of exists. It tells several people's stories and is more of \\"a day in the life of\\" than event A happens, causing event B to happen, leading to event C, D and E, then there's a plot twist and then they live happily ever after. More like event A happens, and event B (not related), then event C and D and E, which alludes to event B, and then F and finally G. Except it does actually have a plot twist or two, although the latter one turns out to be a false alarm. The first one is one of those extremely convenient coincidences. At least there's just the one in this book, and it's not too far-fetched, unlike the fair few in \\"Jane Eyre\\", which beggar belief.It's a story about love (although crikey did it take them long to finally get anywhere!), it's a story about the old clashing with the new (the mill riots), and it's a story which has a fair few things reminding me of Elizabeth Gaskell'sNorth and South: Helstone, a mill whose name ends with \\"-lborough\\", they're in \\"t' North\\" and hey, there's even a guy called Armitage, for good measure! Not to mention Charlotte Bront was actually born in a town called Thornton, and Elizabeth Gaskell was a friend of hers. I see a pattern.It's a charming story about times long past, and it's well told, but a bit unengaging - simply because it's just telling about how a bunch of people go about their daily lives, as opposed to, for instance, focusing on a story about a handsome mill-owner who finds a nice young lass to fall in love with, but oh the struggles they have to go through to get there. Like, you know,North & South. It's just a bit too scattered.That said, hats off to Charlotte Bront for being controversial for her time and for creating characters that stick with you. Her casual racism and French-flaunting is still there, of course - wouldn't be the same without it - because the Moores are half-Belgian. Luckily, there's not too much French in Shirley. Hooray!On the plus side, Shirley Keeldar - now there's a feminist statement! She's independent and has some very modern views, which I'm guessing were completely off the wall for the time it was written and published - not to mention set. This is supposed to be portraying 1812, so yes, it's really a big no-no for a girl to be as bold and feisty as she is. She doesn't conform to society's rules and when her uncle tries to get her to marry, she's having none of it. She'll pick a suitor herself, thank you very much, and she'll pick one she can love and respect, not just someone who has a fancy title. It might not be as shocking today, because we have come a long way in 200 years, but it's a good reminder that things used to be different. No, I like Shirley Keeldar as a character. She's probably the best thing about the book.It's not a reason for naming it after her, though. Not when the meeker and more traditional Caroline Helstone takes up just as much space. It gives the wrong impression. It's not a novel centered around a character called Shirley, she's just one of the ensemble. I'm not sure exactly which title would've fitted best, but even \\"Shirley & Caroline\\" would have been a more accurate title.A decent book, which I'm guessing there are lots of essays about with regards to feminism. (Go Charlotte Bront! Solidarity, sistah!) Still not an excellent book."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I have loved the Brontes books so far except for this one. It has some interesting characters and issues,but overall,it's not the first book from them I'd recommend. It does have some very relevant paasages that are quite feminist considering when it was written. I couldn't really sympathize with the main charactor because she had everything handed to her. Therefore(to me anyway), She lacked the empathy of a Jane Eyre or Lucy Snowe,whom really had to overcome life's obstacles,not being either rich or beautiful. Also,the ending seemed like a Jane Austen- ripoff, the overall tone of the book didn't seem to fit in with it.Read the others first before this one,she really was a great writer,this is just not the best example of her work."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"At the beginning of Shirley, Ms. Bronte addressess the reader by telling him/her not to expect a romantic tale. After the first couple of chapters, which give a general idea of the community, Bronte focuses on the two main love interests. She addresses serious concerns about the Luddite Riots and flaws in religious organization, but I see the novel as ultimately, a romance. Less Cinderella-esque than Jane Eyre, but still about self-denial and facing reality. The book has two heroines- Shirley is not introduced until almost halfway through."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I found that I had a difficult time getting into this novel. The first 200 pages (maybe a bit less) were absolute torture. The only thing that made me get through the beginning section was that I liked the characters of Caroline and Robert. This novel is as much, or more, Caroline's story as Shirley's, actually. I'm quite sure that if someone were to do an analysis of which character (Shirley/Caroline) had the most &quot;air time&quot; in the book, Caroline would come out on top. The book is about their relationship and how they impact each other's life. It's also a social history that gives the reader insight into the political upheaval of the Napoleonic Wars, and the economics of the time.I couldn't get interested in the political/economic undertones of the book. My edition doesn't have a preface/introduction to give me the necessary background so that I could understand the issues presented. As the book is written, a certain degree of previous knowledge is assumed and required to really understand the historical context of the book. There are alot of secondary characters, and it was hard to keep them all straight. A list of characters in the beginning, as is provided in Jane Austen's Emma, would've helped me keep it straight. Also, I needed a glossary/footnotes to translate the French in the book.The book seemed to slip back and forth between being about men, women, relationships, and the two main romances (won't give away which characters are involved in them) on the one hand, to being about the politics/economics/history on the other. The two issues aren't particularly merged successfully.I did like the female characters. They were much more effectively drawn and multidimensional than the male ones. In fact, the male characters seemed really unimportant and secondary. The novel had a few surprising, upredictable twists I liked, too.In summary, this is a good, not great book. If you like Bronte, I think you owe it to yourself to read it.

We share with her two heroines the pain, the laughter, the love. We, along with them, perceive valuable truths as they aspire to reach their ultimate goals - self-discovery and love. This novel overflows with passion and awakens the soul. It's a definite Must Read!"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Slow reading and important characters do not start appearing all at the same time but into 1/3 of story or 3/4 of story. Does Caroline have the capacity to understand Shirley, notwithstanding the fact that Caroline feels hurtful. Shyness is a virtue in Japan but I can understand that it may seem like pride and grievance tinged with envy. Ending was exhilerating b/c of movement based on equality and b/c Bronte is forthright in laying out why marriage works sometimes."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"In contrast with her great romance &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Charlotte Bronte claims at the outset of this book that it is a social novel. The story is the struggle of Robert Gerard Moore to gain wealth once more for his once wealthy family. He is a reformer and uses the latest technology (mills) and this causes massive unemployment for a poor population that have little chance of getting employment elsewhere. The main point and the relevance of this great novel lies in this. It is a great attempt to answer the question of harmonizing social justice with economic aspirations. Well, there are two ladies in the novel. And their affairs with Robert Moore are also mentioned but they are not at the center of the novel. A very clever and inspiring book. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"This is an interesting novel but it is not a good purchase for the general reader. The Penguin version has a good introduction by Lucasta Miller with a number of interesting bits of information and notes on the novel and the Bronte sisters in general.This novel was published in 1849 and it follows \\"Jane Eyre\\" in 1847. Readers will be very disappointed if they expect to find a similar book to \\"Jane Eyre\\" since the book is not a compelling read. The book is good, but it is very diffuse with too much talk and not enough action. It seems to wander for the first 200 pages or so and then it picks up a bit as it follows the lives of the two female characters Shirley Keeldar and Caroline Helstone - after they are introduced part way through the novel. Up to their introduction, the novel drifts as the author jumps from one character to the other: in the opening chapters it is centered on a few members of the clergy and a struggling mill owner. The novel could be called \\"Caroline\\" since she and Shirley are equally important to the story as it evolves later in the book.Charlotte Bronte has attempted to create a historical novel that describes the life in northern England during the Napoleonic wars. Mostly she describes the lives of two women starting around page 200, but it evolves by the end into something similar to a Jane Austen novel. In addition to these two female characters, we have various clergy and merchants brought into the story to permit the author to inject political and social commentary. Bronte is a conservative feminist and we see those ideas in some of her characters and the story.In the beginning on page 1, Bronte warns the reader that this is not a light and entertaining novel. She says: \\"Do not anticipate sentiment, poetry, and reverie.\\" That is not quite accurate since the book does contain poetry and by the last chapter - 600 pages later - it seems to evolve into a conventional but slow paced novel; she dwell on the marriage of the two female characters in the last chapter.Following on the success of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" the author did not have any trouble getting her manuscript published. In retrospect it could have used a good edit. Shirley does not appear until page 189, and one wonders if she was selected after the fact. It starts off as a commentary on the social and political times, but is carried for the last 400 pages by the lives of the two female protagonists. Some critics think that Bronte was distracted by the death of her two sisters, Emily and Anne, during the writing and that is a partial explanation for the form of the novel and its lack of focus.So, in summary, this is an interesting novel but not a great read. It is a book more for Bronte fans rather than someone looking for a good novel for entertainment."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"O.k. So, this isn't a perfectly constructed book. During the writing of this novel, Charlotte Bronte had her entire family dying around her so I can hardly blame her for different parts of the book having different tones. DONT LET THE FIRST CHAPTERS PUT YOU OFF! They're a little dry --> but it flourishes as it bounds along.The main oddity to the novel is the fact that the people that are set up in the very beginning, are not alluded to again [e.g. the vicars], and the people that we get to know and love in the middle of the book [Caroline and Robert] are not necessarily the focus at the end of the book. There are also strong characters that are set up in some chapters and not really developed into a storyline later on, e.g. Mr Yorke.The story is wrriten similar to a George Eliot's style -->so if you like her plots etc, then you'll probably really enjoy this. Think Middlemarch meets Daniel Deronda.HOWEVER, caveats aside - the book is fantastic. You don't get to read prose like Charlotte's everyday. Honestly, that woman could be having the worst writing day of her life and still leave all the modern writers for dead. She really captures characters and lanscapes in a way that is truly beautiful. Shirley the girl is wonderful, and you won't be able to help falling in love with her. She really is a memorable [and very progressive] character.Bronte warns at the start that the book is not romantic in nature, but I beg to disagree. The story revolves around Robert - a struggling mill owner, Caroline, a young girl who lives with her disinterested uncle, and Shirley, a rich, strong-willed, beautiful heiress. In the mix is also Shirley's ex-governess and Robert's intellectual brother, Louis Moore. The story is set around the time of the industrial revolution in England [earlt 1800s] and deals with the difficulties faced by the different sets of society during the time.I've got a few quotes that I loved:\\"the minds of the girls [caroline and shirley] being toned in harmony often chimed very sweetly together\\"\\"[Mrs Sympson]...had been brought up on a narrow system of views, starved on a few prejudices - a mere handful of bitter herbs; a few preferences, soaked till their natural flavour was extracted, and with no seasoning added in the cooking; some excellent principles, made up in a stiff crust of bigotry difficult to digest\\"Can't get much better than that imo :)"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"An unpredictable plot, excellent character development, and many elements of wisdom from Charlotte Bronte. I greatly enjoyed this novel, much as I did Jane Eyre and Villette. In all honesty, this is a book that would not be for everyone. However, for those who greatly like Charlotte Bronte's works, it is a great read."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"An engaging, multi-faceted novel, which wonderfully and realistically depicts women's feelings and thoughts. I was surprised by how much I could relate to! Shirley is especially lovely- thoughtful, brave, a great friend. Yet, I could not help but feel that her object of affection was beneath her. That is the only real flaw of the novel in my opinion."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Bronte's Shirley was written two years after Jane Eyre took Victorian England by storm. Some reviews were harsh and those who cared for the beloved author took care to hide reviews which might bring tears to her eyes.Shirley is entirely different from Jane Eyre. Set during the Napoleonic wars, it focuses on a group of individuals, instead of one heroine like she did in Jane Eyre.If you are a devoted Bronte fan like myself, I urge you to not let the first few chapters keep you from the gold that is not far behind. The first half of the book is rather trying. One begins to wonder why the novel was entitled Shirley since no such character appears until a few hundred pages. Instead, the novel focuses on a pair of rude and gossipy curates and the troubles of mill owner Robert Moore. It takes a while, but slowly all players in the novel are gradually introduced.The character of Shirley Keedlar was in fact inspired by Charlotte Bronte's sister, Emily, author of Wuthering Heights. Shirley is a beautiful but fiery heiress who bewitches and impacts many lives throughout the novel. Bronte claimed that Shirley Keedlar lives the life that Emily might have lived had she been happy and healthy.As I read the book, I attempted to piece together which characters were inspired by Bronte's real aquaintances. It is well known that the characters in Shirley were inspired from a small pool of people Charlotte Bronte socialized with. When her novel was released, many people recognized themselves in the novel, she was highly embarassed, but most of the people who inspired the characters found it all very amusing.I was not wrong when I assumed that Caroline Helston, an orphan living with her uncle in a desolate parsonage has a little bit of Charlotte in her. Caroline secretly loved her cousin, Robert Moore, who unaware of her feelings, hurts her deeply by his aloofness.The first part of the book was a little dull, but at one point in the novel it becomes impossible to put down. Bronte fans will see so much of our beloved novelist in Caroline that you won't be able to resist losing your heart to her.When Charlotte Bronte began writing this novel, she found it incredibly difficult to write. However, the death of her brother and sisters left a void that only writing could fill. This becomes apparent in the heartfelt manner the last half of the book was written. Jane Eyre is most Bronte fans favorite novel, but Charlotte found Shirley superior to Jane Eyre. The latter is still my favorite, but anyone who is a fan of Jane Eyre must read this wonderful novel, which was written during such an emotional time in Charlotte Bronte's life."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"While not as romantic as _Jane Eyre_ or as perfectly-realized as _Villette_, _Shirley_ is in some ways Charlotte Bronte's most interesting novel for the modern reader. It grapples convincingly with feminist issues like female independence and freedom of action, dramatized by the title character (modeled on Charlotte's sister Emily) and her best friend Catherine. Also, in writing a historical novel of the Luddite rebellions, Bronte took on class issues boldly and quite successfully: any writer including Dickens would have to envy her artful, evocative rendering of conflict between early 19th century English merchants and laborers. The romantic ending is rather contrived, as she tried to reassure herself and her readers that hope is possible despite life's tragedies (her sisters Emily and Anne died while Charlotte was writing _Shirley_). My personal favorite of Bronte's work; a good bet for anyone who's willing to try a 19th century novel"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Shirley, Charlotte Bronte's second novel, was published in 1849. Charlotte apparently thought it would be wildly successful like Jane Eyre, but alas, it wasn't that big of a hit. I feel bad for her because Branwell, Emily, and Anne all died while she was writing it. But...I'm not a huge fan of the book either.The novel is quite different from all of her others- it's told by an omniscient, 3rd person narrator, it's set during the Napoleonic Wars, it follows two heroines, and it's part social commentary/part Romance. Well, Charlotte only set it in the past because she didn't want to cause controversy by commenting on contemporary issues, and it doesn't really \\"feel\\" like a Regency novel, so that part doesn't quite count, but you get the point. The two heroines are Caroline Helstone, a quiet girl living with her uncle, and Shirley Keeldar, an independent, free-spirited young woman. The two become friends when Shirley moves to Caroline's Yorkshire town. Caroline is in love with her half-cousin, half-Belgian, Robert Moore, the local mill owner. But Robert proposes to Shirley (for her money), who rejects him. Oh, and Robert's brother was Shirley's tutor, with whom she constantly bickers. Along with the love triangle is the trouble at the mill. Robert ignores his workers' problems and they riot and try to kill him.Shirley was hit and miss with me. I enjoyed the love story, but I thought the book needed better editing. There was a lot of superfluous information. For example, the first chapter goes into detail about the town's three curates at dinner- including their personalities and eating habits. It was so hard for me to even get through this and continue the book! And guess what, these three curates are VERY MINOR characters who don't serve much of a purpose in the story at all. I guess there was supposed to be symbolic meaning or something like that, but I guess I'm too stupid to figure it out. As it is, the book is over 600 pages, but I think a good third of that could have been cut out.It also bothered me that once again, Charlotte had to show her prejudices of anything anti-English and Anglican- the French/Belgians are bad, the Catholics/Methodists are bad, etc. It's really ridiculous. I know these prejudices were very common at the time but Charlotte really isn't even subtle about showing it in her writing. It's just tiresome to read about.Okay, so ignoring all of the prejudices and the extra detail, we have just the love story to look at. Admittedly, I found it enjoyable to read about, even if it did follow the usual Victorian cliches, like illnesses and coincidences. But there was one major thing that bothered me...Possible Spoilers!Shirley, throughout the book, can be seen as an empowering, feminist character. Her parents are dead and she is rich- she runs her own life. But after she falls in love, she and her betrothed agree that she will now leave ALL decisions to him. Shirley no longer wants to have that sort of power and they both think it will be better to let her husband control everything. I know this was written in the Victorian era, but really? I thought it was over the top, even for back then."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"How have I gotten this far in life without ever hearing of \\"Shirley?\\" I always loved \\"Jane Eyre,\\" of course, and then recently discovered \\"Villette,\\" which I also adored with its gothic study in contrasts. \\"Shirley\\" is a fascinating story, another study of opposites and closer to Jane Austen's works in wit and social commentary, but still showcasing Bronte's brilliant use of dialogue, drama, romance, and of course, near-fatal illnesses. Where \\"Villette\\" focused chiefly on religion (Catholic vs. Protestant), \\"Shirley\\" is surprisingly--and refreshingly--feminist. The often light-hearted tone belies the personal tragedy she was experiencing as she wrote the novel (the back-to-back deaths of her brother and two sisters); perhaps she needed some levity and hope during that dark time. I finished the book a few weeks ago, and I miss the characters already!"},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I read Jane Eyre when I was very young (thirteen). Loved it then, but didnt understand everything. I recently reread it (loved it more) and trough amazon found out Charlotte Bronte has written a lot more. Schocking for me. I inmediately started researching Charlotte Bronte on the web and found out she has written the novels Shirly, The Professor and Vilette. Now, after reading those as if my life depended on it I am left with a sense of longing for more. But helas, knowing there can be no more I cherrisch her works of art even more.Shirley and Caroline are both heroins I can relate to. Shirley strong and independant (extravert), Caroline sweet and shy (introvert). In this novel both meet their respective others. Both being the opposite of themselves, but just what they need to find love and peace in mind and soul. Somehow this story appealed more to me becouse it could be real. It could be me ore you and nobody would suspect it was a story told from a novel, if you know what I mean. What I like furthermore are the few moments of romance that touches the soul. It is enough to fill you. In the end Carolines hero askes her a question wich she answers so simply, yet so wonderfull. It gave me chills.I have to say that I enjoy the regency romances of contemporary writers too, but I am beginning to dislike the enormous amounts of explicit sex in them (especially Stephanie Laurens latest works). That is not what makes a romance .. a romance."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"Charlotte Bronte's condition of England novel \\"Shirley\\" wa published following her big literary hit \\"Jane Eyre.\\" The novel has always had mixed reviews and is slow moving and episodic in content.The first part of the novel deals with the budding love between Caroline Helstone and Robert Moore. Caroline is the niece of a sober minded clergyman the Rev. Helstone. During the course of the tale she learns that Shirley's lady maid Mrs. Pryor is her mother. Caroline is painted in colors much like those of Charlotte Bronte. Like Charlotte she too plans on becoming a governess, lives in a restricted stait-laced Calvinist home and is a Tory in politics. Caroline loves the handsome Belgian born mill owner Robert Moore. Moore is not as well drawn as Bronte's Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre or sister Emily Bronte's Byronic antihero \\"Heathcliff\\" in Wuthering Heights.The second half of the book deals with Caroline's best friend the wealthy Shirley Keeldar who is based on the strong masculine and forceful character of Emily Bronte. Shirley is courted by several country swains but falls in love with the impecunious tutor Louis Moore, the brother of mill owner Robert Moore.The only real action of the story occurs when Robert Moore's mill is attacked by a mob of workers. The novel is set in the time of the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century when England suffered through crop failures. During the book all three of the major charactersCaroline, Shirley and Moore have health issues. Caroline is ill with a fever; Shirley is bitten by a dog and Moore is almost assasinated by an irate farmer who wants to destroy the mill.The plot is disjointed and seems to lose focus as the reader plows through the over 500 pages of this Victorian novel. Bronte does do well in describing the Yorkshire countryside. Her use of Yorkshire dialect is well done and her knowledge of church/village life is commendable.The book lacks the wit and repartee of a Jane Austen novel. Stick to Jane Eyre for Bronte at her best! Until the novel was published \\"Shirley\\" was a masculine name. This is a good book but not a great one."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Tenant of Wildfell Hall, I have to say Shirley is a disappointment. It was long, drawn out and at times very BORING. I really had to work to finish it; the others I breezed through because they were so good. I won't go into a dissertation about the book but it does not stand up to the other Bronte work."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I found the first 50 pages very hard going. I wondered where the author was taking me, but soon things emerged into the story form she was creating and I began to enjoy this book very much. Her style of writing is very different from the other Englishauthors of the period, but I have come to appreciate her and also her sisters work very much. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"\\"Shirley\\", originally published in 1849, was Charlotte Bront's first novel after \\"Jane Eyre\\", and it is very different from that Gothic masterpiece. There is no forbidding landlord housing a dark secret and there is no frothing madwoman in the attic setting fires. Yes, there is one of those family-mystery revelations that the Victorians were so fond of, but otherwise this is a realistic study of pastoral life in Northern England, a sort of precursor to the works of George Eliot (though I personally don't believe Charlotte's talent ever reached that of the author of \\"Adam Bede\\"), a rather somber tale of people living under the shadow of the Napoleonic Wars and dealing with the changes wrought by the early years of the Industrial Revolution. The political aspects of the story are only lightly touched on; this is not a historical novel. The dramatis personae is large, and the title character is introduced only after 200 pages. There are two female protagonists, Caroline Helstone, the niece of the local rector, and Shirley Keelgar, the heiress to the Fieldhead manor where much of the action takes place, along with parishes adjoining Stilbro' Moor. (Though the setting is Yorkshire, where Charlotte was raised, the locales in this novel are fictitious.) The two young women are close in age and become friends, even though their personalities are very different. For anyone who has read Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bront it should be obvious that Charlotte used her sister Emily as the model for Shirley. Granted, Emily, like Caroline , suffered painful shyness, but she also had Shirley's bluntness, her somewhat overbearing manner. Shirley (note: in the 19th Century this was more often than not a masculine first name) is called the Captain, just as Emily was called the Major, and at one point she commits the indiscretion of whistling like a boy. There is also the mastiff named Tartar owned by Shirley, reminding us of the bulldog kept at Haworth Parsonage and sternly controlled by Emily. Of the Bront sisters, Emily was the garon manqu&eacute;, and, in his beautiful essay on \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Somerset Maugham gently suggests she was sapphic. (By the way, Charlotte, who lived in Brussels, will be testing your French.)Both Caroline and Shirley must deal with some unpleasant male characters, men of the early 19th Century feeling that \\"dolls\\" or \\"monkeys\\" were only fit for feeding and clothing others -- and increasing the population, of course, which is why they had such contempt for spinsters. In the pivotal Chapter XXXI, Shirley is accosted by her uncle for daring to reject a baronet's proposal: \\"Are you a young lady?\\" he demands, to which Shirley replies: \\"I am a thousand times better. I am an honest woman, and as such I will be treated.\\" You can almost hear the suffragettes cheering. The book is quite long and could be easily condensed, upholstered as it is with the \\"padding\\" common to an era when authors were paid by the page. The intertwining two love stories become complex, as the reader tries to decide which of the heroines is going to pair off with which of two Flemish brothers serving as heroes. Also, Charlotte's prose sometimes gets a bit too precious. I mean, when a character enters a room \\"The door unclosed\\". Is that anything like \\"The door opened\\"? But readers interested in Victorian fiction and the Bronts in particular will probably be patient with these idiosyncrasies and find \\"Shirley\\" a consistently rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I own several copies of this book, leather bound, collectors editions and this one for handling and reading and now a FREE copy on my Kindle Fire HD.

Some 500 pages worth. A bargain to say the least."},{"Title":"Shirley","review":"I struggled with this novel, trying very hard to find something to like about it, but after reading 20 of 37 chapters, I gave up. It is a dead and deadening read. The problem begins with one of the central characters, Caroline Helstone, who appears first and remains solo for the first quarter of the novel. Caroline is an insipid young woman, cherishing a naive love for a neighborhood mill owner Robert Moore but deferring to the wishes of the overbearing preacher uncle who raised her when he tells her to stop associating the Moore family. How could the author who created feisty Jane Eyre think that such a missish character could engage the reader's heart or interest? Part of the problem may be Bronte's omniscient narration, which prevents us from really sharing Caroline's emotions -- we're always on the outside looking in. However, it's a larger problem than point of view because even the arrival of the livelier and more interesting Shirley Keeldar couldn't rescue this novel for me. Bronte is trying for panoramic sweep in her depiction of the labor unrest in Yorkshire when new-fangled high-tech (for the day) looms put many millworkers out of jobs. But she places her reader at a remove from the most exciting events. The interception and destruction of the new machines by disgruntled labor activists during their transport to the mill occurs offstage. The attack of Robert Moore's mill is depicted from afar through the eyes of Shirley and Caroline, who watch the mayhem from a distant hiding place. Meanwhile, Bronte's telegraphing of information reduces some of her plot twists to mere gimmicks -- the true identity of Shirley's former governess and the true owner of Shirley's affections. The Brontes can be exciting writers, but this is one Bronte novel to leave on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The reason that I read this book is so that I could have some background knowledge to help me understand the book's movie, once it comes out this winter. The book certainly fulfills that purpose, and is a very good book as well, but there are some problems with Tolkien's writing that made it harder to read than it should be.I'm sure that, with all the positive reviews (...), you're already aware of all the better parts of the story, so before I say those opinions for myself, let me say what's not so great about it: pacing problems. The first hundred pages of the book are used solely to provide the backstory, when this could probably have been done in 50 pages. And although the action sequences in the Mines of Moria are appropriately fast-paced, this was done at the expense of one of these scenes making immediate sense- very unfortunate, seeing as this particular scene is practically the climax of the book. And I really wish that the last chapter had just been left out; it feels more like a poorly-worded attempt at starting the next book than an ending. But note that I'm only noting three problems with the book. Those were the only problems that I could identify, and that's saying something about the quality of the rest of the book. Great characters, a consistent world, and generally lots of innovation make me glad I read this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I was just checking this site out for the first time, and I have to leave this comment, those who said this novel is boring should learn the virtue of patience and understanding. The first portion of the book many claim to be boring, in fact it is just slow and is imperative to developing the deep rich story to unfold, much like Stephen King does in his novels(whadda you know he's the most reknowned author of Horror in the world!)so they are quite obviously a key component to the story, while in many novels I read I was left to guess about a character or there were just flat characters. This book will go down in history along with it's other companions. The number of publications Tolkien's many works have recieved is proof of the quality of his work which has set the standard for fantasy writing, which remains unparalleled to this day. Few authors compare to Tolkien, but these in my opinion come closest. Terry Brooks, David Eddings and the duo(Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman). There are many other authors which you already know who write forgettable novels. Tolkien's works are unforgettable and I haven't read this trilogy for 5 or 6 years, when I was in 6th or 7th grade and I only read it once, and I can recall that I did not want it to end, for several days afterward I would just lay flabbergasted on my bed after school and in the morning and dream about the vivid characters and places which Tolkien had unfolded me, I can still remember the entire story after not having turned a page since the years I read it. I have read many other fantasy books and most I found to be the same predictable formula which quickly becomes boring. Sticking through with the remainder of this series you will discover for yourself how Tolkien stands apart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkein has created a world of hobbits, elves, dwarfs and wizards that's so real you feel you're reading a history book. Unfortunately, I wanted to read the rollicking good tale that Tolkein buried with plodding details of topography, weather, and history instead. The pacing is so off that several chapters are given to a character that has nothing to do with the plot, while a pivotal scene involving Galdalf is told as a puny, bland page or two flashback. Luckily, the movie excavated the story and showed us what this book could have been if Tolkein was as skilled at storytelling as he was at world inventing."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I wanted to love this book, but it just didn't happen. I liked it up until about 2/3 of the way through. Tolkien has a keen imagination and a talent for making the reader want to believe in his creations. But there's also an undramatic over-reliance on exposition in his writing that needlessly bogs down the story, ultimately putting a wedge between the characters and reader (at least this one).I wasn't wild about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but still wanted to give the world of Middle Earth another try. I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a pretty good little adventure-quest story spoiled by a not so great ending.I had a similar experience with &quot;Fellowship&quot;. For the first couple hundred pages, Tolkien had me. &quot;Fellowship&quot; wasn't the best book I'd ever read, but I was certainly immersed in the world, and was enjoying turning the pages.You'll have to excuse me for going to the Titanic for a fitting metaphor, but that's the only thing I can think of at the moment. I felt like the book hit its iceberg at the Meeting of Elron, about 2/3 of the way through.The fun-if-slow-going story comes to a screeching halt as Tolkien goes into mind-numbing hyper-exposition mode for close to 30 pages. The story continues on after that, but falteringly--the fatal damage has already been done. The book just gets heavier and heavier after that, until it just can't stay afloat.There are some great passages and concepts in &quot;Fellowship&quot; (I especially liked the psychological insitefulness Tolkien displays in having the ring possess its possessor). But there is a distance in the way that Tolkien writes his characters that just kept me from becoming fully engaged."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkien's book is undoubtedly the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.Peter Jackson's films are a masterful and enthralling adaptation.Rob Inlglis's unabridged narration is a worthy and thoroughly enjoyable audio experience.But this 'dramatization' is so horrendously awful that I couldn't even get through the first CD!The Hobbits sound like demented Chipmunks...

First of all let me alucidate you little ass, Jackson who made the movies wrote the scrip after tolkien died. Tolkien wrote the book and then there was a movie. Not too bright are ya. As for this other kid, he did not know how to spell most of the words he wrote. I mean yeah sure everyone mispells, but this kid had his whole review writen like a 5 year old. There was this other kid who did not know the plot. He said that frodo was killed on the 170th page, and gandalf was eaten by zombies. I know WTF. As for the rest of you I know this book is long and tedious. But hey guess what when you get to high school, I'm not speaking about zombie boy, or dislexia lad, you will read not only this sucker, but the iliad,the odessy, excuse, and all the real epic classics. In general this is a good warm up to those books. But if you want to keep on reading level 2 books like 'the little train that could' or 'curious george' hey it is 100% o.k with me.

The reason I started reading it was that I heard that Led Zeppelin (my favorite band) got some of their lyrics from these books. Everytime I came across something that reminded me of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; or &quot;The Battle of Evermore,&quot; I couldn't put the book down! I reccomend this book to only avid readers who can stick it out till the end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This, being the first part of a trilogy, was long in itself. Four hundred and ten pages, and the pages contain about twice as much as a normal page. The writing is also very, very descriptive and imagery takes the center stage, so many readers (child and adult alike) will struggle with this book. Many will even put it down and deem it unreadable, much like I did the first two time I began it. This book is only for very patient readers. That being said, it's a classic.Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting. The story itself is marvelous, and has shaped the entire genre of fantasy into what it is today. Without Tolkien, all of this \\"world-making\\" going on would have never seen the light of day, so pay homage where homage is due. Not only is this work legendary, it is also very entertaining.The tone grows increasingly dark as the novel progresses, but not awkwardly so. It seems fitting that as the valiant fellowship gets closer and closer to Mordor, the lair of the evil Sauron, that the subject matter should get heavier and the mood should darken. Speaking of the fellowship, Tolkien describes them in such a way that we get closer to all nine members. We get inside their brains and feel how they feel, and especially see what they see.I look forward to \\"The Two Towers\\" and, especially, some more dialogue from Mr. Gollum himself.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is good for anybody who has the patience to sit down to read a fantasy book, a long one.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.The story goes like this: Sixty years after \\"The Hobbit\\", Bilbo prepares to celebrate his \\"eleventy first\\" [that's 111 years] birthday. But after that, he wants to leave the Shire to go to Rivendell [I think.] So he performed a disappearing act using his Ring, and leaves everything to his heir, Frodo Baggins. Frodo learns from Gandalf the Grey that the Ring is the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron! He also learns that the \\"Black Riders\\", servants of Sauron, are coming to reclaim the Ring and give it to the resurrected Sauron. So Frodo goes on a quest with his gardener Sam, and two mischievous Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, to destroy the One Ring.[I know this isn't the best plot summary, but I tried.]This book is a bit different and longer than the movie. There is more detail and plot twists in the book than there is in the movie, and at a whopping 423 pages, this will keep you busy. The version I'm reviewing came with a foldable map of Middle-earth! This book is a masterpiece in literature, plain and simple!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This isn't really the kind of book I would usually read but I had some time on my hands so I went into the library and picked it up and gave it a try.

The rings were magical and had bound in them the strength and will to rule. They were all deceived because the giver of this great knowledge was Sauron. Sauron then forged a powerful ring to rule all. Sauron takes advantage of this new knowledge by conquering Middle Earth. But not all resisted to Sauron. There were men who fought against Sauron to destroy his powerful and ominous empire. There was a great battle in Middle Earth. The battle was fought for the freedom of the men and other creatures for Middle Earth. During the battle, Isildur, heir of the throne of Gondor cut the Sauron's powerful ring from his hand. Isildur then tries to use the ominous power of the ring to perform the acts of good. One day Isildur was heading toward Minis Tirith, his home city, when an orc killed him. The ring left him. The ring was then lost, until a hobbit named Bilbo found the one ring of power.... If you want to find out the rest of the story, read the book!I loved the book for its exquisite details and amazing plot! This book will awe readers' imaginations. It gives readers a sense of hope as Frodo pursues to destroy the ring of power. I have learned the learned many things from this book, including the value of friendship, loyalty, and companionship."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When Tolkien began writing The Lord of the Rings, it was supposed to be a sequel to The Hobbit. But Tolkien wanted to write a myth on an epic scale, and he could not resist allowing his story to grow from a simple children's tale to the greatest fantasy saga of modern times.The transition is a little strange. The first half of this book is written in a tone similar to The Hobbit, so it seems somewhat juvinile. However, by the time we get to the chapter The Council of Elrond (about half-way through the book), the story becomes much more serious and adult in nature. And yet this works, because we see the great events depicted in the story through the eyes of the hobbits, who begin as innocent, sheltered country-folk, and end up as worldly adventurers. It is a story about growth. It is also about loss, death, and the passing of great beauty from the world.Fellowship is the first part of three, and in my opinion the least of the three. It certainly has its moments: The Mines of Moria chapter (particularly Gandalf the Wizard's confrontation with the monstrous Balrog) is fantastic, and Boromir's confrontation with Frodo over the Ring is extremely powerful. But I give Fellowship only four stars where the other parts in the trilogy will get five.Please read this book. If you've only seen the movies (which I loved, by the way), you only know part of the story. And although the books get better, you must start here, at the beginning. Better yet, start with The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Umm, hello? To people out there who said that they &quot;came to know every Elf, Tree, Stream, Ent, Rock, Dirt Clod, Hobbit. . .etc.&quot; and that they &quot;nearly danced a merry jig when Boromir died&quot; did you read another cheap copy of Tolkien or something? Are you talking about Terry Brooks and one of his characters of a similar name???Ok, I read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; before I ever read anything by Brooks. Well, actually, I read the first 80-some pages of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; first but at that point I had already seen the movie &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; plus, I owned it and watched it many times in a row. I found Brooks' book to be TEDIOUS, BORING, A COPY and TOOOOOOOO DESCRITIVE. Then, after I saw &quot;The Return of the King&quot; I immediately started reading the LOTR trilogy. I LOVED IT! The descriptions were not boring AT ALL! Plus, may I remind the person who so mistakingly wrote the review I am referring to, THERE ARE NO ENTS IN THE FIRST BOOK!!! Merry and Pippin had not yet gotten separated from the rest of the Fellowship long enough to escape the Orcs and meet the Ents!Anyways, I found the descriptions all to be relevant, there was not a WORD out of place! Tolkien truly IS the Fantasy Master of anyone's time! I mean, why else would so many people try to copy him and end up doing such a poor job of it? It's disgusting. Truly, J.R.R. Tolkien brought us a new world of wonder, fear, hope and triumph and at a time when believing in success over a great evil was so important! Tolkien saw World War II, he saw a great darkness spreading over the land from East and West and he saw it ultimately conquered by people who had faith in Justice and Freedom.I found these books to be so entertaining, they really drew me in! I finished the first two within a matter of days. Unfortunately, Return of the King took longer because I had to start college again after Holiday break. However, the books are, believe it or not, better than the movies! I believe that if you have not read the books yet you should watch the movies first, then when you read the books you will be able to picture all the people and places even more clearly. Although Tolkien does a superb and INTERESTING job of detailed descriptions that are DEVOID of boredom!He was able to create a real and interesting dialogue between characters, and you can really sense the strong bonds of friendship between Sam and Frodo, along with Merry and Pippin and of course Gandalf. I felt that I knew these characters like old, trusty friends, the same feeling I had with all the people in C.S. Lewis' &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. I also liked that the trilogy was all about the continuing adventures of our friends and NOT their descendants! I have complaints with Brooks about that. (Three dark powers, three sets of &quot;friends&quot;, three hopeless quests: all carbon copies). With him, he stops when we get to know the characters and starts out again with their carbon copies in the form of descendants.With Tolkien, we know all of the people, their dialogue is always relevant, interesting and real, the descriptions are precise, to the point and necessary, AND the storyline is ORIGINAL!!! Tolkien wrote the Epic Adventure first, remember that, all you who think Tolkien is just yet another fantasy writer of a particular genre. When he wrote, HE was original, all the hordes of others came in the footsteps of Tolkien.Again, Tolkien had a flair for language; after all, he was a professor of that subject! He knew his stuff, and he was able to write wonderful relationships between people; he could make you feel the struggles and suffering; he brought a vivid world into my mind that has not disappeared! More people than not definitely know how good he was, judging from the fact that both a cartoon series and the recently done cinematic films have been made. Tell me where all of these are for Terry Brooks?The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is an epic for all time. It tells how the &quot;little people&quot; can triumph over seemingly insurmountable obstacles! These books should be treasured as a symbol of ultimate triumph! They are not just fantasy books, they are hope and courage for those who feel that hope had deserted them. They are encouragement for people of all Races, Ages and Denominations! And all of this is wrapped up in a GREAT storyline!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo Baggins inherits the One Ring which his uncle stole from Gollum. He thought it was cool to have the &quot;The One Ring&quot;. Until Gandalf (the wizard) teaches him a little bit more about the Ring and finds out it makes you grow attached to it and then corrupts you. Gandalf told Frodo to keep it secret until Gandalf returned. Gandalf returns and tells Frodo what it really meant and that it is meant to get thrown into the Cracks of Doom. Which is the only place where it can be destroyed. Out of Frodos the Cracks of Doom are in the middle of the evil kingdom Mordor where Sauron is trying to get back his power, trying to find the one Ring that Frodo has, and destroying all good. Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam journey to Bree where they meet Aragorn the Ranger and eventually to Rivendell, all the while pursued by the Ringwraiths. There in Rivendell the Fellowship was more developed: Gimili the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and Borimir of Gondor joined the team. I think with this group they will be able to get the job done.J.R.R. has great writing. And once you finish the first book you want to go onto the second book. I would definitely give &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; 5 stars. It is fabulous."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of The Ring is the first volume in the Lord of the Rings trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien. This is one of the greatest epic fantasy books of all time! We are introduced to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins who has just discovered this one ring is no ordinary ring but a very powerful dark force. This ring was forged long ago by a very dark and powerful lord, who lost the ring and will stop at nothing to once again claim its great power and rule all of Middle Earth.I really enjoyed this book partly because Tolkien uses such vivid and lifelike detail to describe the settings and the characters. It was hard to get used to the strange names and the places, but after the first couple chapters you knew exactly what he was referring too. Then it was so easy to put yourself in the same places and feel as though you were part of the story. I especially liked the way he describes the elves and Rivendale. When he describes the Dark Riders, you can almost smell the cold, stale air coming from the nostrils of the evil horses.Also his characters were very interesting and intriguing especially Frodo because everything revolves around him and the decisions he must make. I feel as though he could have focused some more on Gandalf because he is the one who convinced Frodo to take on this task.Overall, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, I could not put it down. I really recommend that if you have seen the movies to also read the books because they are even better than the movies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There is, as Simon Cowell says, &quot;no question or doubt&quot; (or &quot;no question a doubt&quot;, danged if I know from his accent) that this is one of the greatest works of Western literature the world has yet seen. That was beautifully proven with the movies. Now, after reading the tedious &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and witnessing Peter Jackson's timeless adaptation, I was finally ready to pick up Part One of LOTR. I'm glad I didn't wait another second. Tolkien's first brainchild is timeless, a flawless blend of rousing adventure, memorable (and often quirky) characters, hypnotic fantasy, good vs. evil, and social commentary. If you are willing enough to read the lenghtly introduction, don't be fooled by Tolkien's explanation that this is just a book for your basic reading pleasure. It can be read on so many thematic levels it's unbelievable. There is a chapter in the book that was cut from the movie. The chapter &quot;In The House of Tom Bombadil&quot; provides a pause in the increasing tension of the novel (the hobbits have had a close encounter with death from a terrible enemy) and introduces us to Tom Bombadil and his lovely wife. In the book, the pause works, but it was best left out of the movie, where the pace was much quicker. That brings me to another point of the book: the pace. Tolkien did not write this to satisfy children. This is fantasy for those with very long attention spans. He goes into long, at times tedious, detail of what the Fellowship had for breakfast, if one of them ate more than the other, etc. And the romance between Aragorn and Arwen is not present in the book as it is in the movie. No matter. Both the movie and book are excellent and stand as perfection in their genre. Buy both immediately."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"_The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_ is an amazing adventure story of four friends and many allies who journey great distances as an attempt to preserve all life from evil forces. The main character, Frodo Baggins, exhibits outstanding courage and bears the burden of the ring, which gives its user awesome power. The ring also easily corrupts the mind of all its users. Frodo and his life long best friend Sam are determined to stick together no matter what danger they encounter. It is an excellent display of friendship, and although this is a fictional novel, the qualities exhibited by each and every character make readers feel as if the story is real and they are actually in the setting of the story.Some may say that the first part of the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is slow and boring, but I believe the books serves a very important purpose and sets up what is yet to come in this exciting series by J.R.R. Tolkien. _The Fellowship of the Ring_ is by far one of Tolkien's best works of literature, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fictional adventure stories.

The beginning of the book was a little slow and hard for me to get into, but once the hobbits meet Strider I couldn't put it down. There are many parts of the book that were left out of the movie, that really helps one to understand what is going on. It's a fantastic book of great characters, places, and adventures. I would recommend it to people who love fantasy and who love the movie but have yet to read the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings;The fellowship of the RingBy, J.R.R Tolkien\\"It's a strange business walking out your front door; you step out onto the path, and if you don't keep your feet on the road there's no knowing where you'll be swept offto.\\" To Frodo Baggins of the Shire, these words had relatively no significance, but when he found himself in a crucial position in the salvation of Middle Earth; he came to comprehend the meaning of this proverb more thoroughly. In J.R.R Tolkien's epic novel The Fellowship of the Ring, readers are propelled into the breathtaking fantasy world of Middle Earth and introduced to young Frodo Baggins of The Shire. Throughout this spellbinding epic, readers accompany Frodo on his rugged road of hardships and dilemmas leading up to the destruction of the ring of power and the liberation of Middle Earth.Frodo Baggins was just a typical Hobbit who coexisted peacefully and quietly in his secluded environment in the Shire. He was a normal citizen who was very naive with regard to the many happenings of Middle Earth. However, Frodo's serene life was short-lived, for he soon discovered that the all mighty ring of power was in his household. This book is about how Frodo most leave behind his beloved home and set out to destroy the ring of power once and for all. Along his quest, he faces many arduous circumstances and he sometimes longs for his familiar home. Often, IR.R Tolkien makes the readers really ponder whether Frodo has enough willpower to continue his quest and if he will ever truly overcome affliction. The author does an outstanding job creating this believable yet surreal world and making you really get interested in the characters and events. In my opinion, he is one of the most innovative authors of all time.Perhaps even more alluring than the predominant storyline are the strong underling themes and messages that permeate the book. Even though this book is a fantasy, it has some extremely important messages that are universally significant. For instance, one of the most dominant themes of this book (and the whole trilogy) is the concept of small people being strong enough to overcome great adversity. At some instances, you can really see that Frodo is a brave person and that he has enough determination to overcome the malice and hatred of the enemy. Another central theme is the notion that fate intervenes with an individual's life. For instance, when the ring of power fell into the hands of Frodo, was it really misfortune or was he meant to be the destroyer of the ring and savior of Middle Earth? I found myself pondering such questions over and over again in my mind and definitely think that this added great intrigue to an already outstanding book.All in all, you can see that I enjoyed exploring Middle Earth and experiencing the many thrilling events described in this amazing piece of literature. I think that this is an essential read for anybody who is interested in fantasy stories and I strongly recommend it to everyone who has the stamina to persevere through some of the more complicated and confusing parts. This is my favorite book that I have read thus far and I believe that J.R.R Tolkien is one of the most creative and gifted authors of American literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book,in my opinion, is the very definition of a great fantasy novel.

The only problem I found with this book was that it ended to quickly. Overall I dont think I will ever find a series of books as good as The Lord Of The Rings. This book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I am not one for fantasy books, but I somehow fell in love with the Lord of the Rings movies. I put it off for a while, but a week ago I bit the bullet and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Am I glad I did!Many of you probably know the storyline, but for those of you whom don't, I will briefly put it out. Frodo Baggins lives in the secluded Shire, far away from the real world of elves, men, dwarves, and other creatures. As a hobbit, he lives without much interruption. One day, he discovers his uncle left him a ring with evil powers. His friend, Gandalf discovers this, and they decide they must get rid of it. So Frodo travels with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin to Rivendale, to Elrond, a wise elf that will know what to do with it. Along the way, they have many adventures, and almost loose their lives several times. Once there, it is decided that there should be a group, or \\"fellowship\\", that will take the ring to Mount Doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group is made up of nine: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Boromir the man, Aragorn the man and heir to Gondor, and Gandalf the wizard. They soon realize the quest shan't be as easy as they thought, and the fellowship threatens to break.Once again, I am glad I read this book! Although I knew most of it, it was fun reading it and finding out the history of everything and the new scenes and characters. The first thirty pages or so are hard to get through because it is basically a history of hobbits with a bunch of foreign names and places. Once you get through that, it becomes of wonderful read. Even though they say you should read the book before you watch the movie, I disagree. There was so much description and complicated plots that you should know the story first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring, By J.R.R.

It is about a hobbit, Frodo, who has been told by a wizard, Gandalf, to destroy an evil ring, the one ring of power before it falls in to the hands of Sauron who will use the ring to destroy middle-earth. But the only place to destroy the ring is in the fires of mount doom witch is in the middle of Sauron's kingdom.The only thing with this book is the Cliffhangers in this book are slightly annoying but it does keep you attached to the book.In my mind I think this book is very entertaining and interesting in the description the author use in the many situations Frodo gets into.This book had many good features about it and manly the plot makes you need to read the other books in the series The Two Towers, and The Retune of the King.I would recommend this book to first anyone who has seen the movie because the movie was great and the book is even better, anyone who likes fantasy, anyone who likes adventure, or just anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What is there left to say about The Lord of the Rings? I believe that, on this very website, the trilogy was named the best novel of the twentieth century. Now that the movies have come out, everyone is familiar with the story. It is unfair to come to the books for the first time now, with so many expectations built up. As good as the book is, it is still only a book. Frodo will not leap off the page, put his arm around you, and make you feel good about yourself. I fear people will be disappointed. Also, there is a very large contingent of people who HATE Tolkien.So where does that leave us?I have just finished reading The Fellowship of the Ring for the second time. For me, it was more enjoyable reading the book AFTER I'd seen the movie. Middle-earth is such a complex universe that it is easy to get lost. Do not read these novels if you are fixed on getting to the ending. Here especially, the journey is the thing. LOTR is about going places, meeting people, and having new adventures. The movies told this story from a modern vantage point - emphasizing action. In the book, the action is not as prevalent.I had the opportunity of traveling to Oxfordshire recently (Tolkien's old neighborhood) and I had the feeling that I was traveling to Middle-earth myself. That is the feeling Tolkien wishes to convey. He loved nature, loved traveling, and he wanted to write a book that expressed his love. I think the book succeeds admirably. To be sure, there is enough magic and monsters to hold your attention as well.Come to this book on its own terms. Get ready for a nice leisurely read. Don't expect a transcription of the movies and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This fantasy genre book The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkein is good!

As you can see, this is good!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkein, the task of taking the Ruling Ring to the pits of Mount Doom in the treacherous lands of Mordor and the fate of Middle Earth is placed in the hands of the brave hobbit, Frodo. This burden is also held by the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship consists of the cunning and fearless ranger, Aragon, the skilled elven marksman, Legolas, the stout dwarf, Gimli, the wise wizard, Gandalf, the headstrong heir of Gondor, Boromir, and the three friends Pippin, Merry, and Samwise. All of them agree to helping the young hobbit accomplish the task. They are beset by many setbacks. They find that Gandalf&#65533;s friend, Saruman, is now in alliance with the forces of Sauron. After fleeing from Saruman&#65533;s forces in their encounter in the Mines of Moria,Gandalf sacrifices himself to the demon, the Balrog. They continue their journey disheartened by the loss of their dear friend. The Fellowship is attacked by an army of orcs, the twisted servants of Saruman. Boromir, like his human ancestors before him, is seduced by the power of the ring and tries to seize the ring from Frodo. Realizing his faults he decides to face the Orcs in a last act of redemption. He tries to allow the others to get away. By blowing the Horn of Gondor he gets the attention of all the orcs in the area. He dies a heroic death fighting the Orcs. Still, his efforts fail and the hobbits Merry and Pippin are taken captive by the Orcs. Legolas, Aragon, and Gimli head for Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in hopes of overtaking the Orcs. Frodo and Samwise head for Mordor to continue their quest.I think that the Fellowship of the Rings is a well written novel and I think that it is a must read. In this novel, Tolkein illustrates an adventure of magic and thrills enough to keep you satisfied till the end. The way that he describes the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is truly amazing. It gives you a visual of what is happening in that specific part of the story.

So, confession number one out of the way, I saw the movie before reading the book. Confession number two. I read \\"The Hobbit\\" by Tolkien earlier in the year, but I never finished it. Somehow, the book and writer failed to maintain my interest, but I am sure I will return shortly and complete that journey. There are so many different takes and perspectives on this book I thought it beneficial to this review to convey my background to reading this novel. Okay, onto the book itself. One of the traits of Tolkien I have had to battle with, is his flowery writing, in particular his tendency to burst into song (or at least his characters do) on a very regular basis. While obviously somewhat relevant to the development of the story and a key part of Hobbit culture, I found the plethora of poetic singing rather tedious at times. Nonetheless, I have read through most verse, except maybe the longest pieces at 2am in the morning. Certainly this style of writing will appeal to some and not others, but be forewarned. It is the mythical worlds that Tolkien has created that really elevate this book to lofty heights, and overshadows any (flowery) flaws the book MAY have in some reader's eyes. What Tolkien has brought to life is a sumptuous and complex mythical world that really has no comparison. The depth and detail to which he has gone into, begs the question, 'had Tolkien an all seeing private window into another dimension?' The many lands, races, languages and creatures are just glorious in all their pageantry and it is all laid out for us in a way which makes us feel that it was always so, and will always be. The unique storyline is complimented by Tolkien's ability to bring to life emotions such as fear, sadness, terror, and joy along with qualities such as loyalty, bravery, perseverance, doggedness and humility. The book is literally dripping with all these ingredients. I personally did not find this book an easy read, it demands attention and a degree of concentration, but the rewards are great. A masterpiece, truly deserving of classic status."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Many a time I have struggled with this book. Just way to boring for me. I wanted to read this book to see if it gets any better. And it has. It has grown to win a special place in my heart. Not as big as the Oz series but a small place. It's compeling sad light hearted moving and has many other traits. At the beginning it is hard to understand and boring trying to figure out but it slowly get's better and better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As I read through the incredible story of The Fellowship of The Ring I was amazed at what J.R.R. Tolkien was able to create. Through all the imagination of the story and wide variety of characters I was entranced from the minute I started reading. I felt like I was part of the story all the way through to the end.I very much enjoyed The Lord of The Rings and am quite excited to finally be moving on to the second book. Throughout the first book you really get the introduction of the story and all the characters. From poor old Bilbo to the young spirit filled Frodo the adventure begins.It really starts out in the quiet parts of the Shire where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins both live. On Bilbo's 111th birthday he leaves the Shire forever leaving Frodo his most prized possession. This most prized possession is the ring. To describe the ring I leave you this poem of description which can be found in the first page of the book. Three Rings for the elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their hall of stone, Nine for mortal men doomed to die, One for the dark lord on his dark thrown, In the land of mordor where the shadows lie. One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all together and in the darkness bind them, In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. This one ring falls into the hands of our young boy Frodo and on his adventure to destroy the ring is where the real plot begins. My favorite part of The Lord of The Rings I must say is the part where the company is staying in Bree and come across there soon to be 5th companion named Strider. The descriptions of this great powerful man with rustic, broad features are amazing and very overtaking. He is by far my favorite character.Overall I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to everyone who can get through all the details and really enjoy the true nature of the book. J.R.R. Tolkien really takes you through his own world of imagination and I hope you enjoy the book like I did."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A Review by JordanA young hobbit embarks on a journey to destroy the ultimate ring that will release destruction upon Middle Earth if the true owner gets hold of it. The fellowship meets a raider name Strider and he save them from these dark riders who are after the ring. They join up with a dwarf and an elf to make the fellowship of nine.This was a great book with a lot of details and a lot of imagination. It is a book of might and magic, also friendship and the battles against an evil warrior. I enjoyed this book but I didn&#65533;t like some of the parts where they got into a lot of detail and little actions. I also couldn&#65533;t fallow all of the different names sometimes, I found myself flipping back and forth though the book asking my self, &#65533;what was that again,&#65533; or &#65533;who is that,&#65533; but you get a better understanding of the beginning if you have read Tolkien&#65533;s first book &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; which is kind of the prequel to the &#65533;Lord of the Rings&#65533; series.I would recommend this book for those with patience and imagination.

But over all, this is not bad, but not 100% worthy of a true Tolkein reader or listner."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This was a Christmas present for my brother and it arrived early enough so I could wrap it and have it under the tree before Christmas."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"First of all, can I just say: What the heck is up with Tom Bombadil? I had the impression that he's a much-beloved character (at least in some circles)---but good grief, he makes even the elves seem hardly sappy at all by comparison! That whole section of the book was completely ridiculous---no wonder they left it out of the movie versions.One aspect of the book that the movie didn't fully capture, though, was Tolkein's portrayal of power-lust, especially through the characters of Saruman and Boromir. The ring represents a somewhat different temptation for the halflings (particularly Smeagol and Bilbo), a sort of unhealthy obsession with material objects, similar to that represented by Voldemort's horcruxes in Harry Potter (which also symbolize power-lust and a neurotic fear of death). The discussions between Gandalf and Saruman, and Frodo and Boromir, which were much better in the book and the movies should have used more of that dialogue or at least stayed truer to its spirit. They really helped bring out some of the basic themes of the novels more explicitly, but in the movie they were really watered down and generic by comparison, which really weakened the impact not only of those particular scenes, but of the movies overall.I've also heard it complained that the movies tried to force non-existent and vaguely hinted at romances to the fore, but I actually thought strengthening some of the romantic storylines was one of the better changes made by the adapters. It helped emphasize the values at stake, and in some cases actually tightened the plot and cut out unnecessary characters. For example, it was much better to have Arwen meet Aragorn and the hobbits on their way to Rivendell instead of some other random elf who played no further role in the story, rather than just having her be present at the feast given for Frodo after his recovery and then occasionally dropping subtle hints that Aragorn is in love with her. Tolkein basically just told us that there was a romance between them---the movie dramatizes it. Sam's interest in Rosie the barmaid also gives him a stronger reason to want to return to the Shire other than just that he longs for a peaceful, quiet life of gardening, and thereby raises the stakes for his character. I know the peaceful quiet life of gardening was really the whole point for Tolkein, but let's face it, he was a bit fruity on the subject (as witness the whole Tom Bombadil fiasco).As to this audio edition, Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"With very vivd characters, each with their own distint personality and drive, this is an excellent tale.

It is far more than fantasy to us who have come into possession of the Great Ring of Power and have turned back one assault of the Shadow only to see it as Gandalf warned, &quot;take another shape and grow again.&quot; I have not read any fiction that has pleased me as much as this book during my lifetime."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I had just finished this book 2 months ago, and I must say this is the only book which has even come close to touching my heart.

It's a fantastic world that was created by Tolkien from virtually nothing to forming entirely new languages ... This doesn't mean you need to be a Dungeon and Dragon freak to love this book.

But few writers since then have posessed such a magical writing style, or such a knack for memorable characters.

The answer to both questions is, OH MY GOSH, YES! The movie is about as good an interpretation of the book as anyone could've hoped for - but even so, they still had to leave out a ton of stuff to make it into a manageable movie. People who've never read the book will wonder who Tom Bombadil is. What makes reading the books so essential is that no movie can capture the actual LANGUAGE of the novel. Whereas the movie is about action set-pieces, the book is more about a quest - meeting new people and traveling imaginary lands. Reading the book will only increase your appreciation of the film - and reading it first will only make it even better...having Gandalf, Frodo, and Rivendell in your mind and then seeing them brought to life is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is enjoyed by millions. It has a good plot, interesting characters and it's recently been made into a hit motion picture. This book has a wonderful middle and an excellent ending. However I felt the beginning dragged. There are many drawn out and boring parts. It took me a while to get into the story and I'm not a dummy. This book is a good read. Just don't give up on the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There are several words to describe 'The Fellowship Of The Rings' yet few seem good enough. It is a true classic of its genre and will be remembered in many years to come. I have to admit that I was only tempted to read this book when I had seen the movie (which is also superb) and after a few reservations I had become hooked. The story is basically about the Ring of Power, controlled only by the evil lord Sauron. It is carried by a hobbit named Frodo who can only destroy it in the cracks on Mount Doom. On his perilous journey he is accompanied by a fellowship, including fellow hobbits Sam, Pippin and Merry, the wizard Gandalf, ranger Aragorn, warrior Boromir, elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli.Firstly, the flow of the story is fantastic, although there are some areas where it tends to drag. However, not only are the key points of the novel mesmerising but they are also well written and will absorb even the most cynical reader. What is perhaps most admirable though is the background detail that has gone into the making of 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Not only are there various areas in a world entirely created by Tolkien, but different races have different lanugages, lore and culture which adds to the already superb characterisation. The frienships and rifts built up as the book progresses are also realistic and at times genuinely touching. Moreover it is a stunning work of fiction that deserves to be read by anyone with a passion for adventure, fantasy or mystery."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"All who has seen the movie, they must read the book. It is incredible and full of adventure. There is a lot more to the book. I wished they had added another scene in the movie that was in the book. There is part in which the Company encounters a group of Wargs (wolfs), and that would have made an interesting scene in the movie. Anyway, the movie is basically about 3 1/2 hours long, but why not add another 30 minutes to it- Hey, its Lord of the Rings for crying out loud, it could've been 4 hours or even 6 hours (with everything else from the book in it) for all I care. But anyway, the movie war GREAT! and they did a excellent job of editing it. I was born in 1978, and pretty much grew up in the entertainment world of fantasy (ex. the Smurfs, the Hobbit, Legend, the Laberynth, etc.). I'm glad that this imaginary world is coming back."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This review is for those who, like me, are not big sci-fi readers, who don't like reading classics just because they ARE classics, and who like to be entertained.I rate a book by two things: Does it paint a picture in my mind and make me feel like I'm watching the movie in my head while I'm reading? Can I put it down at night to go to sleep?If a book is too boring, or difficult to get through (like Tolkien's The Silmarillion) I start getting heavy-eyelid syndrome. Since I don't usually read to &quot;improve my mind&quot; but to be entertained, being put to sleep is not a good sign for me. This problem does not happen with the Lord of the Rings series!The Fellowship of the Ring and the rest of the series are some of the best books for drawing me into the story. In my mind, I can see the hobbits scrambling to keep up with the taller members of the group, I can hear the screams of the Nine, and I can feel the terror of Mordor.The vivid descriptions and characters are matched only by the incredible storyline. This is the kind of book that I'll be reading at 3 a.m. and think, &quot;I'll just read one more chapter and then I'll go to sleep.&quot; Or I'll be working on something that I have to do (like dishes, laundry, etc.) and think &quot;if I just do a little more of this I'll let myself read some more of the book!&quot;This book is strongly recommended to anyone who likes a good story, and who is not daunted by a long tale: sit down, relax, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I loathe some of the newer forms of literature just because they are so tame, I think that they have nothing compared to Tolkien's genius. His quick wit and serious situations make you want to keep going throughout the story. If you put it down for a few minutes you are literally craving to begin again. ]I saw the movie first because my fianc&eacute; pointed out that it would be worth my while. I had never taken the time to read these books before. I saw the movie and was awe struck.The book is full of fun adventures, interesting people, like Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and the famous Bilbo. I think if Leonard Nimoy would have read this book then istead of Bilbo being &quot;The greatest little hobbit of them all&quot; Frodo would have been talked about more.I liked the story, dialouge, and the vivid presentation of all the people, places, and things the fellowshop comes across. Spontaneous, sad, happy, and merry are only a few words that I could use to describe the story. All inspiring and fun Tolkien is a master of the Fantasy tale. I enjoyed this tale, continuing the saga is a must. It just isn't right any other way. READ THESE BOOKS!

Even if some people find Tolkien's writing style &quot;boring,&quot; if you can appreciate a great descriptive style that goes in-depth with everything, this is the book for you. As soon as I read this book, I was so caught up in Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth that I didn't really think that any other fantasy book could live up to this, and so far none have. Even though the movie was very good, in my opinion you couldn't get quite as much out of it if you had read the book. Anyone who appreciates great fantasy should read it. Even if you don't like it, you should recognize that many fantasy books written today are written after this great trilogy. This is a great adventure of good against evil, how some friends will stick by you forever and how some will someday let you down, and how so small a thing can cause such a huge struggle."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 8th grade in 1984.

These books got me into reading and it seems I haven't stopped. The Fellowship starts the journey and I enjoyed every step. Tolkien has a way with describing his world that you feel a part of it. As I re-read the book (in preparation for the Movie), I was transported to two places at once. I felt like I was back at Adams Junior High School in Tampa Florida and in Middle-Earth at the same time. I have just picked up Two Towers and am looking forward to continuing the journey.

Don't come to &quot;Fellowship&quot; expecting high adventure and fast-paced action - an introduction is what it is, in every sense of the term. Tolkien spends a great deal of time in &quot;Fellowship&quot; to recapitulate the history of the Ring in his prequel novel, &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; In large parts of this volume, Tolkien goes to great lengths to introduce his readers to the various types of people found in Middle-earth; dwarves, elves, hobbits, and men.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; begins with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; now an elderly recluse, pondering a movement out of the Shire, sixty years after his adventure. To the dismay of his most immediate family, the Sackville-Bagginses, Bilbo has made one of his nephews, Frodo Baggins, the sole heir of his estate and fortunes. The day Frodo comes of age, his 33rd birthday, the same day as Bilbo's 111th birthday, Bilbo orchestrates an insanely massive party, and disappears. Frodo's primary legacy from Bilbo is the Ring - about 20 years later, Gandalf, a mysterious and revered wizard, appears to inform Frodo that trouble is brewing in lands outside of the secluded Shire, and that the Ring is the cause. Three of his friends in tow, Frodo leaves the Shire, his quest, to make a party of nine, and attempt to destroy the Ring. The action of the novel concerns the formation of the party, the Company, or Fellowship of the Ring.The long, detailed histories and songs of each group of people in Middle-earth featured throughout &quot;Fellowship&quot; can seem needlessly intricate - however, I think them to be the most valuable and beautiful parts of &quot;Fellowship&quot; as an introduction. The poetry is simply, but variously metered and rhymed - their most important function, it seems, is to indicate largely pre-writing, oral cultures in Middle-earth. They provide us with speech patterns, characterizations, the values of cultural diversity and pride, and a sense of kinship and tradition in the world of Middle-earth that Tolkien creates. In &quot;Fellowship,&quot; characterization is mainly of this sort, providing an overview of the major players in the quest and how they are each effected by the rise of Sauron, the Dark Lord, and his evil desires.The introductory volume to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sets an excellent scene for the larger epic action to follow - we are exposed to a wealth of social and political issues that affect the diverse population of Middle-earth. The communal governance and barter economy of the Shire, the proud, but failing monarchies of the dwarves and fairies, and the collapsed monarchy of men present a complex web of social, economic, and military relationships between disparate peoples. It is absolutely fascinating to examine the ways in which relations between the various peoples grow, change, strengthen, fade, and reform during the novel, and especially within the Fellowship itself. For example, one of the most moving relationships in &quot;Fellowship&quot; and the epic as a whole is between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf - two individuals from societies with a fraught history.This is quest-romance at its very best, and volumes 2 and 3 more than repay a close reading of &quot;Fellowship.&quot; There are many wonderful and captivating characters that populate the first volume - the cheerfully esoteric Tom Bombadil, the spectacularly magical Galadriel among them - who compensate for the first part's lack of intense action. I would reiterate one fact about &quot;Fellowship&quot; - it is the slowest moving part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - the fact that it covers 11 months of time is but one indication of its sprawl and attention to detail. The last 50 years of continuous reprintings of the Ring saga prove that despite Tolkien's lack of real stylistic elegance at times, and the pace of the first volume, that &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is both enjoyable and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was my favorite reading as a child, and so with the release of the movies I decided to reread the classics.The Fellowship of the Rings, although slow at times, is the timeless introduction to Frodo's ringbearing adventures.

When I was a lad, we had to read some dreary British novel, in high school, Silas Marner, or something like that. They stretched reading it out to a very boring entire school term. It was torture, and I like to read. I slogged through this book joyfully in high school, on my own time. Why don't they have books like this in high school? There is of course far more detail than there is in the movie. This is a book assembled by a craftsman, a Kahuna- an expert- in Hawaiian terms. One can enjoy the book at a few pages per day. He has great, archetypal characters. This book set the standard. The only complaint I might make, and that is small, is that it is long- many people don't want to read something quite this long- however that is not a problem for me, I like it just as it is.

The hero has a horrible burden he has to destroy. There's a bunch of names you can't pronounce. Maybe so. But, for the record, this has to be one of the most awesome pieces of literature given to man.A hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins has his life take an unexpected turn when he inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. His friend Gandalf the wizard informs him that it is the One Ring, creation of the Dark Lord Sauron, and Sauron wants it back. If he reclaims it, he will have all the power he needs to destroy Middle Earth. The ring must be destroyed. And a fellowship of many brave friends assembles to do just that.Tolkien is a master writer. Just to give a sense of it, I used to hate poetry. Then I read Lord of the Rings. And now I love it. I took away so many lessons from this series: friendship, suffering, self-sacrifice, nobility, and yes, love as well. After all, the fellowship truly love one another, as brothers and as friends. Even now, watching the movie at the part titled \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" makes me cry. Sometimes just reading the book makes me cry.If you want to read something beautifully written, with good morals, and just pure epicness, this is the series to read.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions.

R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. The next two areThe Two TowersandThe Return of the King.The Hobbitcontains an important backstory, but is not absolutely essential for enjoyment of this tale.Frodo Baggins discovers that the gold ring given to him by his uncle Bilbo is more than a trinket of minor magic. It is the physical embodiment of a great evil power. And its owner is looking for it. Frodo, along with three other hobbits from the Shire, travel to Rivendell to participate in the Council of Elrond. There it is decided to return the ring to be destroyed in the volcanic fires of Mordor, where it was originally forged. Frodo and eight companions set out to accomplish this task. The book follows the first part of their journey.This book was made into the movieThe Fellowship of the Ring, which is remarkably faithful to it. With one interesting exception. Between leaving the Shire and arriving at Rivendell, Frodo and his fellow hobbits spend an indeterminate period of time in the Old Forests as guests of Tom Bombadil. Tom was omitted from the film entirely. Both fans and critics have suggested he didn't belong in the book, either.Tom does not fit well into the taxonomy of good, evil, and unaligned creatures in the rest of the trilogy. He is clearly powerful, working magic in his forest by singing and persuading plants and animals to do this and that. And the ring has no power over him, not even making him invisible when he tries it on. When it is suggested in Elrond's Council that the ring be entrusted to Tom, this idea is rejected. Tom doesn't stay focused on any one thing very long and would make an inattentive guardian. The hobbits are refreshed by their stay with Tom, but he neither hinders nor helps them with their larger objective.Tolkien offered an incomplete explanation for Tom's presence in the story. In a world where everyone, good and evil, is struggling for power and control, Tom seems to have renounced this kind of power. There is an immediacy to the good he does for others, offering food or helping with a concrete problem. He doesn't sign on for a larger quest, and accepts no responsibility to lead. He exists in impenetrable serenity, while causing frustration in some of those around him.Tom is hard to understand and even harder to explain to an action-oriented audience. It is small wonder that the film omits him. But Tom Bombadil is worth understanding and is one reason you should read this book, even if you have seen the movie.

Tolkien. The story takes place in a mysterious land by the name of Middle Earth, a land inhabited by captivating creatures such as elves, dwarves, orcs, ents and wizards, but strangest of all is the race of the hobbits. Hobbits are very docile creatures that inhabit a territory known as the Shire and tend not to stray from home, but in this story one particular hobbit known as Frodo Baggins embarks on an epic quest.To begin with a little background information will have to be given on the situation that middle-earth finds itself in. First of all an evil tyrant called Sauron has just returned and many details portend war to come. A while back Sauron had created a series of rings of power, one of which he channeled all his power into, causing it to gain control of all the others. Many years ago when Sauron was first defeated this ring was lost, and now that he has risen again it is of utmost importance to destroy the ring before it comes into the hands of the dark tyrant. Interestingly enough a very wise wizard (he is almost like a prophet at times) named Gandalf has just informed our hobbit friend, Frodo, that the ring given to him by his recently vanished uncle is the ring of power that Sauron seeks.Once Frodo is made aware of the fact that he possesses this ring of power Gandalf advises him and another hobbit loyal to Frodo, Sam, to leave the Shire immediately and travel to the House of Elrond (Elrond is a very wise elf and in his house others whom the rings business regards are present), which is quite a way off. When Sam and Frodo set off another pair of hobbits called Merry and Pippin accompany them. As the hobbits begin their journey they realize that mysterious riders that are dressed in black are following them. Later they check into an inn and meet a ranger called Aragorn, who tells them that these black riders are called Ring wraiths and have been sent by Sauron to recover the ring of power. Aragorn chooses to accompany the hobbits for security reasons, but despite this Frodo still sustains a serious injury about three-fourths of the way to the House of Elrond. Once the travelers arrive at the house of Elrond Frodo is healed and Gandalf catches up to the group. Once Frodo his regains health, discussions begin on what should be done with the ring. In the end it is decided that the ring should be destroyed and a fellowship is formed, one in which Frodo is the ring bearer. The members of this fellowship are: Gandalf, the wizard; Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin; Legolas, the elf; Boromir, the dwarf; Gimli, the dwarf; Aragorn, the ranger. Immediately after a plan of action is delineated the Fellowship proceeds to leave the house of Elrond with both the Mountain of doom (a volcano who's fire is capable of destroying the ring) and Gondor(the fortress which the dwarves need to protect).The fellowship travels for many leagues and eventually is forced to proceed by entering a dangerous underground realm called Moria. In Moria they are almost immediately pursued by goblins. These Goblins force the fellowship to travel swiftly to the exit of Moria. Once they get near the exit they need to cross a bridge but a Balrog (mythical creature of immense power) appears and blocks their way. Gandalf knows that the Balrog will be there doom so he sacrifices himself and takes the Balrog with him, allowing the Fellowship to successfully escape. Once Gandalf is gone the Fellowship decides to Proceed and eventually comes to the crossroads between Gondor and the Mountain of Doom. Here the fellowship is forced to make a decision on how to divide them, but they decide that before anything is said the ring bearer should voice his decision. Frodo then asks to be left alone for a while so that he can think, so he distances himself from the rest of his companions. While Frodo is alone Boromir comes and questions him about the ring, reaching a pint where he attacks him in order to take it away. In order to avoid any further effects of the ring on the fellowship Frodo decides to leave to the mountain of Doom on his own, but Sam forces Frodo to let him accompany him and together they escape. Finally Boromir dies trying to protect Merry and pippin from orcs, but despite his efforts the two hobbits are abducted.Now that you know the story I think it is apparent that this book is very interesting, but despite the whole book being captivating there are a few scenes, which stand out. In my opinion there is one that is especially intricate and engrossing, when Boromir attacks Frodo. In this part of the book we are able to witness the first of many negative effects that the ring of power is causing. The ring has corrupted Boromir's formerly noble mind to the point that his lust for it leads him to turn on his own companion. At one point in this scene, in reference to Boromir, the author says, \\"His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire in his eyes.\\" (pg.415) As you can see by this quote the ring was able to seize control of Boromir and twist his mind, thus creating the illusion in Boromir's mind that it was absolutely necessary for him to take control of the ring. This newfound power of manipulating minds that the ring has plays a vital role throughout the rest of the trilogy.Interestingly enough this novel is actually related to history. Many of the events and characters in the Lord of the rings trilogy (especially in the book I read, The Fellowship of the Ring) parallel various aspects of Christian history. To begin with Gandalf is a clear representation of Jesus Christ. This is evident when Gandalf dies to save his people, just as Jesus Christ did. This similarity between characters is even more evident when later in the series Gandalf resurrects. Another vary evident inclusion of Christianity in the novel is the ring of power representing the devils temptations. The ring is constantly tempting others to use it or acquire it, as can be observed when Boromir succumbs to its subtle infiltrations of his mind. Throughout the whole story Frodo himself is forced to fight off urges of wearing the ring and using its power. As you can see J.R.R. Tolkein includes many Christian ideas in this novel.This novel is a captivating tale that leaves the reader hungry for more. I especially like the way in which the author develops the power of the ring. In conclusion enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for some good fiction. If the reader likes the first novel I recommend to go ahead and read the whole trilogy and the other books associated with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"We all know the storyline.

The newer novels are 'The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant' by Stephan Donaldson and 'The Book of the Old Sun' novels of Gene Wolfe. (The Shadow Of The Torturer, The Claw Of The Conciliator, The Sword of The Lictor and The Citadel of The Autarch). The older novels are the Gormenghast trilogy of Mervyn Peake and of course J.R.R.Tolkein's 'The Lord Of The Rings' of which 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' is the first book. All of the books I have quoted have one thing in common and that is an astonishing depth of characterization and the invocation of a sense of a whole, new, fully consistent and fully realized place. These novels draw you in, you believe the places are real, you believe in their independent existence 'out there' somewhere. Once you read any of these books, the characters are with you forever. Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery, Titus, Flay and Steerpike, Severian and Dorcas and of course Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, Arwen, Faramir, Boromir, King Theoden, Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, Gollum, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Galadriel, Eomer, Eowyn etc etc. I can read these novels now just for the chill I get at certain passages.... &quot;And they hewed Hama's body before the gates of the Hornburg after he was dead&quot; as King Theoden says to Saruman.

It has it all, love, war, magic, sorrow, pain and truth. It has such a depth of story telling that even on the second or third read through, you will find more significance than the last. And the poetry, just read it aloud, read the songs. Many fantasy writers (and straight fiction writers as well) have tried the pen of the poet in thier prose, and failed, Tolkien did not .Tolkien wrote something subtle and beautiful in these books.

But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner.

I understand that the characters don't have flaws and you can't relate to them, but I think these books are still wonderful. Every fantasy book that I have ever read, which is a lot, I haven't ever really been able to relate to. That is what a fantasy book is about, it's not about emotions most of the time. I agree also that it gets boring at times, but I think most books do that. I found it so amazing that Tolkien had made up his own laguages and put so much effort into this outstanding world of fantasy. I have never read another fantasy book where you can tell how much effort has gone into it. I would not recommend seeing the movies first because you get so much more out of the books than you do the movies. If you see the movie first then you will not understand the books as much."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I liked this book very much. The story starts out in a cozy little place called the Shire. There lived Bilbo Baggins, an extremely wealthy hobbit who was quite well known for his adventures. He acquired his wealth from an adventure in which he fought trolls, goblins, giant spiders and even a mighty dragon.He planned a huge party for his 111th birthday. During his speech, he makes an unexpected surprise in which he slips on a magic ring and disappears. While invisible, he headed back to Bag End, his house, to say farewell to Gandalf, an old wizard and friend. Bilbo left everything to Frodo, even his ring, however with an odd sense of reluctance. He then left on a permanent and secret vacation.Gandalf soon discovered the cause of Bilbo's reluctance to leave the ring behind for Frodo. It was created by Sauron, an evil sorcerer with one goal, to conquer all of Middle Earth. He seeks the Ring and it wishes to be found by him. Should he get it, all of Middle Earth would lie within Sauron's grasp. As long as it remains hidden, there is a risk he shall find it. It also can only be destroyed in the heart of his empire where it was created, deep within the fires of Mount Doom.Frodo and his gardener, Sam Gamgee, set out on a journey to Rivendale with the Ring to decide what should be done with it. It is a long and perilous journey. Sauron's spies are everywhere. To make matters worse, they are pursued by hideous Black Riders, armored zombies-like creatures on horses whose only mission is to get the Ring - at all costs! All hope for Middle Earth lies in two hobbits. Will Frodo and Sam successfully make their journey to Rivendale, or will Sauron prevail?I liked this book quite a bit. It has such a realistic plot line you could believe that it really happened. The idea with the Ring of Power, Sauron, hobbits, dwarves, elves and goblins was incredibly creative. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had quite an imagination to make this story and I look forward to reading his other books as well.I also loved how much detail he gave the characters. They seem so real and you can really see the book from Frodo's point of view even though it's not in first person. In most parts, such as the mines of Moria, the book was riveting. However, in other parts, such as the forest of Lothlorien or the House of Tom Bombadil, it loses its grip.I would recommend this book to people 12 and up. The only factor to that is it's just so complicated. Even I found it hard to understand every now and then. It's a great story anyway and I loved it. I give J.R.R. Tolkien's: Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring: 4 Stars"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is so good! The first 100 pages were a challenge but then it then it really got exciting. I saw the movie and thought is was overated. I hesitaded to read the book but I thought I would give it a try and I fell in love with it!!!!!!!!! Definetly a must read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It would be incorrect to simply place this novel in the category of fantasy/action. Here, Tolkien attempts to create the first, truly English piece of mythology, and he succeeds brilliantly with unmatchable skills in world-building. Many find the first 100-200 pages slow and tedious, yet these pages testify to Tolkien's relentless imagination and the wholeness of his world. This is a piece of true literature, and should not be read with impatience and sloppiness."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book, although a little slow at the start, has tons of action, and suspense. The book is made great because it has just the right combination of action, suspense, betrayal, and loyalty. It keeps you turning pages from the point when the hobbits are pursued by black riders, and sheltered by elves, with danger at every turn, all in the \\"peaceful\\" Shire.This book begins with the passing of the ring from Bilbo to his heir, Frodo. Gandalf eventually figures out it is the One Ring of Sauron, and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin leave the shire. Through many perils they reach the Prancing Pony Inn, and meet Strider (aka Aragorn, son of Arathorn). From here, the story becomes truly exciting, with a fight with the black riders, and a flight to Rivendell. From here a company of nine sets out, including the four hobbits, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, Strider, Gandalf the Grey, and Boromir, a man of Gondor."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a well written, complex, yet understandable, deep and thoughtful, yet easily connected to, work of fantasy. The Fellowship of the ring is the first part. Within its numerous pages, you will find all the questions, and some of the answers (of the questions) posed to you over the course of your life. The story follows the quest of Frodo Baggins, who has been entrusted with the ring of power, which he must destroy, for if the enemy regains it, the world of good will come to an end. With only a few companions, he sets out to complete an impossible, quest, will little hope of either success, of survival. the only thing that keeps him going is his love for his people, and the knowledge that the world's fate is in his hands. The moral issues, questions of greed, and wants, and fortune which arise, are some of the deepest you will find in fantasy stories. A master of both his languages and the one in which he writes, Tolkien masters emotions, fate, a world picture, and characters which do not even need to be explained for the reader to be able to relate to them. There is a magic in the work of good writers which allows one to get totally indulged in the characters, their problems, and their emotions. Tolkien is a master of that magic.I the year 2001, NewLine Cinema released to the public a cinematic take-off on the Lord of the Rings. According to the producers it was a movie which was intended to stay as \\"Faithful to the book\\" as possible. It was a movie which should have never been made. Although it is a masterpiece of a film, with excellent actors, and phenomenal landscape and music, it lost most, if not ALL of the magic inherent of the book series. A true reader of literature, and moreso a faithful reader of tolkien, will not hold this film in high regards. There is no \\"Lord of the Rings: The Movie\\". This movie has no authority over the true story. Watching the movie before reading the book leaves one with little appretiation for an excellent work of art. DO NOT DO SO. If you can help it, do not watch any cinematic version at all, but instead revel in the magic, and power of the epic trilogy. Tolkien didn't write an action/adventure film, nor was he targeting the mainstream media of the early 21st century (during which, consequently, he was/is not alive.) He was, as all writers are, (speaking from experience)writing to express ideas, and feelings, and true issues. This book will take you to a world you have never been before, and give you views on life you never had. This book is not just entertainment, this book is a way of life. Please read it, and it's two sequels. And don't even think of the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to any reader that likes fantasy. This book has amazing character development, as well as many action scenes. It has several parts that are boring, and have no excitement. However this is for character development and is needed for the plot. The many scenes that are exciting balance the book perfectly. This is a great read for any reader that enjoys reading, but not light reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I loved the book called \\"Lord of the rings\\", because their is a lot of action and fighting, and not a whole lot of ROMANCE like other books. I also like the old style of military like archers and swordsman, and that is another reason why i love this book! It is also kind of spooky, and I love horror films.The best part of the book is when they started to climb the mountain and that one wizard started pusing rocks on them, and they started to fight with the enemy's. That was probably the best action scene in the book.I think conflict and characters are the most important. conflict is the most important one because that is what the whole book is about. You need to have characters otherwise who will be in the story?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Unfortunately, I have not read the books and don't have time to. I have just recently started listening to audio books on my long commute. This unabridged version has to be the next best thing to actually reading it. The reader has a good range in his voice to distinguish different characters and it never sounds dry or dull. The story really draws you in and seems so real that you want more. I wanted to listen to this before I see the movie, which I'm going to do this weekend because I'm almost finished. There is no doubt that I will be buying the next audio book next week so I can continue the story. This is very entertaining all the way through the 20 hours of listening and I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"After nearly ten years of people telling me I *had* to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy I broke down and finally did so. Having read The Hobbit in high school I thought I knew what to expect from Tolkien's trilogy. I was very wrong. The world he creates here is richer and more fully realised than the Middle-earth of The Hobbit. This, unlike The Hobbit, is a story on an epic scale and Tolkien never lets you forget that.As the first novel in the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, obviously, must set the stage for the next two novels. That means a lot of back story and that many characters and themes need to be introduced. It also means that it doesn't wrap things up in a neat little bow when you reach the last page. This bothers people for some reason.Some other reviewers here have said that Fellowship is boring. While I would agree that there are slow spots in Fellowship, I would never call it boring. The bits of the story you learn from Gandalf's meeting with Frodo in the Shire or the Council of Elrond are important much later and Tolkien needs to bring them in when he does. Even the journey to Rivendell (what I thought to be a rather slow bit) introduces a good many characters. The pay-off for the dull parts come in the sections dealing with the Mines of Moria and the journey down the river from Lorien. Tolkien is a master storyteller and he does not waste a single word.If you've enjoy reading works on an epic scale (The Odyssey, Beowulf) then you'll enjoy Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkien's &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy literally created the genre of heroic fantasy, spawning works as diverse as those written by Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel Delany, Terry Brooks, and of course, even J. K. Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. You can also hear echoes of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; in both the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, and especially, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (Indeed J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; has often acknowledged his debt to Tolkien.). Yet it stands head and shoulders above them all as an epic tale of friendship, devotion, and faith as a motley crew of heroes valiantly try to stop the evil Sauron from conquering all of Middle-earth. In &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;, Frodo Baggins undertakes a perilous journey as the Ring bearer, the keeper of Sauron's one ring of power, without which the dark lord can not hope to conquer all of Middle-earth. Frodo is joined in his quest by such noble figures as the Human ranger Strider (later revealed as Aragorn, the last surviving descendant of a legendary lineage of kings), the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the wizard Gandalf, Frodo's kinsmen Merry and Pippin, and his ever faithful friend Samwise Gamgee.Much to my amazement, Peter Jackson's filmed adaptation of &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; remains remarkably quite faithful to the text, though compressing some details for dramatic license, and omitting the important character of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, the film ends at the very opening of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the next installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, with the fellowship dispersed and with Boromir, another of the humans, dead. If you haven't read Tolkein's epic before, you're in for a veritable literary feast after seeing Jackson's elegant adaptation (One of the finest filmed adaptations of a literary work I've seen in a long, long time.). However, I'd recommend reading this splendid work first before viewing Jackson's cinematic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien took forever to write this book, but I think both he and I would have been saved a lot of time if he just cut down his lenghthy descriptions and stuck to the plot. The ridiculous songs, included to add an ancient, mysterious tone to the book, really don't contribute to the book's success, nor do the historical ramblings or repetitive descriptions of the characters' surroundings.Yes, yes, I know some nut who's so caught up in fantasy that he dresses like a hobbit himself will no doubt criticize my review, stating that the descriptions and songs and countless pages of dribble make the story SO REAL and it's the alternate reality that makes this story a masterpiece. But for those of us still living on planet earth, it's just a bit too much to have to deal with the long-winded, unnecessary parts of this book.BUT, the plot is excellent, and that's what kept me reading. Although not as exciting as The Hobbit (a superior book in my opinion), the great storyline and exciting turn of events were enough for me to call this book a good one. I will read the other books in the trilogy, now knowing what to expect.I do recommend this book, but just realize what you're in for. If you have the patience, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"OK-first I've got to confess that I avoided &quot;Ring&quot; geeks in high school-they were way too passionate (zealots?). Over the years, I've resisted and when I finally read and loved &quot;The Hobbit&quot; I decided to read &quot;Fellowship&quot; a year ago. Since then I put it down twice, getting bogged down in the lengthy history of Middle Earth that precedes the actual story. Once I decided to skip it altogether, things built speed rapidly and I ended up really enjoying the book.Since many will consider reading this based on seeing the film, I'll add that I saw the movie and was blown away by how well the filmmakers told the story, leaving out the parts that are nice but superfluous, and keeping the core intact. That said, the book makes more clear the monumental task of gathering opposing forces against a common enemy and shows why the choices characters make (the elf-queen, for instance) are not as simple as they appear in the film.I also realized how thoroughly George Lucas &quot;borrowed&quot; from &quot;Rings&quot; in the first 3 Star Wars movies..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I debated whether or not to write a review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I mean, there really isn't a whole lot more that I can say that hasn't been said already. However, I decided to go ahead and add another two cents worth.THE LORD OF THE RINGS is my favorite novel of all time. It's a shame that all the books weren't printed together as one when they were first published; one has to discuss each part of the series separately. Anyway, Tolkien's novel (of which this is the first part) is the granddaddy of all fantasy and science fiction. Before Tolkien came along, there really wasn't much in the realm of fantasy fiction or even science fiction. It took a master of language to write an extended sequel to a children's story he once wrote to enliven the genre. For the fact alone, Tolkien's work will remain as a classic and endure for ages to come.Yet, there is more to it than that. Tolkien's masterpiece is more than something that started a new genre. It is a great story, one of the best, culminated from many great stories of the past (Shakespeare, Norse mythology, Chaucer, etc.) and imbedded in the morals of Tolkien's Christian faith. It is a story that all men long to live. It is a tale about life. It's about friendship. It's a story about death, redemption, and salvation; a tale of good triumphing over evil. Combining all those elements (and so many others) into one story is a great feat. So, here's to Tolkien and THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Long may it endure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I see many reviewers giving low ratings and was disappointed. For one, it shows how little people care for details and setting these days. The main reason the details are there in the first place is because it is a different world with a different history. The characters were fine the way they were, unless you wanted another 200 pages of &quot;tedious&quot; reading.I think there are people who should stick with MTV and the WWF for entertainment and there are others who can handle something more involving. If you are the latter and love fantasy epics then you probably have already read this trilogy, if not then I recommend getting The Hobbit first and then the non-film versions of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Well, I decided to read this book once more before going to see the movie. It would have only been twice, but I still needed to refresh my memory badly. Was I ever glad that I did! This story is so full of adventure, danger, and mystery it's not even funny. Each page opens up into a new world with things never even imagined by this reader. Reading about the dark lord Sauron sent chills down my spine because this is one of the most evil characters ever created. I can't believe some people say the characters are one dimensional! Every single character has their own distinct personality, and by the end I had grown to love them all.Unfortunately I wound up in the climax during finals week. I couldn't get any studying done because I couldn't put this amazing book down! If you pick up this book and find the first 100 pages or so slow, keep reading...it really starts to pick up. Read this...60 years later it can still thrill, amaze, delight, and even sometimes, cause a laugh. In case you don't know, the story is about a fellowship of hobbits, humans, and other creatures who must take the one ring to be destroyed in the one place where it can be destroyed: In the middle of evil Sauron's vast land. If Sauron got ahold of it, he would be able to rule all of middle earth with it...and make everyone his slave...this ring is the most powerful of all rings. I recommend reading before seeing the movie, but if you don't, by all means, read it anyway when the movie's over. Then, pick up the next two!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"If you don't like this book, then you just don't get it. Tolkien has created a world unlike any ever seen in literature before. The story is amazing and has everything: good vs. evil, rousing adventure, magic, friendship, loyalty, an unlikely hero and the most amazing characters ever created by a fantasy writer. If you haven't read this book, where have you been? This is where J.K. Rowling, Brian Jacques, Susan Cooper and Philip Pullman all got their inspiration. If you have ever loved a fantasy book, fantasy movie, or just love a great story, then you need to read this book. Tolkien started it all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Look, I have heard both sides of the LOTR debate: the Epical adventure + the boring drag. In fact, I have been to both sides. I read the Lord Of The QRings for the first time when I was seven. I loved it. Sure, it took me a month, and sure most of it went over my head. But I loved it (although I hated the actual reading part. Now I have read it sixteen more times, and I can safely say I know where everyone is coming from. Book one, The Fellowship of the Ring, is fantastic in it's own way, but it does become repeditive and a little tedious. It is brilliant, but hard to get into and really live. The second book WITHIN the first novel is amazing. This is where Tolkien starts his action. At first I struggled through the first book, but now I breeze through, knowing there is great stuff ahead. Book two and three are brilliant, if a bit naive and neat for my taste. Tolkien is the origional and the best EVER FANTASY WRITER!!! I can say this confidently as having read most popular fantasy series' and his is the most origional and epical I have ever seen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I cannot possible ask anyone to read any book more then the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit. No other books have entertained me as much and got my imagination going.

The Lord of the Rings, of all the books I've read, is my unquestionable favorite. No other book is so rich and detailed with the history and peoples of its world and no other book tells a tale of such magnitude and beauty. So many people today have such short attention spans and require such consistant melodrama that it's no wonder the beauty and detail of Tolkein's masterpiece ends up wasted. I've read The Lord of the Rings many times and know the story and its conclusion well but I don't read them for the story anymore, I read them to return to Middle Earth.For anyone who has yet to read these books, I envy you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Don't let anybody tell you differently - The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of caring that modern fantasy writers cannot match.Those readers with short attention spans are not fiction in the 20th century, fantasy or not. It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a skill and likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely solely on battles to advance the plot. Those who adore epic adventure, huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love* this book.'The Fellowship of the Ring' starts things off wonderfully, telling the tale of the ring, and giving the reader a feeling of how vast and evil the story behind the ring is. Frodo and his companion must endure a series of adventures and encounters, trying to make their way out of the Shire. The first half of the book is very much reminicent of The Hobbit, and picks up with the same spirit.The second half of the novel gathers together the party who will make the journey that is the center of the series, and features one of the most famous and beloved parts of the series - Moria. Fantastic!Recomended for all readers, young and old. The only ones likely to dislike this are readers spoiled by the cookie cutter style of todays modern fantasy writers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The only drawback to reading this series is that it spoiled me so that every other book I've read since the 7th grade has been a disappointment (which is kind of sad considering that I'm now 28). It's true that it's a great story and that Tolkien creates a world that is totally immersive and believable (even down to the history and structure of the imaginary foreign languages). More importantly though, he has a deep-rooted sense of ethics that he has woven into the story that strikes a harmonic chord in the soul of the reader - for example, that wisdom is often more powerful than strength, that hunger for power or money is bad, that sometimes the harder path is the best, that displaying one's power (or wealth) is bad, and that sometimes it's better to not use power even if you have it. (Consider Aragorn, an heir to the throne who wears muddy boots and lurks in the shadows). From a literary point of view, these concepts are similar to the teachings of Jesus, which are obviously very powerful. Tolkien's anti-materialistic view of the world may be what moves readers so much and what pushes the series beyond being just technically great (which it is) to being almost a religous experience. The only things I found disappointing were the loose ends that weren't tied up at the end and the hints of the decline of Middle Earth towards being a world like our own."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The young hobbit Frodo Baggins has been chosen to go on a daring quest.A few words from the encourager. I have always enjoyed a good fantasy tale, and a heroic quest. It all started when I saw the animated cartoon based on the best selling book The Hobbit. Back then I was too young to read a thick novel.Aventualy I read the book The Hobbit. Now I am reading the conclusion series The Lord of the Rings. I have just finnished volume one The Fellowship of the ring, and I will be reading volume two The two towers very soon.The Fellowship of the Ring is focused on the young hobbit Frodo, and the evil one ring.If you do not know a Hobbit is a being slightly shorter than a dwarf, they have leathery and hairy feet, and often curly hair.Frodo, along with his eight companions Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas, must send the ring into the fire it was created.The one rinc can help the evil sorcerer Souron destroy all good in middle earth.Can Frodo, and his companions put the ring into the fires of Mount Doom? Read the book, and find out.I sugest you read The Hobbit before you read The Lord of the Rings , because it will help you understand the story line of the conclusion.The only thing I don't like about this book, is it started to bore me for a while, but my interest returned. Never give up if it bores you, because your interest will return!If you like a daring quest, heroic adventures, and a good story line The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings are the books for you.I will end this with a quote from the book.In elven &quot;Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbitul, ash nazg thrakatuluk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!&quot;In English &quot;One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read his books when I was in 4th grade and every two years or so I return. I cannot think of another book in print (other than the Bible) that people return to again and again throughout their lives. Tolkien made you feel his tale. His mastery of language allowed us to experience vividly the grandeur of Middle Earth. The languages, cultures and histories of its peoples are rich and real as any from ours. The elvish and dwarven tongues are not just nonsensical sounds slapped together but actual languages that he laboured to produce. The poetry and the songs added a weave to the tapestry of cultures that demanded to be believed. The characters that he breathed life into were real in every sense. Their thoughts acts and motivations were not simply one dimensional: Good men were bad, the brilliant made errors, some people were lucky, others not so, the herioc last stand didn't always save the day, war is very ugly and glory is fleeting, travelling on foot is very hard especially over mountains and through wastelands, eating a good meal, drinking good beer and smoking a pipe is a nice way to spend an evening. Anyone who has ever been in the military would appreciate the proper place given to the joy of a simple bath, rest and food after leagues of cross country travelling. I do not despise those who cannot wade through the reality in this fantasy. It is on a level that some may find daunting. I agree with the fellow described it as art, high art. Not everyone will get it, not everyone can &quot;get&quot; it. I must in closing, take a parting shot at those who would place Robert Jordan near him let alone over him (I blame America's education system). If it wasn't for Tolkien, Jordan would have had to rip off someone with talent closer to his own, assuring you of a tale even more dreadful than the one he spun. You won't see reviews about people not being able to comprehend his work, because it is already dumbed down for the masses. There is a reason whyTolkien's work is so beloved, because it is simply that good and that unique. The man himself is an interesting study and worthy of some time.

The novels begins slowly and the suspense builds and builds.The author - J.R.R. Tolkien fully develops over 200 major characters in this epic work. The work involves the Quest for Truth, Beauty and Goodness.Against overwhelming odds and the might of terrible armies - the hobbit Frodo Baggins overcomes battle injuries, starvation, greed, deceptions, treason and evil to triumph over vastly superior forces.I have read this story 9 times - and rank it as the best story ever written in World Literature.

And how many have tried yet faltered to reach Tolkien's excellence in writing a fairy tale for kids and adults alike, and additionally creating a whole new fairy world full of magic and mysteries?After reading LotR times and times again, I'm still captured by the special atmosphere of Tolkien's masterpiece. He's brilliant in using just as few words as necessary to describe the beings, the landscapes and the events taking place around Frodo, Gandalf and the other members of the fellowship of the ring. His dialogues are charming, pointed and so rich of both hints crucial to the plot and references to events that took place centuries ago on middle-earth. You close your eyes and you relive both the adventures of the main protagonists as well as dramas that once unfolded in the long and intricate history of middle-earth.LotR is never boring. The story flows thru the subsequent chapter like a jolly mountain brook, now and then running thru wild currents, as the companions encounter new and dangerous obstacles. But with each chapter, the creek becomes wider and in the end, it becomes a wild river, when the fellowship breaks apart at the waterfalls of Rauros. Of course two scenes stand apart from the rest. The dwarven mines of Moria are just fantastic, and whenever I reached Balin's gravestone I had goose bumps while reading. &quot;We're cut off. We can't get out ... they're coming!&quot; So few simple words, yet so much drama in that specific situation. And of course Galadriel's mirror. When Frodo offers the one ring to the elven mistress, and she resists the temptation to use the ring to preserve everything that's left of her previous life, to save Lothlorien, and instead decides to stay herself and rather whither away in beauty than become a queen of darkness and despair, the reader gets a glance at the love that Tolkien sensed for this world and his work.So, whenever you're in need of a good read and of some enchantement to lighten your mood, take LotR from your dusty book shelves and jump back into the lands of Middle-Earth, and follow the cute band of Hobbits on their adventures far away from the Shire."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is for sure the best book ever written.If you are young, prepare yourself to live a grown-up adventure.

There is no way to describe the entire world JRR Tolkien created from his (huge) imagination. Anyway, try to think about a world, similar to our world in the middle ages, where there is MAGIC. Not these tricks you are used to in real life, but real magic: a kind of power that comes from every living being. People that are really connected to nature, trees that can think and speak ... and everything in this world has a very well defined history: the beginnings, the myths, legends, kings ... everything told in words that reflect the author's sensations about his own dream. Even poetry you'll find in this book.The Fellowship of The Ring, being the fist part of The Lord of the Rings (usually published in three volumes), is the most polemic of Tolkien's works. This book has been read by many people since it appeared in print, and Tolkien himself received lots of letters filled with opinions, critics, and whatsoever. This story is a huge one, and there are people who dislike big stories. The first part of this book is concerned with providing a background to the saga and to make a link with The Hobbit, the previous book in chronology. This way, things seem to be slow and there's almost no action. For those who have read The Hobbit, a very nice and dynamic book, the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring may (but not probably) be boring. In fact, it's almost necessary to read The Hobbit before thinking of reading The Lord of The Rings; otherwise, much of the fun in this book will be lost.However, in the second part (Book II), action comes back, and now we have the characters dealing with a never-ending series of adventures, puzzles, dangers ... In other words, this book is worth the money you're gonna spend on it. But remember: before doing that, read The Hobbit!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What's to say, tolkien's a very good author in his own way. You don't feel his character's though, you don't care about them much. 500 pages seems really really long in this books. You know how in some books you hardly noticed that you've read 100 pages. Not so here, I swear I looked at the page numbers all of the time and got nowhere. I read the first 200 pages (which were really boring) then got to the interesting part. Unfortunatly the report on it was due the next day so all day I spent reading it page by page until it was finished. Moria was good Rivendell and Elf Land were dragged out quite alot. I give it three because it's very high quality writing. Structurally sound. I just failed to pick it up and soar...if you get my meaning. Don't get me wrong though, the hobbit and the rest of the trilogy are really good."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I really love Tolkien's writing and I was happy to find a non-abridged reading of it that I could use to share my passion with my non-reading family, but all this recording did was put everyone to sleep and probably put them off picking up the book forever.This reader slaughters the text. I'm sorry, but I don't know how else to say it. I know some people here have said that he performed it on stage before recording it, but I find that hard to believe. Did anyone pay to see him? He reads as if he had never seen the books before and had put no time into familiarizing himself with the material. He never puts the emphasis where it belongs and his sentence melody is so off that a lot of the time you have to concentrate to even be able to follow what he is saying. I mean, Tolkien is not really easy listening material, he needs someone to bring out the allure and beauty in the text. I had hoped for someone who could do for the whole book what Ian McKellen did for Gandalf's lines in the movie, but instead this guy reads it like a laundry list.Anyways, I could go on, but you get the picture. Do yourself a favor and just read the book rather than letting this recording spoil it for you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The book and current film have some similarities, however, when dealing with the book one faces oddities:Where does the epic begin and the children's tale end?One can see Tolkien's style changing as the book goes on.The 'songs' (chants?) are somewhat offputting. I was unsure of what to make of them.As far as the Tom Bombadil character: What is his purpose? Is he symbolizing something or an error in the plot?A long work, yes? The films are visually extraordinary, but I wonder if NOT reading the books puts one at a disadvantage when seeing them (the films).&quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; chapter is probably the best in this first book of the trilogy inasmuch as it explains a great deal of background.Personally I prefer the third book &quot;Return of the King&quot;."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I had heard about this book that the plot was slow, but it was a good book anyway because the setting and the &quot;world&quot; the characters are placed in was so good. Personally, I couldn't see anything special in the setting. It reminded me of the setting in almost every other fantasy book I've ever read. This is not because other authors used Tolkien's ideas, it's simply that it's not a very imaginative world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Imagine all the pressure of your country in your hands. This happened to Frodo in the book The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is a fantasy book and it's the beginning of the series of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" The book's main character is called Frodo Baggins, and his problem is that his cousin Bilbo disappeared from his party and left him with the responsibility of destroying the ring at Mt. Doom. He also has to face several challenges before he reaches the Anduin River, which leads to Mt. Doom Frodo is friends of most of the hobbits that live at Hobbiton, except for his cousins, the Sackville-BagginsI read the book very carefully, considering that it had a very high level and it was long. I sometimes stopped in parts I didn't understand, but afterwards, I moved on. I got to a point where I couldn't keep myself in the chair of the excitement and I started to jump while reading. In the prologue, I got to the point where my head almost drooped after reading the first page because it was so boring, but that's only on the prologue. I reconsidered abandoning the book three times, but my \\"book mates\\" told me not to. Something interesting about this book is that from the most interesting parts to the most boring parts, and that makes me sort of upset. This book is similar to \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" by Lloyd Alexander because there are different races besides humans, like dwarves, elves, and wizards. I think that the book is very colorful because its magical writing can cheer you up, just like colors do. Also because its enriched with the good use of vocabulary.I would recommend this book to male teenagers and adults because it doesn't talk about things that girls regularly do or enjoy, like fighting, for example. This book is very similar to the chronicles of Prydain which has the same type of characters. Even though this book is challenging, you have to give it a chance and don't give up on it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The trilogy, and Fellowship in particular, helped to shape my childhood. It opened the doors of perception far more than Aldous Huxley or LSD ever could have. Tolkien is a creative master with talent far beyond what I would have thought possible. Do you realize just how much literature has been an organized rip off of The Lord of the Things? Buy for any boy you know--and read it aloud to them if they're too young to discern the words."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My entire life I had a set of Tolkien books sitting on a book shelf in my house. This set contained 4 books: &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and the three books of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. On a few occassions I told myself that I had to read these books, since I knew that they were known as the best fantasy books ever. I started &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on a few occasions but never could get past the first chapter because it starts quite slow. However, once you get into that book you will not be able to put it down. The same is true for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first book of the trilogy. I would suggest reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first so that you know the background. This book is the greatest book that I have ever read, and I feel quite confident that the next installment (I just started it) will be even better. This book is simply amazing. If you like fantasy or you are a Star Wars fan or you just like to be inspired, this is the book for you. This book takes you into a dream world, yet the world is not unlike the world we know. There are many similarities. Please read it...and enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's novel, The fellowship of the Ring, takes place throughout all of Middle Earth, a mysterious land with evil hiding around every corner. It is a story about a company of travelers trying to distroy evil, and bring peace to all creatures that still live in Middle Earth. Frodo Baggins, Bilbos adopted nephew, inherets all of Bilbo's belongings when Bilbo suddenly dissapeares again. Frodo is a hobbit that isn't content with the way his life is. There is something missing, and Frodo feels that an adventure would fill that eymptiness in his life. Well that adventure comes when Gandalf, the wizard, shows up and tells him that the ring that he inhereted from Bilbo, is wanted by Saruman, an evil wizard. The only way to keep Saruman from having it, and anyonelse from using it, is to destroy it. However to destroy it they need to take it to Orodruin, the fire mountain. This mountain is the only place where it is hot enough to melt the ring. Frodo starts his journey with three other hobbits, Sam, Pippen, and Merry. They run into many dangerous situations in the first few weeks. They are only few of many. While on the road they run into a man named Aragorn, or Strider. He is a ramger who has traveled that way many times. He helps them get to Riverdale where Gandalf is waiting for them. However before they reach Riverdale, they run into troublr with the Black Riders and it almost leads to a fatal accident. Frodo and his group fight the Black Riders many times before the reach Riverdale, but they all make it to Riverdale. There they are joined on the journey by Gandalf,Boromir( a strong man ), Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. From there the adventure becomes even more dangerous. They realize this when they are lead into dander and one of the company is lost in the darkness of the Abyss. However the company still moves on towars there goal, facing one danger after the next. I enjoyed the book and I would recomend it to anyone who likes adventure, and a book that keeps you turning the page."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was great because of all the action and adventure. It was also neat how Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf had perils all throughtout the book. This was cool because it is almost like in real life when someone is lost in the woods, you almost have the same problems, except for the goblins and trolls. The only bad parts in the book is how they always go to different places. Half of the places are not even on the map that comes with the book. They should have more labeled, so you know where they are going. But the book gives an excellent ending and makes you read the next book in the series, THE TWO TOWERS."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is a great book full of suspense,action,thrills, and alot of words I don't understand... It has alot of thrilling parts (such as being chased in an abandoned mine by orcs). It also features a very complex plot and interesting characters. If you enjoy fantasy books this is for u!!!ELVES RULE!...."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The first part of J.R.Tolkein's &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is the first part of the series of, &quot;The Lord Of The Rings.&quot; This novel, if you will, was both interesting but confusing. If you enjoy adventure and danger in a imaginative mind then you would definetly enjoy this book. I only rated it as three stars because it began, for me, a little slow and then it picked up. Once it picked up I found myself more tempeted to keep reading deep into the hours of the night. Then it would go back to being slow. After I got finished with the book I was happy I read it. I would often times put myself in the place of one of the characters. I agree with an aquentence of mine who says, &quot;It's beleivable.&quot; I think the most interesting character is Sam, Frodo accomplis. I enjoyed the book, but I am not sure if I would want to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book left me speechless! Tolkien not only used awe-inspiring discriptions and a glorious plotline, but made the magnifcant world of Middle-earth and all its inhabitants come to life. With the magic and mystery I think this is the epic trilogy of all time, never to be surpassed by anyone in the fantasy genre! A true masterpiece, without a doubt!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"For most of the book I greatly enjoyed it. There were times it made me feel like a kid again. Tolkien's characters are all well developed. ontop of that middle earth is very well mapped out. My problem with the book is it's more of one giant book broken down in to three parts. After reading the fellowship there is no resolution. the last 100 pages are fairly uneventful. The beginning of the two towers should have been the ending the fellowship. There could than have been a cliif-hanger ending. When the movie comes out the films visuals will no doubt be it's strong suit,but the ending is weak and will have trouble bringing back people to buy tickets."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkien's masterful writing not only tells you a story but also practically takes you to the world in which he created: Middle-earth.In exploring his first book of the LOR series, I really noticed how much care he put into creating his characters and blending them into the most realistic world I have ever seen in a fantasy novel. This book gave me many sleepless nights and had an end that made me itch to read the next book. It's no wonder why the LOR series has been a classic for many decades now."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)). SF/fantasy writers today could learn something from this astounding amount of preparation. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There's a plethora of reviews below mine (this is a classic after all) so I won't bother going over the story or taking up a lot of space with my comments. I will say this: I enjoyed this story a lot more now as an adult than I did back in grade school. I think this is because Tolkien focuses more on the characters' minds and their interpersonal (or interhobbit) relations than on simple swordfighting and stuff. The book concentrates on several human themes, most importantly being power and greed. In the beginning when Bilbo doesn't want to give up his Ring, we can understand why. We also understand how the Ring's evil power lead to the downfall of Gollumn. (The Ring kind of reminded me of the corrupting influence of hard drugs, drinking, gambling, and other social vices). The theme of despair is a big part of the story. When the hobbits reluctantly enter the Mines to try to cut through the mountain range you can feel their fear. The scene where they have to let one of their ponies go is a haunting one (&quot;Poor old Bill!&quot; is a line I'll remember) and you can really sympathize with these characters because they're not superhuman heros; they're everyday people (well, hobbits) in a tough situation. The ending is extremely powerful where Frodo decides he must take the corrupting Ring away from his compatriots and strike out on his own. When Sam catches up to him and heads off on this seemingly suicidal mission simply because he trusts his friend Frodo so much, it's a very moving scene.I'd like to comment that I read Stephen Donaldson's 1st &quot;Thomas Covenent&quot; trilogy (Lord Foul's Bane et al) and I liked them as much as I liked these books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The story itself is so much better than what the movie provides. Definitely worth the read! just wish i has bought the trilogy for 15 dollars rather than this one for 8 and i know the other two will cost 8 as well"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"this book was ok but not great. the first 50 pages or so is just about the traditions of hobbits. it gets.dull."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Because of all the hype and the fact that there was a copy lying around, I picked up this book and read it.The imagery and details are amazing.Frodo, a hobbit, inherits a dark and magical ring from Bilbo (his older cousin who chooses him to be his heir). Bilbo retires from his home and Frodo is left to adventure...the journey to destroy the ring.The plotline is somewhat simple,but the world building and metaphors Tolkien used make up for that.What was frustrating was that I could only understand the story when I immersed myself in reading for long stretches at a time...because it is poetic and lavishly detailed.I found it dissapointing (with its' length) that there wasn't more of a subplot going on. Yes there was dialogue between the characters but it did not seem to build up their friendships or characters much.Overall, it wasn't that exciting. There were monster scenes with little details and dinner scenes that seemed too drawn out.It was fun to read about the fantasy items like a ring that can turn you invisible and a bowl that can show you the: past, present, or future(the mirror of Galadriel). But I do not think will read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Although the author did a great job bringing to life the world of the Middle-Earth, I felt that there were to many points of view. To me, the storyline jumped around too much between characters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Ok, so I have to say that I enjoyed this book better than \\"The Hobbit\\" but it still was a very hard read for me. Somehow I have never read these books until now and starting them as an adult, I think I may get something very different from them than most people do who were introduced to the series at an earlier age. While I admire Tolkien's imagination, I still find some flaws with this book. I've also seen the movies before reading which could also serve to change my views on the book.We start in the Shire where Frodo Baggins has just inherited Bilbo Baggins (another hobbit we learn about in \\"The Hobbit\\")house, furniture, and most especially, a prized ring, after Bilbo has disappeared suddenly and plans to go off traveling again. For years Frodo doesn't worry about the ring and enjoys his time in the Shire just getting along alright. However, Gandalf the Grey wizard returns and gives him some history on this tiny little ring that is very surprising. It is the greatest ring on Middle-Earth and dangerous. It's previous owner Sauron wants it back for his own and has started to send out evil creatures to get it back for himself. If that happens, the world is doomed. Trying to keep it away from the minions, Frodo and some friends, take a journey to the Elven kingdom of Rivendale where they join part of a fellowship that is going to take the ring back to the one place it can be destroyed, but right at the enemy's gates in Mordor. Accompanying Frodo are a few hobbits, an elf, Gandalf, a dwarf, and a couple of humans. They have to pass through much danger and tribulations to try to get Frodo away on his quest as he becomes the Ring-Bearer.The characters in this novel are interesting, but to me, not enough time is spent on them. I would have loved to hear more about Hobbit's habits or the history of some of the other characters, but instead, the book spends more time detailing other things. Even the elves whom some may know about in the movie aren't described quite as well in the book. In fact, Arwen is barely in this book, which may disappoint some people. He did do a better job on Galadriel who actually did get a larger part in this book. Sam has always been my favorite character and I wish there was more of him in this book.The writing is extremely descriptive and this bogs down the reader at points in the novel. There are so many names of places and things that we don't even visit in the book that are described that it can serve to confuse a reader and make them wonder why it was even mentioned in the first place. The scenery is described over and over as well which makes for reading that once in awhile I just had to put down as it bored me. My biggest complaint would be all the songs and poems though. I found them distracting and there were so many, I have to confess that I started just skipping over them so I could get on with the story. I might have missed something in the history or backstory because of this, and I would have much rather just had it written normally. That being said there isn't a great deal of violence in this book and not many things offensive either.All in all I would probably give this book 3.5 stars. It has a great story but its hard wading to get through that story. But I'll move on to the next and see what The Two Towers has to offer.The Fellowship of the RingCopyright 1954458 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm one of those people who saw the LOTR films before reading the novels. And now, I've just finished reading \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" last night, and I must say that I didn't really enjoy it as much as other people did. I mean no offense: I still think that LOTR is classic literature that should never be forgotten, but here's the thing . . .After I saw \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" on DVD (both the theatrical and the extended; I now own the Extended Edition), I went on to read different fantasy novels. I've read Robert Jordan's first ten books of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series, Robin Hobb's \\"The Farseer Trilogy,\\" Diana Pharaoh Francis's \\"Path\\" trilogy, Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" (I'll be reading his sequel soon), and so on. Through the years, I've noticed a fomulaic structure that are prevalent in some of these books: average guy/girl in small village goes on a quest, average guy is world's only hope, etc. Terry Brooks's first \\"Shannara\\" trilogy falls into that category very well. But anyway, while I still enjoyed these novels, I couldn't help but be a bit irritated that they included the same basic structure that's typical in the fantasy genre. And now that I've read \\"Fellowship,\\" I couldn't help but think of all the fantasy cliches in many other books. But I know that Tolkien's works were somewhat original back in the day, and that the cliches were formed to perfection throughout the later years.But that's not all. I found \\"Fellowship\\" to be a bit more light-hearted than the actual film, which is fine with me, but light-heartedness isn't for everybody. I grew up watching TV shows like \\"Millennium,\\" \\"Deadwood,\\" \\"24,\\" and \\"House\\". And you already know that there are lots and lots of adult situations in them. Well, I prefer these hard-hitting adult shows over those crappy half-naive half-melodramatic teenage shows like \\"One Tree Hill\\" or something like that. And you know what, I think all these adult shows have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". I feel \\"Fellowship\\" wasn't intense enough to sustain my interest, but I guess it's just me.Now, I'll start with the CONS for this novel. \\"Fellowship\\" gets things going in the second half, but the first half is very slow and tedious. \\"A Long-Expected Party\\" and \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" were interesting enough (it's the history of the Ring that makes it all worthwhile), but then as I got to \\"Three is Company\\" it became a bit tedious. \\"A Shortcut to Mushrooms\\" and \\"A Conspiracy Unmasked\\" is when it started to slow down even more. Then, as I got to \\"In the House of Tom Bombadil\\", I couldn't help but be constantly irritated at its melodramatic overtones. Bombadil's a bit too much on the bright side. But then, the pace quickened up when I got to \\"At The Sign of the Prancing Pony\\" and \\"Strider\\". And some of the most intense sequences in LOTR are found in \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" and \\"Flight to the Ford\\"; this is when it becomes interesting again. As for the second half, \\"The Council of Elrond\\" was just downright hard to read through. Gandalf, Elrond, Men, Elves, and Dwarves just talking and talking and talking and talking. Though, lots of information on Saruman and the Ring are found here, it was just a very big hassle.But I have to say that the PROS are much better here. The concept of a hobbit going on this quest is highly unlikely, and that's why this book's so compelling. Tolkien broke the mold back in the 50's when he created Bilbo (for \\"the Hobbit\\") and Frodo Baggins. And having eight companions to follow the hobbit to Mount Doom makes it all the more exciting. Even though I don't find Hobbits very fascinating anymore, the thought of having one of them go on a journey to Mordor is still outstanding. And let's not forget the writing itself. Tolkien's imaginative narration soars above every page that's written here. It's all so rich in detail and amazing in imagery (Alan Lee's artwork really helps, too). And let's not forget the races. I know that orcs, elves, wizards, and dwarves are a cliche nowadays, but here Tolkien gives them something more. There's history, culture, social issues, and politics. Finally, the sequences in Moria and Lothlorien are brilliant in almost every way.I would have to say that television shows and other contemporary fantasy novels have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". The epic content I admire, but the formulaic structure I should try to tolerate. And I think it's not just fantasy novels and TV shows: there's contemporary books like \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"The Ha-Ha\\" and \\"House of Sand and Fog\\".But anyway, I did enjoy the first part of LOTR, but not that much, sorry to say. I'm glad, however, that other people have enjoyed it much more. And I admire Tolkien for his creation of a beautiful imaginary world. Now on to \\"The Two Towers\\" . . .Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The BBC verison is superior in almost every way than this NPR version, but this does have a few things to recommend it. Tom Bomdadil sounds just as I imagined he would. Sam's voice is childish, but for the most part endearing because of that. I imagine this is how he sounded at nine when he first met Frodo and you can easily hear how much he loves his master as this version includes my favorite scene from Book IV as Sam watches Frodo sleep and the light that is shining from within and says to himself, \\"I love him\\" and the loving reunion in the tower. Both are interesting inclusions because Americans usually shy away from the showing of same-sex affection so this was welcome in showing that beautiful, pure bond of theirs. The scene with the Barrow-wights is very well done and quite terrifying. You can very easily understand why Frodo would have been scared enough to want to run away. The narrator's voice sometimes gets really caught up in the action, dramatically describing the fell beast of the Ring-wraiths or especially Sauron's realization that he is doomed as Frodo puts on the Ring. I almost felt sorry for the Dark Lord there for a minute as he frantically sends his Nazgul to stop that little one, but then I crowed in delight, \\"Too late! Too late!\\" Unfortunately, the narrator is the only one that is enthused in this, except for Sam. Frodo is quite lackluster. Don't try to take the Ring away from him, but otherwise you have no idea that his soul is being torn apart. When he claims the Ring/is claimed by the Ring is done well though."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I find this book to be the best amongst the 3 books.

J.R.R. Tolkien, eminent translator and scholar, brings Middle-earth to life in The Fellowship of the Ring. A fellowship of nine companions sets out to destroy the One Ring: four naive hobbits, two valiant men, one dexterous elf, one steadfast dwarf, and the unassuming wizard Gandalf.The Fellowship of the Ring enthralls with enchanting moments like Bilbo's birthday party but chills the blood with its ghastly Black Riders. Written in the high style of ancient pre-history like Tolkien's prequel The Hobbit, once underway, Fellowship is a page-turner. Using third person limited narration, but often seen through the eyes of Ring-bearing hobbit Frodo, it recounts the first stage of the companions' journey. Tolkien's world is so real that I want to live there. The grandfather of all fantasy and science fiction, The Lord of the Rings is a must-read trilogy for all fans of those genres. Following bewitching Fellowship, the tension builds in The Two Towers and climaxes in the exhilarating The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think that The Fellowship of the Ring is an exciting book about a hobbit called Frodo Baggins who inherits a ring with power off his uncle Bilbo Baggins.

To learn about what the Lord of the Rings is about, please look elsewhere.I have owned the books for many years, I own a dramatization of the books on CD called &quot;The Lord of the Rings (Mind's Eye Version)&quot; and now I bought this version. I was doubtful at first if I should spend the money to basically buy something I already owned twice - I didn't regret it for one second.Rob Inglis (the narrator), a recognized Shakespeare actor, is doing an outstanding job on these 16 CDs (and there are 30 more for the next two books), each with more than 1 hour of playtime and divided into tracks of approx. 3 minutes each. His reading style, using distinctly different voices for each character without any additional sound effects or music, draws you very deeply into Tolkiens world. I enjoy listening to this undramatized version a lot more than the dramatized version I own. If you liked the book, you will love this version on CD."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I just read The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring in preparation for seeing the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing style was good, believable and yet easy to read. I would highly recommend reading The Hobbit first because there are too many references in Fellowship that won't make sense unless you do.For those considering reading the book before seeing the movie - I would recommend this. The movie was great and fairly accurate but left out many interesting details. Also, in rare form, the movie does add some to the book as it is more dramatic and slightly embellished in some places.For those who have read the book but not seen the movie - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There's irony in the aspersions cast against The Fellowship of the Ring. The criticisms most often raised- that its pace founders, that its heroes and villains are vapid, that its prose is effete- simply take a fractured view on the book's greatest merits.Such criticism is symptomatic of our age: Tolkien's pacing incenses readers reared on cartoon adventures, on entertainment calculated to induce adrenaline rushes each instant; Tolkien dares to paint characters unequivocally good or evil, anathema to a society that wonders whether the World Trade Center should still stand; nor does Tolkien condescend to the reader- he renders his epic through epic language. To a culture whose conception of male relationships is a duo of sitcom characters slinging insults and competing for females, the Fellowship's comradeship and nobility, even the genuine love among its members, is a jarring anachronism, but a welcome one.If this review smacks of falsehood, I'll concede that logical gaps should be expected in an argument for a book that I decided was the best ever written while in the first grade. I read Lord of the Rings again recently, though, and my admiration for the book soared. Its author insists that he meant for the tale to stand on its own merits, that it offered no commentary on World War II or on religion, and it does so commendably. It does more, however- it suggests on every page the transience of existence, that all things, beautiful and plain, strong and feeble, must give way to the new.Tolkien's Middle Earth, styled with abundant implications for our own world, nonetheless exists self-sufficiently. No book can boast of a factitious reality so unflinchingly realized. Every song, every sunset, every smoke-ring completes Tolkien's envisaged world, and brilliantly intensifies the conflict. Through profuse detail, we learn exactly what odds face the Fellowship, and what lies at stake. Each step on the journey, then, and each battle acquires gravity unattainable to a tale less completely realized. The opening chapters and subsequent exposition are not impediments to the conflict ahead- they, rather, are integral to it.The Fellowship of the Ring and its companion volumes could imbue all humanity with pride in their nobility. We instead seethe against its idealism. Lord of the Rings becomes, curiously, an exclusionary book. It has nothing to say to post-modernists who find perverse vindication in depictions of people as frail as they. It offers nothing to self-hating intellects who equate &quot;human&quot; with &quot;impotent,&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; with &quot;delusion.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings expertly lends us a view of life as one ought to live it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As LOTR regularly wins polls as the twentieth century's favorite work of fiction, it is now rather difficult to say anything new about it, except that professors of English who appear on highbrow chat shows to review literature rather reprehensibly still prefer 'realists' of the Thomas Hardy and George Eliot ilk. Chronologically (in Middlearth time and in order of publishing), 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the first book of the great Lord of the Rings trilogy and follows 'The Hobbit'. Of course The Hobbit itself is largely aimed at children, although the themes mature as the story matures, whereas LOTR is four-squarely adult. However, it should be realised that Hobbit is essentially, as Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis put it, 'merely a fragment torn from the author's huge myth'. The inchoate romance of the whole of Middlearth and its inhabitants came into being over a very long period, and formed a superlatively coherent whole well before he thought of publishing.As an heroic romance, the book was launched into a post-war Britain that largely expected fiction to be a 'slice of reality', as in the Hardy/Eliot tradition. We had turned our back on books of this type. So far as romances of imagined worlds, real heroes, real villains, and epic themes went the science fiction sub-culture of dime novels and cheap comics was the brightest spot on the literary horizon! All the greater the shock then, when this luxuriously and profligately original masterwork, a veritable new Odyssey, re-established the genre at a stroke.The story starts quietly, and even a little childishly, in the Shire of the hobbits, who are quite English and very much the sort of creation that an Englishman of the Midlands would create, although they are not an allegory of the English (I speak as a Midlander). Events rapidly gather pace and the serious and high nature of the quest becomes apparent, the great master-ring created by Sauron being in the seemingly accidental possession of one Frodo Baggins, hobbit-at-large. The Ring is too terrible a weapon to be mastered for good and used against Sauron, yet the Lord of the Rings is utterly set on claiming it back. Therefore, hard though the thought is, the weapon that is the Ring must be destroyed. A trusty band, a fellowship, of adventurers must be assembled to carry out the quest. There are many subtleties in this book, and the characters are not all they seem. The heroes of the fellowship have mixed motives, Boromir especially. The climax of the Fellowship of the Ring largely revolves around the chaos caused by the Boromir's inner dilemma and his unwise actions. Even Gollum the sneak is not yet entirely bad and has the occasional good impulse. As if the Black Riders and hordes of orcs were not bad enough the story breaks off with a classical cliff-hanger, as the quest must go on even though the fellowship be riven by argument and conflict. As the plots and sub-plots multiply so does the tension. A must read?, to be sure. More than once, certainly. But not before the next two installments..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In this sequel to The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins's favorite nephew Frodo inherits his uncle's magic ring when Bilbo leaves to go off on his last adventure. Years later, Bilbo and Frodo's friend Gandalf, a powerful and wise wizard, comes along to tell him the tragic, horrifying story of the ring. He tells Frodo that many ages ago, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the One Ringto rule over 19 other magic rings used for good that were still in existence. The ring has slipped from hand to hand throughout the years before it came to Gollum, who Bilbo took it from. Sauron had recently started madly searching for his ring so that he could use it to rule all of Middle-Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that he and his friends must set out and take the ring to Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was created, and throw it in to unmake it for good. I would strongly recommend The Fellowship of the Ring to anyone willing to take the time to read it and has previously read The Hobbit. It does get dull in some places, but soon speeds up. The story is enthralling and thouroughly enjoyable. Tolkien has a wonderful way of using the English language to pull the reader in. You should definately at least give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the first step in what is undoubtedly the greatest work of fantasy literature of the 20th century, if not of all time. Tolkien has created a world so compelling, and so 'real' that the reader cannot help but be pulled into Middle Earth.The characters are engaging, the story is riveting, and the locations - Good Lord - the locations are Wonderful. Places like Lothlorien, the Old Forest, Weathertop, and of course the Mines of Moria - the ancient, sprawling dwarven kingdom that inspired Gary Gygax to create the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role playing game.If you are new to fantasy, if you don't usually go in for this kind of story, or if you are just looking for a great read, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about.Let me put it this way -- there exist in the world dedicated Tolkien Scholars. How many Clancy or Koontz scholars do you think are out there?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first segment of the greatest literary masterpiece ever written, The Lord of the Rings. Lots of people call it a trilogy, but I can only agree with that idea in that the three segments were initially published seperately in the years 1954, 1955, and 1956. Besides that, one has to notice that each segment is incomplete without the others. A trilogy would contain three complete stories, like the original Star Wars trilogy. Well, its time I got on with my two cents of TFOTR. After The Hobbit was published, the fantasy genre was revived in a way that gave Arthur and his knights a run for their money. Fantasy was back, 20th century style. People begged for a sequel, and Tolkien delivered one beyond anybody's expectations and imagination. TFOTR begins to answer the questions that resulted at the end of The Hobbit. This, I feel, is its main purpose. It doesn't have as much action as the two later segments, but instead focuses on why a new quest is to begin. It does have its moments of action, but most of suspense and intrigue comes from revelations. Thats why The Hobbit should be read first. It would be a mistake not to. It is true that is somwhat slow in the beginning, but the suspense and wonder of a ruling ring just glides in the story. Suddenly, what happened with Bilbo's quest becomes very importent. It was in TFOTR that Tolkien introduced Middle-Earth and its history. A person forgets that they're reading fantasy in LOTR. It feels very real, and once TFOTR gets though the beginning, it doesn't let go. The only real bad part is that it leaves you hanging in the end, forcing you to read The Two Towers and making you wish that you had a single volume edition. I've been to Middle-Earth, and I deeply regreted having to leave for a while. Read this masterpiece (LOTR) before you die. You'll be incomplete if you don't."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Prepare yourself to delve into a world so rich, so full of life and history that you will have trouble distinguising it from something real. The Lord of the Rings is a veritable treasure. I picked up The Hobbit quite some time ago, I think I was in the 4th grade.From the moment I read the first words &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot;, I just couldn't put it down.This book does, however, lack a few things. Smut, trash, cussing, and all of the other all too common things these days. This is pure fantasy, pure enjoyment.My only wish is that I had never read it, so that I could enjoy the experience of reading it the first time again.I warn you. If you are a very busy person, and don't have much time on your hands, then don't get this book, because you'll find yourself neglecting many important things to keep reading.With charecters so vivid that it wouldn't surprise me at all if I were to run into Gandalf on the street. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd sit down with him and blow a few smoke rings before heading in our seperate directions.My point is, this is a wonderful series . . . arguably one of the best. Buy this book, take the chance. I did, and I have no regrets."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Part one of the Lord Of the Rings Trilogy is an outstanding work of art. Tolkien uses rich and skillful words to tell his epic tale. While part one doesn't have much in the way of action, it is my favorite out of the three books. It contains a very suspenseful build up to part two, where the real action begins. Of course you wouldn't expect Part one to have as much action as Part two or three.In 'Fellowhip of the Ring' I fell in love with Frodo's faithful servant Sam. He is character to good too be true! It is Sam's personality and comments, that make him an absolute bomb. In the other books he is the bomb, but in an action stand point. The only problems with the other two books, is that you have to wait to the second half of them, to find out what has happened to Frodo and Sam.This is a must read for everyone. Of course read 'The Hobbit' first. Without reading that first, this book here can be confusing, and less fun. I wish at times that I hadn't ever read this trilogy, just so that I could read it again for the very first time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"FOTR is really wordy and much too long. Could have been half as long and twice as good if Tolkien had removed all of the really unecessary description, histories, songs (esp. the songs, really pointless), etc. I found it very difficult to stay with this book. After reading the Hobbit, this book is just too slow."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I don't read many books but for some reason this caught my eye. Hearing about the upcomming movie I decided to read the book it came from. Reading more into the book I'm accaully looking forward to what the movie has to offer this fall. It takes a long time for the book to accaully take off but it gets better. The story of a guy still living on his 111th birthday is differant and he still lives on longer. By holding something magical, he has the power to live on longer. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it takes forever to get going, but they have to make the background before they travel and they take a long time. In the most part after they made the background in the novel I couldn't get my hands off the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In despite of my great respect for Mr. Tolkien's personality and the fabulous fantasy universe he has created, I can't give any good credits to this book. It's very leisurely and hard to follow. It's difficult to tell what it really is that's wrong with the book. When I think about it rationally, the story should be extremely interesting. When I start to read it, it just bores me to death. No offense.This book is for dedicated fans only. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, read The Hobbit first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"* I would really like to give this book 2.5 stars, but since that's not an option, I thought rounding up was more fair than rounding down.So after my third attempt to slog my way with Frodo and Company on their seemingly endless journey over every hill and through every forest in Middle Earth, I finally made it! Yea me!!!! As other reviews here have stated, I found the story to c-r-e-e-p by and my eyes had started to glaze over after the 110th description of a hollow or hill or tree or ravine or cliff - you get the idea. I also found parts of it to be filled with, for lack of a better word, WTF- erry. Tom Bombadil anyone? I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-read person and I had no idea what anybody was talking about during that whole section.What really made this book a chore for me to read, though, was the total lack of warmth or humor. Yes, I know it's a dark, serious epic, but come on! Harry Potter (yes, I also know that the two series have been compared, analyzed, evaluated, blah, blah, blah to death) also has a dark undertone but Rowling still managed to add a little sparkle to her characters and story. I cared what happened to them. While reading Fellowship, on the other hand, I was kind of hoping Sauron would get the ring and kill them all - end this somehow! I can't take seriously characters who take themselves so seriously. Half of the speeches given in the council scene reminded me of the Holy Hand Grenade scene in Monty Python - excpet that was supposed to be funny! \\"And lo, we beheld the day on which PooPooRoRo, father of BlahBlah, son of STabMePlease crossed into the Plain of TerribleTerror and crossed the River of WordVomit...\\" That whole scene was so academic and pompous that I almost couldn't read it. Couldn't Aragorn have said, \\"Ok - here's the deal guys. I'm really supposed to be the king, but I kind of have an attitude problem and I'm a loner (besides that means a really hot, brooding actor will play me in the film) so I've spent the past few years wandering around, but now things are serious and we have to get it together and save Middle Earth.\\" Was it really necessary to detail the family history (including school records and traffic tickets) of everyone on the Council?However - having completely slammed this book - the writing is beautiful and the story (as far as I could tease it out of all of the other stuff) really is fantastic. Kudos to Tolkien for creating a total universe of his own that is obviously vastly influential to both the literary and cultural world. I mean, I read a 400 page book that I really didn't enjoy because I felt like I could barely consider myself literate if I hadn't read it! And I'm going to read the other two - which I've been given to understand are more entertaining. It is obvious that this world was real to Tolkien and I can appreciate that.But if I have to work as hard to read The Two Towers, I'm going to chuck it and turn on Monty Python..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I love fantasy and I love long books that are continued in a series. That being said... I read all of the books in The Lord of the Rings. The first few pages were okay.. but I quickly grew to realize that while there were some interesting concepts put into play for this book and the others in the trilogy.. however, it was far too long.I read this right before the movies came out thinking that I'd be wowed.. The movies were fantastic.. but I really wish I hadn't forced myself to read the trilogy. It was an unnecessary evil."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The ring has once again found a new owner after spending many years in the hands of Bilbo it was thrust upon Frodo whose task is now to carry the ring out of the Shire and keep it out of the hands of the enemy, Sauron. The planning of Bilbo's 110th birthday was going as planned and only person that knew of Bilbo's planned vacation from the Shire was Frodo. At the party there were many fireworks, compliments of Gandalf the wizard, and other activities, and at the feast Bilbo disappeared after giving a speech and was not seen in the Shire again. Frodo discovered the ring and Gandalf told him to never use it even if the situation was dire. Gandalf left to do research and didn't return for many years but when he did he told Frodo that he would have to leave the Shire because it was no longer safe for him or the ring for ring wraiths were trying to find it. Frodo then sold Bag End (the place where he and Bilbo lived) and bought a small hole in Crickethollow to try to cover u the fact that he was leaving. Frodo started out on his journey to Crickethollow with Sam Gamgee and Perigrin Took (known as Pippin) and they were met by a group of elves and Frodo was named elf-friend. They decided to spend only a few hours and then the group of travelers, now including Merry Brandybuck, left at dawn. They decided to take a road through the Old Forest to find a way to Rivendell where they got into trouble but were saved by Tom Bombendil who gave them a good nights rest and then led them out of the forest, and then he told them to go to the Prancing Pony Inn to spend the night. At the inn they met a man named Strider who was a Ranger from the North and he helped lead them to Rivendell. After a few days they were caught by ring wraiths and they stabbed Frodo in the shoulder. The groups of travelers proceeded on but were chased again by the wraiths, but this timed an Elvin lord appeared and the wraiths were crushed under raging waters that had risen. They made it to Rivendell and Frodo was cured and reunited with Gandalf and Bilbo. After Frodo came to, they had a council to decide who would go on the quest with Frodo. At the first council it was decided that Sam would accompany Frodo on his quest, but on the second meeting it was decided that Aragorn, Legolas, Boromer, Gandalf Pippin, Merry, Sam, and Frodo was form the fellowship, and were tasked with the job of destroying the ring. They traveled for a long time with little problem but they hit bad weather and were forced to travel through the mines of Moria where they met a terrible beast and Gandalf met his fate. Then the company traveled on but entered the land of Caras Galadhon where the stayed for a while and decided that it was solely his purpose to destroy the ring. Then Frodo fled and Sam followed as they headed for Mordor, but the orcs caught up with the others and Merry and Pippin were captured and Baromer was killed. This was one of the best books I have ever read because it kept me engaged through the whole adventure.This was one of my favorite books because of how far the hobbits had to go just by themselves, even though they are not much taller than about three feet. First when they had to leave Bag End and travel through the forest instead of on the road with the lack riders on their tale all the way. Then in the Old Forest they were confronted by evil trees that were rotten at the core but they were eventually saved after days of horrible walking conditions by Tom Bombendil and Goldberry. Then after that they had to travel to the inn of The Prancing Pony all by themselves and stay secret to most people throughout their time in Bree.I loved this book greatly because of how he fights the desire to disappear t any moment. In the beginning when the black rider starts to chase Frodo through the grass and Frodo had the urge to slip the ring on his finger but he did not and they were saved by a group of elves. Then when they were in Barrow-Wights Frodo wanted to escape the place by disappearing but the urge to save his friends was stronger and he instead called upon Tom. Then while on the road with Strider, Frodo also had many thoughts about disappearing.I also really liked this book because of the variety of characters throughout the story. First there are the hobbits from the Shire who are brave, kind, and thoughtful, but they are small and not the smartest people. The elves such as Elrond and Legolas are very tall and wise and know many things about the world. Then are the men and dwarves who are Gimili (the dwarf) who is short of temper and sometimes rash in his decisions, then there is Baromer who secretly and desperately wants the ring for Gondor to revive its glory. Then there is Aragorn who is a decendent of Isildor and is also wise and strong and will protect Frodo always at any cost.I liked this book because of characters like the heroic Aragorn and Frodo; also because of how Frodo fought against the will of the ring, and because of how the hobbits manage on their own. Frodo fought against the ring many times against the black riders and evil people of the land. It was also amazing that the hobbits made it all the way to Bree after being chased all the time by the black riders. This was one of my favorite books and I will the treasure the experience that I had while reading it.R. Roston"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm sure this won't be a popular review, but hear me out. I've heard a lot of people complain that the movies didnt' follow the books closely enough and that they could have been much better if they had done so. However, after reading this first book of the trilogy, I can honestly say that I personally enjoyed the movie more than the book.. I found it to be more exciting and awe-inspiring. It may just be that I saw the movie before I read the book (a sin, I know) and my first impression was just so great that I'll never forget it and it would be very dificult to out-do, but there are just some parts of the story in which I think were improved upon in the movie.While both the book and the movie are undoubtably two of the best pieces of art in their genres, they should be considered to be two distinct works. The movie included a few things that the book didn't and ommited a few things that the book dwelt on. While some people think that the movie should have been identical to the book as much as possible, I am glad that the director felt some degree of artistic freedom and was able to make some adjustments that he felt would make for a better movie (and which I agree with).. The book wasn't written as a movie and some of the story just wouldn't have been as good in a movie. Anyway, maybe its just by bias because of my having watched the movie before reading the book, but I thought the movie really outdid itself and was able to improve on the story.I still think that this is a wonderful book and realize that Tolkien is the Godfather of all that is Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo Baggins the Hobbit hero of the Fellowship of the ring, is the main character in this fantasy book, Frodo Baggins is given a magical ring that turns the wearer invisible and slowly takes control of the wearer. The ring was lost after the war and was found by Gollum in a river. Gollum wore the ring far too much and became a hidous cave-dwelling monster, he calls the ring his &quot;birthday present&quot;. One day Bilbo Baggins who you can read about in The Hobbit( which in my opinion is much better than this book) came upon the ring and took it away. Bilbo sensing its evil power working on him, gives the ring to Frodo Baggins in the begining of The Fellowship. This book tells of Frodo and his companions begining their quest to destroy the One Ring of Power, forge by the Master of Mordor, the land of the shadows, they must bring it to cast the ring in the cracks of doom to destroy it. Tolkien goes into paragraph upon paragraph of detail. The first few hundred pages are very boring and some chapters have nothing of importance in the story at all, like the chapter The house of Tom Bamlibado or something, this tells of how Frodo stops his quest to rest in Tom's house and listen to Tom's pointless,long, and boring stories. There are two chapters in the book that are very fun to read. The only reason you don't stop reading even when you are dieing of boredom, is the promised and hinted excitment in future chapters. The battle with the evil wolves lasts only two pages and the rest is 20 pages of how Frodo gathers fire wood and walks( oh who cares).Too much detail, so what if their walking over mountains, it doesn't take 2 paragraphs to say they walked over a MOUNTAIN! VERY BORING BOOK! If you have got the patience to read this you can probaly get through it alive.I rank all the Lord of the Rings books I've read out of 10.1. The Hobbit 102. The Two Towers 83. The Return of the King(haven't read it but is has to be better than the fellowship)4.The FellowShip of the Ring 1.5"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Yes, this book is lush with descriptions and originality - originality, I'll make myself clear here, in its day.The world of Middle-earth is rich and fantastic - again, I must say, in its day. Tolkien have done a truly marvellous work. What, then, is my problem with this Father of Fantasy, you ask?Look at it this way, Tolkien created a new language, a world full of creatures that have become a model to the modern fantasy. But when it comes to characterization and persona? It drops down like a rock.Elves, by all and every mean, are all-knowing and all-wise; they are forces of good, they never make a mistake, they are immortal - practically, they're one step away from being divine. Orcs and other so-called evil villians, on the other hand, are evil, savage... etc. It's a world of black and white, and that's my point. There's no twist, no intrigue, no whatever that adds depth we readers wish to see from modern fantasy authors. Aragorn, for instance, is a rightful heir to the throne, a skilled Ranger, and so forth. But does he have any flaw in character? No. And everyone knows well how boring and unlikeable a perfect character is.The way he wrote it is out of date; it may remain popular and a favourite in others' minds. But not me."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There are some good and bad things to say about this book. The first of which is probably this. I think it's unfair that some people call this the greatest series of books ever written. Then again, in looking at some of the reviews, calling it total garbage is also unfair as well.In all, this is a good fantasy book. However, I must caution that if you are really into fantasy, this is not going to do it for you. Why? Well, really it has mostly to do with the fact that there is no one main character that can overcome everything. When the chips are down, so to speak, hope, luck, and a little ingenious intervention must be used by the &quot;good guys&quot; to escape trouble.This isn't to say the book does not have it's negatives, because clearly it does. But let's start with a positive and go from there. The first is that this is a very rich story. Of course, this is part of it's downfall too. There is a lot of history that only a Lord of the Rings scholar would be interested in or would be able to follow. The lore of the ring is one thing. But every character's history is handed down to the reader. Is it rich? Yes. Is it very hard to follow? Well, if you don't want to take notes, yes.Along these lines, one of the biggest complaints I see from people is that Tolkein should have handed this story to someone else to write, and I can see that perspective. There are a lot of flowery yet empty descriptions. But for me that wasn't too much of a turnoff. In mentally building a scene, I like to have it painted before me. Still, there were times when I was edgy to get the narrative moving. There were other times when I was downright bored by the lack of action.Bringing that thought around again, however, it leads me to proclaim that this narrative is more believable in that fashion. Classic fantasy books have balls to the wall action from cover to cover. This is not the case here. As such, this is more believable as a story that does really exist somewhere and Tolkein merely related that story to our world. The action is not overly sensational. Nothing is &quot;over&quot; anything. Of course, this is what makes people like it less.The ending of the book is dreadfully slowr. This is something that I take issue with. Someone else mentioned that there is no character development, and I think this is true. But I also think it's true that there doesn't need to be character development in what equates to a journey of a ring with a various number of escorts. The &quot;character developmet&quot; is essentially what you learn about the ring and the powers that exist to get it.One thing I particularly do not like is the excessive songs and poems. I think they add little to the story and only sevre to derail the reader who genuinely wants to see the story develop, not take another detour into history or a different tangent altogether. I wouldn't mind songs entirely, I don't think. But some are 3 pages long and read very dry.Ok, so those are my complaints, which started out as what was supposed to be a positive. Well, the positives are that the book is very enjoyable if you don't want a big strong lead character to destroy every foe in his wake. You likely will not sit down and get back up again when you're done. The book doesn't read that fluidly from cover to cover. Some things take digesting.I would recommend this book for just about anyone. Of course, you should read the Hobbit first, as it is the prequel to this series. The Hobbit is a bit more enjoyable than the first read but a tad younger in its target audience, I believe. This first part of the Lord of the Rings is a solid first step, but moves a bit more slowly and contains a fair amount of info not needed to really get at the unfolding narrative in front of you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I am not one who usually buys books-on-tape (or CD as in this case) but I have long wanted to obtain the Lord of the Rings so as to hear this incredible story over and over. After having read it several times, my book is in tatters and so I searched for an unabridged audio recording. Many of those that I have seen claim to be &quot;unabridged&quot; but the fact is that they are not complete! They give parts of the books in full but leave out many sections or chapters. This set by Rob Inglis is COMPLETE!!! It is very well read with no drastic voicing of characters. Characters are easily distinguished and thoroughly enjoyable. This set is not full of sound effects and music, so if you are looking for that this is not for you. However, I personally prefer the fact that this is not an over-production and is rather quite focussed on what I wanted in the first place, the characters and the story. Inglis does a marvelous job and I am very happy with this set. Again, not to harp on it but, this is a &quot;complete&quot; package well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is truly a wonderful story , But I was unsure of getting the cd over the audio tapes. I noticed that the tapes had the Unabridged version and the Cd version did not say if it was or not on all parts, so i took a chance and got the Cd version of each book. Thankfully the Cd version Is also Unabridged. So for those of you out there like me who might have been confused between the tapes and the Cd now you know they are the same."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In my review of Rob Inglis' reading of The Hobbit, I said it seemed to take me a little while to get into his vocalizations, even though I'm a big fan of audio books (especially those read by a British voice).The Fellowship of the Ring, however, I fell in love with immediately. Rob Inglis' style is perfect for this book. He does the voices well and the story is far richer and more engrossing than that of The Hobbit. (Even though The Hobbit is delightful and unique in its own right.)There really isn't much I can say about these Lord of the Rings audio books that hasn't already been said. This CD edition of The Fellowship of the Ring read by Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis is perfect for you if:1. You love The Lord of the Rings2. You're intrigued by all the pre-movie hype and you'd like to discover what Tolkien's book is really all about3. You have a lot of drive time on your hands and you'd like to fill it with something entertaining and intelligent4. You can't stand listening to insipid Top 40 or Talk Radio programs5. You love listening to the British dialect6. You just want to have a good time hearing one of the greatest novels ever written read to you by a professionally trained actor who makes each character come to life.The sound quality on these CDs is, as it was on The Hobbit, superb. The recording level is perfect. The pace of the reading is just right. I'm about halfway through right now and I'm looking forward to every minute of it.This edition is a very good value for the price."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Now, this is probably going to be an unpopular review because people will see the three stars and think, &quot;What, is he out of his mind? The Lord of the Rings is one of the best books ever written&quot;. And it is. But this is not a review of the book, it is a review of Rob Inglis' READING of the book. And the editorial raves not withstanding, I am sorry to say that this is not a reader that EVERYONE will like. Before I get lynched, here's why I think so.I have listened to HUNDREDS of audio books. All unabridged. Inglis falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. He has a deep voice -- this would not normally be an issue were he reading a historical work. But Inglis is one of those readers who does &quot;voices&quot;. NOw some people are genius at this. For example, the incomparable Frederick Davidson. But for Inglis, the deep voice is a liability when he tries to pitch it high to do an elf voice or, good heavens, a woman's voice. The result is very annoying.Also, fans of the Trilogy will know that it is filled with song. Inglis' rendering of the songs was grating (at times almost embarassing) -- and got my fast forward finger working over-time. He is over-matched by this, particularly when it comes to Galadriel or Legolas.Next there is the manner, or tone, in which Inglis has chosen to pitch his reading. He has adopted a wistful, elegiac, far away manner -- it is almost pretentious, I have to say. And it becomes tedious because he almost never varies it. He is, as the saying goes, &quot;a bit one paced&quot;. Now, some people will like his voice and manner, I do not deny this -- because it does, as one of the editorial reviews says, emphasize the fairy tale aspect of the Trilogy.But to me is drains some of the manliness and power from some of the dialogue. Aragorn, to me the quintessential man of action and mystery, a true hero, comes across as a man obessesed with what has been lost; a man trapped in the past. Which he clearly isn't.Some examples. Aragorn and Boromir are virtually indistinguishable. The Hobbits (apart from Frodo), Sam in particular, are rendered in a country bumpkin voice that is out of all keeping with what I see as the inherent dignity of the Hobbits. It also serves to underscore Sam as the servant of Frodo, rather than his friend. Legolas ends up with a reedy, strained voice, because Inglis can not get into the higher register. I was left thinking, &quot;who ever made the rule that Elves had little high voices?&quot;HAVING SAID ALL THAT, this is the ONLY unabridged version. And as such, falls into the &quot;must have&quot; category. For all of the foregoing quibbles, Inglis' reading is serviceable and entertaining. Buy it -- you will enjoy it -- but do not expect the definitive reading -- that awaits us! Which is an ocassion for celebration I suppose. Because surely it will come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Writing yet another review of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; is a bit like adding icing to a thousand layer cake. No matter how well written, it is highly unlikely that I could add anything new to the richly deserved kudos that Tolkien's efforts have received in the decades since they first appeared. I have read and re-read these works countless times since I first encountered them when I was in high school, which was back sometime around the invention of fire.I'm not going to even attempt to describe the contents of the volumes other than to state that it is the tale of a great journey and an even greater quest to free the world of a great horror. It shows how there is no such thing as the least or the greatest, and that all have terribly important tasks to do. Tolkien's tale combines fantasy within an ethical and moral framework to create a story that has value for every age group.Over the years, my perception of the books has changed considerably. MY first few readings where in childlike (or hippy-like) wonder, and then, over the years, I have become more conscious of the works as literary efforts and some of the wonder has worn off. But even so one cannot but be amazed by the amount of scholarship and effort that went into making &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; an epic which deeply touches almost everyone who comes into contact with it. On the negative side, though, I found in my latest re-reading that the language seemed a bit more overblown and stilted than I remembered. Unfortunately, that one piece of the gloss had worn off a bit.Recently, looking for some tapes to listen to during a long trip, I came upon this set, narrated by Rob Inglis. It was very nicely priced and just the right length. I decided to discover what it felt like to hear &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; instead of read it. It turned out to be a felicitous decision. The occasional over-formality of the written text seems to vanish when it is read. The tale takes on an entirely different flow, and I found myself much amazed by all the adventures and trials that the four hobbits faced. In a way, the spoken Ring is a completely different work.Rob Inglis does a remarkable job of reading. He manages to produce enough different voices to keep the many speakers separate from each other. I think the reading would have benefited from having additional readers, but Inglis does a fine job nonetheless. Except, unfortunately, when he sings. As much as I enjoyed hearing the many songs of Tolkien for the first time, Rob Inglis is not a singer. He can carry a tune alright, but there is something just a bit unmusical about it. Not enough to detract from the total effect, but enough to cause a wince now and then. Even so, this was a surprisingly enjoyable experience. Recommended to all who seek a different experience of a wonderful old tale."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said in the many, many other reviews? This book is absolutely fabulous. It's full of all the stuff a terriffic novel needs. The characters are complex and intriguing, the plot is fascinating and draws you in so you can hardly put it down. The history given for the world in which the books take place is so extremely detailed and believable, you start to wonder if Middle Earth exsists. Which brings me to another point- the setting is absolutely wonderful, I'd give anything to go to Middle Earth and explore.Sure, it slows down in some spots (the infamous Council of Elrond chapter... ^_-), but for a story to work the plot must slow down in some parts for the author to explain things and put further events in the proper context. BTW, even if you haven't read The Hobbit, I think you'll follow this book along just fine. Bilbo's account (There and Back Again) is told in summary in the prologue.After you read this book, I think you'll want to get one of those &quot;Not all who wander are lost&quot; bumper stickers for your car, too! ^_^"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the way The Lord of the Rings was meant to be experienced. At it's heart the Rings Trilogy is Epic, and as such lends itself beautifuly to the spoken word. Inglis (the reader) is a master of all of the key aspects of this form. His voices of characters are fantastic and the music he composed for all of the songs presented are enchanting. I can't recomend these tapes enough. The experience is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I started reading Tolkien 7 years ago, and of course I didn't appreciate his works like I do now.Many seem to believe we should read the book because it was made as a movie, and publishers are milking this classic (LOTR stood the test of time, because it is an attractive story and it attacks social issues that can be identified by mankind for all time. I should add that it stereotypes, but only because of the time in which it was written.)for all it is worth and publishing a dozen different editions. Everyone has seem to forgotten that Tolkien never wanted 'The Lord Of The Rings' separated, not even as three novels. Now, it is being sold as a box set! In separate books! I don't think he would be pleased.Tolkien is a genius. His imagination gave us a separate universe, but not one beyond belief. Read the book because it is worth your time. But don't expect everything to go as you expect. The language is not complicated, save the prose. There are certain glitches - sometimes the people act out of character. You'll LOVE them, though. You will criticize this book, because you should with every work you read. But trust the legions of fans out there, and experience it. Don't shun it when you haven't read it, and by reading it I mean to the end. It's insulting to everyone when you give a comment on something you don't fully understand because you don't have the patience to. That's bias.And I would just like to add that Alan Lee is a wonderful illustrator, and made Tolkien's works that much more entertaining. I own the hard cover edition binding 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' in its entirety. I really recommend that edition to add to your library.As for the movie, Jackson held true to the story, his movie is one of the best I've seen. Great cast as well. I'm very happy that fans like me won't feel cheated and sorry to one of our favourite authors for having his mark in history smudged by Hollywood."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm really tired of the Fellowship getting a bad rap, even by Tolkien enthusiasts. &quot;Too slow and not enough action&quot;, I've heard, &quot;the weakest book in the trilogy&quot;.

That's NOT action?!? And the so-called &quot;slow parts&quot; happen to be the most magical moments in the history of English literature. The pastoral beauty of Hobbiton, the House of Tom Bombadil, Lothlorien...people are actually COMPLAINING about these!?!?

This definition led me to believe that I would be receiving the whole story. I should have looked at the number of disks (or tapes) and the 4 hour time given. This is not an unabridged version of the first boook of The LOTR trilogy. It might be an unabridged version of the BBC rendition, but who knows.

Indeed when it is finished you wish you could just forget all about it and read it again as for the first time. Certainly those who have felt what I have for this book can understand what I am talking about. For everybody else, I hope you may be able to read any book which will cause you such feelings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful, intreging, enthralling adventure story. The characters are well rounded and three dimensional - a rare occurence in works of fiction. The prose wafts along agreeably, absorbing the reader into the incredible world of Middle Earth. The first time I read this book I was so enchanted by the whole aura of the setting that for weeks I lived in Middle Earth alone.

So Frodo and three of his friends travel to Rivendell. From there they have to go to cool places like Caradhras, the Mines of Moria, Lothlorien, and, finally, the great river of Anduin. Also, READ THE SONGS! They have great historical importance!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I am not a real fan of fantasy literature and this is a book that has sat on my shelf for years. One of those \\"I should read this but will get to it one day\\" books. When I knew the movie was coming out, I picked up and read ... and read ... and read. I now understand why Tolkien is considered a master of the English language. He has a unique nack of creating this world and bringing you in to it like you were there. I would put Tolkien down as one of my favorite authors now along with Dostovesky and Jane Austen. In a way that Dostevesky takes a reader into the psyche of his characters and Miss Austen into the manners of her day, Tolkien takes the reader into a world that you don't want to leave."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have to admit hesitating when person after person told me to read The Lord of the Rings. Finally, I bought the book and just read it, and there are few books as written as well as this.I had to, however, not give it the 5 stars it surely deserves because it can be a tough read. It's an old book, so the prose is &quot;dated.&quot; It can also be very historical at times, delving into pasts far from the present, and never to be spoken of again.But THAT'S what makes this such an engrossing tale...the histories. Everything from Bilbo's songs to the story of Strider's sword add to each beings personality and give them a life that few modern writers can achieve.And the images Tolkien can conjure span many generations and are as individual as the person reading it. He gives enough information of the Shire and Rivendale and Bree and everywhere else to form an idea, but not so much so that he corners you into seeing what the next person sees. The many interpretations of Frodo himself are testement to this.If you want something to read in two days, grab a Brooks novel, if you want something you can read again and again and get something new from it each time, I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.(...) Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am young and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece. You will never want to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I just finished reading, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (FOTR) a few days ago. It was my second time and I think it is my favorite part of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Some of my favorite incidents happen here from, &quot;An Unexpected Party,&quot; where many a Hobbit gather for Bilbo's farewell party to, &quot;At the Sign of The Prancing Pony,&quot; a visit to a busy inn in the Hobbit town of Bree. Also, the chapters, \\"Many Meetings,\\" and, \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" are rare times of joy and rest where many different races meet for the Council of Elrond. Then, of course, there are the climatic chapters, \\"A Journey in the Dark,\\" and, \\"The Bridge of Kazad-dum.\\" and, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\"What I like about the novel is this is where one learns the background of the tale; where did the Ring come from, what does it do and where has it been all these centuries? Tolkien creates a feeling that FOTR stands in a long tradition; the world of the novel is already thousands of years old by the time we visit it. After one finishes the entirety of the Lord of the Rings, \\"The Silmarillion,\\" provides the creation myth and the ancient history of the Elves and the other races of Middle-Earth; Tolkien worked on it his whole life.There is also a great feeling of ambience; from the way Tolkien describes geography to the description of buildings and the physical description of characters. On a deeper level, one has the feeling that the current age is about to set and another age is about to rise. The mysterious, powerful, joyous Elves of old are about to fade away and leave Middle-Earth (where Tolkien set his story) forever and Men will takeover and so begin the Fourth Age.The story is suspenseful, as the small company of Hobbits sets out from their sheltered homeland called the Shire to far off Rivendell, just west of the Misty Mountains. All along the way, they are followed by the Black Riders who seek to recover the Ring from Frodo (the Hobbit who carries it) and return it to its evil Master. At times, Frodo is tempted to use the power of the Ring even though he knows that it is evil. At Bree, the company meets with Strider; who wears&quot;[a] travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a good that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.&quot;They all journey to Rivendell, where the many tales of old are told and the Council of Elrond is called to decide the fate of the Ring. The decision is made and a Fellowship made to guide Frodo; Merry, Sam, Pippin (his original Hobbit companions), Legolas (an Elf of Mirkwood), Gimli (a Dwarf of the Lonely Mountain), Boromir (Man of Gondor), Strider, and Gandalf the Grey (a wizard) set out with Frodo. They set out to cross the Misty Mountains, but defeated by snow and weather, decide to turn back and enter the Mountain. The Mountain used to be a grand palace of Dwarves and is sung of in their songs.I can only encourage you to read this book before the movie comes out. While the movie does look quite good, novel-film conversion is never perfect and the book is better than the film nearly every time, so read the book first. I set a goal to re-read the entire epic before the films arrive."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I agree that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I will not say that I disagree with so-and-so's review on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing. And I am looking forward to the movie, it really does look amazing!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's novel titled, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; is the first book of the, &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; trilogy. The trilogy picks up where Tolkien's novel, &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; left off. Tolkein has a great imagination that is evident in his writing. He creates the fictional land called Middle Earth. The land is filled with dwarves, elves, humans, and hobbits. Hobbits are hairy creatures about half the size of humans. Hobbits enjoy simple lives but are capable of great feats and courage if they are pushed to it. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; tells the story of some extraordinary hobbits.Frodo is hobbit that lives in Hobbiton. Gandalf, an important and powerful wizard, gives Frodo the responsibility of caring for a special ring. The ring makes the wearer invisible, but it seems to have an evil affect on people. After many years, Gandalf discovers the true power of the ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring is called the, &quot;One Ring.&quot; The ring was created long ago and holds much power. Gandalf has also learned of an evil force trying to retrieve the ring. Sauron, the Dark Lord, is searching for the ring. If Sauron reaches the ring, he will control the Middle Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the the ring must be destroyed, and it can only be destroyed at the Mountain of Fire. Frodo decides to make the lengthy journey along with three other hobbit friends to destroy the ring.Along the journey, the hobbits come across many different people and dangers. Middle Earth is filled with many different types of creatures. Some are good, and some are evil. It is clear that Tolkien spent much time thinking about the land called Middle Earth. The characters are well developed and are easy to relate with. It is interesting to read about all the cities, creatures, and people in Middle Land. I am a slow reader, and I usually get aggrivated with books over 400 pages. However, I really enjoyed this book, and I plan to finish the trilogy when I get the time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Hobbits are funny little fat people with hair on their feet. They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.Frodo exits his homeland pursued by Furies: Nine undead kings mounted upon great black stallions. These Dark Riders have supernatural power and homicidal intent: they will find and destroy Frodo and restore the ring to its &quot;rightful&quot; owner, Sauron the Dark Lord.Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.The company meets exotic friends, confronts implacable foes, and surmounts daunting obstacles to move Frodo closer to accomplishing his important mission. This first volume of the trilogy ends with the quest seemingly in shambles, but remember there are two more volumes to come.Many have imitated, but none have equaled Tolkien's fairy tale for adults. I wish, however, that he'd left out most of those songs and poems. The best poems were merely mediocre, while the worst were awful. Early on I started skipping the poetry whenever I came to it. It didn't detract at all from my ability to follow the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Science class when I was twelve years old. Perhaps this explains why I do not like science (or its evil twin sister...math) and why I have never stopped reading. Recently, I have started rereading the trilogy. It is amazing how much seems new to me after all these years.The beginning of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is an enticing feast to begin with. It picks up years after the ending of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The story begins with the coming again of Gandalf to, and the departure of Bilbo from the Shire. It then moves forward into telling about Bilbo's nephew Frodo and the magic ring Bilbo leaves him.As events are set in motion, Frodo flees his peaceful home in the Shire. He and a fellowship of others are commissioned with destroying the magical ring...which they are informed is the most powerful tool of evil ever created...the One Ring. The great problem they face is trying to figure out how they will march straight into the heart of the enemy's power to the only place it can be destroyed.I am amazed at the eloquent power of Tolkien's writing. As a child, I was only concerned by the action of the plot (and there is plenty of action and suspense here). Now that I am a little bit older, I am blown away by the depth of these books. Tolkien's creation--the world of Middle Earth is a masterpiece. These stories are filled with poetry and legends from the past ages of middle earth. This depth makes the tale of the Ring breathe with life and wonder.The characters are even more fascinating than the journeys they go on. Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are my favorites so far; although I really like the developing friendship between Gimli and Legolas.I can't wait to read the rest of the stories. I highly recommend &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'll be the first to admit that the pace of the novel meanders a bit, and the action is spread far between the chapters, but regardless I found myself completely at the mercy of Tolkien's magic.

There you'll be introduced to Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who finds the ring that is the catalyst for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also the great wizard Gandalf who figures prominently in &quot;...Fellowship.&quot; It's seems so obvious now that modern masters of the fantasy genre such as Robert Jordan got so much of their inspiration from Tolkein. The edition I read also included a map so it was easy to chart the journey of Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo as he headed towards his dark destination. The story is simple, at the heart being the struggle to destroy a ring forged by a powerful evil that in the hands of it's maker would spell doom for everyone.I know some people felt it slow moving, and I don't totally disagree, but I loved it all the same.

Frodo is going to Mt.Doom,the center of Sauron's dark castle, to destroy the ring. Sauron is an evil wizard who wants the ring for himself. I recommend this book because of its strong wording and imaginative new and old characters. It had very good descriptions and a lot of adventure and excitment,but to me, no book is perfect.

However understandable this may be, some &quot;critics&quot; eagerness to say that so-and-so is imitating Tolkein, or so-and-so isn't as good as Tolkein, they are losing sight of the fact that they aren't Tolkein. True most fantasy authors have read Tolkein and probably put a little of his style in their works, but the point to their novels is to entertain. For those of you who keep forgetting this, you should either stop reading fantasy or open your mind a little and get a life. It's getting annoying and for anyone reading these reviews, who isn't a fan of fantasy yet, he or she may get the wrong idea as to the point of fantasy books, and never get introduced to what fantasy has to offer. It's not based around Tolkien, regardless of how good his books are, or how he pushed fantasy into the mainstream. The point of fantasy is the same as in any other genre, to entertain.For people out there who are looking for entertainment and not something to bitch about, Tolkein is a great introduction to fantasy.

The reader is then introduced to a ring, once in the clutches of the cunning Dark Lord, who wishes to conquer creatures living throughout the land. Yet, in order to do so, he must have in his posession the empowering ring that rules all. The only problem is, this ring is obtained by the hobbit-folk (Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo). And the hobbits are unaware of the danger of the ring.

I have been trying for 30 years to find a story that can fill the void left by finishing this trilogy. But I can't. I know now that all books to come will never satisfy me like these great works. And there is no other place that I would rather be now than in Middle-Earth. I suspect that one day I will go there when my time has passed here."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Many people have found the work of Ronald Tolkien to be To slow and boring, others find it to be to complex, and confusing. The more enlightened individuals of the world realize that, while the works of Tolkien are in fact a myhtology in themselves, his books are in fact some of the best literature ever written, if you have the time, I strongly suggest you read this book"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"First of all, this book will make little, if any, sense unless you have read The Hobbit. Believe me, I have tried it. So I read it a second time, after reading The Hobbit. It was good, I liked the characters and it was well written and a great story, but it seemed difficult to read because of so many references to things that had little to do with the rest of the story, especially the chapters that took place in Rivendell. My advice to anyone who wants to read Lord of the Rings is this: first, read The Hobbit. Go ahead and read this book, then The Two Towers and The Return of the King (you will probably like those two better). Then, read this book again after completing the trilogy. It will make much more sense the second time around, and you appreciate this book so much more. This really is a great series, and after exhausting myself with reading yet another Wheel of Time book (Robert Jordan fans can relate) I found myself re-reading the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I found to be a pleasant change of pace. Robert Jordan should have taken a few more notes from Tolkien's works before launching himself into his never-ending story. I think anyone will agree, Tolkien is often imitated, but never duplicated."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read this book when I was about 10, and I've reread it about twenty times in four years. This is a must for anyone interested in books at all. The depth of the world created within its pages simply boggles the mind. There is simply no way to describe it that does it justice. It is THE BEST. End of story. Once you start this or any of Tolkien's books, you won't stop until you've read them all. Believe me, I've done just that. I started with the Hobbit, then I finished the trilogy within a year. These books will totally absorb you. Buy them, read them and then read them again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I just finished re-reading &quot;Fellowship&quot; and like always, it's a nostalgic journey back in time. This is the first fantasy story I can remember reading, way back in 1973 when I was in fifth grade, and even though I know now the story inside out, I never am tired of this book.For some reason, I find it more magical than books 2 and 3, probably because there is still a sense of innocence and youth about the main characters, and we still do not realize the full horrid power of Sauron. I enjoy the many songs and stories written, the more so because it is seldom done anymore because it would sound phony or contrived by other authors. To be short: This series built the fantsasy genre as we know it today. The majority of authors out there have,conciously or not, put aspects of this tale in their books. That, I believe, is about the greatest testament to the power of this trilogy. It's wonderful"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The LOTRs trillogy, and The Hobbit are -The- best fantasy books ever written, period. Anyone who thinks that they are such an incredibly gifted reviewer as to point out &quot;these books certainly have thier flaws&quot; like I have seen in a few reviews really seems preety egotistical and ignorant. The imagery and characters of this book surpass all others and the action, suspence and humor are like the books themselves, on a level of thier own. These are the fantasy books that all others wish they were, and they were written nearly fifty years ago in a time when &quot;fantasy&quot; was not a very accepted gener, for that matter The Hobbit was written in 1938! Anyone who says this book is sluggish and borish and that 100 pages that dealt with nothing but descriptions and references to things not even concerning the books needs to give up on conquring the -Extremly Tedious- art of thinking and go back to thier TV set were everything is painted out for them bit by bit. Everything in this book is there for a reason, and builds the world for the reader.These books are hyped, and for a reason, if u go into reading them with the &quot;this better be the best book ever or else&quot; mindset you will find a reason or make on up to dislike them, instead go into the book and find out -Why- everyone thinks there so good.Long live the KING.slaybak"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy (Including the Hobbit) are absolutely the best books I've ever read. There is so much sensory and depth involved, you can't help but be sucked into the story. I don't know about anyone else, but the pictures painted in my mind of characters such as Gollum, are vivid and sometimes scary. This is DEFINATELY something every household should buy. Even my brother (age 12) loves it (although he probably doesn't understand it fully). To sum it all up is impossible, but all I can say is read the whole series starting with The Hobbit and you'll see what I mean. (And my description is an understatement)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I love the first part of this book-Frodo is a relatable nobody. The scenes are super-cute, like the constant stream of postmen going up and down, and the party, and best of all, the 'shop' at Bag End. But then, what could have been really cute and funny dissolves into an endless timetable of horseback rides, taverns, and quests. It begins to look like a Indiana Jones pairs up with Tintin and the Thompsons to find Excalibur and the Holy Grail in one go, but on the way they run into Professor Calculus' pendulum, Morgan le Fay, the Black Pearl, and to top it off, the bad guy, Saucepan, I mean Sauron, becomes an evil Voldemort and they have to destroy his umbrella. Maybe it's a good book. I just have to find a way to push myself through."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is about the journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends, Pippin, Merry, Sam (all hobbits as is frodo),Legolas (an elf), Gimli (a dwarf), Aragorn and Boromir (men), and the wizard Gandalf. I did not find this book particularly intruiging, though I am glad I read it because I will hear references to it throughout my life, I'm sure. In short there was to much talking and sitting around a campfire, eating lavish meals in lavish halls and whatnot. I would still reccomend it because, if you think about the plot and everything involved it is and excellent insight on life. About the power of friends and how the misuse of power may lead to corrupt."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When you spend too much time in the Shire you become a short fat hobbit. That is what this book did in the beginning by taking up too much time for the adventure to start. It does get better once they have finally started the real adventure of taking the ring to it's destruction. Now that we are through the book we only get a small showing of how good a Tolkien book can be. Overall it is a good book and everyone has to read it. I think this will be one of the rare books that are portrayed better as a movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is the first part of a trilogy chronicling the journey of one hobbit named Frodo and his friends. Frodo is the nephew of Bilbo, and has lived a fairly quiet life with his uncle in a hobbit-hole in a small village. Bilbo is famous in the village because once years ago he went away on a long journey and returned rich. No one is quite sure exactly what happened. And no one except those who were on the journey with him knows about the magical ring he brought back with him, that can make him invisible.Bilbo has decided that he wishes to leave his village and get away. So he throws a huge party and at the end of it he simply disappears. He leaves Frodo as his heir and leaves him everything, including the magic ring.Years later Frodo is visited by the wizard Gandalf, who was the one who sent Bilbo on his journey so long ago. Gandalf has news that the ring Frodo has inherited is very dangerous--it was forged by an evil wizard a long time ago, and it has incredible power. Frodo must take it to be destroyed where it was forged, and he must do it immediately. Bad things are beginning to waken all over the place, and Frodo must not let this ring get into the wrong hands. Thus his journey starts. This book tells the story of the first part of Frodo's journey to destroy the ring.This book has a bit more character development than \\"The Hobbit,\\" but it is still hard to get a grip on exactly what the characters are like. It was difficult for me to accept that things in this story were so urgent, yet Frodo and his companions spent long stretches of time not moving. It seems that the dark riders would have been upon them if they waited like they did in this story. Overall, there just wan't much action and not enough reasons to care about the characters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Many people gush over the LOTR series like they have nothing more to do. Curious, I went to find the first book, being the FOTR, to see what all the hype was about. Now, don't get me wrong. LOTR is good, but not as good as most people actually say it is. Sure, Tolkien created a interesting world full of unusual people. But must he go over every little detail? Sometimes he just keeps describing something for so long, my head starts to hurt and I keep losing my place or reading the same sentence over and over again. His dialogue is bland and there is really no emotion to it. The characters are just as bland as the dialogue. There is no or little character development in this book, despite its size. Characters should be 3D. Not that all of Tolkien's characters are flat. Actually, Bilbo is more 3D than Frodo. The other characters--Well I won't even start. The list is too long. I just fell asleep reading this book. Believe me, I tried really hard to read this book. But I just can't. I admire Tolkien for being able to create a world where fantasy rules, but the writer must be able to control his world freely and realisticly so that we can read it and enjoy it. It is sad to know that LOTR fans point their fingers accusingly to someone who writes something similiar to LOTR, but the book that person wrote is actually better than Tolkien's work himself."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"(...)

Many think it's an amazing piece of work, it is very different from everything else, and I don't like it at all.Why I didn't like this book is after the beginning it gets extremely boring. The detail is overwhelming. The language is exausting. I'm constantly asking my self 'erm... why is Whatshisname, son of Whatshisnamewithslightchange harkithing to thy for someith reasonith'? It just seems to prattle on and on about one thing over and over again.

I had to keep going back to read over pages that I had just read over (and no I don't have ADD or ADHD).And why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because, HOLY CRAP, this is the most detailed book I have ever read, seen, or heard of. Just the fact that anyone could come up with this highly detailed (boring, repetitive, confusing) story is something that deserves 2 stars.I know I'm going to get a whole bunch of angry LotR fans ambush me with a bombardment of 'not helpful' votes, but oh well...Recomended books:Harry Potter seriesDa Vinci CodeAngels and DemonsThe Adventures of Tom SawyerThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Sherlock HolmesThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.I've got one word for this book...BORING!

I remember how the \\"purists\\" were all up in arms when Peter Jackson changed the plots around, involved characters in certain areas, completely deleated others, etc. Well, I have to say, Jackson did a better job in telling Tolkien's work than Tolkien did.Tolkien's problem I think is that he created such a complex fantasy world with so much detail that he spent his whole time telling us about every single minor character and the minute details of every scene and completely forgot to move the plot along.There were times when I was reading this series and I thought, \\"wait, wasn't that a part that was pretty big in the movie?\\" Such as the Ringwraith's attack on Weathertop or the battle of Helms Deep. These events were described with as much emotion and excitement as if Tolkien were describing his morning routine.And I ended up groaning when one of his characters would launch into a long speech about how he ended up somewhere or especially when one of the Hobbits would talk about the Shire. At one point in \\"The Two Towers,\\" Gandalf actually warns Theodan NOT to bring up such topics...I wonder if Tolkien himself even figured out he was spending too much time on these pointless back stories.Don't get me wrong, I love reading books that are rich in depth but this is a bit too deep.Then there are the songs and poems which are nice but...I stopped reading them after a while and went on with the story.The entire premise of the Lord of the Rings was supposed to be a conflict of good vs. evil and trying to stop evil from obtaining the one ring. Sadly, much of the book is devoted to telling us how these Elves ended up here and what happened at these ruins and who was there...again, all stuff that probably would have been better in a companion piece rather than clumsily put into the story like a concrete roadblock.The plot itself was also odd. Now I understand that Tolkien wanted to publish his work all in one giant book but was forced to divide it up. The man obviously doesn't know about climax and plot resolution and this is where Peter Jackson came in. The end of the first book just ends...Frodo dissappears and the rest of the fellowship are looking for him. The beginning of the second book starts with Aragorn finding a mortally wounded Boromir; we don't even get to read about the heroic stand of Boromir, just that he fought well but was overpowered. For the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, we get to learn more than we cared to know about the Shire and the journey to leave the Shire and the surrounding area is just painfully slow with little or no action at all...just a long history lesson about these woods or this hedge or that village....ughhIn The Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas while the second half is solely devoted to Sam and Frodo.I don't know, Tolkien could have worked the plotline better concerning this and made it more enjoyable. Maybe he got lost in his own world as writers sometimes do and they forgot what the reader doesn't know.As for character development...there is none. The Aragorn you meet halfway through the first book is the same Aragorn that you see crowned as king at the end of the story. Whereas in the film, he is a conflicted man, unsure about his destiny and forced to decide. The characters in the book are one dimensional and you sometimes forget they are even there.I'll say it again, the films were much better or atleast the story was told better by Jackson than by Tolkien. Had Jackson been totally true to the story, we'd still be watching the movies I write this because every single back story would have to be told and the dozens of minor characters would have to be introduced and so on and so forth. In my mind, the movies are how Tolkien would have wanted his story told. His own books are the companion piece, to give more of a history and back story on the world that he created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"...is another man's poison. Before I get flamed by rabid Tolkien fanatics, let me state that I've attempted to enjoy this book several times over the last 7 years or so. Each time, I've managed to get perhaps 1/3 of the way through before I finally give up. I mean, I enjoyed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and, as devoted fantasy readers, it's our duty to worship L.O.T.R., right? Sorry, but this is one book of flowery prose that zaps me (and many readers, I'm betting) right into slumberland. The characters and situations are well-crafted, but his style of writing about them generates a 0 on the interest meter."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I believe that this story is J.R.R. Tolkien's test to himself as a writer. It was to see whether or no he could start from nothing and bulid up a whole new world for his audience to look at. He created lands, peoples, geographical structures, and family histories. It is the perfect fictional world in the eye of J.R.R. Tolkien. In my opinion he succeeded, yet not only did he succeed he shocked his audience. It is a great strory of a journey of faithful friends and their fight against evil that everyone interested in fantasy fiction should read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings: Felloship of the Rings, is the start of the greatest adventure in the history of middle earth. Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, is sent out to destroy a ring, made by an evil lord. The only way to destroy the powerfull ring, is to drop it into the cracks of doom, where it was made. Frodo sets off in this adventure, and soon runs into trouble.This book keeps you wondering about the evil forces and thier powers, since they are very hard to see at first. The book displays many common problems we have today. It shows how idiotic some discrimination is. The dwarf wasn't allowed to walk through the woods of the elves without wearing a blindfold. The elves were enemies with the dwarfs, because they believed in diffrent things, just as some people hurt others because of religion or race, which is very wrong. The story also shows that one person can make a difference. Frodo made the journey to his first destination injured, but he did his job. And he was just a small halfling against the forces of evil. There are more relations, and I could go on, but I think you understand. English teachers can have a fun time thinking of projects to do off of this book.This book is a medival fantacy style book. This book is for people with around an 8th grade reading level, yet to fully understand the books English, it would help to be a better reader. I think that if you want to read the Lord of the Rings, get through this book fast, before you lose intrest, then get into the other books, which have more action."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo is a hobbit who has just inherited a mysterious magical ring from his Uncle Bilbo. Gandalf, a wise wizard and close friend of Frodo, advises him to never wear the ring and to keep it hidden, safe, and secret. Gandalf tells Frodo that an ancient and evil lord named Sauron forged the ring to rule the other magic rings possessed by dwarves, men, and elves. In resistance to this ring, men and elves battled the forces of Sauron, eventually defeating him. The ring was then believed to be lost. Thousands of years later Bilbo found the ring and passed it on to Frodo, however Sauron had reawakened and was seeking it. To prevent Sauron from obtaining the ring Frodo had to journey to Mordor, the forging place of the ring, to destroy it.The book The Fellowship of the Ring goes on to tell the extraordinary tale of Frodo and his eight companions as they journey to Mordor to destroy the ring. However, the Fellowship doesn't survive the journey into Mordor, and Frodo, with his best friend Sam, must finish the task alone.The book and the movie The Fellowship of the Ring differ from each other. For example, in the book the Fellowship did not fight a cave troll in Moria, but just see one. When the Company reaches Lothlorien it takes them several days of hiking through the forest before they reach the elf city of Lorien and speak with Lady Galadriel. The movie also doesn't show most of the places that Frodo visited during his quest, such as Tom Bombadil's house and the Barrow Downs.The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who likes an exiting and suspenseful read. The Two Towers and The Return of the King are sequels to The Fellowship of the Ring and are equally exiting. The Hobbit is the enchanting prelude to the Lord of the Rings books and explains how Bilbo found the ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was one of the best books I ever read. I recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"~If you were a Tolkien fan before the movie came out, I think rereading the series is worthwhile. If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels. Tolkien's greatest gift to me, was the inspiration he has given my imagination.~"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Ths book is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. J.R.R. Tolkien, is a colorful writer. His character development is extrordinary, and the action-packed plot kept me from putting the book down. Also, my expiriance was enhanced when I watched the movie that was based off of this book.After finishing the book, I wanted to read the rest of the triligy as fast as I could. I am reading The Return Of The King currently."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My favorite books are the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien. I enjoy these books for many reasons. First, he includes a lot of detail about scenery. An example of this is when Tolkien writes:\\" Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine.\\" Another example is this: \\"Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low.\\" Next, Tolkien also has a very interesting concept. The One Ring, a ring that, in the wrong hands could make all of Middle Earth slaves to the Dark Lord Sauron, has a mind of its own. It can abandon its bearer at will. Also, there are many obstacles besetting the characters. One is the Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who are determined to find the Ring. Another is the journey itself. The characters travel through many dangerous areas such as the Mines of Moria. There, the creatures living there attack them. Finally, I like the interesting songs and names. One example is the Elvish name Gilthoniel Elbereth. Another is the \\"Walking Song\\" which goes as follows:\\"The Road goes ever on and onDowd from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow if I can,Pursuing it with weary feet,Until it joins some larger way,Where many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say.\\"These are some of the many reasons I like J.RR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The first three times I tried to read the Fellowship of the Ring, I couldn't do it. It was too slow, and I hadn't really read too much of anything in the fantasy realm. However, now that my interest in fantasy stuff has gone up, I gave the book another try, which was a great thing to do.Ok, so the story is still slow at the beginning when Tolkien has the obligatory \\"Introduce the characters for 150 pages\\". Sure, that's boring after awhile, but it is needed. All the boring character development lets you read about the character...developing.After you get past all of that, the good stuff starts. The epic jounrey to destroy the One Ring begins as you read about the Company's travels to Bree and eventually to Mordor. The book does a great job with giving all sorts of in-depth detail about the setting where you can actually imagine what everything looks like. Truthfully, it helps if you've seen the movie just so you can get a really good visual picture of what everything looks like, which did actually help me when I was reading.There are also battles! Who doesn't like some mindless killing with orcs or Balrogs in the middle of a book? It's great. Plus, the end of the book leaves you at a sort of a climax for the second one to start. It makes you ask yourself, \\"What happens to Frodo and Sam?\\" and \\"They can't kill Gandalf...can they?!\\" Stuff like that.I recommend this book for any fledglings in the fantasy genre as it seems to be a must have. And for that matter, I suggest the other two books in the trilogy, The Two Towers and The Return of the King as well."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have heard many people critisize the works of J.R.R. Tolkien after reading only one if not even finishing one book. This particular book is more often than not the choice that most of these people choose to voice their uneducated opinions on. By uneducated, I do not intend it to mean stupid or flawed, only that they don't understand HOW to read a Tolkien book. It is important to know that to understand J.R.R. Tolkiens work, such as the Lord of the Rings series, you have to read ALL of them. In reality, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, are all one book, not three seperate books. One probably won't get the depth they expected from the Fellowship because it's only 1/3 of a book. This application for almost all of Tolkien's works. There will be a lot of things that you won't understand when you first read The Lord of the Rings, especially if it is your first time, but that is the true genius of Tolkien. All of his books tie in to become a realistic history, so to understand that history and what causes it, you have to read another one of his books. Just try it, if you aren't impressed by the Fellowship, go ahead and finish the series. Only then is it fair to make a judgement of Tolkien's literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is certainly a work of art. In this novel, Tolkien creates a world where magic, adventure, and robust thrills are as common as a person who wants ice in his/her water. Describing the world in which Tolkien's story is set in is nearly unimaginable. Tolkien truly lets your imagination flow like a river right after a monsoon. By not defining every excruciating detail in his book, I was able to create a world in my mind that could never be described with words.The Lord of the Rings is set in almost a medieval period, with a magical twist to it, where everything is possible. It all begins with a jolly hobbit named Frodo Baggins. Shielded from anything outside the Shire (his home), everything he knew was beautiful. But a storm was brewing, and what was thought to have been the outside world caved into his backyard. Shadows of darkness marks the beginning of the most amazing journey anyone could imagine. Frodo Baggins has inherited the Ring, a very powerful ring that could be used to rule the world. The destiny of the world as we know it is put in the hands of a small, nearly insignificant hobbit. His name is Frodo, pray he is successful."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The plot is some sort of Reluctant Everyman Hero Vs.

Leave it aside, go for the movie. Otherwise you will end up writing a review for the first time here. If you are one of these people and reading this but yet ignoring all the 1 star reviews given to this book, you will soon learn that no matter how hard you try loving the book due the hype of the movie, you cannot finish the book because you will soon fall asleep. Really.They are right when they say the journey was too detail and a tiring read. I would just want to add my point, this book sounds more like a history book of sorts (oh I heard from somewhere its suppose to be literature but I was too late) when the Council of Elrond take place. Generally the book has TOO MANY names of beings and places thrown to you very quickly without you ever recalling where they came about. Maybe I read it too fast to avoid the walking excercise in the book. Maybe I was not paying attention, ironically, its was supposed to be a book so great that I couldn't stop reading but then again I was too tired forcing myself. I am getting nowhere after 3/4 of the book. Henced I decide to drop it at page 330 and turn on pc to tell you this.I am not writing to criticise Tolkien.

After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed \\"Not another (...) elf!!??\\". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is mindless, poorly written, and an utter bore."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think this book is one of the most boring loads of... I have ever read. I am someone who tends to suffer a lot from insomnia, but all I have to do to beat it is just read ten pages from this book, and I am asleep like a baby. Although my opinion is definitely in the minority, I am far from alone either. I have read the ten most recent 1-star comments on The Fellowship of the Ring... The consensus is that the book is boring! J.R.R. Tolkein, like many other conservative academics, had a creative mind, but was much more of an analytical author than he was a storyteller. After seeing and loving the movie before reading the book, the book was a real disappointment. Most of the parts of the movie that I enjoyed were not even in the book to begin with! The scene where Merry and Pippin accidentally set off the dragon firework is not there. The scene where Bilbo and Gandalf are outdoing each other with smoke sculptures is not there. The gripping battle between Gandalf and Sauron was not there either! These were all things that would have picked up the pace of the novel tremendously if they had been there. They would have indicated real CHARACTERISATION as opposed to dry description and journalistic chronicle. The Harry Potter series may be bubblegum in comparison, but my God, at least it is readable! J. K. Rowling is ten times the storyteller that Tolkein is. If only you could combine Tolkein's creative ideas with Rowling's narrative flair, you would have one hell of a fantasy author."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"McCord of Asuncion, Paraguay says:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has you predicting from the start. By the title,you're probably asking yourself \\"Why is a ring so important?\\"J.R.R. Tolkien was a British man that wrote this series book. He also wrote The Hobbit and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. It is a book mostly for adults, but a bright sixth grader can read it. Do not be surprised if you do not like the beginning. The beginning is slow, but the story gets better as it goes along.This book is the first book of a series of three. This book is adventure genre that takes place in middle earth. They tell of a very powerful ring forged by a dark lord. This ring is full of evil and very tempting. Anyone who puts the ring on turns invisible.A group of people set out to destroy this ring of evil. Some of these people were the elf, Legolas, the royal humans Boromir and Aragorn son of Arathorn, and the dwarf, Gimli. They encounter merciless orcs and fearsome ringwraiths on their journey. Can they go to Mount Doom and destroy the ring of evil without being killed? Find out.I did not really care for this book. Sometimes it was so boring I had to force myself to keep reading. I think that this man does not know how to make an exciting book. Some parts did not make sense also. To me, he seems to describe things too much. He also goes on and on and on. I found the movie to be a lot more interesting, exciting and make more sense. My teacher says that J.K. Rowling used The Lord of the Rings series to write the Harry Potter series which can be seen, but J.K. Rowling is a better and more talented writer in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"chuck it away burn it most boring est book ever go buy yourself a decent book like George RR Martins Song Ice And Fire the its better than LOTR this crap"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is quite boring and goes off on long tangents that have nothing to do with the plot of the whole story. It is like Tolkien started this set without any outline or idea where it was going. The next two books far surpass this one. It was a struggle for me to get through this book. Just because everyone is in love with Tolkien does not make this book good. I know he did not have the format modern writers do for their series but that still does not make this book good.

It made me cry in several places, Tolkien definetely had a way of making you connect with each and every character. I would recommend this book to every single person on this earth.

This is the first time Frodo or Sam has left the Shire. They are clueless about anything or anyone they don't see in the Shire. In Rivendel they meet up with a few others that are joining the quest.

I've probably read it at least 10 times. I bought this audio version because I thought it would be nice to be able to listen to it in the car or when I have some spare time. This is an actual reading of the entire book, not a dramatization or an abridged version.I think the reading is very good. The reader has a very good voice and he varies it to represent the voices of the different characters.The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there are some cases where the reader voices the characters differently than I would imagine. This might not be a problem if I had never read the book before, but since I have, I have an idea of what I think the characters sound like, and what I think their emotions are in particular scenes. In some cases, the way the reader voices the characters doesn't match what I already had in mind.I'm sure that any reading by another person would never match how I imagine all of the scenes, so I would probably feel this way with any reading or dramatization. Given that, I would recommend this reading to any one interested in an audio version of this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have been a mad keen J.R.R.

I must admit that Tolkien's writing style is bit hard to read at first but once you get into the story, it's hard to put down. Don't expect the book to be exactly like the movie. There are a lot more things in the book that were left out of the movie for time reasons. Tolkien's characters are wonderfully written and the detail of the scenery is spectacular. I would have done with out the songs but they do fit in the story nicely. If you liked the movies then I recommend getting the \\"whole\\" story by reading the books.

He has just the right type of British voice to bring the Tolkien books to life. I don't want to rehash the many other favourable reviews. This review is relevant for anyone who wants to make mp3's out of the CD's. Since the boxes are so large, and the cd's so numerous (I bought all three volumes) it is a logical step to rip the cd's and put them on your ipod or other mp3 player. This is where the glitches arise. Although the Ipod cd database found the tracks, the naming of the cd volumes and the individual tracks is inconsistent and confusing so you can't logically navigate through the discs. Each cd seems to have its own naming convention in some sort of secret geek code understood only by the inventor. I eventually solved the problem by making each disc into a playlist on its own so I could go back to the relevant disc and track number at will. This seems a very odd technical oversight in this day and age, unless it was done deliberately to prevent illegal file sharing on the internet. This fortunately does not detract from the otherwise excellent quality of the product."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I AM ONLY TWELVE, BUT I THINK THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY MAY BE THE BEST BOOKS I WILL EVER READ!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Le livre a emporter sur une ile deserte !

Although it gets hard at some parts, this book still is very involved and it illustrated my mind into a whole different world, and so did the Hobbit, which, though childish, is a great piece of literature too, though it has no comparison to The Lord of the Rings. The book begins with Bilbo Baggins's (who happens to be one of my favorite characters in the book, though scarcly in it) eleventy-first birthday, in which he mysteriously disappears right in the middle of his speech. How? Well, I can't tell you that or it will spoil the whole story.

The story in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is tremendous, creative and truly profound. I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. Where was the supreme Tom Bombadill? Where was the powerful elf lord Glorfindel? There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING wonderfully takes up where THE HOBBIT leaves off and addresses the sinister aspects of the great ring and the true Lord of the Rings, the diabolical Sauron.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE TWO TOWERS and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. And if you haven't read THE HOBBIT yet you will likely be adding that one to your library as well.The GOOD NEWS is that you will not regret a single moment!I could go on and on.

Tolkien, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, would have to be my favorite book in three ways. To begin with, there is a tremendous amount of action in this book. For example, Frodo, the main character, and all of his companions set out to destroy an evil ring so the evil Sauron won't get his nasty hands on it. If they don't destroy the ring, all of Middle Earth would be doomed. They must battle their way to Mount Doom to cast the ring into its flames. But, there are many enemies on their way like, Sauroman, orcs, and Ring Wraiths. Secondly, I like how Tolkien brings Middle Earth to life by describing it so deeply. For example, I like how he describes The Mines of Moria so well. Last but not least, I love the fantasy and magic in this book. For instance, Gandalf, a great wizard, has many spells and magical powers. If you do not like fantasy, you shouldn't read this book; but if you do this book is spectacular! In conclusion, if you are looking for a great book, get The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is the first book in an epic trilogy known as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It takes place in the third age of Middle-earth. The main characters are Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin who are hobbits. A hobbit is a creature smaller than dwarves and they are furry, but resemble humans. It is action-packed and suspenseful. I gave this book 5 stars because I really liked it and also it has a very deep-winding plot. The Character I like best in this story is Frodo. I like him because he is just like his uncle Bilbo(from The Hobbit). His uncle Bilbo had adventures just like he will have and you can only find out if you read it. I recommend this book to people who like books that keep you on your toes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm a nurse who works the night shift, and I have to sleep in the day time. Although I have heavy curtains on my bedroom windows, I do not live in an isolated area and so have to deal with the noise of the \\"outside world\\" to some degree. I would periodically have a hard time getting to sleep or staying there, before I started getting these CD's. The other collection I have is the dramatization of the hobbit, which is also quite good, but much different overall, as it is only 4 discs long, and without much of Tolkien's flair, as descriptions are minimized in favor of dialogue.This product, however, I find completely rewarding. The guy who reads has a lovely voice, pronounces everything impeccably without hesitation, varies his tone just enough to distinguish between characters (but not dramatically enough to be distracting), and as it is completely unabridged, you don't miss a single word of Tolkien's masterpiece. And as for his singing, well, I don't imagine the characters in the books to be divas, if you catch my drift, so I find it quite realistic and not at all off-putting.I play a disc when I lie down to sleep, and usually listen to the same one several nights in a row until I am sure I heard the whole thing, as I find that I am asleep within 15 minutes. I have had this collection for about two months and I am on the 8th disc (of 20). I LOVE IT.I also have been more courageous about instituting positive changes in my organization as of late...hmmm...could it be that my nightly dose of Frodo has been subliminally inspiring me?I hope this helps you make your decision!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"If you like adventure,fantasy and evil corrupting characters,then you're going to love this book. The antagonist is just pure evil! All he cares about is world domination and getting his ultimate ring of power! The protagonist is gentle and well caring for his home called the Shire. His goal is to destroy the ring of power so he can bring peace to his home. The author describes the environment and setting magnificently! I would say that the author has gone so far into his fantasy. From making languages,maps,stories and creatures he has created his own little world!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Unfortunately, I saw the movie before reading the book. I've now read all three. Some reviewers have complained about the amount of detail in the books. Personally, after seeing the movies, I was full of questions: very curious about the history of the cultures of the inhabitants of Middle Earth, the landscapes and geopgraphy, and the lives of specific characters. The movies give you a taste of Tolkien's grand epic, but the books themselves suck you into Middle Earth. I was mesmerized and welcomed the painstaking detail. Tolkien didn't just create a landscape, races and languages. He created a universe that comes to life in the pages of the books.I attribute the epic's success to the intense emotion that it invokes. When reading, one genuinely feels the characters' hardships, fears the orchs, Saruman, the Urukai. The book is chilling and invokes terror at times.My copies of the books have detailed appendices and maps. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to refer to the maps of Middle Earth and track the fellowship on their quest. I highly ecommend using such maps when reading the books.In summary, if you long to know more after having seen the movies, you'll find yourself immersed in and hypnotized by the text. If, on the other hand, you're satisfied knowing what's given on the widescreen, you probably won't make it through the first book. The best case scenario would obviously be to experience the books first. Unfortunately for many, myself included, the first experience with Tolkien's works was on the bigscreen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I just type this review to warn all who have seen the Lord of the Rings movies that this does not mean they should neglect to read the book!

The movie cut out important characters such as Tom Bombadil and Lady Goldberry, characters I thought that were of a certain importance that they should have been included. The Old Forest and Bilbo play a much bigger part. Despite all this, I would not suggest this book to anyone who has not seen the Lord of the Rings movies.

Some time ago I decided to go to the original English text, thinking that if the original is bad, then it's simply not such a good book.Well, I got a lesson about the importance of a good transtlation. I have read the book from cover to cover, ceaselessly, and enjoyed it greatly.Tolkein's English is superb. You can see he's a linguistic, since his language is deep and reach. The characters are wonderfully built and the plot, although complicated and very detailed, is easy to read and fluent.After reading it in its original language I see the problem. This book is a challenge to every translator, because it is deeply rooted in the English tradition, both plotwise and in its language. It takes a skillful transtlator to pass all the different meanings Tolkein uses, and still have a readable result.So I do recommened anyone who considers to read this book in any other language other than English, to wait until you can handle with its not-too-difficult language. It'll be worth your while."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is so good, the minute I was done I needed the next one.

So I avoided it, preferring instead \\"realistic fiction\\" with \\"meaning.\\"When the first movie was released, my aunt asked me to please give them a try so she could see what someone else who had read the books thought of it.I am grateful to my aunt for encouraging me to do this.

Not in a million years.I'm ashamed of my initial fear that this fantasy book would not have \\"meaning.\\" The struggle to destroy the Ring, though fantasy, applies to the lives of any of us who have ever carried a burden. That is to say, to most of us.If you are afraid of the length and wordiness of the story, I still suggest you give the book a try: even if you find yourself skimming descriptive parts, you will still get something out of this book. Perhaps later you will want to reread it and see what else you can get out of it, but even if you do not, you will still have gotten something from it in one quick read.Also, to those of you who have read \\"The Hobbit\\" and did not enjoy it: I urge you to try the Lord of the Rings anyway. The difficulty I had with The Hobbit didn't continue through the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit seemed more like a delightful but light children's adventure, while the Lord of the Rings is much deeper.

Tolkein creates a world of elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and men that is fantastical in scope yet wholly believable. Tolkein knows how to pit evil against good in an epic and spectacular way.I would literally stay up nights until 2am with my little reading light, driving my husband crazy because I simply couldn't rest until I got to the end. I feel the same way about the second book! What's more is that I've read that the third book, \\"The Return of the King\\" is even better and I couldn't be more excited to get into it.If you are a lover of good books and have been avoiding \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because of all of its current movie hype, I can assure you it would be a foolish thing to pass up. Also, if you really want to start off right, begin with \\"The Hobbit\\" (if you have lots of time on your hands I would suggest starting with \\"The Silmarillion\\" which is the start of it all).Tolkein was a world famous philologist and created his own \\"Elvish\\" language to create these books. They are perfect for readers young (young adult) and old and are a true means of escape from reality.Let this be the review that gets you started on the reading adventure of a lifetime, one you'll likely never forget."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the only work of fantasy prose in the last millenium which deserves all the awards which could be awarded to it. Tolkien outdoes himself with this first installment in the world famous trilogy, exceeding all limits with his creation of a new world, characters so deep you'll never be able to get yourself out of their heads after the first fifty pages, and a plot so complicated, and yet easy to understand for the reader, that the first time I read it, (when I was seven or eight), I knew that it was the best work of fantasy that I would ever read. I read it, read the other two of the trilogy, and read them all again, and again, and again, and I have read them at least once annually since. When you look at the trilogy all together, it looks like you'll never finish it, but the key to that is to read the first one, without thinking how long the others are. You'll love them, these priceless gems of fantasy from the mind of a genious, I garuntee it.This edition is an example of a faithful unaltered or abriged, true to the author edition that you can trust, and read over and over, until it falls apart. I recommend it.The plot centers around a ring, made in the distant past, which was created to give the dark lord Sauron the power to overrun middle earth with darkness and untold malice. He made the ring in the volcano in the middle of his dark kingdom, and that it the only place where it can be destroyed. But it was stolen from him. Follow the adventures of a Hobbit (a small sort of person, like a dwarf, but without the beard) to whom the ring has passed. Finding out what the ring is, and who is looking for it, Frodo Baggins, with his servant Samwise, set out to bring the ring to the Cracks of Doom, and destroy it once and for all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It took seeing the wonderful movie version to finally make me read this book and for that I am grateful. I had read the Hobbit and enjoyed it but never finally felt compelled to pick up J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. The characters of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are more complex than I expected and I loved the slow build up as both dread and unbearable tension are increased with every step on their long journey. The novel has a quicker pace after the Council of Elrond and the previously established atmosphere is put to good use and delivers on all its promises. How I missed this book during my nerdy teenage years will always remain a mystery. I am only thankful I have opened myself up to them now in my tender middle years."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is one of the best books I have read, and I have read many books. \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" begins when Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit from the book \\"The Hobbit\\", has his 111th birthday party. At his birthday party he left the Shire and left every thing he owned to his heir Frodo Baggins; he even left the magic ring. Gandolf the wizard finds out that the ring is the evil ring-of-power that was made by the Dark Lord Sauron. Years later after Gandolf found out about Frodo's ring, Frodo leaves the Shire with three other Hobbit companions. They are pursued by the fearsome Ringwraiths and finally make it to the Elven Lord, Elronds House. Along the way Frodo and his companions find many new friends and meet many evil dangers including a confrontation with the Ringwraiths. At Elronds house, they join a group of companions whose mission is to destoy the ring at Mordor Sauron's fortress. On their journey to destroy the ring they meet many evil dangers including one Gandolf the Grey can't beat.I recommend this book to people who like action and drama. This is an excellent book so even if you don't like action or drama you should still read it -- it could be the best book you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have never been a fan of the fantasy genre. My taste has always been of the classic, 18th and 19th century literature (i.e. Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, Louisa May Alcott, Oscar Wilde and so on).I am proud to say that Tolkien has broadened my selection of stories from which I now choose to read.Tolkien has a way of bringing a scene alive like the greatest writers of all-time. While reading The Fellowship of the Ring I felt as though I were there with the Fellowship; fortunately I was not. Some may think he labors a scene with descriptions but I assure you he does not. Everything he writes is for a purpose at some point in the story. And I might add, the best stories are those that give the most background about characters and places. Nothing is worse than a flat character, except bad writing.To those who decide not to read this trilogy I say this: You are missing out on two things: first, one of the most fantastic stories told of all-time and second, on an exquisite piece of writing.Incidentally, if you do read this trilogy be sure not to miss The Hobbit and The Silmarillion. The former is what I'd call the \\"prologue\\" to the trilogy and the latter is considered the bible of Middle Earth.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"WOW! This book is just unbelievable! Took my breath away....A story that shows the virtues of friendship, love, sacrifice,....a real heartwarming story. What i really liked about this book was that the hero of this story was a small, measle character who does not know what he's in for, or how he's supposed to save the day, he relies on his friends...its very rare because nowadays &quot;heroes&quot; are muscular, handsome men who know absolutely, everything, right? Well, read this story &amp; you will be absolutely touched.Frodo, a small hobbit (humans that are generally 3'6&quot; &amp; have furry feet, read The hobbit for more), was chosen by fate to be aringbearer &amp; bring the one powerful &amp; dangerous ring that rules them all to Mordor, the only place it can really be destroyed. He faces danger &amp; obstacles every path on the road.Read this! believe me, it might take a while, but it will definitely be worth your while!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Hopefully the first film of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; will cause many viewers to read the original books. Open the books, start reading, and you'll find the real treasure.If you have seen the movie and are new to the books, be prepared for a few things to be different:1 - Tolkien has to construct his world (Middle Earth) with words. Sounds ridiculous and obvious, but Tolkien spends a LOT of time describing this world, these people, and their history. In fact, most readers new to the book will probably find more information than they wanted to know. Understand, however, that for this world to be believable, Tolkien had to dive in and create a believable world that you could sink your teeth into. There's a lot of description and it's all important. Don't get discouraged.2 - The action is not as frequent as it is in the film. Get used to that. The action comes, but Tolkien wisely leaves a lot of the detail here up to the reader's imagination. When it comes down to it, the book is really not about the action as much as it is about the characters and how they behave. You get a little of this in the film, you get a lot of it in the book. Savor it.3 - Read 'The Hobbit' first. Even if you saw the film, you need to read the &quot;introduction&quot; to the series. It's fun, not too long, and will help you understand the goings-on of Middle Earth.If you are about to undertake the journey of Middle Earth for the first time, I envy you. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the great works not only of fantasy, but of all 20th Century literature. Be patient. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the world Tolkien made and loved. I think you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"a complex story. I suggest you first read &quot;THE HOBBIT&quot;. At the end of story you would have like if Tolkien had written the following. I wormly suggest it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Well, I must say, I have been reading several of these reviews and they seem pretty much the same: there are two ways to go: its boring or its incredible. For those who think that one must slug through this book do not have a very imagintative mind and won't allow themselves to explore the wonderful descriptions of nature and surprizing realistic chracteristics of the protagonoists. I do agree that the very beginning of the book is a bit trivial, but it sets up the rest of the story incredibly well. Of course, the other way is the ultimate 5 star way, which i would give to the other two books. the second half of this book is absolutely stunning while the later part of the first half gets really intersting as well. The only reason this book does not get 5 star is the slight slow start. Otherwise, if you cannot make it through that much are not a real fantasy fan, just a simple-minded moron."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship the Ring is the first part of J.R.R Tolkiens epic fantasy trilogy about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins; heir of Bilbo Baggins, hero of the hobbit. In the Hobbit Bilbo finds a magical ring that he takes home with him. Then around fifty years later he gives the ring to his heir Frodo. After sometime he finds out it is the ring that Sauron the evil character of the book wants. If Sauron gets the ring he can rule middle earth how ever he likes. So Frodo must take it to the one place it can be destoyed. But that place is in the center of Sauron's kingdom. So Frodo and a few friends set out on an epic journey to Sauron's kingdom. I would definenetly recommend that you read the Hobbit before you read this book. If you don't you might have trouble understanding the plot of the book, plus the Hobbit is another great Tolkien novel. This book is one of the best I've ever read , and I would recommend it to anyone interested."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The best thing about Tolkiens books is that he likes to describe the land and tell you a lot about where the company is. He tells you full backgrounds of all the characters. He likes to tell about stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the book. And thats what I like about his books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think that Tolkien did an absolutly astounding job in creating middle Earth, and i think that the Hobbit and LotR is a classic. But as with all books, this one did have its flaws. First of all, there were no people of color (african americans), nut this can be forgived because there may be none in Middle Earth (Hmm..?). Second, there were fery few women roles in the trilogy (Arwen, Galidriel, the stewards daughtor, and a few elves). Overall, there were few flaws, and those were crushed by the woner of Tolkiens imaginative world"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have never dived into a labyrinth of characters so diverse, explored a world that is as threatening, beautiful and complex as the one Tolkien created. Oh well, there might be my own life. The protagonists are classical heroes or losers, the telling is epic - it compares, somehow, to the bible. Ever read the bible as a book that tells about adventures, dreams, goals and mystery? If not, do it, if so, read about the hobbit that accomplished Sysiphus's work. There are other novels, of course. I acknowledge their existance, I even read these. But, have you ever read a book from an historian and a great storyteller from another world?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The only thing wrong with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is that you have to sit through Fellowship to get to it. Now, I'm a big Tolkien fan, don't get me wrong, but I found that reading this book was a bit of a chore. My advice to any who have tried to read Fellowship and given up is go ahead and slog through it. It picks up a bit at the end and the other two books, The Two Towers and The Return of the King are simply incredible and will blow you away."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"LotR is the best story ever written. If by some odd coincidince, you have been in bed for the last fifty years and have not read these wonderful books, read them.P.S. LotR live action movies with computer effects are coming out in 2000 and 2001!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"How could a man creat such a beautiful and extensive world like this? Tolkien was an undisputed genius."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It's really the best book I've ever read. I consider J.R.R.Tolkien a genius. He has created an entirely new world, so real and vivid. His language is also wonderful.It's a real pleasure to read the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Very good. One of the best I have read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book had too many descriptions. I saw the movie before I read the book and I have to say the movie is SO much better. I knew all this interesting stuff would happen, I just didn't know it would happen at 100-page intervals and with a non-exciting description! All I can say is that the movie is awesome and don't waste your time reading the books.P.S. I have to admit, the second book is better. However, I believe that is because of Frodo,Sam, and Gollum's scenes in the book. That is its only saving grace."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm glad I sorted the reviews lowest first because I saw I wasn't the only one who did not enjoy this book. I tried reading it three times, the first two I gave up. Finally while on vacation I finished the book only to be disappointed. The story was way too long and had entire chapters that contributed nothing to the plot. I don't think I can bring myself to read the other two books, instead I'll watch the movies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was boring and hard to understand. I almost couldn't get through it. It got recommended to me by a friend. I decided to not read the second one. The only reason it became popular was because of the movies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I thought that all the songs were boring and sucked, and it got a little slow at times. But the book made up for it all at the end. A tremendous ending to the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Despite the fact Tolkien has inspired hundreds of great fantasy authors, these books are boring. They detail way too much environment, the characters are stale and the action is warm at best. What more could you ask for to completely avoid a book?I listened to the audiobook and while I realize Inglis is a sub-par reader when it came to many of the characters, the book just isn't engaging. I don't think the tone of voice would've fixed it all that much (but it would've vastly improved the action scenes and tougher characters)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I actually like the whole series, but I figured that I would rate them individually. I would give \\"Fellowship\\" 4 1/2 stars, because I really like it (as opposed to just liking it, which would be 4 stars). Unfortunately, having watched the movie, the movie is fresher in my mind. I do remember liking the book more than the movie, and I like the movie a lot, so....there you have it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"hey, ive been wondering why was tom bombadil excluded from the movie? One of my friends reminded me of that... who was he again? i barely remember him.. anyway this is an excellent book i really suggest u read it!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Never before have I encountered a wordier or more boring author than Tolkein. After three weeks of struggling through this book, I finally gave up a quarter of the way into Book II. How this book ever became a beloved classic is beyond me. Now, I have absolutely no desire to see the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Uau, this is obnoxious writing. It seems Tolkien was mockering his readers. IT's not possible, to a book classified as &quot;fantasy&quot;, to start a trilogy in such a boring manner. The description of the hobbits' breakfast, lunch and dinner are annoying, a total waste of time, it only makes some readers (like myself) want to get rid of the little fellas!!! Then comes the endless descriptions of the sun rising, wind from the west, winds from the east, the green of the ground, the waters falling in cascade, the sun rising, the sun going down...!!! Enough!! The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the worst book of the three. As I see, here are the merits and flaws of Tolkien's totally overrated trilogy:* MERITS:1- Someone willing to write such a long book must be respected by the enormous difficulty of the taske alone;2- TOlkien was really a respected English teacher and historian, and you can sense his joy in writing the book* FLAWS:1- The characters, all of them, are totally faceless, in the style of Frederick Forsyth's characters. We don't have any insight about heir feelings, about what's really going on inside their heads and hearts;2- Tolkien clearly copied unashamedly so many points from other fables, like the Arturian legend, for example;3- The endless descriptions sometimes makes one wonder that he is only gaining time (and pages), by repeating himself over and over again, like &quot; the sun was coming down, the air was heavy, the sun was rising, the air was clean and bright.........&quot;&quot; Irc!I really think the complete trilogy would fit in just one 500 pages book. That's all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My girlfriend was reading Harry Potter, heh ... and she thought I should read it too. I told her that if I was going to go reading any fantasy books I owe it to myself and the world at large to read Lord of the Rings! (Great way to get out of that one, eh?) Having read the Hobit in school (I reckon 8th grade or so - it was long ago) I was vaguely familiar with the plot. Criticisms I've heard I can sometimes concur with, it does get rather long winded with detail descriptions of meals that, if you took all reference to eating out of all six books (two in each part) could probably trim it down a few hundred pages. The other complaint is it often goes into nonsense poetry and prose in &quot;elven&quot; tongues, etc. Well, I don't read Elven so well and I find it difficult to even attempt reading such. These things aside the series is absolutely brilliant. Often just when you are sure you know what's coming next Tolkien will spring a suprise on you and twist and turn the events to the unexpected. It is one of the most remarkable fantasy books I have ever read and it is well worth taking the time to read. You must not simply buy Fellowship and not expect to commit to reading the other two parts: Two Towers and Return of the King. Fellowship does a great job of setting up the characters and you'll almost feel that the fellowship are all personal friends of yours by the time you make it to the second book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Literature for children, as opposed to children's books, is a work of serious fantasy where a world is created in imagination and then flowers from the author's craft. In both craft and imagination, no one rivals Tolkien. It isn't the story that captivates you, but how could it not, Sauron, perverter of beauty and good, unleashes the 9 Ring Wraiths to hunt down the Ring of Power. Who has the ring ? An innocent hobbit, Frodo, who has known nothing but comfort and love in the idyllic country of the Shire. Frodo inherits the ring from Uncle Bilbo who discovered the ring in the Mines of Moria while seeking a dragon's hoard. Frodo's introduction to the struggle between Good and Evil and his harrowing escapes from from the mounted Ring Wraiths is your introduction to the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. Tolkien's love of the mythology of Middle Earth which he spent a lifetime perfecting is inspiring and that is what makes it great.If you want a book that will last a lifetime, buy this one."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Most people coming to this review already have a good idea what the story is all about from either other readers or people who have seen the movies made from this three part story. This is not a trilogy the three-part story so you can buy the individual books but it might be prudent to buy all three at the same time or a combined volume.The reason I say buy the complete \\"Lord of the Rings\\" now is that you will just be picking up speed and getting everything straight in your mind and you will come to the end of this volume. Talk about a cliffhanger. This animal leaves you with several.Even though the adventure takes place six years after the adventures in Tolkien's \\"the Hobbit or There and Back Again\\", the writing style is also a little more in-depth.I am not going to paraphrase the story. J.R.R. Tolkien himself tells you what you need to know in the prolog.Many people have read things into this story thinking it was maybe an allegory of things like the bomb; but Tolkien says himself that this is not an allegory.Tolkien creates a rich world in which you the reader will feel you are part of the adventure. If you've only seen the movies than you've only seen a synopsis and you will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"this book is... beautiful. incredibly well-written and vivid. it brought back my imagination. read this book, and read the entire wonderful trilogy. afterwards, you will have wonderful things to muse on as your mind will be lifted from the mundane to the gorgeous world and characters Tolkien has created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Wow! What an amazing book. Mr. Tolkien is an amazing writer. The vividness of his world is utterly unbeleivable. When reading any of his works, I feel as if I am seeing and feeling exactly what the main character is seeing or feeling whether it be frightened or happy. The main character in this case is the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins, the lovable main character in the Hobbit. Frodo is heir to the ring of power and knows the terrible ringwraiths were searching for him to steal the ring which would enable the dark lord Sauron to destroy all that was good in the Middle-Earth. His journey is full of sights and adventures, both good and bad. I would like to journey to the Middle-Earth after reading this magnificent book. I admit that it is slow in some places but it is worth the time and it will get you reading the whole trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I just finished this book last night. It is incredible! The characterization is amazing, and the setting is so wonderfully convincing that I felt amazed when I would look up and see my TV across the living room instead of Middle Earth.That being said, I did not find that the tale was as tightly woven as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and it did, indeed, drag in parts. However, these are small briefs with a great work of art and I cannot wait to read the next two books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the second greatest book of all time (The Hobbit being the first). It has everything you need: magic, might, swords, sorcery-but with one difference: Tolkien is able to make all these elements, put them all together and make it all seem real. While you read The Fellowship of the Ring, you feel as if Middlearth is a real place and that the characters are real too. I have never gotten so into a book series as Tolkien's Lord of The Ring. People sometimes say Fantasy is stupid or weird. I woudl agree for the most part (sorry). Then one day on a lark, I read The Hobbit and it changed my perspective. I came to realize that Fanstasy (as a genre) can be as respectable as mainstream literature. Tolien is a literaty genius. Every part of this novel i s perfect, I'm not saying that because I like it, I say it because I think that every writer should read this book to see how a story is meant to be told: with heart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"To this day, even the greatest find it difficult to match Tolkien. You can still feel the freshness and innovation that marked the beginning of his genre. Almost any reader will have to confess that there are tedious parts, but they enrich the storyline and add a depth possessed by few other worlds. The characters are alive and breathing. The humor is memorable and the friendships lasting. Tolkien describes everything, giving the world a feeling of reality. Modern day fantasy sometimes gives the impression of being a movie or TV show. There's nothing but exciting parts and footage seems to be cut out. There are two or three points of major crisis in The Fellowship. In modern fantasy it's ten, twenty, thirty times, vainly trying to get a rise out of the reader. The Fellowship and the remainder of Lord of the Rings is the work of a man who invites you to live in his world and doesn't apply the impatient force of constant action and employ all the usual gimmicks. Many people criticize the flow of Tolkien's writing, but his books are fantasy in its purest form. This book is a must-read for more than its entertainment value. The Lord of the Rings is the key to understanding the genre. All fantasy books that follow the Ring Trilogy have definite roots to the father of them all. If you read through The Fellowship and its sequels and are still hungry for more, I would recommend Brooks and Eddings, my favorites."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Now that our friend Potter is taking all the glory, I thought it was a good idea to go back to basic. And wow. Not to benchmark, but the rich, complex personalities of its characters and the thick, intriguing plot makes this book a forget me not. We must remember that this saga was written more than 80 years ago, when imagination was not hindered with today blast of easy science fiction and gruesome information. In my wish list, is a visit to middle earth, and, if I may, use the ring for a few moments.An adult, honest story, perfectly balanced, that, as Joyce almost said: I love to love it.Get lost in Middle earth, and, if you are lucky, you won't come back"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The begining of one of the greatest sagas in history!

Tolkien's world and its history are painstakingly detailed. Characters and motivations are deep and complex. The descriptive writing is breathtaking.In the second and third books, the story lines divide and become more complicated. But in \\"Fellowship,\\" the plot moves forward in a powerfully continuous straight line. The only place where the action stalls is the chaper \\"The Council of Elrond\\" in which the reader is fed huge amounts of information and backstory very quickly. For those interested in the history of Tolkien's world, however, this chapter is a bonanza.The Lord of the Rings should be required reading in high school. Forget Shakespeare -- this is English literature at its absolute best."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Let me begin by saying that I adore Tolkein and love The Lord of the Rings. With that out of the way, I have to admit that of the three books, Fellowship is definitly the weakest. Because Tolkein viewed the trilogy as a single novel, book one is almost entirely exposition. The story doesn't really get moving until more than halfway through the book.Also, a lot of people have difficulty with Tolkein's language. This is one of my favourite parts of the book, but he is wordy and descriptive so it does take him a long ime to say anything. That said, reading his books is like reading epic poetry. His words flow the same way the language in a good version of The Oddessy or Beowulf does so it can be easy to get caught up in the flow of the language. I find that this helps me get through the books, as I get so immersed in the story that I have trouble coming out of it when I need to stop. Also, the flow of the words makes his lengthy description run past quickly.On a less technical note, Tolkein's characterization and plotting are magnificent. As slowly as Fellowship moves, you can feel the action building into something grand and vast. His characters are complex and vibrant, and they all have a well-developed range of actions and motivations. Even the pure, otherworldly characters have things that irritate them and make them snappish. This is traditional fantasy, so there is little depth to the evil characters, and a nearly inexhaustible supply of easily defeated minions, but it's not really noticable within the context of the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien takes the world of Middle Earth that he developed and continues the tale of the ring. The ring first appears to us in 'The Hobbit'. The hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, keeps this special ring he found on his journey to help the dwarves. This book picks up the story decades after 'The Hobbit'.Bilbo has aged and in the course of celebrating his birthday leaves the Shire. To everyone's surprise Bilbo gives everything to his nephew Frodo, including the ring. Many years go by, and the wizard returns with a warning to take the ring and leave.Frodo and three friends begin the trip. Along the way the meet the Ranger who helps them get to Rivendell, home of the elves. At Rivendell the true identity of the ring is revealed and a course of action is decided upon. The ring must be destroyed.A band of nine people (men, elf, dwarf, wizard, and hobbits) form the Fellowship and begin the journey. This book sets the stage for the coming War of the Ring. We are introduced the members of the fellowship, gives us some background on Sauron, and the rings of power. We get a sense for the evil that the group is up against and the obstacles in their way. And soon realize that this journey is near impossible and may just be delaying the rise of Sauron.At times this book is hard to read. Tolkien goes into great detail regarding the history of Middle Earth and the characters involved in the story. This may hard for some readers to get through or keep track of. I, on the other hand, think these details add to the richness of the story. The story is wonderful and has much more detail than the recent movies. If you enjoyed 'The Hobbit' and/or the films, I would recommend reading the books to get the full story of the ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book starts off with a birthday party at hobbit named Bilbo's house,Gandalf the grey has come with his fireworks and Frodo another hobbit is excited.

He finds its dark past and goes to the tower of orthanc for counsel from Saruman the white, he finds that he is corrupt by the power of sauron's control. Meanwhile the nine nazgul are after the group and frodo gets stabbed by one of their poisonous morgul blades. A elven wizard rode Frodo to the elven city of grey havens, in order to find to heal him. At the city Gandalf tells the counsel of the ring and decides to start the fellowship of the ring. The get into a fuss about who should take it to mount doom, when frodo decides he will take it, just then Aragorn decides he will go. Followed by Legolad and Gimli the dwarf, and Merry, Sam and Pippin will go too. Thus starts the fellowship if the ring, they start off good until they get into the mines of moria. There Gandalf fights the mighty balrog and get thrown over the bridge into the firey abyss. This was a big blow to the fellowship, but after that they get canoes and head down the river. They get to this part on the river where Merry and Pippin get captured by orcs and are going to be taken to an orc eencampment. Boromir gets shot by an orc named Ugluk and dies, Aragorn avenges his death and kills ugluk. Frodo and Sam starts off on the other side of the river to get the ring to mount doom themsleves."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Oh my gods I couldn't believe it! I skimmed over the first 60 comments so far and simply HAD to make my own reply to the three, yes that's right, three people so ridiculously oblivious to this thing called reality that it made my stomach turnSo to anyone who wishes to post a review after this one, PLEASE READ:First off, the MOVIES were made AFTER the books, NOT the other way around! To say you saw the movie and were then disappointed that the book was so different and should have stuck to Jackson's version should be tested for crack usageSecond, Tolkien is DEAD and has been dead for decades! It took him 14 years to write the Fellowship, it was published in 1954, and he was already OLD by then! So to the person a few pages back that wrote his reply asking if he was gonna write *more* stuff, not to mention to write it like PJ's movies, I beg you, please PLEASE don't ever ever ever write another review to ANY book EVER again, for I shall weep!The books are excellent, the movies are beyond excellent. Of course Tolkien's writing is horribly slow at times and overdescribed on others. This guy was a PROFESSOR, he worked his whole life in the field of Languages. LOTR was his life work, so you have to expect a book taking 14 years to make to be a tad long winded. Get over it.

Dune and Ender's Game being personal favorites, this book offers elements that were never attained in either of the aforementioned. In particular, the details with which Tolkein encapsulated the true settings and feelings of places and characters is unmatched. Like another reviewer remarked, I have to agree that this novel was not written to give the reader a symbolic hidden message underneath the beauty of his writing, but rather entertain the reader with a land of magic and fantastical delight. I have yet to read a novel where i thought it would be astonishing to see how a movie could be made based on this. I am afraid that there is no way possible a movie will encompass what Tolkein has created and that those who fall victim to exchanging the reading for the viewing of the movie will be at a loss.

I was incredibly bored so I decided to give it another try. Afterall, fantasy is my favorite genre. From then on i was caught. I read the book three times and loved ALL the characters, (even the EVIL Sauron, which,i admit, is odd).

This is a fantastic trilogy and a fantastic book you HAVE to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of Numenor, ere it fell.\\" This is the archaic tone you will need to endure to enjoy this book. This, the endless mentions of places, people, and things that have nothing to do whatsoever with the central plot; the mind-boggling barrage of songs and poems; and the book's drudging pace curbed all of the enthusiasm I had going into reading this epic story. The story itself is creative and wonderful; of course, how couldn't it be and be so popular. \\"The Hobbit,\\" though, was a much better reading experience in both style and pace. It had a clear beginning, middle and ending. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" seems from the beginning to concentrate so much on laying down the foundation for the trilogy, that it really doesn't move. The ending is not an ending at all, but the most blatant lead-in to a sequel you could imagine. I expected a lead-in, but I didn't expect that this book would end completely unresolved in every way. Also, so many of the character's physical descriptions are so vague that I still can't really say what the difference between a dwarf and an elf is. What does an orc look like? I'm not too sure, yet the geography is often described in painful detail. Now I understand all the dubious remarks about this book that have kept me from reading it over the years. It's good and agonizing to read at the same time. In my case, the agony wins out."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is probably the most loved epic fantasy series ever written. From the first pages when Bilbo Baggins makes his secret departure from Hobbiton, you are drawn in to this lush story. Tolkien tells a wonderful story and is able to do that while keeping the reader hooked from page 1.&quot;Fellowship&quot; is the start of the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; In this first installment, Bilbo Baggins leaves Hobbiton and leaves The One Ring in the hands of his cousin, Frodo Baggins. When gandalf the Grey tells of brewing trouble the Hobbit says he's going to move to Buckland. He departs on a quest that will change his life forever. He takes along friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The hobbits finally reach Rivendell and an important counsel is held. This is the point in the book where the plot starts to skyrocket. To tell you any more on the plot would most likely ruin your reading.Tolkien's detail on nature and history is astounding and only makes the novel even greater. He is always describing the surroundings and I just couldn't get enough of it. Some may not like this detail because they say Tolkien just drags on and on. This couldn't be furthur from the truth. His detail only adds to this beautiful story.For those of you that are interested in reading this book because you loved the movie need to know what you are getting into. This is the start of one of the biggest and best fantasy epics of all time. Don't think that you're going to be opening a book that anybody can handle. That is not the case. Only people that are willing to make a commitment to a fabulous and sometimes complicated novel should buy this.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is most likely the best fantasy epic of our time. There is not enough that one could say about such a riveting novel. I strongly recommend this to anyone that is interested in a wonderful fantasy that is willing to make a commitment. The best thing about &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is that there are two more novels that come right after it.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of a novel which some have called the Greatest Novel of the 20th Century. Personally I have never liked such titles, but I will say this is an amazing work. J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination is matched only by that of Frank Herbert, in my humble opinion.The novel starts off innocently enough with the departure of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who was the hero in The Hobbit. Soon, however, we learn that one of the items his nephew Frodo inherited is not as it seems. It's belongs to Sauron, the Dark Lord who, for ages, as tormented Middle Earth. Thus begins a journey of epic proportions.Tolkien developed full-fledged languages for the various races which inhabit Middle-Earth, inlcuding the Elves, Dwarves and others. He also developed a history for all the peoples which gives the story added depth, a depth unparalleled in fantasy novels which attempt to recreate the magic of this work. Authors such as Robert Jordan would do well to re-read this novel and learn the fact that sometimes brevity is best. Tolkien has the ability to give the reader enough information to make the story interesting while not loading him/her down with useless details.The reader will, by the end of the novel feel as if he/she has read a history of a world gone by, a place which truly exists. You will find yourself wanting to visit the Shire, to walk down the old road to Rivendell and visit the elves who dwell there. From the fields of Hollin to the darkness of Moria and the evil power dwelling in Barad-Dur, this novel is excellent. If you read only one novel this year, read The Lord Of The Rings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Few can compare to Tolkien for fantasty writing. Every time I pick up this series I find myself astounded by the beauty of the writing and the richness of the characters. It's different now that I've seen the movies. I find myself trying to picture places and things from viewing them on the TV screen instead of relying on my imagination more. Once I finally start to imagine things again though it's like Dorothy stepping into Oz - full blown color, brilliant scenery and fantastic creatures that I've known since I was a child.One of my favorite characters was left out of the movies and, while at first I was disappointed, getting reacquainted with him in reading was made even more pleasurable. Tom Bombadil, in Tolkien's own words, is an enigma. He does not fit the molds, fantastic though they may be, created for the other races and characters. In speaking to my dad about this read through I mentioned that it's incredible to me how Tolkien wrote in such a distinct way, not only in describing and speaking as individual people in the book, but also how sweeping he wrote about their races as a whole. When the Hobbits speak, they are Hobbits. The same with the race of man, elves, dwarfs and even the council-folk. Each voice carries the weight of history of their kind behind it and that's not an easy thing to accomplish and one that, in my opinion, is often forgotten about or overlooked.I love re-reading these books. I still feel the same thrill when Elrond says, \\".. This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great\\". I still quake with fear when the drums beat deep within the heart of Khazad-dum. I wonder at the description of Galadriel but still can feel a kinship with the longing for home and a hearth that Sam often wishes for. I could go on for house speaking of my love for this story.. but this is not the time or place for it.If you haven't read it, I highly encourage you to do so"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Words cannot describe my love for this book. Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring has a plot and storyline superior to most books that I have read. I loved reading it to the end. Tolkien set out to create something far different than what had been made up until this point: Just a regular story with little background on the characters and places. Tolkien created something a thousand times better. He did a great job introducing all of the characters and actually writes about them in such a way that makes you feel like they are real. The plot is very original, especially for the time period that it was written in, and shows the thought and time that Tolkien put into writing it. Throughout the book, the reader is able to picture some amazing things in their mind, and allowed to really create his or her own world based on what Tolkien has written. The reader can visualize the different places and people in the book, and it is fun to do so.As for the characters themselves, there are quite a few of them. They each have a mind of their own, with all of them coming together seamlessly and creating a great book. One of the characters that I think is most significant is Frodo Baggins. He is a hobbit, a normal half-ling, that gets thrown into a quest to save Middle-Earth, and I like how Tolkien didn't try to create some supernatural character for this story to accomplish this task. Frodo had many flaws and had to overcome his weaknesses.Although it is one of the best books that I have read, there are a few minor criticisms that I have for the Fellowship of the Rings. Since Tolkien spends so much time describing the story and since he needs to explain so much, the book does become slow during multiple points of the book, as some other people have mentioned. However, most books have slow points, and this really is not a true reason why anyone should not read the book. I personally think that so much description adds to the high level of praise this book deservesAnother setback is that the story gets confusing due to all of the places and people of Middle-Earth, and the events that take place in the book. It makes it hard to follow and you might end up with a need to reread some of the pages to fully get a grasp on what is happening.Overall, this is an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone that loves fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is perfect for the person with time on their hands. You can't just read it once, read it over and over again, you'll have to. Don't forget to read The Hobbit first, it gives you the basis for The Fellowship, you'll be addicted if you keep with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I searched high and low for depth in this book. I looked in the dialogue between characters, naively thinking that sooner or later they had to betray something profound in their speech, something to intellectually justify this work's existence. I looked in the actions, the adventures, the songs - and I have concluded that Tolkien's epic, while engrossing and undoubtedly creative, lacks any real substance. When I read a piece of literature, I look for richness both in detail and in relevance to the human struggle. And though a central focus of this book and The Lord of the Rings in general is the ancient struggle between good and evil, this struggle is too often lost in Tolkien's obsessive detail. For instance, the second chapter of the first book and its significance is the reason I rated this book 3 of 5; it chronicles the struggle between good and evil, and for a moment drew me in, as though I was vested in Frodo's dire business. But soon after, the narrative of the book becomes overburdened with elf-chants and adventures that are compounded by Tolkien's linguistically savvy but stylistically flawed prose. The narrative maintained my interest, but barely. I prefer literature that makes me think; but Fellowship of the Ring does not make me think - everything I would possibly need to know about it is immediately obvious at a glance."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;One ring to rule them all and bind them in darkness.&quot; In ancient times these rings were crafted by 11 smiths, another ring was crafted by zauron to rule over all of these rings. This ring somehow finds its way into the hands of Bilbo Baggins (as read in the book The Hobbit), a small hobbit from hobbiton (being that all hobbits are small). In this book it starts out as Bilbo's one hundred and eleventh birthday. At the end of a huge party he summons his nephew Frodo to his hole (where he lives), he shows and tells Frodo the powers of the ring and his mission, to destroy it!The only way this ring can be destroyed is by taking it to the place it was crafted, the cracks of doom. Frodo forms a group to accompany him on his journey (these men are later known as the fellowship). They set out across Middle Earth to the cracks of doom. Along the way they meet many evil creatures and houses of friends to stop at. The book becomes very intense and exciting. Many surprising things happen along the way.This book is very entertaining and descriptively written. One thing I did not like was how it got kind of repetitious with the fellowship being attack them someone being kidnapped then being rescued then being attack etc...The book is also quite long and some how tiring to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think I'll be one of the few dissenting opinions here. The only real reason I read this was because, like so many other people, I had it drilled into my head what a &quot;classic&quot; it was. I managed to slog through the first book, after several aborted attempts, and there I stopped. I can kind of see where these people are coming from, who trumpet it as the all-time greatest thing ever. In one aspect, Tolkien was something of a genius--Middle Earth is an incredibly rich and detailed world. However, that doesn't make the books that take place there particularly good. The dialogue is less than sparkling, and the meticulous detail in which everything is described becomes really, really, tedious. The characters are incredibly two-dimensional--Tolkien's obviously more interested in showing us his world than in creating sympathetic protagonists. That's his choice, I suppose, but it really doesn't make for interesting reading. As far as characterization goes, there are two main types of characters: the pathetic little hobbit guys (Frodo, Merry, Sam, et al), and the powerful, cool, mysterious guys (Gandalf, Aragorn, Elrond, et al)--nothing too deep here. On a another note, I've noticed that there are really virtually no female characters--just Frodo's irritating relative, Goldberry, and a few elves, if memory serves. Gads, this is overrated, and the worst part is that it spawned so many even worse imitators--Terry Brooks, Tad Williams, and so on. If you want REAL classic fantasy, you should check out Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar series--it's superior in nearly every way."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I couldn't really get into this book. I'm such a big fan of the movies, and the beginning of this book is just too slow. There were a ton of interesting little facts I got from the book, but otherwise I don't think it's a necessary read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Before making comments about the whole 3-volume series, let me first talk about volume 1 (Fellowship of the Ring).While it starts off slow, the narrative and characters are interesting enough that it's not too bad getting slowly introduced to the Tolkien universe, Elves and Dwarves and Hobbits and the history of the Rings of Power.I was a bit bored by the childish poetry and singing, especially in the parts involving Tom Bombadil.The last two-thirds of the book build up suspense and speed, a good reward for plodding through the boring parts. The action sequence in the mines, ending with the fall for Gandalf, and the dilemma, betrayal and regret of Boromir, are both done very well.Now, about the whole series.Tolkien's &quot;Earth&quot; is formed out of a mixture of various elements of European myths and superstitions, transformed to form elaborate histories and characteristics of the various groups involved. There is an undercurrent of racist ideology, but if you ignore that, the whole effect is rather charming. There is a sense of doom and foreboding and danger, which is well-done, if a bit too drawn-out.I have to confess: I don't understand the extraordinary popularity enjoyed by this book throughout the U.S. and the West. It's a charming series, and the universe described is grand and all that, but does it really deserve the biblical status it seems to have gained?The racial subtext seems to be unnoticed by Tolkien fans. The whole series is a story of the good West &amp; North (elves, hobbits, western men) fighting the evil East and South (Sauron, orcs, eastern men). The Eastern men have &quot;oliphants&quot;, evoking the image of elephant armies from India. Tolkien describing orcs is suspiciously reminiscent of Europeans describing black Africans.Maybe the correct context can be found by thinking of the psyche of a British man (Tolkien) in the early twentieth century, also involved with racist South Africa. The European history of subjugating and raping Asia and Africa, seems to such a person a gallant tale of victory. And so it is reflected in the tale of elves, men, dwarves together defeating &quot;Sauron&quot; in the past.Now, in the early twentieth century, the Asians struggle for freedom. In the mind of the racist Brit, this is an evil challenge to Western hegemony. In the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, this is reflected as the new danger from Sauron gathering power in the East.If you disregard the racial undertones, the series is a fine piece of literary work.Does it deserve all the hype it gets? Maybe not.Is it worth reading? Yes, if you can spare the time, certainly. You start to understand many cultural references after you've worked through Lord of the Rings. Next time someone says, &quot;like Bilbo Baggins ...&quot;, or refers to some bearded guy as a Gandalf, you know what they mean."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I decided to read this book because it is a classic and everyone has read it.

At Elrond's house he learns that is a very dangerous ring and must be destroyed. The fellowship is formed and the set out to escape evil and destroy the ring.I didn't really like this book much. It was really boring and slow moving. Watching the movie partly ruined it for me because the movie was so action packed. I highly advise you to read this after watching the movie so that you can read it with an open mind. Parts of it were okay, but near the end I got so sick of it.

I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a snoozer. The book could have at least a hundred pages cut from it simply by eliminating the endless descriptions of nature that the band is travelling through. Another thing that I found annoying was the portrayal of elves - why are they always relegated to living in magical forests, where they possess great wisdom and power, but never use it? Just to say I've read them, I will probably force myself to read the next two volumes. On it's own, however, the first book is a real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Lord of the Rings Book ReviewIn lord of the rings there are little people called hobbits and they are the most peaceful and careful races of all in the story. One of them (Bilbo Baggins) contained something of great value to out side the shier. The shier is where the hobbits lived, far out of where wars and conflicts are. There are darker races like Orks, Goblins and Ring wraiths. They want what Bilbo has, the ring. The ring is known to control evil and destroy all that was good to middle earth. Bilbo was ready to leave the shier and move on; he left the ring with his nephew Frodo Baggins. They had no idea it was the most powerful ring of all and everyone was looking for it. An old friend of Bilbo, Gandolf knew what it was and sent Frodo and Sam to travel a distance and help them destroy the ring.One of my most favorite parts in the story is when J.R.R Tolkien described how the shier looked. The detail he put in and how things were, the houses the field the hobbit nationality. When I was done I could clearly see everything about the shier. I think J.R.R Tolkien wanted his audience to know excaclty what he wants you to see in your head. He also left room for imagination. Reading it was exciting, though some parts were sort of boring and I could define some of the words used in the book but I got most of it. Another one of my favorite parts through out the story is when Frodo and his crew of hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry) were camping out with there new friend strider, strider went out and on the lookout and handed the hobbits swords for defense, the ring wraiths found them and stabbed Frodo. Then an elf rider came to pick up Frodo and cure with elfish medicine. On the way nine ring wraiths came to take them out. When J.R.R was telling what happened it felt as if you were right there with them. Intense and extreme feelings were cool. I like how he even wrote in elfish language when the elf rider was talking to her horse. Those were my most favorite moments in the book. Also that merry and pippin made me laugh in some parts because they were funny characters. It was good to hear humor in the book with merry and pippin.

Unfortunately, given the time constraints and production costs of film, I don't think even a series of films could do justice to the books. No one would be completely happy with any adaptation.If anyone is considering reading this book for the first time, I highly recommend a comfortable place with good light and plently of patience. Your investment in time will truly be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Compared to the rest of the Tolkien novels, this book might be Tolkien's weakest, but it has it's innocent appeal. Much like the first part to any trilogy, this book sets up what is to come, while following the structure of a complete book. Impressive stylistically, stunning in plot this book starts off slow, but that does not affect the final product."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Not the best LOTR book, after all, this book is the starter, I am on The Two Towers and I love it! This book is short of The Hobbit by a bit, and The Two Towers by far. Trust me, to enjoy the other parts of the LOTR, read this and The Hobbit first. You won't believe how important it is to read The Hobbit before this, you may be confused. This book is worth the read though, so deal with the boring parts, and just remember, it gets MUCH better!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I really liked The Fellowship of the Ring a lot. It is full of beauty,mystery,and terror. I really liked hobbits and elves a lot too. There is so many great characters that it is difficult to choose a favorite one,but I would probaly say I liked the hobbits,the elves,Gandalf,and Aragorn the best.Merry and Pippen are the most engaging hobbits but Frodo is the bravest and most serious. He would have to be my favorite character.Tolkien uses great imagination and description. There is not one dull chapter.Some chapters,like the ones in Lorien are very lovely while others,like in Moria and the barrow downs are terrifying.This is defiantly a great story and I recommend it along with The Hobbit and the other two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Is the best fantasy novel.

Tolkien starts up slowly, but then it gets a little more exiting (especially if you are into dungeons and dragons.)This is a very good book out of a series, that you must read (I would recommend you to read the Hobbit first, it will give you an idea of the story and the settings.) But if you start with this book, you will get the story even if you don't read the Hobbit.The Fellowship of the Ring is about an evil ring who by destiny was given to Frodo who is Bilbo's nephew. So a wizard advises Frodo to destroy it in the place it was made. By trying to accomplish this goal Frodo has many adventures and surprises and meets many different people hobbits, humans and elves.Beware there's a lot of strange, made-up words and there is a lot of songs in this book.

This is such an incredible book, but it doesn't make any since whatsoever if you don't read The Hobbit (also by Tolkien) first! The Hobbit is a lot more fast-paced (and shorter) for you people who thought the Fellowship of the rings dragged itself out. (which it did for a very good reason,to explain a bit of history that comes in very important later on,if you read the other books)So don't give this book a bad review if you haven't read the book that explains it or haven't even finished the trilogy, it gives this really good book a bad name which is the least it deserves!

TolkienGenre: FantasyIn this book the author's imagination comes to life with great description and word choice that paints pictures in your mind while reading.On Bilbo's 111th birthday he disappears on another one of his adventures but the only person that knows that he left is his friend Gandalf a wizard. Before Bilbo went he left a very mysterious and powerful ring behind for Gandalf to give to Bilbo's cousin Frodo. When Frodo received the ring from Gandalf he learned all about the ring and he learned that a very powerful dark lord is looking for it and if he finds it he will rule the world. Learning that fordo knew he had to leave his house and destroy the ring by tossing it into the cracks of doom. Sam, Merry and Pippin join Frodo on his quest to destroy the ring. On their way they come very close to death with many different enemy's including the Black Riders. Also on the way they find another companion Aragorn a friend of Bilbo's. Together they get closer to the house of Elrond, there they can rest and get rid of all their stress. With only a mile to go Frodo all alone encounters the black riders as the riders get closer to Frodo a spell is cast by Elrond and Gandalf at the house of Elrond due to this Frodo blacks out. Weeks later Frodo wakes up to find himself in the house of Elrond and finds all of his friends and Bilbo! Frodo is very excited to see Bilbo and they talked to each other for hours. About a month later it is time for Frodo to continue his quest and has some new companions to go with him Gandalf the wizard, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf and Boromir of Gondor. Then they all depart from the house of Elrond to finish Frodo's quest the whole world is depending on. Will they make it? What dangers will they encounter?

This first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy introduces the characters and how they came together and follows them until they are split up. This story keeps the reader in suspense as the party runs from the evil minions that chase them accross the terrain of Middle Earth. Not only does Tolkien tell a story, he weaves an intricate background of history, culture, and lore for his make-believe world. This sometimes causes the story to slow down as it breaks into song periodically. Of course, the reader may choose to skip the songs since the toon and rhythm is unknown. Overall, I rate this a 5 star story for Tolkiens brilliance in story-telling and attention to detail."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As a rule, I tend to avoid books that fall into the \\"fantasy\\" categoy, but I decided to pick up The Hobbit & the Rings Trilogy, to see what all the hubbub was about. Any set of books that has held up as long as the LOR must have some redeeming qualities, and I figured I should at least give them a chance. So far (after the Hobbit and Fellowship), I'm glad I did. What I found was an intricate tale of friendship, duty, and the inner strengths and failings of men, wrapped in an epic quest whose goal is no less than to save the world from evil.*And no, I haven't seen the movies yet, so I went into the books blindly.The writing is fantastic, every step taken is described in tremendous detail, as first the Hobbits leave their home and gain companions along the way. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the varying landscapes of Middle-Earth; from the mountains to the plains, Tolkien has a fantastic way of painting a picture. The struggles of the group and their wisdom and frustration are recounted in wonderful detail, as their pursuers attempt to close in on them.The plot-related minutae that fantasy fans love and most others hate is present in this book, and all but hardcore fantasy fans will find that the book bogs down a bit in the middle, where the reader is inundated with probably more detail than one really needs to enjoy the story. This is especially true during the Council of Elrond, where I was upset with Tolkien for not just getting on with the quest. The plot presented is wonderful in that the whole history of the ring and its quest are described in detail, but it gets a little slow at that point, and some may have to plow through that section.The final chapters of the book are wonderful, as the quest truly begins with the departure from Rivendell into the wild world beyond. The strengths and weaknesses of the individuals come to drive the plot to its ending and deliver a powerful message: that the seemingly weak can be the strongest among us when dire circumstances and great temptations arise, and the those who would be strong often hide great weaknesses. This lesson is slowly learned by the fellowship, and ultimately leads it to its fate.Finally, since I haven't read the next two books yet, I have to judge this book on its merits alone, and I must say it is a wonderful story, and it certainly leaves me craving the next installment."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A Review by DillonThis is a fantasy book with many adventures. It is about the beginning of the War of the Ring. The story has 9 main characters. They are Elves, Men, Hobbits, Dwarves, and a Wizard. The book varies from the movie in a lot of ways. Most of the ways are that it introduces more characters and has more exciting events. \\"The Fellowship\\" is about a hobbit and a gang of people loyal to him, setting out to Mordor to destroy the ring of power. The story ends about a third of the way through and there are many adventures throughout the book.One of the main things that I liked about this book was the cool story. By reading the book, I could tell that the author put a lot of thought into it. Since this is the first book in a series of three, it was very well written. I also liked the exciting adventures and battles in it. There were many times when the battles in the book were very different from the ones in the movie. It is very exciting the way the author describes the events in the book and it is fun trying to imagine what he is talking about. The creating of characters was also very excellently done. Tolkien does a very good job of describing the different racesI think this was a very good book. I think that people who like fantasy books with lots of adventure and battles would enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Elves. Dwarves. Hobbits. These are just a few of the many amazing creatures in this fantasy story brought to life by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best-written books I have ever read in my life. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins leaving his homeland of Hobbiton and leaving the dark, mysterious One Ring in the care of his nephew Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the main character throughout the trilogy. His friend and wizard, Gandolf the Grey, knows of the Ring and senses the danger behind it. Frodo is instructed to leave Hobbiton and take the Ring so it will be safe. He takes along his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The Hobbits encounter danger in their quest to find a way to keep the Ring safe from its evil maker, Sauron, who is hunting the ring in order to rule the world. They finally reach Rivendell, the home of the elves, where the leaders of the elves, dwarves, and humans along with Frodo and Bilbo had a counsel meeting to decide what must be done with the Ring. This is the point in the book where the plot begins to thicken tremendously. Saying more would only give the best parts of the book away. The style in which this book is written has a mix of Old English in it, but the book is not hard to understand. Tolkien describes his characters in such a way that one can actually feel like they know the character. Tolkien provides such a great depth in his explanations of history and landscape. Some people may get bored saying that he drags the story on and on. However, the way that he uses description in his novel only adds more beauty and life to his epic fantasy. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone who loves to read and has a vivid imagination. The Fellowship of the Ring takes a deep commitment to stick to it and one's full attention to fully enjoy this wonderful book. The Fellowship of the Ring offers fantasy, adventure, and friendship wrapped in one extraordinary novel. The best thing about reading The Fellowship of the Ring is knowing that there are still two more novels waiting to be read in the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have this book and the rest of the series however i have only read this one!

Lately it has been given even more praise, due to its appearances in the movie theatre. Personally, I thought \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" to be no more than a decent read. Tolkien focuses much on character development rather than progression of the plot, which sometimes caused me to put the book down and go clip my toenails, because doing this simple task was more entertaining than reading this book. I have to give Tolkien credit in the level of thought and detail he put into the world of Middle Earth. He gave the reader vivid images of the characters' surrounding (sometimes a little too vivid.) I do have to say that this book is a good tale, but after reading, I wasn't eager to jump into the next novel into the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingBy: J.R.R. TolkienReviewed by: W. HorngPer.6This story talks about Frodo, a hobbit, who get hold of the Ring of Power and he had to destroy it in the mouth of Mt. Doom. At the beginning he was just a regular hobbit when his uncle Bilbo's old friend, Gandalf, came to celebrate Bilbo's 110th birthday! Gandalf found out that Bilbo has a magic ring but doesn't know that it was the Ring of Power. When he found out, he gave the ring to Frodo and told him to leave the Shire and go to the Prancing Pony to meet him. That's when Frodo and his friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry met Aragorn, a warrior who's suppose to be the king of Gondor. Together, Aragorn, Frodo, and his friends went to Rivendell, where the elves live. After they arrived at Rivendell, many people were gathered around to discuss how to destroy the Ring. Frodo volunteered with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir,and Frodo's friends. So the nine companions set out to Mt. Doom. Will they destroy the Ring of Power???I like this book because it's so intense and amazing that you don't want to stop reading, especially when they were battling with the orcs or Urak hais. The sad thing was that the fellowship broke very soon after Gandalf fell down from the bridge of Khazad-dum with the Balrog that he was fighting with. The last words he said was to Frodo, \\" Run, you fool!\\" That part almost made me cry. It must felt really bad to watch as an old friend fall to his doom.The part that I don't like about the book is Sauramon betraying the good and joining forces with Sauron, the Lord of the Rings who can destroy all of what is good in Middle-earth. Gadalf was shocked when he heard Sauramon said,\\" Let's join with sauron, it's a much wiser choice.\\" Gandalf refused to join with Sauron so Sauramon held him as capitive, luckily, he escaped. Gandalf left Sauramon with these words, \\" There is only one Lord of the Rings and he will not share his power.\\"My favorite part was when Frodo thought he got stabbed by the cave troll and was about to die, but he was wearing mythril, an armor light as a feather and as hard as dragon's scale, so he survived. I also like frodo's sword, Sting. I like it because each time when orcs are near, the sword glows, the brighter the closer the orcs are. If I have those things, then I wouldn't be afraid of battling anyone(Well, maybe except Demons and Balrogs)."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent book just as his others. There are three books in the whole story that are very elaborate. Every character fits perfectly in the story like Tolkien knew about the history that no one else had. In the Fellowship, It explains a lot about each character's story and why they were chosen to go on this amazing quest. I liked Tolkien's detail to the environment in the story. You can almost see in your head where the characters are. I would though, have liked to see what the characters were talking about on some of the long journeys, or more of how the characters reacted to each other."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is definitely NOT all the hype that money can buy.

Granted it opened up many doors for the half hearted fantasy writing of today, it still used plane, boring and ohhhhh so long descriptions. What I don't understand is how JRR Tolkien could take a great idea about four young chaps (who happen to be midgets which kills alot of the drama for me) on a harrowing adventure to destory the ring that the evil one wants so he can take over middle-Earth. The whole book went through a phase of Duex Machinea where Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin where either saved by friendly hobbits, not so friendly hobbits, friendly Elves, not so friendly Elves, or friendly Men or not so friendly Men. Startaling trasitions from numbly simiple to madingly difficult dialog made the book jump from one pace to another. Tolkien didn't use mounting suspense through the book, but manic-depressive, spasmatic jumps. Putting a song in the middle of one of the few exciting scenes breaks the pace, and leaves the reader starting all over again, feeling bland.

A great boook."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm very tolerable of boring books. I have a great passion for history and can slog through textbooks with the best of them. Indeed, i even got through the Simirallion without too much trouble. But history books are supposed to be boring, and they flatly detail things that happen in the past for the most part. However, in Lord of the Rings, things are supposed to be happening RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES and it's about as interesting as watching water slooooowwllllyyy slide down a wall.When pointing this out to LotR fanatics, and pointing out better fantasy writers, i'm generally greeted by \\"yeah, well Tolkien started it all\\"Claiming that the fantasy world is completly reliant on Tolkien is utter lunacy. A great deal of Tolkien's world was taken from myths and legends (especially norse ones) that have existed for centuries.Moving on, tolkiens world is very unrealistic in a great many ways. In Gondor, there is no high court, no scheming, and everyone seems perfectly happy to be ruled by a lunatic. This is a very poor reflection of both the medieval ages and mankind in general. In Rohan, there's a bit of dissent, but that's all do to Saruman, no one in Rohan can think for themselves. Everyone's dark side is motivated by the ring, but what about the inherent darkeness in everyone's nature. Tolkien should've researched psychology a bit more before writing characters.

I don't know how someone who wrote something as good as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; could produce this junk. I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called &quot;dumbed-down&quot; like most money-making sequels noone could attack it. And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they're intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not.

TolkienFrodo Baggins inherits a strange ring from his uncle Bilbo. It is a plain, gold ring with no visible markings on it. But it has special qualities. It can make you invisible. It lengthens your life if you have a long time. It was created by the evil wizard, Sauron of Morodor who used its power to command armies of Uruks and Goblins. He battled Elves, Dwarves and Men with his new power. Then he was defeated and the ring was lost. But a little creature called Sm&eacute;agol find it and keeps it for hundreds of years. The ring has a will of its own and Bilbo comes by it when he gets lost in a mountain full of Goblins. The ring leaves Sm&eacute;agol, now called Gollum, and Bilbo uses it on his journey for a dragon's treasure. Sauron comes to life again in the form of a large eye on top a great stone tower, but does not have his full powers back. The one thing he needs is the ring. Sauron sends his servants to find the ring and Frodo is pursued by Black Riders. Help comes from many different types of people as the quest to destroy the one ring begins. They form the Fellowship of the Ring. Led by Gandalf the Gray, the company consists of: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Hobbits of the Shire; Aragorn, a human Ranger that is the Heir to the Throne of Gondor; Boromir, human son of the Steward of Gondor; Elvin prince of Mirkwood, Legolas; and the dwarf Gimli, son of Gl&#972;in.The characters in this book are incredible, good and evil. Gandalf is a wizard in a gray cloak with a white staff. He has a sword and a pointed hat. He is old but he is a very able fighter, killing many orcs with his sword and magic. The Balrog is an evil creature. It is walking darkness and evil fire in a mass of bloodthirsty orcs screaming for enemies to battle. It has an immense, flaming sword and a lash of fire. The Elves are a graceful and skillful people. They are extremely good bowmen and are quick and deadly with their swords. They also have a wide variety of spells and enchantments to hurl at their enemies. Hobbits are small and lazy creatures that look like little humans, like to eat a lot, and do not like adventures. A few of them are out of the ordinary and like to do extraordinary things. Among these few strange Hobbits are: Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.The characters would have no place without a plot to follow. The plot of the story is remarkable. The quest to destroy the Ruling Ring, which could be used to supplement a great wizard's powers so he could rule all of Middle-Earth, is completely original. It has been often copied, but never duplicated. There is a story within the story. And one the people are still alive as they are Elves and they live so long. He believed that this ring of power was lost forever, but not destroyed, like its unfortunate master. The story is a truly superior read.This book is interesting, has a very good storyline, and the characters are astonishing. It is one of my favorite books of all time.D.

It is a follow-up to The Hobbit, the story about how Bilbo steals the ring from the creature, Gollum, who plays a small part in The Fellowship of the Ring also. The Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite in the series so far. I like how Tolkien made such a massive world for the books to take place in.It is an epic story of adventure, war, friendship, and greed. It gets extremely detailed and if you don't read carefully, you could get as lost as the characters in it.

The author skillfully mixes a concoction of effortless lyrics, wicked monsters, and intermittent magic in a dark and foreboding fantasy.As part of an epic tale, not only does \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" masterfully addresses the responsibilities of good versus evil but also examines companionship and loyalty within the confines of a tremendously treacherous task. Suspense grows as the importance of the Ring-bearer's objective is fully appreciated as the Ring's power incites an evil influence on those nearby.Regrettably a peculiar encounter involving Tom Bombadil, a vigorously charming and unique individual, needlessly diminishes the potency of the Ring. Many readers feel the entire episode concerning Tom and Lady Goldberry is unnecessary to the progress of the menacing plot other than a silly interruption.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The book is very intersting. I think it is very diffent from the movie and I like it much better. If I was to choose a book it would be the fellowship of the ring. The book helps put you into the life of Frodo Baggins. And the rest of his group.The life of frodo is going to be hard at all times, and he can't let his gaurd down at all. If he does he might die.IF frodo and his friend let their gaurds down the dark lord well rule all the land."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Definitely a wonderful book. There is no way to describe the entire world JRR Tolkien created from his (huge) imagination. Anyway, try to think about a world, similar to our world in the middle ages, where there is MAGIC. Not these tricks you are used to in real life, but real magic: a kind of power that comes from every living being. People that are really connected to nature, trees that can think and speak ... and everything in this world has a very well defined history: the beginnings, the myths, legends, kings ... everything told in words that reflect the author's sensations about his own dream. Even poetry you'll find in this book.The Fellowship of The Ring, being the fist part of The Lord of the Rings (usually published in three volumes), is the most polemic of Tolkien's works. This book has been read by many people since it appeared in print, and Tolkien himself received lots of letters filled with opinions, critics, and whatsoever. This story is a huge one, and there are people who dislike big stories. The first part of this book is concerned with providing a background to the saga and to make a link with The Hobbit, the previous book in chronology. This way, things seem to be slow and there's almost no action. For those who have read The Hobbit, a very nice and dynamic book, the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring may (but not probably) be boring. In fact, it's almost necessary to read The Hobbit before thinking of reading The Lord of The Rings; otherwise, much of the fun in this book will be lost.However, in the second part (Book II), action comes back, and now we have the characters dealing with a never-ending series of adventures, puzzles, dangers ... In other words, this book is worth the money you're gonna spend on it. But remember: before doing that, read The Hobbit!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"With all the hype over the movies there is a great opportunity to encourage reading. There seems to be hardly a better set of books for young people to read then those written by members of \\"The Inkblots\\". When young people have trouble reading, listening along with the audio book can be a great help.

It is so powerful that it calls people, elves, dwarves and hobbits alike and dements their mind so much that they can only follow Sauron. Thus begins the adventure of 4 daring hobbits, an elven archer, a wise wizard, a feisty dwarf and a powerful soon-to-be king.While it is a very good book, if you do not like fighting, gore, or extremely intense cliffhangers, do not read this book.

You will start your magical journey inside Tolkien's world with this book. And you will finish it with The Return of the King. No waiting for book 12 to come and go. It seems many of today's fantasy writers have decided it takes 5-10 volumes to get their stories going. Tolkien will grab you from the start, entrance you throughout, and leave you breathless at the end. And there is an end. A very happy, heroic, satisfying end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is it, boys and girls. The ultimate. Fantasy doesn't get any better than this. What more can be said about Tolkien and his work? The man practically invented what we think of as modern fantasy. Yes, yes... I know Tolkien took much of his material from older myths and legends. Trust me, I know; I wrote a 170 page paper on it. But that changes nothing. Without the earth-shattering publication of LOTR in the mid 20th century, fantasy today would be vastly different.Thus it is safe to say Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy. Yes, I love George R. R. Martin, and Robert Jordan, and Goodkind, and all those other guys too. They're great writers (for the most part). Often I just can't put their books down. But none of these writers can hold a candle to Tolkien. Pick your favorite fantasy work and I'll tell you how Tolkien influenced it. After reading LOTR you could probably do it yourself. Think of Tolkien as their (modern authors) muse. He is the master. The creator of the most intricate and detailed fantasy world ever conceived. For God's sake, the man invented his own language and put it in his books! If that's not dedication I don't know what is.Suffice to say, this book (and the other two comprosing LOTR) is incredible. Just amazing in every aspect. The pinnacle of high fantasy. And PLEASE, if you have seen the movie and are considering the book now, expect there to be discrepancies and additions in the writing. Peter Jackson did an excellent job directing the movies, but there is absolutely no way he could incorporate all of Tolkien's genius onto the big screen, even with several 3-4 hour long movies. This alone should give you an idea of the scope of the world Tolkien created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is AWESOME!!!

The voices are diverse and rich with character without being over-the-top. The narration perfectly captures the beauty, scale, and terror of Tolkien's world. The only small problem with the recording is how much Gandalf's voice changes from Book 1, when he is in the Shire, to Book 2, where he is featured prominently. Also, this recording is not only completely unabridged, but contains the original Foreword and Prologue to The Lord of the Rings.

It has really good details that made me feel like I was really there in the story. Tolkien did an excellent job, he used the perfect words.\\"Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is about how a young hobbit, (a short little human with very hairy feet) Frodo Baggins who lives in a peaceful place called the Shire, travels in the footsteps of his uncle Bilbo Baggins (a great adventurer.) As his uncle leaves to go in peace Frodo inherits a magical ring, but his old friend Gandalf the Grey (a powerful wizard) tells him he must destroy it in the very fires of Mount Doom where the enemy lives.On his journey he brings his fellow friends Sam, Merry, and Pippen. On the way he meets people such as Aragorn, (a ranger) Gimli, (a dwarf) and Legolas (an elf.) They encounter ringwrathes, (tall men covered in black that are the servants of the enemy) goblins, and even orcs. They travel through the mines of Moria, Rivendell, and many more places.This book is a great read and is very long. There is two other books in this series (The Two Towers and Return of the King.)

If you love fantasy... well, you've probably already read this one, but if it's not your thing, try it anyway. It's definitely written on a much more sophisticated level than The Hobbit. It's readable, engaging without going over the top.

Tolkien's storyline is rich, his characters are deep, and his world incredibly detailed. Therein lies the problem. While I do love the story, the books tend to drag. Tolkien had a great fondness for convoluted stories, thus you have a great amount of extraneous information. There are characters that have no real plot value (which is fine as long as you don't spend much time on them). He also spends too much time on character development at times. I don't like to spend so much time singing songs, reading poems, or perusing the menu...bring on the Nazgul!!! I think this book should be required reading for school writing courses however. At the very least it must be respected as the prototype work for the entire fantasy genre. As much as I love the story however, (I read the series at least once a year) this is one of the rare occations where I feel the movie was more entertaining than the book.

He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves.

Tolkein. It is an awesome story about a hobbit that receives a ring from his Uncle Bilbo Baggins and has to leave the village because the ringwraiths are after a hobbit and especially the ring.As Frodo is on his journey he brings along other hobbits. After Frodo is attacked he has help and is taken somewhere. Before he goes any further, more people come along and helps him out. As they are traveling they go in a cave and fight all these goblins to get out. Now they are out on the field fighting and almost everyone dies for Frodo so he can get to the fire then travels down into the land of Shadow.The book is very long but is so exiting and fun to read. I think this because I can read this particular book without going away and not reading it again. It was hard to read were there was a lot going on but the book is so interesting it makes you want to read it.My favorite part of the book is were there is war in the beginning was started by a king who made the best ring out of the fire and people were fighting for it because it had power over all. When the war started there was a whole lot of rings that only the most powerful of all held. About 15 rings were on the earth. Before this time there was a story of Frodos uncle of how he got the ring. He passed it down to Frodo because his days were almost gone and he couldn't live with it because soon or later someone would find him and kill him.I found something very interesting about the book but I must not say. It happens all in just one day.

Well anyways the book is a little hard to read and very big but it was good and very enjoyable and I had a good time with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Fellowship of the Ring, always possessed an interest in the English language and began writing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in 1939. The story falls under the fantasy and adventure genre. The epic is set in the land of Middle Earth where Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits dwell. The once weakened Dark Lord Sauron has regained much of his power and is searching for his Ring, which is the focal point of his power. Now, Frodo Baggins, a cousin of the renowned Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, has acquired the Ring of power. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring details Frodo's flight to the Elven City of Rivendell, where the fate of the Ring will be decided. Tolkien uses an intricate setting, a unique style and strong characterization to bring this adventure to life.Perhaps the most important device Tolkien uses in his writing is setting. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring is set in the imaginary country of Middle Earth and focuses on the Ring's journey to Rivendell. The environment plays an important role in The Fellowship of the Ring, and Tolkien spared no expense in creating a setting that could be clearly understood and visualized. To do this, Tolkien employed the use of personification. Frodo's travels through the Old Forest are a fine example of Tolkien's personification. \\"But after a while the air became hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them.\\" (123). Tolkien uses personification of the environment so well that the environment almost becomes a character in the story. The lifelike descriptions aid in making this story so real. Tolkien's style in this novel is noticeably different from other novels.One characteristic of his style is Tolkien's use of songs that are found throughout, and play an important role in his writing. Using songs, Tolkien is able to express feelings and relieve tension in suspenseful situations. The songs are also used to give the reader glimpses of the history of Middle Earth. For example, Strider sings a song of the old days to the Hobbits on their journey to Rivendell. \\"\`I will tell you the tale of Tinuviel,' said Strider, \`in brief-for it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.'\\"(203). This allows Tolkien to depict his imagined world without slowing the pace of the book. The reader gains knowledge of the world of Middle Earth that gives them a stronger connection with the story. Songs also server the purpose of giving readers insight into the characters of The Fellowship of the Ring.Tolkien develops Frodo from a young carefree hobbit to a hobbit encumbered with the burden of bearing the Ring of Power. As Frodo journeys towards Rivendell, he encounters challenges with other characters. These conflicts make the story suspenseful and create stronger bonds with his companions.Once Frodo reaches Rivendell, he will go towards Mordor on a quest to destroy the Ring. Tolkien's adventure does not bore and it only gets more exciting. The end is a cliffhanger and urges one to jump immediately to the next installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I am tingling in anticipation to read what happens in The Two Towers (the second volume). I recommend this novel to any that seek a change in their life and want to escape to a wonderful world of mystery, honor, and adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"Three Rings for the Elven-Kings under the SkySeven for the Dwarf-Lord in their halls of stone,Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord, upon his dark throne,in the land of Mordor where shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themin the land of Mordor where shadows lie.\\"And that is the summary of the tale of Sauron, Lord of the Rings, who sought to rule the Land of Middle Earth until his defeat. Though his body is dead, his soul and will are preserved through the power of the Sauron's Evil Ring. What is good, and what is evil? \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" concerns the battle of good agaisnt evil, in which evil is represented by a small, golden Ring.The Evil Ring, lost for thousands of years, is now under the keep of the little man, Bilbo Baggins, who passes it on to his heir, Frodo. But as the ancient evil of the Ring and its master, Sauron, grows, Frodo must now destroy the Ring, or else the power of evil will be strong. And since the Ring was made in the volcano, Mt.

Doom, in order to rid themselves of the Evil Ring.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is unlike any other story that you know. This one of the rare stories that combine serious drama with slap stick comedy, fantasy, and exciting adventure. It is neither too dark, nor too kiddie. It is a story created for all audiences. There has never been a story like this, which will be remembered for years. In fact, though it was made in the 1950's, it is still read and loved. Though the book is long and at some parts it is slow, it's good that there are exciting parts, such as the Bridge of Kazad-dum. In my opinion, J.R.R.

The movie follows this book well, but as always, this epic novel is much better than any flick. We get much more personal with the characters and get more in depth conversations and scenes.The book is fairly long with small fonts and lengthy chapters, but the go by fast, due to the wonderful way of Tolkien tells us this story.For all that have not read this book for school because they had to, or just for fun, you need to.

Along with this present Frodo got a very unexpected surprise... the chance for an adventure that would take him along the lands of Middle Earth, looking for a way to keep the magic ring away from Sauron, the Dark Lord or Mordor. Eight others join him in this adventure, including three hobbits, an elf, a dwarf, a ranger, a man and a wizard. No one knows where they are going or if they'll ever get back...I honestly believe this is an excellent book, the plot is amazing, the chararters and this fascinating fantasy world all come to life... friendship, forest, magic, mountains, everyday heroes, evil, rivers... just everything.Of course!, the book doesn't have a climax ending, for, it is just one third of a larger tale, and you will have to read the other two to know where it all ends.I loved this book, but I do believe it should be read by older kids, or by teenagers because of the many characters, and descriptions, and also because it is a bit long to keep young kids interested (I tried to read it, and gave up when I was 10). I would also recommend to read The Hobbit first, for apart from being an excellent book, it will help you understand how the ring came to the hands of Frodo."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is one of the greates books I have ever read.

The white gulls are crying,The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.West, west away, the round sun is falling,Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling,The voices of my people that have gone before me?I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;For our days are ending and our years failing.I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,In Eressea, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,Where the leaves fall not: land of my people foreverThere is such originality and love in the books that is hard to comprehend, but easy to love. This is why i love this book because the words and sentences you will read in there will never be forgotten by you.Another reason is because Tolkien integrates themes of honor and loyalty that make you wish the book will never end. The way he writes makes you wish you could witness the honor and loyalty portrayed throughout this book. Here is a example:\\"Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\\"This quote was said when Sam and Frodo were completely exhausted from the journey, they had not eaten or drank in a day but Sam carries his master, because he has not the strength, shows the loyal of unimaginable proportions. He follows his master to almost certain failure and perhaps death, but he never leaves him none the less.This is a amazing book and i rate it 5 stars because of the complicity and originality in this book that you will find no where else."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Definitely a book to read if you are an advanced reader and likes fantasy.

Recommended to all who love the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkein's style a very visual and like he's writing a history. This book is sprawling but the reader has a very strong sense of foundation -- of the whole world that the author has created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"WHAT CAN I SAY OTHER THAN THE FIVE STAR MARK PUTS THE HOLY GRAIL OF FANTASY LITERATURE TO SHAME- THE LEGEND (NOT MERELY A NOVEL) DESERVES MORE THAN FIVE STARS, IT DESERVES THE MYRIAD OF THEM IN THE SKY AND MORE THEN. I FIRST READ THE HOBBIT WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOVED IT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTANCE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND WAS DEPRIVED OF ITS RADIANCE FOR A FEW MORE YEARS. SINCE THEN I HAVE READ THE TRILLOGY THROUGH THREE TIMES (UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ONE OF THOSE READINGS WAS UNINTERUPTED). TOLKIEN IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY LARGEST INFLUENCES TO DATE AND I OWN THE TRILLOGY (THE BOXED SET, THE ORIGINAL SET- BOTH INCLUDING THE HOBBIT, AND THE CENTENARY EDITION IN ONE VOLUME AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK I OWN), THE SILMARILLION, UNFINISHED TALES, THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH, THE TOLKIEN COMPANION, AND VOLUMES 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, AND 11 OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH BY CHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN. MY MATERIAL ON MIDDLE EARTH TAKES UP NEARLY A FULL SHELF IN MY BOOK CASE AND I TREASURE IT. A PREVIOUS COMMENT IS CORRECT ABOUT TERRY BROOKS, HE CAN'T BEAT LotR, HE CAN'T AND NEVER WILL, FOR THAT MATTER NEITHER WILL ANYONE ELSE. TOLKIEN IS SIMPLY THE GOLD STANDARD OF FANTASY LITERATURE. NOT THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER GOOD LITERATURE OUT THERE (I.E. ROBERT JORDANS WHEEL OF TIME SERIES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TOLKIEN INFLUENCED BUT IS RE-MOLDED ENOUGH TO BE UNIQUE). I NOTICE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONFUSED COMPLEX AND HIGH WRITING WITH POOR AND RAMBLING WRITING- TOLKIEN DOES NOT RAMBLE, HE HAS A SLOW AND ELEGANT STYLE OF STORY TELLING AND ONE MUST PATIENT, FOR EVEN IF THEY FINISH THE BOOKS, THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE WRITING IF THEY RUSH IT. TOLKIENS GREATEST ACHIEVMENT IS NOT HIS NEAR-LIVING CHARACTERS OR HIS GRAND DEPICTION OF WORLD ALTERING BATTLES, NOR EVEN THE TORN ROMANCE BETWEEN ARAGORN AND ARWEN AND EOWYN, BUT IN THE FACT THAT HE HAS CREATED A GROUP OF GODS AND MYTHS AND LEGENDS (THE SILMARILLION IS MIDDLE EARTHS OWN GENESIS STORY). HE HAS CREATED NATIONS AND BLOODLINES WITH THE HISTORIES TO JUSTIFY THE FAMILIES'S NOBILITY. THE ELVES, THE DWARVES THE NUMENOREANS, THE MEN, AND THE SERVANTS OF SAURON ALL HAVE DEVISED AND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY PUT INTO PRACTICE. HE HAS CREATED A WORLD WITH A BACKGROUND AS BELIEVABLE AS OUR OWN. THE WORLD WITHIN HIS PAGES SEEMS TO EXIST AS YOU READ THEM AND ONE SINCERELY WISHES THAT IT DID WHEN ONE REALIZES THAT IT DOES NOT. IF YOU READ IT FOLLOW SAMWISE GAMGEE, FOR I THINK HE IS THE TRUE HERO OF THE STORY AND I SOME TIMES CONTEMPLATE NAMING MY SON AFTER HIM, IF I EVER HAVE A SON. I WISH SOME DAY TOO THAT AN FAITHFUL MOVIE VERSION IS RELEASED, FOR FILMS ARE A GREAT WAY OF EXPOSING PEOPLE TO NEW THINGS. PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO CRITICISE TOLKIEN MASTERWORK SHOULD DO SO IN PRIVATE FOR THERE ARE SO MANY LEGIONS OF &quot;RABID FANATICS&quot; THAT THE FLAME MAIL WOOULD CRASH HIS COMPUTER FOR PUBLIC NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. IN MY OPINION, ANYBODY WHO CAN'T REALIZE THE GRANDUER THAT IS TOLKIEN SHOULD BE TOSSED TO SMAUG AS PUNISHMENT. LOYAL &quot;RABIDS&quot;, FEEL FREE TO RESPOND (AS WELL AS OTHERS)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In this series tolkien did something that no one else has ever done he created a mythilogical cycle not only did he create a myth he created one to rival the greatest of myths like the Irish Fiannin cycle, the Greek Iliad, and the Norse myth cycle.If there is any modern fantasy to rival tolkien they are Patricia a.

Martin's song of fire and ice series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This was a great book overall, and I think J.R.R. Tolkien is definitely a genius. Since I haven't read the entire trilogy, I can't judge the three as a whole. There are some chapters that you can't stop reading, and there are some that you just can't wait to be over. It takes perseverance to finish, but well worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have read many of the reviews concerning this book and I have to agree with them. Tolkien is the master of them all. It may be rather difficult to read initially, but if you have the patience to do so you will be rewarded by its empathic prose that will guarantee a long rewarding read. Whoever wrote that Terry Brook's The Sword of Shannara is better should consider the fact that that novel is generally regarded by many as a rip-off of The Lord of the Rings. It's that influential. The only authors of this genre that would come close are David Eddings and Stephen Donaldson. But Tolkien is still the king of the pack."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I simply have to laugh at the one-star review below. To compare Tolkien to Brooks is like comparing Mozart's Don Giovanni to Cats. One is art, the other is light entertainment. Not that art can't be entertaining (I find the LoTR immensely so), or that there can't be art in entertainment (I very much enjoy Brooks' work myself, although I don't think he's a particularly brilliant writer), but they just aren't on the same level. Tolkien's writing is certainly difficult, which may put some readers off, but there's no question that this is one of the masterworks of fiction of this century. It spawned an entire genre of high fantasy, and few if any authors in the genre can claim to be uninfluenced by his work. The trilogy rewards multiple re-readings. Fans of Tolkien's work, I suggest doing some research into Old English literature (Beowulf, for example) -- this was Tolkien's area of study, and you can see the influences from that tradition in LoTR."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This trilogy is like Michael Jordan: the best there is, the best there ever will be.

Unparalleled in scope and detail. Few other works of fantasy even come close to creating the mythic appeal that this novel has evoked. I believe Tolkien's work is now considered a form of mythology than a mere novel. It's characters are profoundly relevant in thought and action. While the political scheme and the places are far different than earth, the characters live like us and act like us, they come with all the quips and foibles of our character. In short Tolikien expresses this profoundly encompassing work as part metaphor, part fantasy story. This is more than a great read, as one reads it more and more, one is drawn into the world of Middle Earth, drawn into its history and its characters. This is not a novel to be read but a saga to be experienced."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them...I know a lot of people that think kids today are hopeless. Sometimes I agree with them. I am 12 years old, and I am currently reading The Two Towers. I have the whole set, starting from The Hobbit, all the way through Return of the King. I think all the books (so far) are awesome. I've always hoped to find something like Lord of the Rings. When I read it, I get totally absorbed into the world of Middle-Earth. Sometimes people will be screaming my name into my ear and I won't hear them. I've been introducing it to my friends (most of whom have read The Hobbit already). Some of my friends on the internet, all either 11, 12, or 13, introduced it to me. I think it's great when you can relate to someone years older than you who has read the same books.

Well I repent for I have seen the light. Tolkien is not only the lord of Fantasy but he is a GOD! I have to say that I have never had this much fun and joy reading a book in all my life. This book is also deep and very rich. The world Tolkien creates is so real and his characters are so intricate that I have to slap myself for ever thinking of Robert Jordan as the King. In Jordan's books you get the same richness of his world but not like Tolkiens. It's weird. It's like Tolkien has some special skill that becomes apart of his words. Oh yeah, and Jordan waits up to 4 years to bring out his next book. While this is insulting to the fans and shows how smug Jordan can be I can't help but appreciate the sincerity of Tolkien.

I despise all the fantasy and imagery-haters out there who wrote such horrible reviews about this book.

I hear you whine about 'those little hobbit guys' and 'slogging through the chapters.' All of you who cannot read between the lines of the characters' personalities or deal with the beautiful sensory language of this book, you can return to your little television world where you can *see* everything and nobody had to explain it to you; where you see it all in two seconds.

Buy the entire trilogy right now so you won't have to keep going back to the library to check them out again! :)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As far as I am concerned J.R.R. Tolkien is the best fantasy author ever to put a story down on paper. People who read fantasy and then call his work boring are obviously after a &quot;quick fix.&quot; In other words, they want light fantasy to kill a little time, they don't want an epic story to read. This is not light hearted fantasy. The Hobbit was, but this isn't. Tolkien basically defined the fantasy genre with these books. E.R. Eddison and one or two others are the only writers who had fantasy works before Tolkien (he was influenced to some degree by Eddison). I think the biggest problem for many of the people who don't like these books is that they are unable to identify with the main characters because they have no concept of self-sacrifice. The main characters in the book (Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf) are willing to sacrifice life, pleasure, power and their own personal goals so that others might live free and persue their desires. I think its possible that a me-first attitude is widespread in the world today which makes it difficult for people to understand the point of view of the characters in this story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It's all here! This is the book that started it all! Jrr Tolkien was a brilliant professor of german philosophy and ancient languages. It took him over thirty years to write 'The Lord Of The Rings' based on his epic mythological poem &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, penned during WWI.In this classic epic, the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, relative of Bilbo Baggins who gets his own adventure in the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (which forms part of the back history to LOTR's) must travel from his home in the Shire (based on Oxfordshire where Tolkien lived) to the evil kingdom of Mordor to destroy the One Ring, a magical talisman created by Morgoth the Dark Lord. In the present Third Age, Morgoth's agent Sauron seeks the ring with the help of the corrupted wizard Saruman and his army of goblin-orcs. On his travels Frodo meets elves, dwarves, nature spirits, guardian-angels, fairies and heroes. His protector is Aragorn, disinherited heir to the throne of Gondor, destined to overthrow the mad pretender-king Denethor, who tries to burn his own city, like Nero. This books has all the whiz-bang special effects magic of the classic Grimms fairy tales, the trolls and unicorns you love to read about in Arthurian fantasy and the heraldic splendor of a medieval tapestry. The languages are unique to the book, invented by professor Tolkien as a game to play with his clever children.If you enjoyed Peter Jackson's profound and entertaining movie adventure you will enjoy the book it so faithfully evokes - The Lord Of The Rings by Jrr Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Obviously a creative story, but the movie is 10 times better than the book. This book moves very slow and more than half of the entire book is spent on explaining the mundane details of your surroundings. Everytime the characters in the book move from one place to another, the author has to stop the action and spend the next 3 or 4 pages telling you how many branches are on each tree and which types of leaves are on each branch. The other half of the book is filled with these long and grueling elf chants. This book lacks any real action and I wasn't able to read it for more than 15 minutes at a time without being bored to tears."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I saw the movie (all three actually) and I loved them. so i went to check it out of the library and... BOOM!!!! I was blown away. look out harry potter and percy jackson, Frodo and Sam are here now."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Though held to be a trilogy, this is opening volume of the six-part Lord of the Rings (each of the three LOTR novels has, as Tolkien counted it, two books inside them) and when I was younger it was my favorite in the series. Fellowship begins amid the pastoral utopia of the Shire, as the venerable Bilbo Baggins, hero of The Hobbit, prepares to celebrate a particular milestone in his life, and from there the pace changes as dark dangers begin to appear in this quiet backwater, as they have long-since done in other lands of Middle Earth. Soon Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, finds himself, along with his beloved servant Samwise and two hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin, traveling toward Rivendell, a great elvin city. After surviving the journey to Rivendell, meeting the mysterious ranger Strider, and taking part in a council where the representatives of the mightiest of Middle Earth's peoples gather, the quartet of hobbits join the Company of the Ring, a dwarf, an elf, a human warrior, the ranger Strider (now revealed as Aragorn, the heir to the Kingdom of Gondor) and the wizard Gandalf, and set out on a perilous mission to cast into the fires of Mt. Doom, the One Ring, tool of Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, foe of all that is good in Middle Earth, and would-be enslaver via war and tyranny of all that lives. This is the novel wherein we learn the fate of Balin from The Hobbit, where we briefly encounter Tolkien's most enigmatic and whimsical, yet perhaps most powerful of all beings, Tom Bombadil, and where we enter the dreary mines of Moria, legendary dwarven city carved deep under a mountain chain, and read of the battle of Gandalf the Grey and the demon of fire and shadow, the Balrog. Thrilling stuff indeed!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\`Fellowship of the Ring', the first of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time. There is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours. Ralph Bakshi's attempt to do it was a total failure.With all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third volumes, not to mention Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog in the Mines of Moria, I really find the single scariest moment in the whole novel to be the one I read on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. It is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in Jackson's movie. Jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior, Glorfindel with the very slender, delicate looking Arwen, who would seem to not have the snowball's chance in hell against the nine black riders.While almost all the scenes in \`The Two Towers' made it to the screen, important parts of both \`The Return of the King' and \`The Fellowship of the Ring' were understandably left behind when the film was done. Oddly, the single most interesting character of the volume, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the \`deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was \`the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. \`The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes. Bombadil and his soul mate Goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In fact, of all the characters in \`Lord of the Rings', the contrast between Bombadil and Gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans. I certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive, hairy-toed hobbits.While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more \`human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films. The most important instance in this film is the struggle of Boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father, Denethor, steward of Gondor.As great as the movies are, and they are masterful in how much of Tolkien's story they got onto film, the depth of history and linguistic richness Tolkien creates simply cannot be conveyed in three hours. You got to read the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as a pre-teen and over time my memory of the details of this story had become blurred. It was a great pleasure to return to Middle-Earth to make this epic journey again. Tolkein's attention to detail, in particular to the development of the history and backstory, pay huge dividends in making this story believable. You can't help but be drawn into this quest to save the world. Tolkein's characters are complex and even his heros don't always get along. The story is full of surprises, some of them pleasant, others, not so much. The thing that surprised me the most, upon re-reading, was the time span of this story, with large gaps in time glossed over in the telling. If anything, this helps reinforce the epic nature of this saga."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bid them. These were the words inscribed on the one ring in the black language of Mordor, the one ring that was forged by the dark lord Sauron; the ring of power is all Sauron needs to cover all of Middle Earth in eternal darkness. All that prevents Sauron from spreading his dark dominion is Frodo and his companions. Frodo was chosen to be the ring bearer and to carry the ring to the one place where it could be destroyed-Mount Doom, the very heart of Sauron's kingdom.This is the setting of the great trilogy of the Lord of the Rings written by J.R.R. Tolkien-the man who is widely acknowledged by many as the father of modern day fantasy. The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, begins on Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday. Bilbo, weary of his life in the Shire, desires to have adventures like he's had before. Before Bilbo's departure he leaves his possessions to his nephew Frodo Baggins but he is reluctant to part with his precious ring. Bilbo finally parts with the ring after the wizard Gandalf the Grey convinces him to. Several years pass and Gandalf returns to Frodo in the Shire and reveals the truth about the ring. This is when Frodo's great journey began. When Frodo eventually reaches Rivendale a counsel is called and The Fellowship is formed. Its members include Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimly, Boromir, and Gandalf. The hobbits had many powerful people to aid them but these powerful people weren't the true heroes in the story.The \\"great heroes\\" in this novel are people who are arguably least suitable for the job. The hero wasn't Aragorn, son of Arathorn, the heir to the throne of Gondor, nor was it the great wizard Gandalf the Grey, the great heroes were Hobbits. Hobbits aren't known for their greatness; they are content with their life in the Shire and care very little about the outside world. Yet, hobbits were the ones who had the fate of Middle Earth placed in their hands. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin (Pippin) Took, and Meriodic (Merry) Brandybuck were the greatest heroes. They are by no means powerful. They don't wield magic or swords with great skill; they are just ordinary people, but their ordinary qualities are what make them great.Although Tolkien's characters are very interesting I think they could've been developed in greater detail. Much of Tolkien's rich descriptions were focused on the appearance of the landscape or the history which was involved. Very rarely, if ever, does Tolkien describe the thoughts of his characters; Tolkien writes in an omnipresent viewpoint-the reader sees the events but they don't see into the character's psychology or reasoning. The reader doesn't get to know the character on a personal level through interpreting their feelings, the motivations of a character must be interpreted through dialogue or their actions.Boromir's desire to use the ring to defeat Sauron shows how he is greedy and impulsive. He has the same traits that the Nazgul, the undead servants of Sauron, had while they were human. They desired power so they were easily deceived and corrupted.Other information can be inferred though a character's dialogue. It is evident that Gandalf has great power but the magnitude of his power is never completely apparent. A glimpse of Gandalf's true power is shown at the bridge of Khazad-dum. While the fellowship journeyed through the dark mines of Moria they encounter a Balrog-a demon of the underworld. Once they reach the bridge Gandalf confronts this demon directly and makes a definite statement, \\"You shall not pass.\\" No fear is evident in Gandalf and it was obvious that he is facing a creature of immense power, a creature powerful enough to cause hordes of orcs and goblins to flee like cowards. In spite of this Gandalf confidently stated, \\"Dark fire shall not avail you here...\\" This was a further display of his lack of fear. Gandalf's confidience gives us a glimpse of his true power. People are usually afraid of things that are greater than them; Gandalf's confidence implies that he knows that his power is on the same level if not higher than the Balrog's. It was only because Gandalf dropped his guard that the Balrog was able to pull him down as he fell.After losing Gandalf the fellowship was forced to continue on. Even after losing his great friend and mentor Frodo and the other hobbits still continued this journey while carrying his heavy burden. Through their actions Tolkien demonstrates the bond of friendship that existed between the hobbits. This is what made the hobbits great; in spite of adversity their friendship stayed true and they stayed by each other's side. Through Frodo's journey he was never truly alone; Sam had vowed to stay by his side. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of the hobbits is where their strength lied, in their friendship.Tolkien's interesting characters and intriguing story combined to make an excellent novel. My only complaint is that I wish he would've wrote about some of the other characters like Gandalf and Aragorn in greater detail but that wasn't something that Tolkien wanted to focus on. The main focus of his novel was the hobbits and the extraordinary accomplishments that came from these very ordinary people. Even though I wished that Tolkien would have given more exposure to some of his other characters, I agree that Lord of the Rings definitely deserves to be known as a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Having seen the movie adaptation twice, and looking forward with great eagerness to the next installment, I decided it was time to re-read the novel. I used to read it twice a year, religiously, starting from when I was in grade school---third or fourth grade, I think---and even now I pick it up at least a three or four times every decade. I can still write my name in Elf-runes...I was (and am) fascinated by Tolkien's world-building, so desperately imitated by so many neophyte fantasy writers. This world-building is a good portion of the attraction of the book, for me. It feels so complete. As a kid, I wanted so much to believe that it was true (not, at that point, being able or willing to differentiate between the truth of art-making and the truth of history). It resonates at a very deep level for me, all those Jungian archetypes and half-remembered myths. At a time when I was becoming aware (and frightened) of my own adolescent mortality, I wanted desperately to believe in the immortality of the Elves...And every time I go back to it, I am surprised all over again at how grand the story-telling is---I tend to remember the writing as beautiful but lugubrious, but Tolkien actually evokes places and personalities swiftly and skillfully.I read a lot of schlock in the early 70's which featured large ad-copy: &quot;Not since Tolkien has an author blah blah, blah...&quot; but there are very few who work satisfied me as his did (and still does). Ursula K. LeGuin. Octavia Butler, Sheri Tepper, Orson Scott Card. Sharon Shinn. Ray Bradbury when he's not overdosing on lyricism. But Tolkien is the Master, the one to go back to. I'm not as fond of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, but I can gladly recommend Smith of Wootten Major and Farmer Giles of Ham---both terrific little books with deep resonance."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"hallo dilligent readers,I am a girl from a Eastern Europe, Latvia, and not quite aware of what Tolkien is.

Excuse for my poor English.Getting ready to become a fan,yours Barbala"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In the beginning, I was not sure what to think of Tolkien's books, since I did not read any of his previous works prior to this book. First, I must say that I enjoyed the story and it kept me interested. I will soon read the rest of Tolkien's epic. I liked the characters and how Tolkien made each one specically unique. Even within the journey, each character finds or learns something that helps his own life. The company changes and developes like Frodo's opinion and feelings toward the ring (and its destruction). My favorite characters were Sam, Frodo, and Strider. They were all responsible and loyal characters and I felt like I could trust them. Another wonderful thing was Tolkien's expressive language which he used to describe the setting. The woods and the mountains were pretty, yet scary when they needed to be. It was easy to see the darkness (of Mordor) and the happiness (of the olden days) through the chants and songs that were mixed into the story. They were fun to read but also helped me understand the basic plot. I also thought the plot was exciting; it kept me wondering what evil the company might run into. Another thing I looked for was how the company dealed with the evil chasing them. They faced their worst fear and horrible dangers. So it was interesting to see how they escaped such things, as the Orcs and the Black Riders."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the ring tells how Gandalf the Grey discovers that Frodo Baggins the hobbit has had the almost forgotten ring of Sauron - the one ring to rule them all, left to him by his relation Bilbo.

Buy it, read it"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I bought the digital audio of this when I saw the price and that it was unabridged. Unfortunately, I thought unabridged meant that it was actually the book....I didnt know that 'dramatized' meant that it was literally a dramatized VERSION of LOTR.My own fault for being uninformed, but the 'unabridged' advertisement didnt help. I was expecting a mere dramatization of the text...not an audio version of a sort of LOTR play...For purists like myself, this just wont do. If you are going to do something other than the actual book, you may as well watch the movies.For kids or non-purists, this is VERY well done.......however, be warned...if you listen to this before you challenge yourself to read the book, it could destroy your ability to appreciate the actual book, difficult as it is...to a greater extent than even seeing the movies without actually reading the book. If you know the basic plot of the book, all the twists and drama, before you read it, then you will probably never tackle the book even though it is unspeakably better than the films or any 'dramatized' version."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I was led to believe the CD was unabridged by reviews, even though the product description is not very clear. I also was hoping for a single reader, as opposed to full cast (just a personal preference). Once again reviews reassured me there. I ordered it and got a 3.5 hour fully casted telling of the story. I listened for about 2 minutes before I realized it wasn't an unabridged reading, checked the back of the box, and sure enough it said it was abridged.I hate giving a 1 star, because I know the book, and it should be a 5 star. It seems there's a mistake where multiple products are sharing the same review base though.If you're new to lord of the rings and aren't sure if it's worth experiencing, it most definitely is, but that seems like a given with it's popularity. Be wary of ordering the CD from this page though, because it may be the abridged version."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read. The 360 something pages (I think) of this book could easily be condensed to a little over 250. Great plot and interesting at times but it ends up boring and tedious to read with all the details."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Now, I will start by saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is incredible, and Middle Earth is truly a masterpiece. However, he may have been better off just building the world and letting someone else ghost-write the actual books.The problem is that there isn't a single aspect of Middle Earth that he *doesn't* mention in this book. Since there's no way to just sort of work the details in, there are large amounts of *explaining* by the narrator. Consequently, the book looks more like a documentary than a novel. Tolkien would have been better off leaving out details, if there was no good way to include them without having to actually spend a full chapter describing the Shire.So, if you can put up with the *extraordinarily* slow pace, you may enjoy this book. I would say, though, that this is one of those extremely rare cases where the movie is better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The book I read is named The Fellowship of the Ring from The Lord of the Rings series. The author of the book is J.R.R. Tolkien. The book is the sequel of The Hobbit. The books setting starts of in a town called Hobbition were Bilbo Baggins (the main character in The Hobbit) was shortly having his 111th birthday party. Suddenly one of Bilbo's old friends Gandalf (who is a wizard) came to visit him and talk to him about Bilbo's magic ring that be had found during one of his adventures in the past. Gandalf wanted that ring destroyed and had an argument over it. Bilbo ended up giving the ring to his nephew Frodo and then he disappeared. He left notes to all of relatives including Frodo. Gandalf told Frodo what be wanted to do with the ring (destroy it) and be accepted the mission. He was given help by three other Hobbits named Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Merry went ahead of the others at first.The Company set of on there journey to destroy the ring. The first enemy they came across was the Black Riders. The Black Riders are men on horseback who carry swords with them and cause terror to people. They escaped the Riders and came to where an old farmer's land that has killer dogs. The farmer picked them up and they met up with Merry. They went through a forest and a swamp and came to a land that is called Bree-land. They met a spy named Strider who was sent by Gandalf to met up with the company and lead them through the rest of the adventure. They continued their adventure with a new leader but they were all a little uneasy about Strider. They had another attack from the Black Riders and Frodo was almost turned into one. (Black Riders take a magic knife and stab their victims in the heart and their victims turn into Riders.) The company found out that the Riders want the magic ring. An Elf leader named Elrond met them and they went to the house of Elrond (Elrond's house.) When the company got there Gandalf, Bilbo, and lots of other people were there. There was a long meeting and it was voted that they continued the journey. Gandalf, Glimi (an Elf that joined Bilbo in his journey), and Legolas (an elf representing Elves.) So they continued on the journey. They went through the forest in the dark and were attacked by giant crows and the men were injured. They kept on going and were cornered by wolves and then Gandalf caught them on fire by magic and they escaped. The company moved on and they met (unexpectedly) lots ofOrcs and a few trolls. Gandalf was captured but the rest escaped with a few scratches. They came to a land named Lothlorien. They were given three boats to travel with on their adventure. They traveled on the Great River to get rid of the ring. They went on the shore and were going to get rid of the ring but Frodo and Sam took a boat and they wanted to go destroy The Lord of the Rings (the original keeper of both the magical rings who is evil.) To find out what happens in the rest of the series you have to read part two and three that are named The Two Towers and The Return of the King. I recommend this book to people who like fantasy and magic stories. The Fellowship of The Ring is a good book.By,Lance Hueston"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"First, a disclaimer to those of you who would attack me personally because I didn't like the book: I AM a very intelligent, bright person (straight As in college kind of bright.) I do not believe that (as some have said before in response to unfavorable reviews) any lack of intelligence on my part led to me disliking this particular book.Second, I have not seen the movie. It has been my goal for years now to read the Fellowship of the Ring. I have attempted it at least four times in the last five years, and I finally finished it this evening. The last book I read before this took less than 24 hours to read, and I have been stuggling for two months to read this. In the meantime, I read about 20 other books. I was bored.I understand the concept of world-building. And Tolkien has done a magnificent job of that, I agree. But I also think that world-building is just about the only thing that has gone on here. I was startled by the lack of depth of character. I wanted desperately to care about Frodo, and only in the last ten pages did we really understand that Frodo really has come to grips with his task. Before this moment, Frodo is purely reactionary. He sets off on a journey because he is told to, he eats when he's hungry, sleeps when he's tired. For the majority of the book, he makes no conscious decisions, he only REACTS. Of all of the characters, I felt that Sam was the only one who was remotely accessible. He was the only character whose motivations are clear and interesting. I agree that his loyalty is moving.The journey narrative is so very popular, but describing just about every day &quot;they awoke early that morning&quot; makes me just as tired as the poor pony they drag with them. I am a fan of sci-fi, fantasy and plain old great literature, and damnit, I just wanted something to HAPPEN. I wanted to believe that Tolkien cares what happens to them. I intend to read the next book, because if I don't this is a HUGE letdown. The plot didn't sweep me up at all. If I never read the Two Towers, I'll be just fine. You know it's a great book when you can't breathe until you have the sequel in your hands.This reminds me of Star Wars: Episode 1. This was a narrative so hung up on introducing all the major points, that it in itself doesn't go anywhere. It's the trilogy dilemma! Any author who plans three books from the get go better have a lot of action planned for the first one! But this has no purpose other that to set things up for book two! When Ep. 1 came out, I got so sick of hearing, &quot;Well, they'll explain that in the next movie.&quot; Then why am I investing my time in something so wholly unsatisfying? Why don't I just wait for the next one?I'm also interested to know how many women enjoyed these books. I'm 24, and every man my age gets such a look of joy on his face at the mention of Frodo. I've never spoken to a girl who liked it that much. I wonder why that is? I personally would have enjoyed even a touch of the feminine in this book- I'm not talking romance. I may be a girl, but I normally hate romantic subplots. I just personally lose touch when the female presence is so absent. I think it's a hard book to identify with if you're female. I could be wrong.I just expected so much more in what is considered the greatest fantasy ever written. Maybe that's why I didn't like it- everyone says how great it is, puts it on such a pedestal, that it will never be as great as you all say it is- there's no way it could be. Here's hoping that something interesting happens in the next chapter."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"After seeing the movie Lord Of The Ring I thought that it would be pointless to read the book, but I was wrong.

There was never a monment when I was bored with the book. The only part that I didn't like was that it was a little hard to read.

The characters come alive. It pulls you in. JRR Tolkien made the characters not human and yet have human feelings. My personal favorite character was Legolas.

The action may be a little bit slow in the beginning, but the wonderful details and descriptions of every part of the world really make this story seem real. As the story progresses, new locales are visited by the companions, and new challenges are conquered. From the start of this book, with Bilbo leaving the Shire, and giving everything he has to his nephew, Frodo. Gandalf the wizard then tells him that a ring bilbo left to him is really Sauron's One Ring of Power, and if he recovers it, it spells doom for all races of Middle-earth. Thus Frodo, with the help of three of his friends, makes it to the house of Elrond, where he seeks further council, and then heads off to Mount Doom with 8 other companions to destroy the ring and defeat the Dark Lord. This was an exceptional book"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkien created this unique world where men, hobbits, elves, ogres, et al all mix & mingle with one another. By reading this special piece, I journeyed to the middle earth & experienced the quest of the \\"Company\\" to battle evil.Quite interesting with Tolkien's unique language for each specie & the numerous 'songs' (supposedly) sang by the elves. Not to mention the very helpful map included at the start of the book which guided me through my reading. Very descriptive --- even the unimaginative cannot help but picture Tolkien's world vividly.I started with the Hobbit & moved on to this & immediately continued to read Books 2 & 3. Well, I have to admit, I had an overload of the Hobbit world but I appreciated the entire story more, since I view it as just one long continuing saga of the Company's mission to save Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is a great book but you have to be ready for the difficulties of reading it. It is hard to get into the language and fully understanding it. Sometimes you will have to read the same sentence over and over to finally get the meaning. I love the characters and as the book goes on it is easier to read. I can almost put myself in middle earth and feel like I am there with Frodo and everyone else. Just don't over analyse the language and try to remember everything that goes on, that would make reading this book like a headache. Your best bet is just to read and enjoy and go along with the characters and try to image what the places look like, etc... this is how I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can one say about the beginning to this series that hasn't already been said? I shall try to throw in MY two cents anyway.I have long considered Fantasy to be my all-time favorite genre, but have found pitifully few fantasy books that for me seemed to 'click' with what I was looking for. I was introduced to 'The Sword of Shannara' and for years felt that IT was the Bar to be judged by--despite the nay-sayers who claimed that Brooks had borrowed shamelessly from Tolkien's works--but I refuted that over and over again, even though I had as yet never once read anything written BY Tolkien. Oh I had tried. I felt that the style was too weird for me, and somewhat childish when I gave it a go some 20 years ago. I never once even attempted to realize that Tolkien had created a world based in part on his own studies of history, and imagined a complex society filled with different races, and from scratch he weaves a story that combined historical speech patterns with his own fantasy world...in short, something entirely different, original AND totally entertaining.To say that Tolkien was a genius doesn't even begin to describe his character and imaginiative abilities. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins the Lord of the Rings by bringing us to the Shire of Middle Earth with Bilbo Baggins celebrating his Eleventy-First birthday. Shortly thereafter, he disappears (literally) leaving most of what he has to Frodo. Before long the One Ring becomes the central point of what he has left to the poor unknowing Frodo. Gandalf the Wizard informs him of the historical nature of the One Ring and of the impending danger that awaits every living creature of Middle Earth because Sauron wants it back and the Ring itself WANTS to be found. Frodo quite obviously does not want this charge, but accepts it anyway, and before you know it, he is set upon with Samwise Gamgee on a quest that he believes will be a rather short adventure--and it turns out to be more, a LOT more. From being chased by the Black Riders and Orcs to seeing sights he had never imagined and putting his life on the line more than he had ever thought possible, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins what is arguably the grandest Fantasy adventure ever written. One cannot fully appreciate the detail of this magificent story without reading it yourself. I imagine the release of the 1st movie in the Trilogy will spurn an interest in these books that hasn't been seen in several decades--or more. If history is any indication, it should (the release of Dune in the 80's alone sold an additional million copies).ANY person who enjoys Hard Fantasy owes it to themselves to see why The Lord of the Rings is so beloved and why it IS the Bar by which ALL Fantasy is judged. As much as I enjoyed 'The Sword of Shannara', it doesn't even begin to reach the originality that Tolkien created so long ago...books that hold up now as good as they did when first published in the early 50's. Once you have immersed yourself into this amazingly creative world, you will feel cheated unless you finish the tales that continue in 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King' (I recommend buying all 3 together, or getting the 3-in-1 volume so you won't have to agonize over what happens next when you finish the first part).Finally, I feel as though I cheated myself all these years by not only ignoring these books, but by claiming that they were pale in comparison to Terry Brooks' 'Shannara' (which I still like, by the way). Do NOT make MY mistake. Pick these up and if nothing else, see the movie which will compell you to read the story to see how well the movie measures up (which by the way, is surprisingly good in Myopinion). Read and enjoy.

This is my all-time favorite book. I do not know how many times I have read it, but each time I am swept away by multi-dimensional characters battling as best they can against a powerful evil. Tolkien was a humble man who was glad to make corrections in his books as each edition was published and many true fans like to look for changes from one edition to the next.

I understand that many of the ideas being conveyed are somewhat dated, and as one review said, overly conservative, but one must keep in mind that JRR was born in 1892, so the author probably didn't have much of a choice as to weather his writing style was conservative or not. on another note, the story should be considered a great classic for all readers to at least make an attempt at. although it is a long story, there is not a word that i would remove. this book makes use of imagery in all its forms, cleverly written so as to be detailed while not seeming too wordy.

Lord of the Rings is a story set in a fake place called the middle earth, the middle earth is where bag-end is. Like Thomasville is in the United States. The actual Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who lost the One Ring that had most of his strength. He wants to get the ring back and make all the people in the middle earth slaves. In a very strange turn of events, the ring somehow ended up in the little hands of Frodo Baggins, who is a simple hobbit. Hobbits are little tiny people who are about half the size of normal people. They have big hairy feet and they are short and stout. Frodo is the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins. But somehow the fate of the entire middle earth rests in Frodo Baggins hands. With Gandalf, the powerful wizard as their leader, Frodo and three of his friends, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took,and Merry Brandybuck set out to keep the ring from Saurons hands but destroying the ring by taking it to the cracks of doom, the only place that it can be destroyed. First the set out for Rivendell, a home of elves. on their way they are chased by nine ringwraths, but are helped but a man named Strider. They make it to Rivendell and with the help of elrond, an elf, Frodo accepts the challenge of taking the ring to the cracks of doom, in the the fiery of Orodruin, inside the realm of Mordor. They head south with all of the members of the Fellowship to take the ring. They meet a demon on the way, and Gandalf is no longer the leader of the group. then Frodo and one of his friends decide to head on to the Cracks of doom buy themselves. In the end they make it through many struggles and destroy the ONE ring and save all of the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.I would also like to say the people that rate on what the book looks like are rating for the wrong reason, because i saw i guy saying it was one of the best books he has ever read but he gave it on star because how it looks. Frodo is a better character than Bilbo was in the hobbit.Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am just 12 and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece.

Tolkein gives the different races a certain attitude and the individual characters have personalitys that meet those attitudes. You know the dwarves are physically strong and carry pride, the elves are secret and cunning, the hobbits are hasty and curious, and many other things without Tolkein coming out and directly saying it. He is able to describe the scenary and the situation extremely well, I feel like I'm really in a land to where the grass is fresh and green, the air is refreshing and easy to breath, and the atmoshphere is happy when he explains the Shire. Yet on the other hand he can make me feel fear by explaining the fright that the characters are experiencing. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone that likes elves and magic and old tales and songs being sung and all that cool stuff that should be in a fantasy book because he is wonderful and describing it and getting his point across."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Personally, as a sophomore in high school, I enjoyed the First Part of the Lord of the Rings immensely.

Although extremely creative, the plot successfully avoids tangling into a giant mess that is hard to keep track of. The premise is simple, and the characters are well described. Tolkien is wonderful about letting his characters' true identities shine through their actions, rather than long wordy descriptions. Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mount Doom, even though he knows it will end in most likely in death; Legolas befriends Gimli, despite the long history of conflict between their two species (elf and dwarf, respectively); Gandalf tells the others to leave him at the Mines of Moria to save themselves, and leave him to deal with the Balrog. All these actions show the characters' compassion and bravery, without outright stating so. Yet the characters are not divine beings; they have plenty of flaws too. Boromir, and his greed, are revealed when he tries to persuade Frodo to \\"lend\\" him the ring to save his homeland of Gondor. Even though Boromir has good intentions, he is made more realistic in the eyes of the reader, due to his relatable weakness. The settings are also artfully described; the picture painted of L&oacute;thlorien is indeed beautiful, making me almost wistfully wish for some mallorn trees in my back yard. All these are evidence of Tolkien's strong and descriptive writing, yet sometimes this can almost go too far.When Tolkien writes about how Frodo and the three other hobbits (Sam, Merry, and Pippin) journeyed to Rivendell, I sometimes wanted to fall asleep. While I understand the immense lassitude they had to overcome, I still feel as though Tolkien's words were superfluous and often repetitive. Some might disagree that this brings a sense of realism to their journey, but I disagree. I feel as though all his descriptions of their daily meager meals were almost too much, and at some extremely barren parts, I almost wished for an airplane to take them to Rivendell, just to end this tedious \\"torture.\\" Also, while I appreciate the effort Tolkien put into his many songs and poems, I wish there were only a few, to have a bigger impact, rather than many losing their significance from the sheer amount of poems in the book. These two shortcomings made the novel at times not as engaging as one would hope.All in all, The Fellowship of the Ring was an outstanding book, despite being overly descriptive. The characters, story, and settings were all believable, yet whimsical with enough creativity so as to capture the reader's interest. The book would be great for fantasy lovers, especially those who enjoy longer books such as Eragon or other fantasy novels such as Dragon Rider (in spite of an apparent lack of dragons). Readers of Holly Black would probably also enjoy this; and of course, anyone who has seen the movies should definitely give this trilogy a read! I would definitely rate this book a solid 8.5/10 or higher, and would recommend it to any of my friends.-BJ from BHHS '15"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This was a fantastic read. It will entertain readers for generations to come. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this to a friend. In fact I've already convinced 3 of my friends to start reading it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Lord of the Rings are an awesome trilogy. I have read all the books twice and have seen the first and second movies. The Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the movies I have seen so far. The Return of the King is my favorite book, I am going to watch the movie soon. The Fellowship of the Ring is an AWESOME book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I watched all the Lord of the Rings movies over this summer and loved them in every way whatsoever. I decided to read the books thinking that if the movies were this good, the books must be just as good or better. I raised all my expectations when I started to read The Lord of the Rings Part 1: The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, and this book met every single one of my expectations, and more. This book was amazing and possibly the greatest book I've ever read. Even though I had already watched the movie, there was a new twist around every corner. And I loved this book because of Tolkien's word choice. He used descriptive words in every sentence. I read this for a project in school and could barely read the book because I was taking so many notes on word choice.In this book, a young Hobbit named Frodo inherits a seemingly harmless ring after his uncle Bilbo's disappearance, but as soon as he puts the ring on, everything changes. Monsters from the evil land of Mordor begin to follow him to take the ring, for this is no ordinary ring. This ring is the master ring of the evil lord Sauron. The ring begins to control him as well. Every time someone asks to see it, he draws back, hissing, and overcome with greed. Soon Frodo realizes it is not safe in his home, he must leave to talk to the elf king Elrond to discuss this matter in Rivendale. Along the way they meet new dangers and assistance until they reach their destination. There, at the council it is decided that nine people will go to destroy the ring, in the fiery pits of mount doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group of nine, or The Fellowship of the Ring must set out to complete their quest and destroy the ring, once and for all.I would give this book a five out of five, and more if I could. This book is perfect for boys and girls of all ages, although it is a pretty hard read so I wouldn't read it until maybe 7th grade. This book has something every reader loves, action, funny lines, romance, and much more. Also, this book isn't a book to fly through just to get it done; with this book you want to sit down, relax, and have a good time reading it. I really wish that everyone would read this book because it can teach us all a valuable lesson that the entire world needs to know: Great power can cause even the best of us to be overcome with greed. You can learn a lot from this book, so I hope you will read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was VERY well done. the details and description was amazing and the storyline was so wonderfully unique. i would definitely recommend this book to people who love adventure and something that they cant put down."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I loved the movies but the books are a whole lot better.

It's so much better than reading a hard copy, and this is one amazing book that can be read over and over again without getting tired of it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Though receiving mixed reviews, there is little doubt that \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" stands as starting a new era for fantasy literature. Prior to its publication (July 24, 1954), fantasy adventures were aimed at young readers, including Tolkien's previous work - \\"The Hobbit\\" which was published nearly 17 years prior. While \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" still centers on the adventures of the child-like Hobbits, the material is much darker and more serious than its predecessor. Tolkien also showed that one can deal with serious themes (machine vs. nature) in fantasy writing.Tolkien preferred the name \\"The War of the Ring\\" to the eventual title of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and he wanted it published in a single volume as part of a two-volume set which would have also contained \\"The Silmarillion\\", but Tolkien did not have much influence at that time, and so the Publisher dictated that the single work would be divided into three books, the first of which is \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\". Each of the three volumes is then divided into two books, though this volume also contains a prologue entitled \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which summarizes the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as provides background material about what type of beings Hobbits are.The first book is titled \\"The Ring Sets Out\\" and covers the events of Bilbo Baggins leaving the Shire after his birthday, the transfer of the ring from Bilbo to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, and the adventures of Frodo, Samwise Gamgee (Sam), Merriadoc Brandybuck (Merry), and Peregrin Took (Pippin) as they escape from the shire and travel to Rivendale. In addition, the reader is introduced to Gandalf, Strider/Aragorn, Fredegar Bolger (Fatty), Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, and Glorfindel. The reader is also introduced to the Nazgl, who and pursuing the ring. The events in this book take place over numerous years, though once the hobbits leave the shire it is a shorter period of time.The second book is titled \\"The Ring Goes South\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" and covers the time at Rivendale. There we learn about Saruman turning on Gandalf and imprisoning him at Orthanc, and we meet the other members of the fellowship, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. In addition there is Gl&oacute;in (Gimli's father whom the reader would have met in the Hobbit), and Galdor. The book then covers their travels, from the failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains at Caradhras through their travel through Moria, to the forest of Lothl&oacute;rien where they meet Celeborn and Galadriel. The book ends with the breaking of the fellowship at Amon Hen. Frodo and Sam have left the others, and an Orc attack is causing confusion with the remaining members.As much as I enjoyed the movies which were based on these books, they are simply do not capture significant pieces of the story. Wonderful characters are lost, as are nuances and events which are simply cut out. Some things are changed in the movies, perhaps to make them easier to follow, so while I can certainly understand why one might enjoy the films, I would suggest that you do not deprive yourself of the opportunity to enjoy the books and the original story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Epic battlegrounds and awesome excitement. One of the best books ever. I can't wait to read the rest of the series and I am looking forward to reading the rest"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm rereading Tolkien's works on the Kindle to enjoy our wonderful winter evenings. We read these with our children years ago and they are just as enjoyable today. What a master storyteller he was. These are fun for all age groups."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit) are my favorite books of all time. I've read them at least every five years since I was fifteen. There are no words to express what these books mean to me. The performance of Rob Inglis was very good and convincing. He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording. The packaging has a little to be desired being made of a cheap thin cardboard with cutouts for the CDs to be put in. I just don't think it would protect them over time and a lot of taking them out and putting them back in."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It's fantastic! Cover looks cool and it fits nicely in my bookcase. I'd recommend it to anyone. Lord of the rings rocks :)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is another one of those books I started and put away unfinished many times when I was in school. Now, after discovering Goodreads, I found the motivation to finish it.I'm glad I finally did. It's good... but it's not as outstanding, jaw-dropping, eye-popping-ly good as everyone makes it out to be. I'd give it 3.5 stars.One thing I can say about Tolkien is that he absolutely could write! His talent for describing in excruciating detail every single leaf on every single tree is admirable - but it gets a bit much. The book took me just less than two months to read, and if I were to hazard a guess, I probably took in... 60% of it. Tops. I have a tendency to \\"zone out\\" while I'm reading, and have been known to read twenty pages or more and have no recollection of what I've just read. That happened a lot with this book.It's a good story, though. As other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the things in this book can be interpreted as being clich&eacute;d, but you need to understand that they're only clich&eacute;s NOW, because Tolkien invented them! And that's how I tried to read this book. I read it for the HISTORY of the fantasy genre, the history of wargaming, of Dungeons & Dragons and just about every fantasy role-playing game, story or movie that has come since.For people interested in the history of the genre, or people with loads and loads of time to read, I highly recommend this book. Will I be reading the other two parts? Probably - I wouldn't be able to stop myself!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The book captures you in from the first pages all the way to the end.

I had a very hard time putting it down. It was very descriptive and full of adventures as well as detailed personality. Definitely recommend this trilogy to fellow readers"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I had to write this review due to the one star reviews of people saying the book was too detailed for them. Go back to reading Harry Potter. This isn't a novel, it's literature. It may be above your head, but don't deny it for that. It's not the book's fault. Simply put, these books defined fantasy. Very few fantasies out today haven't lifted a page from Tolkien. If you can't handle the book because it's deeper than Xena, fine. But, respect it for what it is."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There used to be two ways to read The Lord of The Rings, now there will be three. It used to be that you either read this book before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. Now it will also be either before or after you've seen the movies which you saw before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. However you arrive you will not be disappointed. If you come from 'The Hobbit' it continues the story of the One Ring as it passes from Bilbo to Frodo, and as they, Gandalf, and the world become more aware of what has happened and what the ring really means. While reading this book you'll hear clues to many other, older, stories and myths of ages gone by (the three ages of Middle Earth) and at first you'll pass over them, and you'll enjoy the adventure of Frodo and the fellowship facing their collective and individual destinies.If, however, you read the Silmarillion before reading this book, you'll immediately recognize people, places, and things that carry a much greater history, which can add greatly to your enjoyment. The meaning of places and items encountered will carry the wealth of meaning associated with mythology in our literature. It has been said that these stories all grew out of Tolkien's attempt to invent a language, and his awareness that you can't invent a language without inventing a mythology and history to go along with it.Another option is to read all of them several times, and the good news is that they hold up. These books are all good enough to be enjoyed with several readings. Which leads to the further temptation of all those other Middle Earth books that Christopher Tolkien has been editing.For now, if you're just starting, start with 'The Hobbit', it's an easy read, it introduces many characters that are referenced in 'The Lord Of The Rings' and gives you a general introduction to the land and people of Middle Earth. Then 'The Lord of The Rings'. As much as you may like to read just one, the three all go together and they are a compelling tale. Then, if you really want to know more about those characters, and the history that precedes them, The Silmarillion. By that time you'll be a true fan and can decide on your own whether to go back to the beginning or on through all the other bits and pieces that are being discovered.This is a really rich fable. It's been written out of a deep love of language, literature, history, and religion, and the more you read the more you'll wonder about the mind that could invent it, and the man that would keep working on it for so long without passing it on.There is a great love here and bit of it rubbs off on each of us while reading it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I really liked this book, but like other people, I was sorta brain-washed by Harry Potter. It got really hard to read when they were constantly on the road and describing every single bird that flew by, but by the end it was all worth it. I think you need to read the whole set to appreciate the story. After you read it all, it will hit you and what came to me was, &quot;Everyone should have a faithful friend through even the darkest evil, just like Sam.&quot; These books bring to light just what real friendship and brotherhood are. So, if you and considering reading the books, give them a chance and I am 99% sure there will be something there for you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Before reading this book, I had heard a lot of things about how good Lord of the Rings was. Before reading this book, I didn't realize how amazing this story could actually be. Fellowship of the Ring is the first step in the amazing Lord of the Rings novel (it has three parts, each containing two books for a total of six books).Though Fellowship of the Ring has less fighting and &quot;action&quot; in it as it's two sequels, I probably enjoyed it the most out of all three books. The way that the book begins, with Bilbo leaving his precious ring to his nephew Frodo; all the way to the end of the first part where Frodo is left with a difficult decision and Middle-Earth's fate in his hands. Frodo's character develops beautifully. At the beginning he's nothing more than a regular hobbit, Bilbo's nephew, son of Drogo. By the end, Frodo has been through so much that his character has been shaped into something that one wouldn't have imagined when he first left Hobbiton. All in all, Fellowship of the Ring is a fantastic book and a perfect start to a perfecet novel."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What if your uncle suddenly disappeared on his birthday leaving you with an evil lord's ring?

Lord of the Rings was the series that started it all. if it were not for Lord of the Rings we would not have many things that we have today. We would not have Dungeains &amp; Dragons, we would not have Robert Jordan. Tolkien was the one who perfected the fantasy epic, and these books are just as good now as they were when they were published. Someone posted a review that said the characters had no depth, they didn't like the poems, and they didn't understand why it spent a lot of time talking about Hobbit families. Well....someone obviously doesn't really understand what these books are all about. They complaied that the orcs were just evil and and that there were no twists. Well...Tolkien INVENTED Orcs...whay should he HAVE to twist them? And as for the characters having no depth.....that simply isn't true. Anyone with an imagination will enjoy this books. Anyone expecting a book to create an imagination for them needs to go study accounting and never have anything to do with art or fiction. This is a timeless tale that will stay with you forever....and you usually don't just read it once. Every couple of years you'll pick it up again and read it. Wonderful story and great fun."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Rings is one of the best books I have read. It is amazing how Tolkien goes into all the detail, like when the bad guys drowned in the river when the current picked up. It has lots of adventure and excitement. When you start reading you don&#65533;t want to stop. There are also two more books after this one. I would suggest first reading The Hobbit, which is a prequel to the series.

I have read 8 of J.R.R. Tolkien's books and I can't say anything else but praise this person's work. My favourite books are The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. But LOTR has taken the first place of my heart. The amazing Lord of the Rings is my personal beloved book. I like it more than any other book of the trilogy, especially the chapter: The Bridge of Kazad-Dum, the climax of the book. The Lord of the Rings isn't just a book. It is a masterpiece, something historic. Tolkien is the Homer of the 20th Century and his &quot;Odyssey&quot; is the Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend this book to every single person and it is sure that anyone who completes it will love fantasy and will search other works of the same writer too."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best books I have ever read. In this book you will find a great cast of characters and learn learn a whole lot of new words. This book starts out really boring in the beginning but then it picks up and becomes such a great book that you will not be able to put it down. You might want to read the Hobbit before you read this book so u do not get lost at times in the story and characters. The story is about Frodo Bagginses(Bilbo's nephew)and three other hobbits Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Throughout the story a wizard named Gandalf will accompany Frodo and his companions. As you go farther through the story there will be new characters and it will get much more exciting.

Tolkein is a genius. The story that is unfolded is exciting, action packed, and every other aspect you could want in a book. The characters are unique and truly awe inspiring. From the tiny hobbits with stout hearts to the strong and mysterious ranger Strider. This is a story that will capture your imagination and your heart. You'll cheer for Frodo as he carries the burden of the ring and be touched when Sam shows his everlasting loyalty and friendship to him. The Fellowship of the Ring will reach out to you like no other book. Not only are the characters inspiring, but the places are truly astounding. From the hobbit holes to the beautiful elven city of Rivendale. My personal favorite is the underground mines where the dwarves had awakened a monster from the depths of the earth. Something so terrible that even the great Gandalf is scared of it. Another I think is just as amazing is where an elf queen resides. It's an entire town in the trees. All the locations in this book are just beautiful. J.R.R. Tolkein has created a book that will enhance lives throughout the ages. It will touch people with its intriguing story and truly unique and amazing characters and open your imagination with its environments. This is a must have for everybody. And it never gets boring. This book will amaze you and inspire you; it's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings, continues the chronicles of the small folk known as Hobbits and their role in the War of the Ring. Longer, more complicated, and far darker than The Hobbit (\\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings,\\" as Ballantine Books' marketing division puts it), this first installment of three places the destiny of Middle-Earth in the hands of a hobbit.It's been over 50 years since Gandalf the Wizard and a party of 12 Dwarves enlisted Bilbo Baggins to serve as their \\"burglar\\" in their quest to recover the Dwarves' treasure hoard from the dragon Smaug, who terrorized the lands near the Lonely Mountain. After facing trolls, giant spiders, and orcs (called goblins in The Hobbit), the survivors of that adventure returned home and went on with their lives....But even though Bilbo Baggins returned to Hobbiton with a bit of treasure and a tale to set down on paper for future generations, he also brought back a dangerous piece of jewelry, a ring he had found in a cave during one of his misadventures as the \\"burglar.\\" Plain and apparently ordinary, the ring had the ability to render its wearer invisible. This power helped Bilbo escape from the ring's previous owner, the strange creature known as Gollum, and saved the hobbit and his friends from several sticky situations.The Fellowship of the Ring's narrative begins with a long introduction that explains the book's connections to The Hobbit. Tolkien gives us more background information on hobbits, their history and traditions, and even a short treatise on pipeweed, the Middle-Earth version of tobacco. After this explanatory preface, the narrative focuses on the next generation of hobbit adventurers, especially Bilbo's nephew and heir Frodo, his gardener and loyal friend Samwise Gamgee, and his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took.Gandalf, the Wizard who'd enlisted Bilbo more than 50 years earlier, returns to serve as both mentor and protector for Frodo, and it is he who reveals to the younger Baggins the true nature of Bilbo's ring. It is, as all Tolkien readers know, no ordinary magic ring, but a dangerous Ring of Power, forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron to control the other Rings of Power crafted by Elves he had deceived into making for him to rule over the three major races of Middle-Earth. It's also Gandalf who enlists Frodo to go on a perilous quest to take the One Ring out of the Shire and to find a way to destroy it forever.Tolkien's tale is entertaining and at the same time a challenging piece of literature. He uses different styles of writing to tell his tale, ranging from straightforward narrative prose to poems full of references to Middle-Earth mythology, some of which makes more sense after reading his posthumous work The Silmarillion. Some readers (especially younger ones) may feel overwhelmed by all the songs and epic saga-style poetry, but patience with this book is a virtue with its own reward. The Lord of the Rings is one of those rare fantasy tales that has stood the test of time, as proved by its enduring popularity and the popular and critical success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the one of the best books I have ever read because it is a story of an adventure and love to read adventure books. I knew this was going to be a great book because I have read the Hobit and that was a good book too. Yet I wouldn't read any of the Lord of the Rings books until you've read the Hobit because the Hobit is the first book of the series and would be confusing if you didn't read the Hobit first. The Fellowship of Ring may be a long book, over 400 pages, but is a great book none the less and is worth spending a little time to read it. If you like books about dragons, wizards and other fantasy characters this would be a great book for you because what the book is about a hobit, who's the heir of Bilbo, must overcome many difficulties to try to get the ONE RING destroyed by tossing it in the belly of Mt. Doom."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book (and when I say \\"this book,\\" I mean the entire trilogy) is an extremely intricate and powerful book that rewards multiple readings. To call it a good \\"adventure book\\" or to note that modern fantasy literature is virtually all just sincere flattery of Tolkien or to observe that Tolkien's own precedents were epic and mythological literature or to wonder at the depth, consistency, beauty and, above all, REALITY of Tolkien's Middle Earth is to damn with faint praise. Read it again. There is always something more.What struck me during my most recent reading was the deeply Christian ethos of the book. The ring is, of course, the power to indulge one's pride, the capacity for ultimate self-aggrandizement. The heroes of the west are all great because they are all able to deny themselves that power: Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, even Boromir (after a moment's slip) are all great because they are humble. There's a wonderful passage in Mordor where Sam is wearing the ring and sees himself as the irresistible gardener, striding through the wasteland with a flaming sword and using the power of the ring to restore the land. It's delightful characterization and powerful writing.(...)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"How does that adage go: &quot;Some books are to be tasted, others nibbled upon, others devoured whole&quot;? I am used to reading &quot;pop&quot; fiction that can be ravaged in a day or two. Reading this book, however, gave me a new experience altogether - taking my time to see each image in my head and ponder each happening. It's a &quot;nibbling&quot; book, if you will.Tolkien has painted an incredibly detailed world in Middle Earth. After reading the 40-page forward, you can really appreciate how much thought he actually put into this. I found the forward a bit tedious, but it refreshed my memory on the Hobbit (read years ago) and gave me a good backdrop of the story.The characters are fantastic, and although a few of the secondary characters are little-mentioned, the main characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippen, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, et. al.) are rendered in great detail so that you soon begin to like them all very much for their feats (and their faults). Every adventure, every turn in Frodo's great quest to return a dark and mysterious ring, is so fascinating that I could only read about 30 pages at a time before closing the book, closing my eyes, and pondering and recreating what I had just read in my mind. I think that anyone willing to take the time and not rush through this one will really enjoy it. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Following the advice of my good friend (and a much more experienced Tolkien reader), I read \\"The Hobbit\\" before tackling the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \\"The Hobbit\\" is the prequel that introduces the creatures (hobbits, elves, and dwarves) and their manner of adventuring. This is particularly useful when facing the prologue to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (the first book of the trilogy followed by \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\").*** Tolkien uses his prologue in \\"Fellowship\\" to give more background about hobbits as creatures and their history. You have to delay satisfying your appetite for adventure while Tolkien gives you this important set-up. -- Have patience! You will be rewarded.*** Hobbits and dwarves are physically not unlike people -- except for the height difference and the mortality rates (humans are taller and shorter lived). There is a rustic beauty in Tolkien's cast of creatures. They pass on their stories and traditions through song and folklore. But there is also magic at play -- for good and for evil.*** The basic story is this: There is a Ring, created by dark powers and once thought to be lost, that is now in the innocent possession of a young hobbit named Frodo. The Dark Lord, Sauron, sends his servants, known as the Ringwraiths or the Nine Riders, to reclaim the Ring from Frodo. Thus pursued, Frodo engages the help of three fellow hobbits (including the ever-faithful Sam) and learns that the fate of the Ring will determine the fate of the world itself.*** Tolkien creates a very detailed epic. Admittedly, readers may be discouraged by the prospect of all the names and places. However, the basic story is never lost. A helpful trick is to see yourself in Frodo's shoes. The young hobbit is confused himself, but always in the thick of the action. He meets up with amazing companions like Gandalf the Wizard and the heroic Aragorn, and finds refuge in the idyllic elven realms.*** Danger lurks and strikes in one adventure after the next. Frodo and Co. are in it for the long haul and most readers will be too. If you've made it through to the end of \\"Fellowship\\", you'd better have the sequel, \\"The Two Towers\\", close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My daughter tells me I should occasionally read fiction. \\"To be more 'well rounded',\\" she says. She asked me to read Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I had tried reading Tolkien about thirty years ago. I just couldn't -- too many odd, invented proper nouns. And worse. Elves, dwarfs, Hobbits, trolls, orcs, Barrow-wights, Dark Riders, wizards, Rangers, a Balrog (\\"This is a foe beyond any of you\\"), and even more mysterious beings? Be serious -- not worth the effort, I thought.Well, I read The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I had difficulty making my peace with those strange place names and those stranger character names, yet I pressed on. Eventually I found a pretty good story. In truth, I believe the story is something beyond the genre-pioneering work of epic fantasy that critics generally consider Tolkien's Rings books to be. There are certain philosophical and spiritual themes as well. This strong undercurrent is not difficult to find, yet the reader need not recognize it (I'm guessing that many do not) to enjoy the adventurous journey, as Frodo warns his friends: \\"You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\\"Some say the story beneath the story is one of environmental stewardship (I don't know, this wasn't a burning issue in Tolkien's England). Others tend toward the theistic themes of providence (an abstracted 23rd Psalm?) or the relentless conflict between virtue and evil. Some cite social or even political themes -- a bit of a reach on the latter, I'd say. Only a servant of the Dark Lord would deny the theistic themes. The story is rich and deep enough to support all of these ideas, and too much may be made of them; if Tolkien had wished to pen a philosophical dissertation he would have done so. The Fellowship is the first of the highly imaginative Rings trilogy. A good book, even if fiction will never be a genre with which I spend a high percentage of my reading time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As of this writing (Mar 2011), only this title, The Fellowship of the Ring, and the third book, The Return of the King, are available on the Kindle.

For people who have seen the movie before reading the book, it can be harder to figure the book out. The book has more characters and many more details about different events. The book can seem to drag at times, while the movie is action packed. Many events inn the book are written completely different then they are shown in the movie. Some parts of the book made me completely confused. Considering that this book is long, I would suggest that coach-potatoes stick to the movie.

What makes this story great is it's scale. Of such magnitude that it would be an understatement to call it an epic. The story begins with a genuine innocence, but becomes increasingly darker and full of more action as it goes on. Tolkien's brilliance can easily be enjoyed by falling in love with the characters he has created. He has formed and effectively layed down the ground work of fantasy/science fiction for hundreds of authors to follow in his footsteps by creating such ideas. When it comes to such stories, Tolkien is the master. This story kept me wanting more the entire way through. What really intrigued me as a reader was the intense details Tolkien uses to describe every aspect of the action in the story. With this amount of intensity and this magnitude of fantasy, a person who enjoys fiction can only enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Author Bio: J.R.R. Tolkien writes this book \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"; he was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa on January 3, 1892. His memories of Africa are Vivid, but one encounter with a big hairy spider stuck in his mind. He wrote his first book \\"The Hobbit\\" and this was published in 1937. He Died on September 7th, 1973.Annotation: Bilbo Baggins acquired the right more that 90 years ago. On his Eleventy first birthday he disappears, leaving the ring behind for his son Frodo. Saran, once a great wizard, has joined the dark side, and is trying to take over middle earth.. Frodo now has to run from evil, the evil he encounters, you can't even begin to imagine...Evaluation: This is by far one of the greatest book/series of books ever written. Tolkien creates a whole new world; it has elves, dwarfs, men, and of course, hobbits. Being the major RPG/Adventure buff that I am, the Lord of the Rings series was right up my alley. This book, though, isn't just for RPG buffs; anyone who wants to have some adventure in their lives must read this book. It grabs you from the first line, and rips you till the last word. My greatest feeling on this book is that it can be so widely imagined, you imagination can run wild while reading this. The movie also goes great with the books, there are a few parts that they left out, but the movie is very gripping to watch. \\"Two Towers\\" the second of the trilogy is an amazing movie.

Trust me, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first heard of Tolkien when I read The Hobbit for 7th grade reading. I started reading The Lord of the Rings when the movies were starting to come out. I started reading the Fellowship of the Ring during the time when the first of the three movies was coming out. I am now reading the Two Towers which is starting to get a little interesting in the plot. The story is very well written and created thanks to Tolkien's years of commitment of creating a very giant world filled with humans, elves, dwarves, and a variety of creature races that are good and evil. The writing style of Tolkien is simple in a way, making young people also able to read the book. Since Tolkien created such a huge world and a series of time periods that spanned for years and years, it was kind of hard to understand some of the terms that existed in this book were confusing and made me do some research on Tolkien's world and had to flip on the atlas which is actually quite useful. It's a good beginning to a great adventure as I read Frodo starting to begin his new adventure with Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf. It also ties well to the movie but it has more detail, extra scenes, and more characters that pose a great significance to the story (like Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel). Why the four stars? It's a very impressive book but not the best book I've read. The book is a great beginning to this series and I'm looking forward to see what the Two Towers has to offer. Before you read this book, read The Hobbit, because it tells some more detail on Hobbits, Dwarves, and Gandalf as it will give the inside track on what happened before Frodo got the Ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"i liked this book however it was kind of difficult to read. there was way too much details and names to remember therefore making this a slow read book. the plot and charactors were described and written magnificantly throughout the book. i have also seen the movie and there are a few parts not in the movie, but that does not really matter. it was a great book, i recomend this book to someone that has a very good reading skill and likes to read, if they dont like to read and dont have a very good reading skill than this will be a difficult book for them."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Finally, a book I actually like, in and out! Tolkien amazes me with his ability to imagine the diverse characters and places in The Lord of the Rings. This book portrays leadership, and the long enduring of good in an evil world. I am very pleased with the detail that Tolkien puts into the novel so that the reader can understand completely each situation. Tolkien writes the book so that the readers feel as if it could be real. It's an outstanding novel that teaches us that we need to bear our burdens and stick together so that good can prevail in a world of such turmoil.Tolkien has made me think a lot more about my characteristics and whether or not I would be able to bear the ring. Would I be able to withstandthe temptation of putting on the ring? Or using it's power for my own good? It's an outstanding concept. This book leaves you in anticipation for the next. The suspense of what is going to happen next is nerve-racking.Overall, I just enjoyed the material, and I feel that Tolkein is a very experienced writer.

Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.And Tolkien's story evolves--parallel to the turbulent and terrible years of World War II, when he was working on Part 1, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. The book, as it progresses, takes on a darker, more ominous tone, a reflection of the inherent danger manifesting itself in Great Britain under a relentless Nazi attack.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING begins in a lighthearted, almost whimsical fashion, much like Tolkien's prequel, \\"The Hobbit.\\" Case in point: Tom Bombadil. When Frodo and fellow companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin are bewitched by a menacing willow in the Old Forest that has magical powers, Tom Bombadil bursts onto the scene spouting poetry, saving the day. Better yet, when Frodo and his friends fall victim to the Barrow Wights, Frodo recites a poem that instantly brings Bombadil to the rescue. This is fairy tale prose, very much like the tone from \\"The Hobbit,\\" where even when a character is in danger there is no sense of doom or foreboding.And yet, the story evolves, because Frodo's quest becomes more dangerous, disturbing. From the attack at Weathertop, to the confrontation with the Nazgul at the Ford, to the Council of Elrond, the crossing of the Mines of Moria, the imposing majesty of the Argonath, to the breaking of the Fellowship at Parth Galen on the banks of the Anduin, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING becomes a sweeping, vivid account of Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring--to save Middle-earth.Hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs...Tolkien gives us a rich fantasy world that is as believable as it is dangerous.

You'd miss an awful lot if you omitted it! I decided to read the Hobbit because a friend of mine told me that it was the most beautiful English book she ever read.

After that I couldn't do without reading the Lord of the Rings.The complex and beautiful world Tolkien created and described is without doubt the work of a genius. I can't remember ever seeing the land a book described so clear before my eyes like I did while reading this book. The story is a sad one, unlike the Hobbit. It's more serious and much deeper, and for my taste too realistic in some ways (I'm not going to spoil it and tell you in which:P).

It is similar to folklore, we may not love it, but it has it's place in teaching us of the trials and errors, as well as the cermonies, of the past which we have all forgotten. As well as the important intiations of life that we as humans, need to feel more alive and to gauge where we are in our development. I feel like I'm visiting these characters every time I open the book, like old friends, like visiting old traditions, that by way of getting rid of them in present day life, has left this world a bit more empty.

But I had always found it to be a tough read. The language is old, the locations are confusing, the implied histories of the civilizations... it all got to me. In fact, I don't believe I had ever progressed as far as completing The Return of the King. However, the ideas behind the story have always appealed to me and never stopped me from coming back to the books time and again. I recently sat down and read \\"The Hobbit\\" to my seven-year old son, and that really whetted my appetite for more. This is the first opportunity that I've taken to read The Fellowship of the Ring after the Peter Jackson movies.I've watched the Peter Jackson films repeatedly. I estimate close to a dozen times on The Fellowship, so I'd like to think I'm well versed in the movie adaptations. So with this in mind, I began my own personal quest to read The Fellowship. I realize that I don't think \\"big\\" enough when reading epic novels. I can't picture so grand a scale for something so foreign to me. But with visuals from Jackson's movies in my head, I could better envision the story as it unfolded in the pages in front of me. The books and the movies are not the same, and I appreciate that. The film adaptations move parts around to make the flow more natural, and omit areas that would drag in a movie, but it gave me the basis for the proper mental visual.Reading it on a Kindle adds a new dynamic to clear another of my hurdles - the language. Not so much the created language of the elves and dwarves etc, but the use of old English verbage that is not in common use. I had come across many words I do not understand and with the press of a key I could get the translation and move on, not bewildered.And so with the issues of verbage set aside, and the trick to getting past my own mental block of not thinking \\"big\\" enough with the imagery now taken care of, I was able to sit down and ENJOY the book as it was meant to be enjoyed. I didn't find myself skipping passages, I found myself compelled to read more, I didn't feel like I was forcing myself into a chore, and thankfully, did not find myself comparing the novel to the film adaptations. For the first time, I felt like I appreciated Frodo (all previous reads, I thought to myself he was a second-rate Bilbo). The characters really are compelling if not somewhat mysterious. The pacing is questionable at times but the scope of the story is absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My opinion: Brilliant. Simply brilliant. This is the best book I've read in a long time. The characters are realistic, the action is-edge-of-your-seat, and the setting is incredibly believable. This is good stuff. Most people have told me that The Fellowship of the Ring is a boring book, but I completly disagree. Reccomended to anybody."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has never appealed to the literati. Your English professor would hate it. It is wordy, conventional, direct, stereotypical, repetitive, bombastic and overly descriptive. But with so many faults, why is it still so good? Because ultimately, these are faults only of style, not of substance. Judged by its substance, this book has few peers.You must not approach this book lightly. Those who take up this work expecting the easy rewards of \\"Harry Potter\\" will quickly bog down in its philology, its faux history, its detours into song and verse, its cast of thousands, its sheer quantity of verbiage. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not a book that is read; one must be prepared to soak in it and absorb it through one's pores. Tolkien has painstakingly created a world so vivid that it exists in a parallel universe of heightened reality. It is more vibrant and more vital than our own world, but this sense unfolds slowly through a meandering plot filled with flashbacks and disjointed narrative. The opening chapters that introduce us to Hobbits, to the Shire and to the back-story consume over seventy pages and constitute a small novella of content. Yet nothing much happens in this time: it is all about history and premonitions and plans. If this sort of sustained and protracted build-up bores you, then frankly, you should save yourself the bother of starting.But if you have the determination to stick with it, the rewards are without equal. No other book in the past century so effectively addresses questions like \\"For what do I struggle\\", \\"For what do I live\\", \\"Why go on\\", and \\"Who am I\\"? Most writing struggles with simply asking such questions; \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" gifts us with the most inspiring of answers.By now, the plot is so well known that it is unnecessary to describe it. However, it would be a mistake to think that the book is just an adventure story about hobbits who save Middle Earth, or just an epic saga about courage and sacrifice. It is essentially a spiritual quest in which heroes--especially little ones--affirm what we struggle for, what we live for, why we go on, and ultimately, who we are.This work is so strongly identified with its genre that we tend to overlook its genius as pure literature. The themes that Tolkien evokes are the kind typical to the great books: life and death, good and evil, preservation and corruption, redemption and sacrifice. Not least we deal with pity and grace. We could be speaking of \\"Les Miserables\\". But in setting his creation to fantasy, Tolkien imbues it with a mythic aura that allows \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" to share in the conventions of fantasy while going beyond the genre's limitations. Few other works manage to surpass their genres, and none do so more skilfully.I used to think that to read this book is to love it. Time and age have taught me that this is not so. This book requires a determination and a forbearance that does not come easily to the modern mind. We are now so addicted to instant gratification that we no longer savour expectation--nor are we prepared to toil for our rewards. But if you are one who can still appreciate the art of waiting and can see beyond the book's stylistic faults, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will inspire you with a transcendent experience unique in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I generally don't reread books.

I first read LOTR when I was about ten years old and while many of the finer details were absent from my memory, I managed enough of a general gist of the books to avoid going back to them, even resisting the urge when the movies came out to dive into a reread frenzy, even as the rest of my friends were tearing through them (plus I had a certain satisfaction, having gotten to them years before, first on the block syndrome and all that). And I did successfully resist through the three years of movie releases. But when I saw the extended version of the final movie, I was struck by a few scenes that I didn't remember that clearly, as well as reading some articles on the differences between the books and the movies, what was left in, left out, changed, etc. With all that in mind, I figured it was worth a shot to go through the books again, with an adult mind (in theory), since I don't know if I appreciated them enough as a kid. Of course, there was also a risk I would find them tedious and dull and just ruin all the magic but it was one I was willing to take. And it turned out to be a good idea. I firmly believe the reason Middle-Earth has remained stuck in everyone's consciousness over the years was because Tolkien treated it like a real place, made it a living, breathing world, down to the nuts and bolts of its history and as such it almost became a place you wanted to live. I've never encountered a made up place that feels as solid as Tolkien's creation does. That said, Fellowship of the Ring is interesting but also acts as setup, putting everything in place for the events that would happen in later volumes. The pace is far slower than I remembered, when I reached page two hundred and they hadn't left the Shire I knew I was in for a long haul. But you know what? I barely noticed. All the templates of modern epic fantasy are here and done right, by contrasting the average lives of the \\"little people\\" with the actions of the big important immortal people and mixing them all together, he really creates a world shaking feel, that big events are just around the corner and going to change everything. His writing has a casual ease to it, sure everyone speaks in stilted fantasy dialogue but it reads easy and the going went much faster than I would have thought. His gift for description is amazing, he relates enough to develop a sense of wonder but doesn't bog down the proceedings by describing every leaf and blade of grass. Those looking for action will probably be sorely disappointed, as will those looking for women characters (saving the world was man's work apparently, but it was a different time, kids) and yes, if you boil it down to the basics, you can summarize it, in the words of my brother so many years ago, as \\"all they do is walk around!\\" True, in a sense, but it's how they do it that matters and if you let yourself be immersed in the epic sweep of affairs, you'll be walking right along with them. The movie is what it is, and was a great experience, but they had to cut corners, literally transferring this novel to screen, as much as it alarmed purists would have made a dull movie. So think of the movie as the Cliffs Notes version of the book, I heartily recommend both, but if you want the full effect, the text is the way to go. This will be one reread I won't regret."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"No words can due justice to this audio book. It is incredible. The reading by Rob Inglis is beyond belief. He is so consistent with the character's voices throughout the reading, I wondered how he kept all of the characters straight in his mind while maintaining the dramatic content. There are over 20(+/-) major characters along with many characters involved in sub-plots, WOW!I listened to the entire Trilogy and to The Hobbit as well. I have thought about listening to the entire series again (I am in the car a lot). It is a performance worth taking the time to listen to and the financial investment to purchase.

This seemed to drag on until at least the middle of the book with moments of excitement in between. I almost tossed it a few times at this point.

TolkienReviewed by Enaud Ekralc9/20/02This summer I read the best book ever. It's called The Lord of the Rings, by Jr.r. Tolkien. The story begins in the shire, which is where Hobbits live. A Hobbit is a little creature that looks like us and has hairy feet. Frodo is very nice and worry free, until the ring falls into his hands. A Hobbit called Frodo receives a ring that has great power; the evil lord made it himself. Frodo must take a journey to destroy the ring. Only there is one problem, the only place the ring can be destroyed is Mt. Doom. Mt. Doom is Sauron's fortress. Frodo must go through a lot of frightful tasks.There are a lot of characters in the novel. Here are my favorites; first you have Strider who is a mysterious fighter who can beat any demon, then there is Gandolf, a wizard who is loved by everyone for his firework displays. I like Strider because he is really strong and he tricks the evil demons. Gandolf has great power that helps a lot of people. I like Gandolf because he makes people laugh and smile. Both Gandolf and Strider help Frodo through this task. They both play an important roll in The Lord of the Rings.I really enjoyed The Lord of the Rings. It has a lot of adventure that kept me reading. Anyone who likes adventure and fantasy books would love The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien made up a lot of characters that are mean, nice, ugly etc. I would recommend this book to all of my friends and my family. I think that everybody should read The Lord of the Rings. I really liked The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I enjoyed \\"Fellowship of the Rings,\\" a lot. \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" is such a great trilogy and I can't wait to read all the other books! J.R.R Tolkien gives such great descriptions and details in his books, and makes you think that you're in the book yourself, going through the adventure! J.R.R. had such good ideas in his writing; you're in the place called \\"Middle earth,\\" with hobbits, and wizards, orcs, and elves, ringwraiths, rangers, and a single ring to bring darkness to all that is good, a hobbit named Frodo is stuck with the ring. J.R.R. Tolkien is a genius, I want to read all of his books!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R Tolkein's magnificent start of an epic fantasy trilogy that continues in The Two Towers and climaxes in book three, Return of the King. In my opinion, it is the greatest fantasy epic of our time. The Fellowship of the Ring is the story of Frodo Baggins, who becomes the unwilling heir to the One Ring forged by Sauron the Dark Lord in the dark and foreboding land of Mordor. The Ring had come to be in the possession of his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, who kept the Ring hidden in the Shire for sixty years, ever since discovering it while lost deep under the Misty Mountains. The book goes into much more in-depth detail than the movie does. In the book, when Gandalf the wizard discovers the nature and origin of the Ring, he speaks to Frodo things concerning the shadow of the past, tracing the history of the Ring from its making to the present, unlike the film, due to time constraints. Frodo then realizes that he must flee his homeland the Shire, and journey to Rivendell, home of the Elves, as Gandalf suggested. After narrowly surviving perils of his journey, Frodo arrives in Rivendell, where the Council of Elrond is held. There it is decided that since the Ring is the work of Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor, it must be destroyed in order to save Middle-earth from total annihilation, for annihilation is what would occur if Sauron ever reclaimed this One Ring of Power. Frodo embarks on a perlious Quest, his destination being the Cracks of Doom in the very center of the Sauron's dark realm. He is accompanied by Gandalf, and an Elf, a Dwarf, two Humans, and three of his Hobbit companions.Brilliantly written, The Fellowship of the Ring is a work of art with a broad scope. It is filled with adventure, drama, and magnificence. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the best book i've ever read. tolkien is a brilliant author with a very vivid imagination.

It begins with a hobbit, the smallest creature in Middle Earth and it will end with the same hobbit, Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo Baggins, of whom we read about in The Hobbit. This book is historic piece of literature with characters the develop well over the course of the storyline. How can the smallest creature change history? By resisting all that is evil, and even that may prove to be too much for Frodo of the Shire. J. R. R.

Listening to this unabridged rendition of the story added yet more insight into an amazing epic tale. Robert Inglis reads so very well, characterizing the voices enough to tell the difference between characters, but not overdoing. I also love that he actually sings the many songs in the book. He sings unaccompanied by music, just as the character in the story would, and the melodies fit the setting very well. When reading, I tended to skip the songs - especially the long ones. Hearing them as they would have been done by the characters added depth to the story that is missed in just reading. I would recommend this rendtion to anyone who loves Middle Earth and is looking for new ways to experience it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Can you imagine being a bearer for a ring that is pure gold? It sounds easy but it is not because the ring has dark powers from an evil ruler. The ring can turn you invisible if you put it on but it is not good because it has a mind of its own. It can turn you evil. There is a hobbit named Frodo who has to be the ring bearer for that dark and evil ring Frodo also has to destroy this evil ring by taking it to a place of great danger called Mount Doom. Frodo's quest will be long and adventurous. But right now he does have some companions and they are Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf.The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is a really great book. It is very suspenseful and as I was reading it I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. I really like the way that Tolkien describes the forest -- it made me feel like I was actually in that setting. The characters in the book are really cool like the Hobbits, Black Riders and the wizard. One thing I did not like was how long the book was but this particular long book made me use my imagination. Another scene I could really imagine in my head was when Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry were in a barrow and it was really dark, misty and cold. The reason that they were all in the barrow was because they were attacked by barrow-wights."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When Bilbo Baggins of the shire has a birthday party Gandalf,the wizard,notices something different.

Simply summed up then Fellowship of the Ring is the continuation of THE HOBBIT OR THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which recounts the (mis)adventures of a hobbit, Mr. Bilbo Baggins and a ring. FELLOWSHIP, focuses on Bilbo's heir Frodo Baggins who when Bilbo in his aged state decides to leave his home in Middle-Earths shire, home to hobbits, leaves everything to Frodo. The mysterious yet kind wizard Gandolf drops hints to Frodo that the magic ring is not some parlour trinket, but of a dark design once owned by the evil Sauron, who seeks to claim &quot;the one true ring to rule them all again.&quot; Hence Frodo and his friends begin their journey to destroy the Ring before the forces of evil can destroy them.Might be hyperbole, but this is debatably the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The measuring stick against which all fantastic tales written since has been measured. Tolkien's gift of language and descriptive detail is second to none, possibly he was a magician in England conjuring stories in reaction to his keen distaste for what he saw the Industrial revolution doing. Read in that context adds an additional layer to a tale into which depths more than one hobbit, elf, dwarf and yes human has fallen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I realize that I will be ridiculed for giving this book such a low rating.

Overall the book is very good, filled with everything you would expect from a fantasy novel, because in essence Tolkein created the Fantasy novel.

It starts out in the possession of Bilbo Baggins of Bag End in the Shire. At his eleventy first birthday he leaves on journey, giving the ring to his nephew and heir, Frodo. Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, soon learns of the true identity of this ring and tells Frodo to hide it in Bag End. After learning that the ring is indeed the One Ring, Gandalf returns to the shire to warn Frodo. It is then decided that the ring must go to Rivendell and the last homely home in the west. With the help of Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took, Frodo manages to get Bree. It is here where the group meets Aragorn, one of the Rangers from the north, and one of the last of the race of Numenor.(sp?) Aragorn says he will guide them to rivendell. At camp at Weathertop, the Nazgul attack the party, and the Witch King of Angmar pierces Frodo with his blade. The group flees from the place and make haste towards rivendell where Elrond Halfelven might use his healing ablilities to cure Frodo's wound. After several days of travel, an elven rider comes to the aid of the party and takes Frodo with speed towards rivendell. At length, a host of all the peoples of middle earth is brought to rivendell to decide on the fate of the One Ring; it must not stay in rivendell.

Buying Tolkien's novels for people is a great gift because they read them over and over. I keep reading the series each year because it is that good. I also recommend reading this novel slowly, because the depth of his writing is amazing. If one reads slowly, and let Tolkien's words sink in, imagine what he describes, the reader will be taken to a magical place. Each time I read this novel, I notice something I didn't before, and it is always entertaining. I noticed this time that in the past, I read to quickly and did not allow myself to see the landscapes he paints.What happens. The book begins with a continuation of the Hobbit, and Bilbo's magic ring has been found to have a dark past. The Ring must be destroyed. But Bilbo passes the ring on before this is known, and the quest is thrust upon his heir, Frodo. Frodo leaves with his friends and meets elves and Tom Bombadil, before he reaches Rivendell. The movie leaves out some stuff. Once Frodo and the other hobbits make it to Rivendell they continue with five others.

Here are the reasons why this book is so incredibly boring, slow moving, and often frustrating.ok, first of all, Tolkien spent more time describing the scenery than he did anything else.There's hardly any character development. I mean, honestly, the book is more surroundings rather than narration. Plus, the book was just too wordy.Not enough action. Where are the battles? Tolkien had the talent of creating a good battle scene, but, unfortunately, there were hardly any action scenes, and the ones that were there you had to get through atleast a hundred pages of fluff, and in the end the battle scene was only two pages long!Needed more excitement. Oh man, I don't even wanna begin to tell you how much minimal, (yes, MINIMAL) excitement this book has. The movie was ten times better, no make that one hundred times better. No, make that a thousand time better.Overall, I wouldn't be willing to spend one dime on any of these books. I read one hundred pages of the fellowship, and it was just so boring. Where were all the good battle scenes? Where were the monsters? There were hardly any other creatures of interest besides Orcs and Hobbits. That's basicly it.I just don't like any of the lord of the rings books. I want action books, not only with action, though. I don't expect an action scene every two pages, I just want an action scene atleast every one hundred pages! I also want a book that has SOME KIND OF EXCITEMENT OR A HOOK! this book didn't supply that at all. Plus, it's frustrating. Why is it frustrating? Because it has nothing which makes the quality of a book good.

A book that, judged by conventional standards, contains so many appalling lapses of taste and so much coarse vulgarity really ought, by now, to have faded from sight.From many points of view, it has dated badly, and its aesthetics and politics are now so odd that you might be forgiven for thinking, as Peter Jackson's new trilogy of movies rapidly approaches, that its appeal, after all, is one of a delicious period piece.But all judgements have always been confounded by this extraordinary book. It ought to be too long, and too pointlessly abstruse, to command wide popularity; it is not a book for children, and yet not a book for adults either; its style is too elevated for popular literature, but too coarse for &quot;high&quot; literature. There is no reason on earth for anyone to like it, and there are plenty of readers who still think that the judgement of JRR Tolkien's first publisher - who was surprised when it started to look as if the book might make as much as 1,000 - was much sounder than the people who, in the past 50 years, have bought more than 100 million copies of the book.However, by now, The Lord Of The Rings is unarguably a part of English literature. Contrary to popular belief, 100 million readers can perfectly well be wrong; but the continuing life of the book cannot just be ignored. It is just there, massively.But, in many ways, it is just awful. It is amazingly humourless, and Tolkien knows it - over and over again, he writes &quot; 'Come, master Pippin!' Gandalf laughed&quot; - a very bad sign, all those laughing wizards. You don't have to be politically correct to be mildly alarmed by some aspects of it. Apart from Eowyn, the women in it are not madly significant, or allowed to do anything much. There is Galadriel, who stays at home being Wise; there are Goldberry or Rose, who stay at home being Patient Helpmeets; there are Lobelia Sackville Baggins and Shelob, who stay at home being completely ghastly.It is an appallingly nave fantasy of good and evil races; mostly, the good people are tall and blond and speak Nordic or Celtic languages, and the bad ones are dark and hairy and talk a sort of Persian - those guttural dwarves are allowed a sort of virtue, but it is rather grudging in tone. Sam Gamgee is a loyal retainer of the most frightful variety, still &quot;Mr Frodo-ing&quot; away and knowing his place 1,000 pages in; basically, he is Dickens's Sam Weller, and Tolkien couldn't even be bothered to change his name.Tolkien probably knew as much about language as anyone, but it would be fair to say that his interest stopped at grammatical inflection. The Lord of the Rings, by ordinary standards, is just badly written. Great swathes of it are in a sort of Ben-Hur biblical: &quot;And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them... until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords...&quot;There are endless mock subtleties of the &quot;It seemed to Sam that he saw...&quot; variety. And there is, too, that infallible sign of a really bad writer, the overuse of the word &quot;suddenly&quot;. Everything in The Lord of the Rings happens suddenly, dozens of times a chapter. And yet it is one of those very rare books that confounds all objections, all standards, and which in the end may make its own standards. Nobody, I think, has ever produced anything with the imaginative density and intricacy of the book. The reviewer's clich&eacute; is, for once, apt here; he really created a world.The power and resonance of the book come in part from an ethical debate that is much more adult than one remembers - it is haunted by the cruelty of its age, and is not, in fact, just about the alternative of Good and Evil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions. It is really about slow corruption, and is at its finest in the portraits of Saruman and Denethor, characters who it is not difficult to parallel in 20th-century history.But its claim on real greatness comes from the sense of huge, half-glimpsed vistas of history and language, the illusion (which may not be an illusion) that its author knew exactly the languages each of its characters would have spoken and understood the events of ancient history that lead all of them to act as they do.In a realistic novelist, writing about a real war, this would be a remarkable feat of intelligence; when you consider that Tolkien invented absolutely everything - the backstory, the languages, the geography - it quickly becomes almost incredible. At some point, the critics and the literati have to admit that they were just wrong, and, by now, it is probably time to start considering his extraordinary flight of imagination as one of the key works of modern literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; section and the first chapter and then immediatly returned it to my library. I couldn't keep my eyes open it was so boring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm not going to tell you not to read _The Lord of the Rings_ just because it bored me stiff; too many people have loved it for you to take my advice instead of theirs.

If you didn't like Part One, don't waste any more precious time on Part Two."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Really! I do not get why this trilogy, even back when it was made, was so revered. Tolkien is the reason I'm not such a fan of fantasy (the other reasons being Squaresoft and other Video game companies, and a few bad authors). Tolkien was basically the inventor of all of today's popular cliches. A nobody who by chance gets a powerful object that must be delt with, an old pointy-hatted wizard, that dark force that wants to rule the world... despite all this, there really is almost no plot to speak of. Basically Frodo and company go from here to there and everywhere in between, with the events having almost no connection. Alot of characters were pointless too. What exactly was the purpose of Tom Bombadil, Rivendell, or Boromir? Ok, Boromir had SOME importance, but Rivendell ended up summing up what we all knew all along: that Frodo had to go to Mordor and destroy the ring (Which he does almost withut incident). I guess this trilogy is good if you crave adventure and exploration, because its certainly nothing if you want complex plots.On a side note, I rather liked the Silmarillion..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Let me see the flaws in this so-called &quot;masterpiece&quot;, that I should call THE LORD OF BOREDOM:1) WHy the hell all the characters must have at least two different names (in different languages)?2) The &quot;songs&quot; are a joke, boring, it only serves to destroy the narrative;3) endless repetitive descriptions of characters and environment, such as sunset, sunrise, &quot;the air was heavy and hot&quot;, &quot;the hobbits were tired and hungry&quot;, &quot;the fields were green&quot;, &quot;the sky was foggy&quot;, ... Uau, it's utterly boring!!!4) Heavy narrative. Tolkien should have handled his ideas for someone else to write. He's totally conservative, and you just can't sense the real urgency in the plot, as modern fantasy writers can do.5) Empty characters. The characters are lame and their dialogues worst still.6) Terribly drawn maps."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring: Book One by J.R.R. Tolkien is about three hobbits: Frodo, Pippin, and Sam, who take an adventure. Frodo has a ring that can turn him invisible, and the enemy wants that ring. The conflict in the book is good versus evil, where the good guys are hobbits, elves, and a wizard named Gandalf, and the bad guys are Black Riders. There are other bad guys in this series like goblins, Gollum, and trolls, but we do not encounter them in this book. The most interesting parts are when Black Riders find Frodo and want the ring, which happens several times in the book.You should not read this book unless you like explanations all the time and extremely slow pace. The best thing about the book is also the worst thing; Tolkien makes you think something will happen when Black Riders come into the picture, but most of the time nothing happens. This could be considered suspense, but it is also boring. Too often all that happens is the three hobbits travel, eat, and sleep. There was singing in this book, and the songs do not belong. The people who would enjoy this book are adults, not kids or teens. This book is similar to The Hobbit, another J.R.R. Tolkien book. The Hobbit was better than The Fellowship of the Ring: Book One because there was more action and less description."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A simply wonderful book! My favorite in the series as each of the friends it now joined together through the Fellowship. A good book for young people to learn moral, ethical and loyalty values. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the sequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book of three (followed byThe Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), but it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \\"Middle Earth\\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).The story picks up some years after Bilbo Baggins returns from the adventure told in The Hobbit. Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"i have all 3 books and have listened to them over and over! this is also a great way for my kids to enjoy a book i think they would have difficulty reading by themselves. they love mr. inglis' voices too. he sounds just like the movie characters although he recorded this before they came out! wonderful!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The title pretty much says it all. In fact had it not been for this very version of the story I might never have been able to read the trilogy in its unabridged form. The Library of Congress version, better known to some of you as the Talking Book version recorded mainly for blind would-be readers, just didn't capture the story at all. Because of the narrator's voice I just couldn't get into it.Then along came Recorded Books Incorporated with their unabridged recordings. In fact when I have a choice of audio book companies I generally go with them because of their excellent narrators. British stage actor Rob Inglis does a fine job of bringing these classic novels to life, and Fellowship of the Ring is no exception.The book comes in a very portable box and consists of about sixteen disks in four cardboard holders, although only the actual novel and the afterward that Tolkien wrote are featured here. The Concerning Hobbits material found at the beginning of the book is absent, but it can fortunately be found on one of the final two disks of Return of the King. It's actually quite a nice setup. In fact I've got the entire trilogy, now including the Hobbit, stacked on my dresser beside my bed, next to a small boom box for easy listening.As for the performance, as I said, Rob Inglis does a very admirable job. With his deep, calm English voice he's able to convey the narrative quite well, and while his voices aren't extremely varied it's still easy to tell who's speaking, whether it be Aragorn, Boromir or one of the hobbits. I particularly like the fawning yet sinister portrayal he gives to Gollum.All in all this is an excellent version, not the least because it includes the entire novel unlike other performances I've heard. An excellent narrator only makes things better. It's great for lying at home reading or taking a long trip in the car. I listen to the series at least once a year, generally more than that."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Everyone has read so-called high fantasy novels -- lots of dwarves, elves, wizards, Dark Lords, medieval lands lost in the mists of time, and other such fantasy tropes.None of those would exist -- let alone be cliches -- without J.R.R.

Noble elves, lost Arthurianesque kings, craftsman dwarves, and the whole Nordo-Celtic setting.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire amongst hobbits about to have a party. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner.The plot meanders along at a relatively pleasant, slow pace, complete with dinner with High Elves and a visit at the strange too-cheerful-to-be-sane Tom Bombadil's house. But when the hobbits reach Bree Tolkien's writing becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. And the plot darkens as well -- Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul and begins to slowly \\"fade\\" into one of them, as well as the increasingly harrowing journey through the Dwarf mines and into an orc-infested forest, where one of Frodo's friends turns against him.Tolkien wraps this seemingly simple plot in great swathes of atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the snuffling undead Black Riders, the shining beauty and immortal sadness of the Elves, the decay of the vast underground kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn and the elf queen Galadriel.

However, it's not the Bible, or the new I Ching. It's just a story; but besides creating an entirely complete world of its own that you can all but touch, it speaks volumes about human will, passion, and the motivation to do the right thing despite how uncomfortable it is.

To summarise, it DELIVERS. The Fellowship of the Rings may be long and complex, but is the epitome of all that is simple literature. JRR Tolkein uses his remarkable poetic and philological talents to guide us through an entirely distinct universe, and in the fashion of Classical, Norse and Irish legend and mythology envigorates the mind with each twist and turn in the basic struggle against good and evil. With the literary skill of a master seanacha&iacute;, he relates the tales of a new quasi-mythology...this book isn't fantasy, to an open-minded reader it is a new level of reality; we may learn as much from the thematic structure of the Lord of the Rings than we do from the innards of a history book. No other novel has delved as deeply into the mind of the author, and none have manifested these ideas as well to the reader.

Not so here, I swear I looked at the page numbers all of the time and got nowhere. I read the first 200 pages (which were really boring) then got to the interesting part. Unfortunatly the report on it was due the next day so all day I spent reading it page by page until it was finished. Moria was good Rivendell and Elf Land were dragged out quite alot.

Places like Lothlorien, the Old Forest, Weathertop, and of course the Mines of Moria - the ancient, sprawling dwarven kingdom that inspired Gary Gygax to create the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role playing game.If you are new to fantasy, if you don't usually go in for this kind of story, or if you are just looking for a great read, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about.Let me put it this way -- there exist in the world dedicated Tolkien Scholars. How many Clancy or Koontz scholars do you think are out there?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first segment of the greatest literary masterpiece ever written, The Lord of the Rings. Lots of people call it a trilogy, but I can only agree with that idea in that the three segments were initially published seperately in the years 1954, 1955, and 1956. Besides that, one has to notice that each segment is incomplete without the others. A trilogy would contain three complete stories, like the original Star Wars trilogy. Well, its time I got on with my two cents of TFOTR. After The Hobbit was published, the fantasy genre was revived in a way that gave Arthur and his knights a run for their money. Fantasy was back, 20th century style. People begged for a sequel, and Tolkien delivered one beyond anybody's expectations and imagination. TFOTR begins to answer the questions that resulted at the end of The Hobbit. This, I feel, is its main purpose. It doesn't have as much action as the two later segments, but instead focuses on why a new quest is to begin. It does have its moments of action, but most of suspense and intrigue comes from revelations. Thats why The Hobbit should be read first. It would be a mistake not to. It is true that is somwhat slow in the beginning, but the suspense and wonder of a ruling ring just glides in the story. Suddenly, what happened with Bilbo's quest becomes very importent. It was in TFOTR that Tolkien introduced Middle-Earth and its history. A person forgets that they're reading fantasy in LOTR. It feels very real, and once TFOTR gets though the beginning, it doesn't let go. The only real bad part is that it leaves you hanging in the end, forcing you to read The Two Towers and making you wish that you had a single volume edition. I've been to Middle-Earth, and I deeply regreted having to leave for a while. Read this masterpiece (LOTR) before you die. You'll be incomplete if you don't."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Prepare yourself to delve into a world so rich, so full of life and history that you will have trouble distinguising it from something real.

Smut, trash, cussing, and all of the other all too common things these days. This is pure fantasy, pure enjoyment.My only wish is that I had never read it, so that I could enjoy the experience of reading it the first time again.I warn you. If you are a very busy person, and don't have much time on your hands, then don't get this book, because you'll find yourself neglecting many important things to keep reading.With charecters so vivid that it wouldn't surprise me at all if I were to run into Gandalf on the street. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd sit down with him and blow a few smoke rings before heading in our seperate directions.My point is, this is a wonderful series . . . arguably one of the best.

Tolkien uses rich and skillful words to tell his epic tale. While part one doesn't have much in the way of action, it is my favorite out of the three books. It contains a very suspenseful build up to part two, where the real action begins. Of course you wouldn't expect Part one to have as much action as Part two or three.In 'Fellowhip of the Ring' I fell in love with Frodo's faithful servant Sam. He is character to good too be true! It is Sam's personality and comments, that make him an absolute bomb. In the other books he is the bomb, but in an action stand point. The only problems with the other two books, is that you have to wait to the second half of them, to find out what has happened to Frodo and Sam.This is a must read for everyone. Of course read 'The Hobbit' first. Without reading that first, this book here can be confusing, and less fun. I wish at times that I hadn't ever read this trilogy, just so that I could read it again for the very first time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in the trilogy Lord of the Rings. This first portion of the book tells of the making and breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The major appeal of the story stems form its rich history of the mythical world Middle Earth, and the great number of characters.The Fellowship of the Ring tells of a little known race of beings called halflings, or as they like to all themselves Hobbits, who's peaceful and fun loving way of life is being threatened to the brink of total destruction as well as pure and utter chaos. None in the Shire,the secluded home of the Hobbits, know of this emanate danger which is rapidly approaching except one small Hobbit named Frodo. Fore he possesses a magical ring of immense power. A power which is sought after by the dark lord of Mordor and his nine black riders; who will stop at nothing and go to any lengths to obtain the One Ring. Frodo's ring.With the help and guidance of Gandalf the gray,a powerful wizard and a well respected member of the Great Council, Frodo resolves to travel to the ancient land of Mordor to unmake the One Ring of the Dark Lord, by casting it into the firy mouth of Mount Doom. Although the journey may prove parlous or even fatal Frodo and three of his closest friend begin their journey toward Mount Doom, which will that them more than a year fromstart to finish.I could go on for several dozen pages, how ever I would hate to destroy the great pleasure I found in reading and discovering the deep and rich history of Middle Earth. The best aspect of the Fellowship of the Ring is I never tier of reading it. I have spent many a nights reading well into the early hours of the dawn when I suddenly realize that thoughs \\"just five more minutes\\" have turned into just five more hours. And even then I will say to myself \\"just five more minutes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Rob Inglis's reading of Tolkien's work is brilliant. He evokes the spirit of the book through the very timbre of his voice. Even if you do not usually like to listen to recorded books, I believe this recording will draw you into the story and keep you spellbound. Every time I listen to Inglis's recordings of The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit (he has recorded them all), I feel as if he is spinning out the tale for the first time.Listening to a book helps me pick up details I miss when reading (sometimes being a fast reader is not a good thing). Inglis's narration and characterization have helped me understand the plot and characters better. In particular, he gives delightful and moving readings of the poetry--the stories within the story of Frodo's adventure. He sometimes chants, sometimes sings the tales of the ancient heroes of Middle Earth.Do not miss the opportunity to hear the best reading of Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Lord of the Rings is truly monumental fiction. I've read fantasy from many, many different authors, including Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Stephen R. Donaldson, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, to name only a few, and I have come to the conclusion that every fantasy author in the last fifty years has borrowed from Tolkein to one extent or another.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple. Frodo Baggins is a hobbit who inherits a Ring of Power form his uncle Bilbo Baggins. At first glance, the Ring seems to be a good thing, posessing the power to turn its wearer invisible (a power which saved uncle Bilbo several times during his own adventure, chronicled in The Hobbit). However, the wizard Gandalf learns that the Ring is in fact the One Ring, created millenia ago by the evil Dark Lord Sauron, and removed from his posession by thr forces of good. Sauron was weakened by his loss, but now he has recovered strength and wants his Ring back. Once he gets it, he will have the power to conquer the world. The only way to keep the Ring from his grasp is to destroy it, and this can only be done by casting the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally created. Naturally, Mount Doom lies in the very heart of Sauron's realm in Mordor, so the quest is fraught with peril. Frodo and his faithful servant Sam, along with others, take on the task of the destruction of the Ring and the salvation of Middle-Earth. Fellowship of the Ring chronicles the first part of this story, which concludes with The Two Towers and Return of the King.If that was all there was to this book, it would be mo more than a first-rate work of fantasy. But, what lifts this book out of the realm of &quot;fantasy&quot; and into the realm of classic literature is the backstory. Lord of the Rings is essentially the conclusion of an incredible mythology that stretches back for over 7,000 Years of the Sun, and for who knows how many millenia before that. Tolkein worked on this mythology for several decades before Lord of the Rings was published, and references to it are sprinkled liberally throughout. The language and songs of the Elves are the best example of this, but there are many others.The pace of the book does slow a little in places, but that is only becuase several long expository sections are essential to give the reader the full story behind the Ring and how it made its journey from the hand of Sauron to the posession of Frodo. But, the book nevertheless has the power to draw you in. I've read this book over 20 times since I first discovered it in the early 1980's, and I still have not gotten tired of the wonder of this book.I do want to make one comment on the latest version of the book, however. I've noticed that many people have criticized the maps in the book as too difficult to read. I've looked at some of the newer copies, and I have to agree with this. I would like to point out that the map in these new copies is NOT the original map drawn by Tolkein himself, nor is it the revised map drawn by his son. The older maps are much better drawn, though the text is a little small. Frankly, if the new maps (drawn by Shelly Shapiro) bother you, I would suggest that you prowl through a local used bookstore and pick up an older copy of the trilogy, preferably the beautifully done Ballantine paperbacks of the early-to-mid 1980's. In addition to much better maps, the cover art on those books is beautiful. The one-volume red hardback version is also very nice, and you should be able to find a nice copy of it new.Books like the Harry Potter series are OK. They are light and enjoyable reading, but 100 years from now, they will be forgotten. Not The Lord of the Rings. It's a major classic of English literature, and it is THE classic of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can I say that has not already been said? (except in the bad reviews) Tolkien has changed my perspective on life. I may be an evangelical Christian (Tolkien was Catholic) but I find his books full of great Christian insights. And besides that, his books are AMAZING.The descriptions: full, deep, beautiful. Rich with variety, color, and realism. I stand on the rocky crags of the Emyn Muil. I hear the ever-changing music of the Falls of Nimrodel. I see the breathtaking majesty of Minas Tirith. And I shudder under the menacing glare of the Dark Tower of Mordor. I have read this book countless times, and I am still moved by it.The characters: Rich, touching, real. I cry for Frodo and empathize with Sam. I cheer on Gandalf when he rides on the Pellennor Fields. I gasp as Eowyn removes her helmet, revealing her identity and defieing the Nazgul. I laugh at Butterbur puzzling over the thought of Strider as a King. Even the secondary characters seem to have lives and histories of their own. These are people I know.Last, the plot: Oh-h-h-h. &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; still scares me half to death. &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot; makes me want to slap that evil wizard. &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; still takes my breath away.I swear: Tolkien did not make this up. Tolkien has been to Middle Earth. This book rates second on my list of Books of the Millennia (with the Bible as #1!)If you have not read it, read it! If you have, read it again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In his introduction to The Fellowship of the Ring, J.R.R. Tolkien writes that the story he began in The Hobbit &#34;grew in the telling&#34; as it metamorphosed into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I've found that The Fellowship of the Ring grows in depth and breadth each time I read it. I must confess that, after seeing Peter Jackson's movies of The Lord of the Rings, I needed to take a break from reading to let Jackson's images clear out. Having done that, my recent re-reading of The Fellowship of the Ring has been a wonderful experience. Tolkien's story is so much more complex than Jackson, and maybe simply than film, is able to convey.

It had a lot of the same charecters and some new ones the main charecter was Frodo. They treavled far to destroy the ring Biblo found in the HOBBIT. To read this book I strongly suggest to read the Hobbit first. This book was very good and carried on well from the HOBBIT, but really dragged on in details. The Hobbit had a lot more action in it but the Fellowship of the Ring is explained better. I still liked the Fellowship of the Ring; it is a good book and is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I know that I will probably go to hell for saying this, but I do not understand why Tolkien remains so popular.Don't get me wrong, I can not deny the man's intelligence nor the work he put into his stories. However, the fact is, if Tolkien were to publish his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series today, it would undoubtedly flop.His plot is cliche. Yes, I know that it is the protype for most fantasy books today, and in his day it may have been original-- but not now. His characters are flat. People rave about Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Strider, but can they compare to the type of characters we demand from modern authors who show us every characteristic quirk, gesture, opinion, thought and history of their personalities-- and at the same time not telling or showing us too much? Tolkien also packs his stories with details that modern authors could not get away with today. You think Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind could tell a story and describe every tree, fern, hill, rock, road and river and expect their books to still be popular? No. Not anymore.It took me forever to read this book. I found it slow and often boring, but I read it because this was Tolkien-- the master. I believe that many writers feel the way I do, but are afraid to express their feelings for fear of being shunned for blasphemy. I have respect for Tolkien's stories and it is true that he is the father of modern fantasy, but his style is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Writing Quality: 6/10.Tolkien is a capable writer, but not a great one. He periodically injects humor into the tale, but it is sometimes inconsistent, and rarely truly witty, as opposed to what someone like T. H. White does in The Once and Future King. There is an intriguing, archaic storytelling quality to his stories, a product of his respected academic work with such early works as Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It's consistent, and immersing. But the real draw of Tolkien's work, in my opinion, has less to do with his prose, and more to do with his storytelling, which is something more difficult to define, but has more to do with ideas and less with artistic craft. His descriptions sometimes feel like they bog the story down, and even his most-quoted and well-loved lines -- \\"Not all who wander are lost\\" and \\"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us\\" -- are not the creations of a wordsmith, but simple philosophical aphorisms that have been made memorable by a memorable story.Depth of Concept: 8/10.Tolkien himself chafed at the idea that his tales would be picked apart in classrooms, and he very much resisted the idea that they were allegorical. It's just a story, he would say, just enjoy it in whatever way works for you. But Tolkien, as an academic, was also steeped in allegory and myth creation, in studies of hero journeys and tragic flaws. What Tolkien really means is that The Lord of the Rings is not merely allegory, not merely something to dissect and explain. Instead, he also hopes for it to touch something more primitive and inexpressible in the psyche, something that can elicit visceral and emotional responses without having to be deconstructed. It certainly has proven to do that, but as such a rich work of mythopoeia, the multiple interpretive meanings available in the story are also very rich.Rounded Characters: 6/10.This is a tough one to score. On one hand, many of the characters are very flat, undergo very little change, or have very little ambiguity in their personalities. Aragorn, for example, is a pretty one-dimensional hero figure, albeit a cool one. But the depth of his character is perhaps a \\"3.\\" The development of loyalty and friendship in Sam is perhaps a little more rounded. But the reason I scored Tolkien as high as a 6 here, was because of Gollum's developmental process through the novels, which I think was highlighted well in the Peter Jackson movies. If there is an interesting story of redemption in all of Tolkien's work, Gollum is it. For him, I'd rate something around an 8 or 9, balancing out many of the other less-developed characters.Well-Developed World: 10/10.Of course, this is where Tolkien has to score the highest. His world-building isn't as existential or all-encompassing as what you can find in Moby Dick or Midnight's Children, but the great care and thoughtful planning of a whole, mostly original mythology is astonishing. It's too bad that so many fantasy writers connected so strongly with Tolkien's truly great accomplishment, and then tried to mimic him in inferior ways. The difference between what Tolkien did and what his imitators (Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, etc.) do is that he truly understood what makes a meaningful, ambiguous, expansive world, one that is more than the sum of its parts and that draws meaningful parallels with other mythologies from around the world. Reading Tolkien's works feels like the real deal, a real body of myth and legend handed down from generation to generation. Tolkien's imitators always seem to focus most on cool characters, exotic lands, and fun magic systems, and present a painfully muddled, and even careless understanding of what makes myth and legend stay pertinent over eons. Tolkien drew from his vast knowledge of Germanic mythology and philology in writing his novels; people like Brooks and Jordan appear to have used only Tolkien's novels as their foundation.Page Turner: 7/10.I debated how to score this category, because I've come to realize that as a kid I must have skimmed and skipped much of The Lord of the Rings in order to get to the \\"good stuff,\\" the battles and adventurous portions. When I go back and read now, it's not so much that the prose feels dense, as that much of it seems unnecessary. It's not hard reading . . . it's just that it often seems to take so long for a character to get from one place to another, without what appears to be sufficient justification. I wouldn't want to merely have the \\"good stuff\\" and none of the rest of Tolkien's rambling explorations, because then I might as well just be reading Brooks' The Sword of Shannara or something. But I wonder what a really aggressive but erudite editor might have done to streamline Tolkien's prose and tighten up his story. Ultimately, the book doesn't feel particularly well-paced, but Tolkien accomplishes such a rich and appealing atmosphere that it can be hard to put it down, even when you wish things would move a little quicker.Kept Me Thinking: 7/10.This wasn't like Moby Dick for me, where there were so many fantastic philosophical concepts running about in my head that I almost felt like I was achieving Burke's sublime. Rather, Tolkien created such a powerful other world that I can't help daydreaming about his world even after putting the book down. It's justifiable to question whether the thinking about Tolkien's Middle-earth is of as high quality as the thinking engendered in me after reading Moby Dick, but there is no doubt that The Fellowship of the Ring stayed in my head long after I turned the final page. And perhaps where that rumination can be particularly useful is asking why it stuck in my head, and dissecting the common human connection with myth. Enter Joseph Campbell and The Hero with a Thousand Faces.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 9/10.You could get by without reading The Lord of the Rings, although it seems silly to willfully ignore something that is so present in the modern psyche, and that is the best example of its kind by which you can judge the mediocrity all around us today, both in literature and in film. It is perhaps most interesting when paired with a thoughtful study of myths in general, but it's also important as one of the defining novels in modern British literature. You don't need to love it, but by understanding it you'll be enriched by a better understanding of culture, mythology, religion, and nationality.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Book Review on Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the RingA Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins found a Ring with magical powers.

I'm just finishing up The Fellowship of the Ring now, and I must admit, I had to skip some parts out of sheer boredom. I love the storyline and the character development, but some of the detail just seems kind of, well, not desperate, but Tolkien seemed determined to make this the longest book ever. I don't think all the descriptions were absolutely necessary for the story, nor were they really enjoyable either.I love everything in, and not in the movie, especially Tom Bombadil, who brings life and happiness to a very dark story. Over all, it is a very, very well written book, but a warning: There are parts you might have to skip, and don't worry, most of them aren't that important to the story.I'd suggest this to any Lord of the Rings fan, absolutely, and also to anyone who loves a great fantasy novel. It's very intriguing and entertaining, and there are many awesome poems and songs, but just be aware that the prologue makes it seem like it won't be a good book. To be honest, I skipped the prologue and still loved the book anyway. I recommend this strategy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Before the well reknowned movies came to being the Lord Of The Rings books were there. The first movie was one of the best movies of all time in an epic trilogy, however it does no justice for the book. This book has more battles and introduces you to the characters way more than the movie does. Although it is lengthy it is well worth it, and you may want to read it again. I recommend this book to all Lord of The Rings fans and all people who like any sort of adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This fantasy is a great book. It's a prefect fit if you want to read about an adventurer. The Lord of the Rings, the series, are my favorite books! It's about a hobbit (who is a human, but smaller then normal). He has this ring that is evil and owned by a magical being who has a army of orcs that are mined from the earth. The hobbit's name is Fredo and he must go to Mount Doom. Mount Doom is a mountain that has such flaming fire that it is the only thing that can destroy the ring. Unfortunately, it is right next to the being, Sauron.

Tolkien, titled the Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Ring is about the forming of the fellowship and the beginning of the quest.The book starts out in a land called middle-earth. In middle-earth, many different creatures live. There is a place in middle-earth, called the Shire. most of the hobbits live in the shire. Frodo, after finding out the truth to his inherited ring, has to begin a journey to a place called Rivendell. Along the way, Frodo and his managiere face many strange foes and meet many new friends. Upon entering Rivendell, an elf by the name of Elrond forms the Fellowship of the Ring. Elrond chooses 9 beings to go on the quest, some Frodo knew and some he didn't. The Fellowship faced many hardships along the way and even lost some of their members.This book was an overall good book. The only things that I didn't like is how there are some really slow parts, for example there would sometimes be 15-25 page long stretches were the book only talks about how the Fellowship is walking. Then there was too many poems and songs. There were also some really interesting added bits to the book. Tolkien gave a history to the peoples of middle-earth and also created several languages."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Two years ago, at the age of eleven, I came across a book known as The Hobbit. A simple book as it was, it became the stepping stone to probably one of the greatest writings of all time. The Hobbit was my favorite book, and two years later, the memory of Middle-earth and all its splendor came to me, again. I decided to pick up The Lord of the Rings, a story much more in depth than The Hobbit, much more dark and mysterious than a simple journey to the East to retrieve a dragon's loot. It tells of an Evil coming over the magical land of Middle-earth, and a simple hobbit's quest to destory the One Ring that could save them all. It is but a simple, unadorned ring, just as this story is a short, simple story, and yet underneath the surface, it is much more than what it seems to be.When you read The Lord of the Rings, you are drawn into the mystical land that J.R.R. Tolkien, a genius way ahead of his time, drew from the imagination of all those who dare to imagine. You will find yourself reading on, flipping the page and wondering what you are about to stumble upon next. It was not at all a rare sight when I would be reading late into the night, with my mother begging me to go to bed, while I would be saying, &quot;One more page, okay?&quot; You will not be able to stop!Tolkien's work is sheer poetry; not &quot;boring&quot; at all. I find myself reading hundreds of pages in only a short amount of time, as anyone who has half of a brain will. So, don't be discouraged by those who say that he is monotonous or that the writing is slow-moving. I don't think so at all. There is much mystery and intrigue in the story; you will end up wondering whether Middle-earth exists or not, for he comes up with such a deep and rich history and so many tales of woe and tragedy, and of valor and hope. This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"One word can describe the writing of Tolkien: excellence. Tolkien has mastered the arts of story telling, language, and writing. Nothing can be said about this book that is not of a positive nature. Tolkien has written a believable story that gives his readers an adventure too incredible for the common man. In some ways, Tolkien gives readers something for which to strive. His characters put themselves at risk to protect the freedom of the land. The characters of the book are what we all desire to be, heroes. These characters serve a higher purpose than self. People long to be heroes and guardians of justice. This book gives readers a sense of satisfaction that can only be felt in the imagination.The Fellowship of the Ring and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest fictional tales ever told. I plan to read all of the books J. R. R. Tolkien. I would recommend a Tolkien book to anybody who is creative and open minded. I would also recommend reading The Hobbit, prelude to the Lord of the Rings, and then moving into the trilogy. These books offer so much to the open-minded reader. Satisfaction, adventure, and an all around incredible story are just a few things Tolkien has given to so many readers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy! It's one of those classics where you can just keep on reading on and on and you don't want to finish. Yes, this book just captivated me with the adventure, suspense, excitement, and humor.&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins (read J.R.R. Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themLost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;. Have &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; on hand.My favorite character has got to be the Elf, Legolas. Elves have always fascinated me, for their mysterious, quiet, and almost immortal ways. I love it also how Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf in this book are sort of unfriendly towards each other since Elves and Dwarves usually do not get along. But towards the end of this book and the rest of the trilogy, they're the greatest of friends and inseparable.Another good character is Pippin the hobbit with his bright and cheerful ways. One of the youngest of the group of hobbits, he is always in a positive mood but somehow manages to get in trouble often.All of the books in the trilogy are must reads. Also the prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, should also be read to understand the events which had happened before the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Though it is written mostly for adults, I'm sure teenagers wil also love it, though younger kids might not be able to understand it. Enjoy, this book will have you fascinated and keep you in total suspense!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I know that I'm in quite a minority, but on re-reading &quot;The Fellowship...&quot; in anticipation for the film, I'm finding it quite dull. (And I'm someone who loved &quot;War and Peace.&quot;) Don't get me wrong: the story of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is fantastic, and Tolkien has my undying admiration for the magical world he has created. But his writing is not -- to me -- particularly interesting. There are far too many topographical passages, along the lines of &quot;Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys.&quot; And then there are the historical passages: &quot;Under [the mountains] lies Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit...Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundudshathur...between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimril Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.&quot; And on and on and on.

Do we need it? Probably not. However, I would like to say that, if you are new to Tolkien's work and are thinking about reading The Lord of the Rings because of the impending movie then I can say that The Fellowship of the Ring is the easiest of the three books to read that make up the trilogy. The film that is to be released in December is this part of the story, with the other 2 films (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) to be made next year and the year after. The Fellowship of the Ring is such a good book to read. It is full of innocence, magic, terror and wonder. Tolkien conjurs this world of loveable Hobbits and ultimate, brooding evil. In this, the first book, you get a real insight into hobbit life and the beginnings of the adventures that Frodo makes to destroy the one ring. The other two books are great, of course, but the story gets more political and I feel they demand much more from the reader, especially The Return of the King. If you want to dabble in a bit of fantasy literature, then you can do no better than this book. I know people go on and on about The Lord of the Rings but there is a reason for that and I feel a newcomer with an open mind to this genre will be even more rewarded when reading these stories than a hardened fantasy buff. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It is quite difficult to review a book which is generally acknowledged as a masterpiece; there is the danger of merely repeating the praises heaped on the book by earlier reviewers, and there is also the difficulty of doing justice to the book's greatness. Fortunately, the release of Peter Jackson's excellent film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" gives me a fresh perspective from which to review J.R.R. Tolkien's novel.If you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book, which you will almost certainly also enjoy, even if in a different way. One of the glories of Jackson's film is its great richness and depth, the feeling it gives the viewer of stepping into an unfamiliar but real world with a long history. The reason Jackson's film is able to produce this effect is that the world in which it takes place had already been created, and imagined in almost unbelievable detail, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Far more even than the movie, Tolkien's book lets the reader share the hobbits' experience of wandering out of their doors into a world with a detailed and believable history, a multitude of different mortal and immortal races with distinct cultures and languages, and a well-defined geography (maps are included in the book). I must place special emphasis on the linguistic depth of Tolkien's world: Tolkien, a distinguished philologist, invented around fifteen languages for the inhabitants of his imaginary world to speak. (The \\"Star Trek\\" Universe, by contrast, contains only one language, Klingon, which has been devised in any detail.)Moreover, as with any cinematic adaptation of a work of literature, Jackson's movie leaves out characters, events and scenes from the book. These elements are waiting in Tolkien's text for fans of the movie to discover them. In particular, the chapters involving a character named Tom Bombadil are among the best parts of the book, although they had to be left out of the movie to keep it down to a reasonable length.Anyone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world. The film's exchange between Frodo and Gandalf in which Frodo wishes the Shadow of evil had not arisen in his time comes directly from the book, which also contains a few other moments that resonate strongly with the current world situation. Tolkien was writing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" during World War II, but he did not intend it as an allegory of that war or of any other specific situation; rather, he hoped that readers would feel free to find his work applicable to any scenario they might see reflected in it.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is, in fact, not a novel, but the first volume of the three-part novel \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie of \\"Fellowship\\" will surely want to read the two subsequent volumes, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King,\\" to find out what happens to the characters without having to wait for the release of the two subsequent movies at Christmas in 2002 and 2003."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'd been a fantasy binge as of late and decided to pick up the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since the movie is due out soon. Why did I wait so long to read this? Actually I can remember starting this book at an earlier time but I got bogged down in the detail. This time through the detail didn't stop me and I screamed through it. Tolkien has woven together a very intricate adventure with characters that are both likable and believable(in the sense that they have flaws as well as attributes) in land that you can easily visualize. When I was finished I ran out right away and purchased the second installment and hope to start it shortly. I would recommend this book to anyone....even if you aren't a fantasy fan, because you soon will be. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is the fact that there were a few sections where the action seemed to slow down, but theses sectoins were short and easy to read through."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"After reading this book, I was surprised to see that so many of the reviews here were written by young people. Naturally fantasy tends to be very popular with young adults (it was with me), but Tolkien's work seems to transcend demographics. This is not a book for escapists nor for those who prefer a reality that is in opposition to our own. This is a book for those who desire to understand reality and look for magic in the process of discovery. Tolkien uses human traits and physical realities to create a world of complicated and mysterious morality - a world where a wizard Gandalf the Grey is somehow more pure than his colleague, Saruman the White.People are rarely what they appear to be and neither are hobbits. Frodo Baggins, the protagonist hobbit, is the ring bearer. He like many human heros in other books carries an unasked and heavy burden. He does not carry it with a saint's gracious self-immolation, but rather with a determination to do what he thinks is right for himself and those who depend on him. Like anyone in a situation like this, he desires to cast his burden off, but gathers the courage to continue. The admirable thing about Tolkien is that Frodo does not make these decisions based on some blind fervor for an unattainable ideal, but rather through a series of inductive steps. In this way Frodo transforms the ideal of saintliness into syllogism.Frodo would prefer to kick back with a pint of ale beneath a tree, but he doesn't. Through logic and reason, he determines that unless he begins his perilous journey and defeats the great evil spreading across the land, neither he nor anyone else will ever be able to see simple joy again.It is a story about magic of course, but the magic serves as an ideal that the realists strive to protect, not worship. They are rooted in reality, as is this tale. All fantasy writers since Tolkien owe a great deal to the style and imagination of this writer, but the greatest gift he gave them was the gift of realist fantasy. Rest assured that Tolkien is not simply the progenitor of a generation of better writers. He is a master among masters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I guess a little over two years ago I saw the Fellowship movie, and I was blown away and went out the next day to buy the boxed set...I mean, if the movie was that good, the book must be ten times better right? WRONG! The Hobbit was pretty decent; I finished that in a few days. Then I started Fellowship. After 150 pages I couldn't take it anymore! I put it back in the box and forgot about it. I made a second attempt a year later, but only made it to page 50. I am now on my third attempt and I am GOING to finish it this time because it's driving me MAD.Now, it's not that it's not a good story. I respect Tolkien for his imagination and creativity. You can tell that he put his whole soul into this book and you can't bash someone's soul (reason for the 3 stars...), but clearly, not everybody's souls match up, so to speak. Personally, I like to feel a certain degree of empathy for characters in a story. I don't care how many leaves the 52nd tree to the north has, but I would like care about the characters. This book leaves you identifying more with topography and three page long descriptions of sunsets and such than with the characters. And I don't understand what the deal with the songs are. I hope they aren't that important because I just skip them. Derry dol, Merry dol, who cares? Jeez.Obviously, there are people who like this book, and if you're the type of person who likes to be given vast descriptions of things for the neurons in your brain to construct, then you should get this. Maybe you will even feel something for the characters. Everyone's different, otherwise this book would be as beloved as it is. If you would rather read something that moves you and stirs empathy, then go for something else.I haven't said anything new, but I need to suggestion this: I made assumptions and wasted $30 on a boxed set that I will probably never finish. PLEASE don't buy the boxed set! Just buy the first book to see if you like it, and then if you don't, you won't feel OBLIGED to read them like I do. (I guess I just have OCD or something. LOL I feel like I can't buy any other books til I read these.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo Baggins was a simple Hobbit with a normal life, until he was chosen to be the heir of Bilbo, a Hobbit with a long history, and inherits an evil ring that will send him on a quest that was started long ago. On his quest he faces many dangers and meets many friends that accompany him, including an old wizard named Gandalf who seems to have started the whole quest; Sam and Merry, two Hobbits with very little taste for adventure; Strider, a Ranger with an Elven lineage, and many more people whom he befriends. During the entire journey he travels out of the boundaries of his home, the Shire, and ends up in cursed forests, abondoned Orc camps, great Dwarven and Elven cities, and a dark kingdom where he must destroy the ring which could give the dark prince the power to bring all the other rings of power together and rule Middle-Earth, destroying all good with in it.This book is for only the most serious fantasy and adventure fans because you must understand a lot about fantasies, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and Wizards. This book is the first in a three-part story that will leave you wanting to know what the author has in store for our heroes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I had read dozens of fantasy books as a young adult, but never read the one that started it all, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; With the movies coming out and the prodding of my father (who can't get enough of Tolkien), I decided to delve into Middle-Earth.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The characters are fairly one-dimensional, the story is not all that interesting, and nothing happens as a result of the main characters. The fellowship moves along on their quest, but don't seem to do anything.The book's strength lies in the encompassing nature of the world that Tolkien has created. A long history of all the denziens of Middle Earth exists and you get the feeling that Tolkien may be more interested in the past of his world than the current story of Frodo and the Ring. The number of races (elves, hobbits, orcs), their interrelations, and their place is all of interest, but not enough to keep me interested in Frodo's dull quest in which he takes no action.Because the book ends without resolution, I will continue to read the trilogy and hope that Frodo becomes a more active character as he seems to try to become in the last chapter of the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As a self-professed nerd I wanted tot love this. I read The Hobbitt about 20 years ago and remember really rnjoying it. I expected more of the same here as I finally got around to Lord Of The Rings. What I got however was sadly a little boring, very tedious, and wordy to the point of confusion. Tolkien certainly has created one of the most amazingly thorough fantasy world. However, his writing style is so verbose that by the time he explains whose talking to whom you can't remeber what's being talked about. The actual novel could've been a quarter of the size and probably more enjoyable. I haven't given up on the entrire series but it'll be awhile before I feel the itch to read Two Towers. :("},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"this was a pretty good book, personally, i liked the movie better, but it did have a pretty interesting plot when you get passed the details, which are really boring in the way that it spent 2 pages explaining everywhere they went. It is an amazing journey that gets some hobbits and men and some mythical creatures in mortal trouble, and JRR tolkein did do a good job writing out the fight scenes so you could tell what was happening, it actually was exiting to read.Im not going to try to explain the whole plot, because there are so many parts to it that I would be typing all day, but I will say that a bunch of different creatures are on a quest to destroy the ultimate evil. For people who like fantasy and action this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I must say that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. As far as I can tell because I've just read the first book which is called \\"The Ring Hikes\\" or something like that. But I must also give a little word of advice, if you really want to read it then you should first read \\"The Hobbit\\" because there the story is told how Bilbo Beutlin, one of a big hobbit family, gets the ring in the first place. So the whole story is about wizards, hobbits, who are like humans only a little smaller and fatter. Then there are elves and black knights. And naturally the ring plays an important role, because there are also other rings around but only one is able to rule them all and he was created by the dark ruler of the land of Mordor, which tries to conquer the world. So if you're interested in an interesting and magical fairytale which you can only hardly put aside you should really read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Please don't get mad at me people, because yes I am only fifteen. I attempted to read this book because last year we had read the Hobbit in 8th grade, and I was one of the few who actually liked the book. I have loved the movies for years, but for the first time i found myself holding the Fellowship of the Ring, ready to dive into it. Right off the bat, I was a little taken aback by the long prologue, which wasn't really a prologue at all but more like a history of Middle Earth. I don't see why this was really needed when they tell you about it later in the book..OK moving on. Once the story started moving i was good and enjoyed it then...ughhh we got to the four chapters of them in the forest, and Tolkien describes the trees, the sun, the moon, the stars, basically everything, and then Tom Bombadil comes in and his part in the story is in one word, boring. I couldn't wait to be done with his chapter. I mean how much can someone possibly want to know about mushrooms. After that part, it was very enjoyable..all the way up to the Council of Elrond. I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PART! This part is so amazingly boring, that it is because of this that I have put the book down, and am not ready to pick it up again soon. Now if someone will tell me one good reason why I should continue on reading, I will take their reason into consideration. But, if the three books continue on like the first one has, then I probably won't continue reading them.

Tolkien's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, the 20th century's most important epic fantasy and a perennial for all ages. It presents a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he discovers that a family heirloom is actually a magic ring devised and then lost by a Dark Lord, and then sets off to destroy the ring before it can be seized back. Frodo and his company pass through many parts of Tolkien world of Middle-Earth, filled with many races of mythical beings.There are several ways to approach the work, and for myself the most fulfilling has been from a philological perspective. Tolkien was enamoured with languages of all kinds, and over the course of his life he created many, giving special attention and care to two, Quenya and Sindarin. These two constructed languages are loved by many fans of linguistics, and it is precisely in FELLOWSHIP that we have the most important example of mature Quenya. There are also several important snippets of Sindarin here, especially among place-names.Approaching the work as just good literature will be disappointing, however. Tolkien, a specialist on Anglo-Saxon, tended to write mostly in a faux-archaic style reminiscent of BEOWULF or &quot;The Battle at Maldon&quot;. This tone, outdated and overly simplistic, will soon annoy the reader. Fitting in with the style, cliches and repetition abound. How many times must the reader be told Aragon suddenly seems not ragged anymore, but kingly and proud? Also, there are no narrative illusions here; the plot moves as it is overtly presented. If you like untrustworthy narrators, and thin and nebulous accounts where the reader must carefully fill in the blanks, as is common with such writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Gene Wolfe, Tolkien will seem infantile to you.I do recommend reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and even moving on the all of the Lord of the Rings. If you are fond of language, then it will be a fulfilling and eye-opening work. If you are just looking for fine literature to enjoy, however, then it would probably be best to read something by an author with a more modern tone and better academic reception."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The one that started it all! Join Bilbo Baggins as his wish for adventure binds all of Hobbylta to a quest to save Middle Earth. Tolkien created a world all his own that invites the reader to stay just a bit longer.

In fact, I almost abandoned it a few times before I was over the 300th page. The story is very slow going, though the fact that the details sort of put up to it, though I still have no idea of why the 50 pages of mentioning about hobbit's names and family which has almost nothing to do with the plot. I can name a few books that balance the story very well, so that it keeps excite you up and down through out the story and not bored you to death(ie. foreverwar, hyperion, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy).There are also many poems(songs in the story) through out the novel, which make no sense to me and seem to have to do nothing with the plot. Maybe because I simply don't understand poems, but that's just my opinion, no one is good in everything. Sometimes after half of the book(around 350th page), though, the story really picks up, and you start to feel as a part of the journey.The end cuts off as if you're only went through 1/4 of the story, which gives me hope(also make me feel stupid that I went through 500 pages for this) that the other two books would be good since the beginning as less background has to be told. In general, the plot is very good. However, I don't really like the idea of a big gap between good and evil, though that's not the case for the main character(if you know the story around Warhammer 40k, you would know what I mean.....everything has an evil-side in it). On the course of adventure, the main character would either meet good people OR bad people.......Anyways, it's a great book if you can pass through 300 pages of snail-moving story. For me, the fact that 1/3 of it is pretty good, I will give it a 3 stars though I've heard a lot of good things about this trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a good book(just not great) and I'm looking forward for the other two(and hope that they won't put me to sleep as the first)."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings- Read it, enjoy it.

The only thing that I really dislike about Tolkien's world is the elves. They strike me as silly and unmotivated, and even though they have infinite wisdom and strength they send in a bunch of untrained hobbits to do the dirty work of getting rid of the ring.

This book helps indicate why.The Lord of the Rings was intended to be a single story, not a trilogy, so this volume is not a stand-alone novel. Instead, it is the first two of six \\"books\\" into which Tolkien has divided his work. Book one introduces the principal characters of Frodo, Sam and Aragorn and reintroduces (from the Hobbit) Gandalf and Bilbo. It also outlines the dangers of the One Ring and the evil forces out to retrieve it. The second book deals with the adventures of the fellowship in the title as they set off on a quest to destroy the ring.Unlike the Hobbit, this is a work aimed towards adults. Tolkien does a wonderful job in telling his story and is unsurpassed in creating a setting that is rich in detail and history. As fantasy, or just storytelling in general, this is top-of-the-line stuff."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is a long review for a long book and yet there has so much more I have wanted to say that I could not due to limitations of space.The first part of the famous epic of The Lord Of The Rings , The Fellowship Of The Ring begins in the tranquil , rural setting of the Shire .It is from here that we get our first view of Middle Earth with the preparations for the 111 th birthday party of Bilbo Baggins (the hero of the children's classic The Hobbit ) . We are introduced to the many relatives of Bilbo and of course the hero of LOTR , Frodo Baggins (Bilbo's favourite nephew ) and his faithful gardener Sam Gamgee as well as his two favourite cousins Peregrine (Pippin ) Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck.It is after Bilbo's carefully planned disappearance and during visit from the Wizard Gandalf that we are introduced to the horrible threat to Middle Earth involving the Dark Lord , the enemy , Sauron and the Ring of Power which was introduced as a minor theme in The Hobbit and has been inherited by Frodo .Frodo sets out on the grand adventure with Sam,Pippin and Merry and it is in the Shire itself where the Hobbits encounter the absolute evil of the Black Riders (Ringwraiths) and the magic and beauty of the Elves . Throughout the novel they go from one diabolical danger to another , but are relieved by their stay in certain havens where the dangers and darkness of Middle Earth are kept at bay - The House of Tom Bomabadil and the Elven Kingdoms of Rivendell and Lothlorien. Together with their companions Gandalf , Aragorn the mysterious ranger (and heir to the ancient Kingdom of Numenor ) , the young warrior from Gondor , Boramir , the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli we are introduced to the scope of Middle Earth from the beautiful to the diabolical , from the homely to the mysterious , from the noble to the villainous . We also see the brilliance of Tolkien as a poet as we are introduced to a variety of Poems and Songs recited by different characters.Tolkien stressed that LOTR was in no way meant to be an allegory and was not meant to parallel any events taking place during the time , in this case the Second World War.Instead he says he approves of applicability which he distinguished from allegory by writing that the one refers to the ' freedom of the reader and the other in the proposed domination of the author ' . Thus while we must always bear in mind that LOTR is in now way an allegory we are free to draw our own analogies and parallels with events in our world .The Lord Of the Rings was published in 1954/55 .At the time there where many similarities between our world and Middle Earth . The world was divided into the Free World (as was Middle Earth ) which was engaged in a titanic battle with the Communist World and its surrogate Revolutionary Movements which aimed to destroy the way of life of Middle America and Middle England (which was mirrored in The Shire of Middle Earth ) . It aimed to destroy our Judeo-Christian heritage and all that we knew as right and good (as Mordor aimed to destroy everything noble and beautiful on Middle Earth ) through the use of terror and their disdain for what they saw as 'bourgeois ' mirrors the scorn expressed by Saruman ( in his meeting at Isengard with Gandlaf described in Chapter 11: The Council of Elrond ) for the values of old , and replace it with a system of total power and enslavement . Therefore it is hardly difficult to draw a parallel between Mordor and the old Soviet Union ( or during World War II Hitler's Third Reich ) , between the Orcs , Trolls and even fouler things infesting Middle Earth during Frodo's journey and the Revolutionary regimes and movements around the world at the time of The Cold War held in thrall by Moscow or Peking such as Nasser's Egypt , Castro's Cuba , the Viet Cong and Gadaffi's Libya .As Robert Foster , who has made detailed studies of Tolkines works and written various volumes on the topic once said : ' I remember at a Tolkien conference watching a Polish woman reach out to shake [daughter] Priscilla Tolkien's hand , This was in the dark days before Communism fell, and she said, 'You have no idea what your father's books have meant to us. They kept us believing that the Orcs would not always win.'\\"The Lord of the Rings is the story of a long and difficult battle against great evil, taken on by the humblest,\\" he continued\\".Indeed LOTR encapsulates all that great values of Western Civilisation - Freedom ,faith , the importance of the individual and the heroism of the common man .We can take faith again from LOTR as in the words of writer JP Zmirak '' A SHADOWY, evil overlord hides himself amid an unmapped mountain range. There he wields absolute power over fanatics and slaves, scheming for domination over the free peoples of the world. He sends forth assassins into peaceful lands and cities, spreading terror among civilians\\" : which refers to the network of terror supported by Radical Islam and Revolutionary Movements today which once more aims to , through an evil theology , spread terror to the innocent (whether in New York , Antwerp , Geneva or Jerusalem ) in order to destroy Western Democracy and our Judeo-Christian civilisation . Once more we need the faith of Tolkiens World to know that the forces of evil , no matter what the odds , will not win."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Four words: I love this book. The way it is constructed and the way it is so in-depth and visual just blows my mind. This book should be required reading for high school. It is the epitome of great English literature.I read this book over the spring of 2001 in anticipation of the movie which was to come later that year. The movie stood true to the book, but I was dissapointed that they left key points out, especially out of the first half. I love Tom Bombadil.Tolkien created this world which reflected our own but was totally his. It took him years to make this book and the effort shows. You NEVER at any point in the book get bored of it. The people and cultures of Middle-Earth enthrall you.The story is about a ring. A ring that once belonged to an evil king. It gave him power beyond imagination, and he used it to rule Middle-Earth. The dark lord was defeated in a brutal war, but the ring wasn't and the spirit of him still lived on.The ring somehow finds it's way to a Hobbit named Frodo. Hobbits are halflings with hairy feet and habit of smoking tobacco. They are the most peaceful race of Middle-Earth. Once he finds out that this ring is evil, and that it is his job to destroy it, he flips out, but he does it anyway. He takes three of his hobbit friends along and have adventures and meet cool people.In the second half of the book, a fellowship is formed between the four main races of Middle-Earth. The Elves, the Dwarves, the Humans, and the Hobbits. The job of the fellowship is to destroy the ring by taking it and throwing it into the cracks of Mt. Doom where it was forged. Frodo is the Ring bearer of the fellowship, the one who carries the burden of the ring, which means that he is most vulnerable to it's wicked powers.Some people say it's a social commentary but I can't really tell besides the fact of the Elves and the Dwarves as peoples hating each other, and the fact that two members of the fellowship, Legolas and Gimli make a bond which comparable to brotherhood. The Fellowship in my opinion is everyone working together in peace despite our differences.This is one of the best books ever written and I give the biggest five stars it can possibly get."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was great and had alot more too it then the movie but the movie was more concise and to the point which was good. Too many songs that get really annoying around page 130 when Tom Bombadil rescues them. After they get past that part the books action increases and you don't wan't to stop reading until they rest which happens alot in this book and its a good thing or else I would have read the book straight through until the end and wouldn't have savoured the flavor so to speek."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkiens Fellowship of the Ring is the best book I have ever read. It may be long, but once you finish a chapter you want to read the next. This story has a lot of adventure and great detail. It's about a Hobbit named Frodo. A Hobbit is a very short person who lives for a long time. Frodo gets a powerful ring that he needs to destroy. The ring can maked Frodo vanish in thin air. The reason Frodo wants to destroy the ring is because the Dark Lord wants to use its power for evil. Frodo goes on an adventure with his friends Merry, Pippen, and Sam. During the book new characters appear in each chapter. They pass through towns,villages, and end up fighting Lords, monsters, and the Dark Lords warriors. This is a really good book. If u like books with adventures read Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an exhilarating and well written book by J.R.R. Tolkien. That is probably why they made it into a movie too. I chose this book because I have been hearing that it is simply great. My brother also has read it and gave me the whole series to read myself. I have read the book titled The Hobbit which leads up to this trilogy, and it was just exciting to read. That was one of the reasons I have chosen to continue and read this author's books.Another is that there are new pictures from the movie which were put on to the covers. I felt I should at least give this novel a try after what I have been seeing and hearing about it.I believe that Frodo is the main character over the whole book. Not just because he is on the front cover, but because he is the key to destruction or peace. Even though there are other main characters that accompany Trodo or stir up trouble, it surrounds Frodo since he holds the one thing that could bring evil upon everything.Frodo is the adopted son of Bilbo, the main character in The Hobit. He has inherited Bilbo's wealth for he had an adventure which gave him treasure in the end. Anyway, Frodo has many good attributes like being friendly and being moral. Through that he has made many friends as well as enemies.It starts when Frodo was given the ring from bilbo.The ring that Sauron once made to control and destroy all. Now Frodo, and his hobbit companions go to Rivendell to escape the Ringwraiths that were after the ring. If Sauron got hold of the ring, he would destroy all that was good. That is why nine travelers were chosen to accompany the hobbits and destroy it in Mordor at Mount Doom. Later, the fellowship gets broken by armies of orcs, but Frodo and his loyal companion move on."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an exhilarating and well written book by J.R.R.

It was better than the movie because of its depth in everything. I saw the movie first and after seeing it I decided that I had to read the trilogy. The book went into greater detail with many of the events and it helped explain why some things were the way they were in the movie. There were a few flaws to the book however. First its length, the book is approximately 450 pages long and it can take a while to read. Second, it can become very hard to remember all the names and places which the book is heavy on. What I thought was weird when comparing the movie and the book was how a part of the book that would take 2-3 chapters, might have only taken 5-10 minutes in the movie. Where as with the action parts the movie might take 20 minutes whenever the book only covers it for a couple of pages. Overall the book is definitely worth reading even if you have seen the movie. My only suggestion would be that you go and read the \\"Hobbit\\" first, because it contains some background information that would help out quite a bit and also because it is a great book in its own right."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A while back I read the Hobbit, one of those stay-up-late books because you can't put it down. Well, of course, then I had to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I was rather disappointed at the time and never finished it. A month or two ago I decided to give it another try in anticipation of the movie. This time I did finish it, but I can understand why I never did the first time.First of all, Tolkien is a exceptional writer. He weaves a fantasy world of elves, demons, and magic full of color and life. His style, concepts, and general quest-type plot have become a much copied model for fantasy writing.However, his style is rather long winded. Although his writing is clear, sometimes I would get really tired of page after page of what the forest looked like. Sometimes I'd scan ahead and skip pages. Some of my friends, it turned out, admitted they did the same. Every once in a while it'd be problematic because I'd miss some detail and have to go back to pick up on it later. I can understand why I didn't have the patience at 12 years old to finish the book.Think of a bard, sitting by the fire with a circle of children around him. His story is good, but as he must last the entire night, he adds detailed descriptions of everything. Some of the kinderlings fall asleep. But everybody does come back for more tomorrow.

I enjoyed how Tolkien gave vivid descriptoins of every character and every thing, from the most important cahracter to the least eventful setting. I thought the general plot was original and exciting. At some points I had to force myself to put it down and go to sleep. I really enjoyed how Tolkien makes you wonder what happens at the end of the series and leaves you wanting more.In my personal opinion, the best part of the book is when Frodo Baggins, the main character, and his companions Sam, Merry, Pippen, and Strider are being persued by the Ringwraiths, evil servants of Sauron. The whole first half of the book they are fleeing to Rivindell and wondering what became of the wizard, Gandalf.I enjoyed the conflict of good versus evil that went on throughout the book. All the way from the Shire and and into the next book in the series. The journey of Frodo is filled with peril, from the Orcs of Mordor down to the slinking menace, Gollum, who stalks Frodo for &quot;his Precious&quot;. The resolution of the book leaves you wondering what will happen inthe next book. All I'll say, not to give away the ending, that the Fellowship is broken and each remnant will play theri own part in the second book in this epic trilogy, The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is put under the genre 'fantasy' but it not only owns that it also rules 'sci-fi', 'adventure' 'action', and 'suspense'!

When I read this book I felt as if I was Frodo's companian and I felt strongly for the fellowship like when they felt sad I felt sad, they felt scared I was scared, etc., and I think he felt that when he wrote it, I'm never gonna know but I'll definitely beleive! His beggining was excellent it was commical and proved hobbits my be small outside but they're quite, quite I say the opposite on the inside.It is about a hobbit who inherits the deceiving Ring of Bilbo's (found in'The Hobbit')and is not at all aware that it contains more evil than 1,000,000 orcs put ta' together he doesn't realize that Saraun will do anything to get a hold of it and if he does well we don't wanna go there... but we might have to..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books. The language in which Tolkien brings his message is beautiful. He truly makes the world of Middle-earth come to life. While some things may be confusing for first time readers of the Lord of the Rings, such as names and places, I would recommend it to fans and non-fans alike.I was not a fan of the Lord of the Rings until about a month ago. Before that, I thought the whole series was boring and stupid (thanks to the cartoon which defiles the books). Do not let such prejudices hold you back from experiencing this adventure. I suggest you buy it and find yourself in a whole new world!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When J.R.R. Tolkien sat down to write these books, I doubt that he knew how great they really would be. When reading The Lord of the Rings, you are forced to escape into Middle-Earth for however long you wish to stay there. Unlike other fantasy tales that just don't seem real, this is oftentimes creepy in how it makes you forget where you are. It's almost as if you are the tenth member of the Company.I won't go into any detail about the plot, considering the success of tbe book and the recent movie, it's already a given. But I felt that I needed to say just this one thing:Our world is frightening, stressful and sometimes a bore. However, with Tolkien, you forget where you are and are part of something else, something amazing. 'The Lord of the Rings' is probably the best fiction story of all time. Though not my favorite book, I now understand why it is loved worldwide and why the tale of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins will never die.A rare gem amongst oftentimes disappointing works."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring leaves of where The Hobbit ends. This book is where the real adventure really starts. This book is magic. I can't describe in words how much I love the Elves, the forest of Lothlorien, and especially Galadriel. You feel refreshed by just reading the descriptions! Tolkien is awesome!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Along with it's other parts, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, The Fellowship of the Rings makes up the greatest trilogy of books ever written. Tolkien has a style which gives life to his characters in such a way that the book feels less like fantasy and more like historical fiction. His descriptions are vivid and his setting is epic - both of which create an increbible book which I have read many times in my life. The Fellowship of the Ring is, of course, where anyone new to the books should begin. It lays out the quest and cast of characters for the entire trilogy as well as providing a daring &quot;chase&quot; story. I doubt that anyone who picks up this book will find it less than entertaining, and for a great many I am sure it will become a well-read favorite!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the best work of J.R.R.

If you've read the Hobbit, my god, read the Lord of the Rings series! I guarantee that these books are going to be some of the best you've ever read and/or your favorites! Even if you don't care about fantasy, like me (i'm more of the sci-fi type), read them anyway.The first book, the Fellowship of the Ring, was my favorite of the three. All the action is well timed, and the book provides plenty of cliff-hangers...not to mention the ones in-between the books! All the nine characters (after the fellowship is formed), are so very different and interesting, and I loved how they brought back one of the old dwarves.Basically the whole idea of the books is that Bilbo Baggins, a small kind of man called a hobbit, passes down Gollum's Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, in hopes that he might take it to be destroyed. Bilbo is 111 years old now, and doesn't feel he is up to the task. Gandalf and three other hobbits will accompany him- Merry, Samwise, and Pippin. Merry and Pippin provide comic relief for a while, until they meet Strider, and become pursued by the Ring Wraiths. They are now on a journey to meet the wise Elven King and Queen, who will brief them on their mission, as well as provide others to help them in their quest. The first book takes them through about half of their journey in the lands, while the second will be the other half. The last book takes place in Mordor...their ultimate destination, where Mt Doom is and where salvation from the Dark Lord Sauron."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fantasy focusing on a hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the favorite nephew of his Uncle Bilbo Baggins, the legendary hobbit who set foot upon the most storied journey of all hobbit folklore. Bilbo's story is told in The Hobbit, which is considered the prelude to this trilogy. Near the end of Bilbo's travels he came upon the most powerful ring in all of the land, known as the Ring of Power. Being Bilbo's favorite relative, Frodo inherited the Ring, among various other items, when Bilbo decided to \\"retire\\" and move to a different land after his 111th birthday. Frodo had known of the Ring through stories relayed by Bilbo, however he learned all that was to be known of the Ring from the mighty wizard, Gandalf the Grey. What Frodo discovered was that very little was known of the One and that its mystery was only exceeded by its power. Gandalf told of the very evil implications about the Ring and that the dark Sauron was in pursuit of the One. Frodo must set foot on a journey to dispose of the Ring in the only place which it can be destroyed at the very center of Sauron's evil kingdom in Mordor atop Mt. Doom. Frodo is joined initially by his faithful servant, Sam, along with Gandalf. Along the travels, the crew encounters several new characters and conquests, both advantageous and perilous and is continuously having new light shone on the mystery of the Ring and the true meanings of the journey. This book is the classic story of Good versus Evil. This book is a must-read to a fan of anything adventurous, classical, magical, mythological, or fantastical. The one aspect that really sets this book apart from the pack is Tolkien's excellent language and diction. His language is very descriptive, yet to-the-point. The reader can see what is happening without actually viewing the actions. Tolkien's language is very poetic and would be better served had the book been printed in calligraphy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy will hit the big screen in successive Christmases starting in 2001 with The Fellowship of the Ring. However, this story is sure to be far better using one's own imagination rather than the impressions of someone else. Read the book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My old review: I tried to read this book. But it was just too boring.

Im glad I did, I feel that most avid readers should at least give the fellowship of the ring a try, it may not be for everyone but once you get into the world of Tolkien it is very hard to let go. I felt that I lived inside the book and I never wanted to leave. I have started The Two Towers (Part 2 of the lord of the rings) and it is even better. I dont know what I will do when I am finished the third book I dont think I will ever want the journey to end.

My three favorite book series are all fantasy- The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Prydain Chronicles. The Lord of the rings is an amazing saga of good and evil. Harry Potter is a great lighthearted and witty mystery series set in a 'modern' wizard school. The Prydain Chronicles (the best books ever written) use wisdom, ideals, attitudes, and witty dialogue while at the same time completely but perfectly believably changing the main character from reckless boy to wise man as he discovers the truth about himself and being a hero. No one is the same as the others. Never, ever, say that Harry Potter is Tolkeinesque again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Beginning where the Hobbit left off, The Fellowship of the Ring begins the Lord of the Rings adventure by having the true nature of Gollum's ring revealed.

On a few occassions I told myself that I had to read these books, since I knew that they were known as the best fantasy books ever. I started &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on a few occasions but never could get past the first chapter because it starts quite slow. However, once you get into that book you will not be able to put it down. The same is true for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first book of the trilogy. I would suggest reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first so that you know the background. This book is the greatest book that I have ever read, and I feel quite confident that the next installment (I just started it) will be even better. This book is simply amazing. If you like fantasy or you are a Star Wars fan or you just like to be inspired, this is the book for you. This book takes you into a dream world, yet the world is not unlike the world we know.

Once again, the theory of &quot;the book is always better than the movie&quot; is proven true."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Those unfamiliar with J. R. R. Tolkien's book or have seen only Peter Jackson's splendid cinematic adaptation, may not realize that &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is part one of a nearly fifteen hundred page novel which was divided into three parts by Tolkien's English publisher, Allen and Unwin in the mid 1950's. The entire saga should be seen best as a very long novel, with each volume representing a third of the saga. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; we are introduced to Frodo Baggins, his servant Samwise Gamgee, and his friends and cousins Meriadoc &quot;Merry&quot; Brandybuck and Perigrin &quot;Pippin&quot; Took, hobbits of the Shire, an obscure corner of the land of Middle Earth, located in the former realm of Arnor. In stark contrast to Peter Jackson's film, Frodo Baggins is depicted as a mature scholar familiar with Elvish lore; a younger, more dynamic version of his uncle Bilbo Baggins, whose most important adventure was recounted in Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. His cousin Merry is also portrayed as a wiser, more thoughtful person than he is seen initially in Jackson's film. And Gandalf, their wizard friend, comes across as a bit more reckless than he is portrayed in the film by actor Ian McKellen.After celebrating his 111th birthday, Bilbo Baggins disappears in front of an astonished crowd of family, friends and neighbors in Hobbiton. His old friend Gandalf persuades Bilbo to give up the magic ring responsible for his disappearance, which he leaves to his nephew and heir Frodo. Years pass before Gandalf returns with some ill news regarding the ring. It is the One ring, the all powerful ring forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron; the ultimate weapon for seizing control of Middle Earth and plunging it into darkness. Over a thousand years before Frodo's time, at the end of the Second Age, a last alliance of men and elves fight Sauron in the land of Mordor; their victory is assured only when the ring is cut off from Sauron's hand. Isildur, son of the slain king Elendil, cuts the ring and takes it for his own, with dire consquences for him. The ring is lost, found hundreds of years later by the creature Gollum, and is lost again, found in Gollum's cave by Bilbo Baggins.Gandalf urges Frodo to flee to Bree, since Sauron's deadly servants, the nine Nazgul or ringwraiths, are in pursuit of the one who bears the One Ring. Sam, Merry and Pippin join Frodo in his quest. Before leaving the shire they meet the mysterious Tom Bombadill, who recommends to Frodo that they seek Gandalf in Bree at the Prancing Pony inn. At Bree they meet instead the ranger Strider aka Aragorn, the last of the Dunedain, the direct descendants of the kings of the lost realm of Arnor. He leads them eventually to Rivendell, after a perilous chase by the Nazgul, in which Frodo is stabbed in the shoulder by the Nazgul leader. Finally, in Rivendell, at the home of Elrond Halfelven, Frodo is reunited with Gandalf, who warns of his fellow wizard Saruman's treachery.Elrond assembles a council to determine the ring's fate. It is decided that the ring should be brought to Mordor, to be destroyed in the firy chasm of Mount Doom. Isildur's broken sword Narsil is reforged and presented to Aragorn as the sword that was broken and remade, Andruil. Frodo volunteers to serve as the Ring Bearer, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry and Pippin joining the Fellowship of the Ring. Boromir, son of Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, also joins the fellowship, along with the dwarf Gimli and the elf Legolas. The fellowship is ordered to accompany Frodo for as long as it is feasible, with some of the fellowship thinking of accompanying Boromir back to his home city and capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith.Gandalf, leading the Fellowship, tries to take them across the snowy pass of Caradhras. Defeated by extreme cold and a blinding snowstorm, and an attack by wargs (wolves), the Fellowship turns back and is taken through the Mines of Moria. Inside the darkened halls of the deserted dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf, the Fellowship is attacked by orcs and a demon from the First Age, a Balrog. Gandalf confronts the Balrog on the Bridge of K'hazakdum, and is swept by the Balrog into the abyss.In mourning, the Fellowship flees Moria and ventures out into the open, finding sanctuary in the enchanted forest of Lothlorien, home of the Elven king and queen Celeborn and Galadriel. After receiving parting gifts from Galadriel, the company journeys by boat towards the Falls of Rauros. Attacked once more by orcs near the falls, the company disperses, with Frodo and Sam making the perilous journey to Mordor on their own.I have provided the reader a brief sketch of the plot in the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, which does differ, in some substantial detail, from Peter Jackson's acclaimed film version. Yet I hope that those unfamiliar with the written text of Tolkien's words will be sufficiently intrigued to pick up this volume. Without a doubt, it is the great beginning of what many regard as the finest fantasy epic ever written."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I received J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for Christmas and had them sitting around on my shelf for a long time; I wanted to read \\"The Hobbit\\" first. But I had a burning desire to read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and so I set \\"The Hobbit\\" down and read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I obviously started with the first of the trilogy: \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" starts of in a small area of Middle-Earth called the Shire. We are introduced to our main character named Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins. During a visit to the Shire, Bilbo's longtime friend Gandalf the wizard discovers a mysterious ring in Bilbo's possession. So Gandalf leaves to do some research. He returns, after Bilbo has left the Shire, leaving the ring behind. Gandalf speaks to Frodo, telling him of the horrors that he discovered about the Ring. Many ages ago, one ring was forged in the fires of Mount Doom by the dark lord Sauron, and into the ring Sauron put all of his evil powers. The ring was made for only one purpose: to give the ring-bearer ultimate ruling power over all peoples of Middle-Earth.But in a battle at Sauron's fortress, Isildur, the son of the King of Middle-Earth, cut the ring from the hand of Sauron. So Sauron lost all of his power and vanished. But his spirit still existed, and it searched for the One Ring. The ring was lost but was found by Bilbo who brought it to the Shire. After telling the story, Gandalf tells Frodo to go south to the Elven village of Rivendell and seek the advice of Elrond, Rivendell's ruler, so Frodo journeys south with his friends Sam, Pippin and Merry.At Rivendell, they learn that the Ring cannot be destroyed in any way other than being thrown into the fires of Mount Doom where it was first forged. Only then will Sauron lose all of his power and diminish. Elrond advises everyone that the ring must go south to Mordor, the lands where Mount Doom and Sauron's fortress reside. Knowing what must be done, Frodo, having taken the task of ring-bearer, journeys south with a fellowship organized by Elrond. The fellowship includes: Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf.So that was the premise of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", set up in the first of the trilogy, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring. While reading the book, I could tell that the story was a great story and it is. What makes the story so great is that as the Fellowship gets nearer to Mordor, the harder their journey becomes, and no matter what they face, they have to get to Mordor and destroy the Ring. What also help the story are the places that we visit. Places like the Shire and Rivendell are described as beautiful places. It is through these descriptions that we can see a part of what is at stake here if the One Ring should return to Sauron, and Sauron claim ruler ship over Middle-Earth.What I really liked, apart from the story, was Tolkien's writing style. He would always describe everything in many details, making it easy for the reader to visualize what is going on, therefore enhancing the story. The descriptions really help not hinder the book.For this review, I decided that a description of the plot would be more important than talking about literary mechanics that made the book something enjoyable for me to read. I would recommend this book to everyone, but if you don't like the plot then don't read the book, because the plot is what \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is all about. It is a masterpiece, and I am looking forward to reading \\"The Two Towers\\", the second book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is a great book. You'd be surprised to see how different the movie and the book are. And they are so different, that it would not be good to read the Two Towers after watching the Fellowship of the Ring movie. You would miss so much. And I would also recomend reading The Hobbit. But anyway, the story is about a Hobbit named Frodo. In the beginning Bilbo, Frodo's uncle (who you will find more about in The Hobbit), is visited by an old friend: Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo announces that \\"This is the end\\", and he slips on the ring, and leaves Hobbiton in the Shire. I do not think that it would be a good idea to tell you much more, so you'll just have to read it. But remember, it will not work seeing the Fellowship and then reading the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\\"This proverb sums up the main theme of The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring in one carefully-worded phrase; indeed, this thematic saying is repeated several times throughout the novel. The legend-like story was written by J.R.R Tolkien to supplement the almost nonexistent native lore from his own country, England. This mythical style imparts a sense that the fantastic occurrences of the novel actually happened; while reading it, it seems as if you've simply stumbled upon a dusty scroll which matter-of-factly chronicles history.Like the unconcerned, humanoid Hobbits that the novel centers on, the story starts off very slowly, spending twenty pages detailing the history of Middle Earth and of the One Ring, which becomes tedious as the names of obscure places, people, and things quickly become muddled. Finally, the real story begins, only to stall a few dozen pages later when all the information scrupulously reported in the Prologue is then accounted again in another wearisomely long--though watered-down--history to Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit protagonist of the tale and the Ring-bearer. This lecture, given by Gandalf the Grey (another character crucial to the plot) becomes tedious after the first paragraph. The novel then continues with the action, and after another 100 pages, finally takes Frodo and his willing friends out of the agrarian Shire and into the real beginning of his dramatic and exciting quest. Frodo has been enjoined to take the evil Ring and destroy it in its birthplace, Mt. Doom, in the gloomy and disheartening land of Mordor, making Middle Earth safe from the dominion of the evil Sauron, whose gloved hand created the Ring long ago. At this point, the suspense level of the novel, which had previously been set at about two (Move Along, Please) skyrockets to twelve and a half out of ten (Under the Covers With a Flashlight).Though it starts off slow and plodding, The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring develops into an engrossing tale of incredible mythology. Since its first publishing in the 1950s, the novel has remained a bestseller- a fitting tribute to a genius such as Tolkien, who created the complex Middle Earth while holding down another job as an English professor. The history and legends extend far beyond the novels themselves, but unlike other less complicated fabrications, never double-crosses itself.This novel, an enduring classic, has been made into a multi-million dollar movie, filmed in the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. Surprisingly, most of the literally millions of viewers had never read Tolkien's works. In fact, the majority of people who have watched the popular movie have never read the novel, which remains the best introduction to Middle-Earth. This stands as another reason to begin the daunting, though highly satisfying, undertaking of reading the three volume, 1100 page epic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Don't miss the opportunity to partake in one of the most fascinating, enthralling, and indepth stories of all time!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Fellowship of the RingBy: J.R.R. TolkienReviewed by: Matt GleasonThe Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, is the first book of the thrilling Lord of the Ring series. The story takes place in Middle Earth where many good and bad things live.Frodo Baggins receives the, \`Ring of Power,' from his adoptive uncle who mysteriously vanished on his 111th birthday. Frodo must now take the ring to Mt. Doom and destroy it there, but Ring Wrath and Orcs are following him. With him he takes his friends Merry Pippin and Sam. Along the way they meet a man named Strider who helps them on their way. When they reach the house of Elrond, many other people, such as a dwarf, Gilmi, an elf, Legolos, a man named Boromir and their wizard friend, Gandalf the Grey, join them.I really like this book because the author uses strong descriptive verbs and adjectives. I also like this book because one thing is going to happen when a completely different thing happens. I give The Fellowship of the Ring a 4 out of 5 rating and recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and danger."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"After seeing the movie based off this book in December of 2001, I decided to read the book itself about nine months later. It was a great decision to do so. Even though the movie was a spectacular display of making an imaginary world come alive, it was not nearly as enthralling as this simply incredible book. I was just amazed with how much information and how many details were given about middle-earth and the characters within. Whenever I was reading this book my mind left my body and went to Tolkien's amazingly enchanted world.With J.R.R. Tolkien's fluid diction and incredible use of imagery, this book is a page-turner that will keep one up way into the middle of the night. If there is a problem with this book (and movie) it is the fact that it does not end, at least yet. In order to figure out the ending one must read the next two books in the series: &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King.&quot; I have not read either one of these, but I think I will continue with my pace of seeing the movie and then reading the book nine months later. I would also recommend this method to anyone who has not seen or read any of &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; books or movies because seeing the movie first helps put faces with names while reading the book. No matter what method one uses to read these enchanting fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, I recommend that they are read with an open mind and a will to be enthralled. This book was simply incredible."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was really great! I had picked it up before the movie came out, but I became a little bored in the section about the Council of Eldrond. But after I saw the movie (and loved it!!) I picked up the book again and finished it, and it was marvelous! I just began The Two Towers, and I can't wait to start Return of the King! I definatly recommend this book for any fantasy lovers!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"~If you were a Tolkien fan before the movie came out, I think rereading the series is worthwhile. If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels. Tolkien's greatest gift to me, was the inspiration he has given my imagination.~"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Very fine rendering that gets the pronunciations of proper names (including geographical ones) correctly, as Professor T. wanted it. Very good (I felt) on the nuances that readers notice in the book after first reading in (say) junior high and then re-reading it every five-to-ten years or so. Will especially appeal to the less fanatical Tolkien fan who deeply appreciates the book without getting into collecting the plastic figurines or going to the movie of it; the reader who because of the LOrd of the Rings went on to discover other, even greater stories like those of Shakespeare and Dante (for which I thank Tolkien whole-heartedly). Better than the (enjoyable, light) BBC version, and far superior to the American - accented production."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien uses many interesting literary devices to grab all kinds of different readers attention. Unlike some other authors, Tolkien creates a fantasy world for readers, to make the book more fun, and more exciting to read. This fantasy world is called middle-earth. Middle-earth is a place where Tolkien brings all sorts of creatures like elves, goblins, dwarves, orcs, and other creatures to life. Tolkien creates a plot that is more than good enough to make the fantasy world that he has created come alive. He does this by giving elements of nature more attributes, and making unreal creatures that people have only imagined. By reading this story the reader is able to relate him or herself to one or more of the many characters in the story that Tolkien brings to life. Another important thing that Tolkien was able to do in this story was make the adventure of the main character Frodo Baggins seem true to life. Tolkien makes Frodo and his friends be heroes to those people who thought that some things were impossible. In this story Frodo's friends are compared to companions that Tolkien feels are true friends of somebody. Tolkien uses a literary device that is similar to a gospel message. The message is that one this adventure the fellowship would not have been able to accomplish what they did, if they were not there for each other, and they did not work together.This was an excellent story because Tolkien did as much as he was able to make this story as great as it is. Tolkien shows the world in writing this story that people don't have to write like there is only one world. Tolkien's imagination has defied the ways that people think about what literature can be. Tolkien put his thoughts, his emotions, and what he believes in into this book. If you are a reader who is looking for a story with an unreal world, and unreal characters, and an adventure that is like no other, than this is the book for you. Even though this was just the first book of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien still leaves readers curious and interested how the entire story will actually end. In conclusion Tolkien's story The Lord of the Rings, can be an inspiration to anyone who needs any kind of uplifting, or anyone who wants to read about something that seems beyond belief compared to the world that they live in now.Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have just yesterday finished reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;the Hobbit&quot;. After being incredibly intrigued by&quot;the Hobbit&quot;, I can honestly say this book disappointed me. A precaution though: I loved &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot;, but &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the worst book in the series.To begin with, lots of stuff we learn in the beginning seems irrelevent. I confess, I eventually gave up on the seemingly inconsequential prologue and skipped right to chapter 1. While this problem doesn't taint the rest of the book too much, the prologue is just too long and showcases this flaw too much to just ignore.Even once the story begins, you still have to deal with the slow pace that I'm sure you've read about in the negative reviews. Tolkien just takes too much time describing things. Basically, the problem runs through almost the whole book, but especially in the early going. I realize some description is needed, but &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was just as descriptive, yet had far less space devoted to descriptions.But there's good stuff as well, Namely the charactor interactions. Scenes like Gandalf revealing the truth about the Ring to Frodo and Frodo's chat with Gimli's father Gloin really redeem this book.But that doesn't change the fact that this is the worst of the trilogy. I'd give it 31/2 stars, rounded down. It is true &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; will be remembered as the book that started the original fantasy series, but being there first only holds so much credibility. Thankfully though, &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot; were giant steps up from this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"(...)The first 200 pages or so are tough going--a leaf by leaf description of the landscape as Frodo and his pals walk and walk and walk (I think I got aerobic benefit just from reading!). It really helps to skip all of the awful songs and poetry (even Kahlil Gibrain seems inspired compared to Tolkien), which are totally superfluous. When the action gets going, it's good. The characters are a mixed bag (or baggins, I suppose). The hobbits are really engaging: lazy, overeating, territorial little critters who are very human and lots of fun. Gimli the dwarf is okay, too--he's got a huge grudge against almost everybody and thinks that subterranean cities are fun. The human warriors are fatuous and dull, though Aragorn (Strider) earns some sympathy because, despite his strength and lineage (he's the scion of kings), he manages to screw up constantly. The tendency of the warriors to recite 600 generations of their ancestry at the drop of a spear gets old quickly. The elves are the most insufferable creatures in fiction--impossibly beautiful, immortal, and do they ever know it! They also deal some drugs, but don't ever have any fun.The loopiest character by far is Tom Bombadil, an old geezer who can talk cranky elm trees out of devouring hobbits. This bizarre proto-hippie sings godawful songs and seems to have eaten too many forest mushrooms. He also appears to be shacked up with a teenage forest nymph. I think Tolkien means us to take him seriously, but it's just not possible.Gandalf is a hoot--a wizard with a sense of humor, the inspiration, I guess, for Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (which are much more fun to read than Tolkien). The best villain so far is not Sauron (who is just a yellow eye, anyway), but a character who appears for only three paragraphs or so--Bill Ferny, a stinky mortal who inspires more loathing than all the orcs and Gollums put together (I'd bet he was based on some Oxford colleague of Tolkien's)But with all the laborious description and with the tedious pastiche of mythology (some Celtic, some Germanic, a soupcon of Christian, etc.), the story is a good one, and you pull for the good guys. I had fun with it this time around. (...)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I resisted reading this trilogy, felt above fantasy type genre. This is great stuff. There is really little else to say."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Over the years, I have joyfully delved again and again into Tolkien's fantastic world of Middle-earth. If you aren't careful, the lush descriptions and rich lore will enchant you into thinking this world is real. I sometimes have to pinch myself, remembering that Middle-earth is, after all, a world of imagination only. But what imagination! Still, I cannot recommend it unconditionally. The age-old criticism of this novel is that its conflict of good versus diabolical evil is too simplistic. Even if this is true, is this a flaw? Rather, it might be the most tragic aspect of Tolkien's tale - wouldn't we all rather live in an easy world of black and white distinctions, instead of our own unhappy, difficult and ambiguously gray world? That is why Middle-earth is so easy for people to love. Other notable criticisms are that Tolkien included no substantial female characters, and that dark-skinned characters are always on the side of evil. Truly, these are unfortunate anachronisms that mar an otherwise gorgeous story. Still, if you are able to willingly suspend your disbelief, you might find yourself enthralled by this epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's phenomenol trilogy starts with the Fellowship Of The Ring, the story that takes you into a world of elves, dwarves, men, and hobbits. Tolkien's writing painted the story in my imagination like de Vinci painted Mona Lisa. The first part of the War of the Ring takes you around Middle Earth with an unforgetable cast of characters. i will be honest, if your not in the mood it may start off a little slow, but it quickly turns into the page-turner epic classic tht makes it world famous today.

Tolkien was a storyteller of genius!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Obviously with Tolkien, it's all been said before, but having just re-read Lord of the Rings again I felt inspired to add my bit. I cannot think of another author in any genre who has put in the same about of work and passion into the background for his or her novel. Tolkien not only create a completely believable universe in the form of Middle-Eart, he create languages, a history, politics and religion unparalleled in complexity or scope. Lord of the Rings is the template from which almost all subsequent fantasy has been cut. It doesn't take a lot to see the parallels between Goodkind and Jordan's first novels and Tolkiens, the exhausting flight in the face of deadly and unexpected danger, the reluctant hero and even the black riders in the case of Jordan. So compelling and complete is Tolkien's dominance of this genre that it will take another genius of his calibre to truly innovate in every respect. With the film's of the same name fothcoming over the next three years I would recommend everyone get a copy a read or re-read what has to rank as one of the greatest works of literature produced in the last century to see if Peter Jackson can truly bring to life the majesty of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)).

Some sections seemed to detail numerous characters that I could not keep them straight. I also became rather annoyed with the different 'accents' and 'songs' the narrator used in the recording.

Since I read it long after seeing the movies I was not prepared for what I read, there are so many small parts that either were left out or changed slightly that its like reading a story you don't know entirely. I have to say that I love the movies and if not for them I would never have wanted to read the books. If the only way you are willing to experience the book is audiobook only then I still recommend it because they are wonderful books, my favorite actually.

The width is perfect; the font size and spacing are relieving to the eye, light and spacious, enough room to break up the printing so it doesn't jumble together on long, extended reading marathons, which with Tolkien is easy to do.This is, of course, the first part of the new \\"Holy Trilogy.\\" I would strongly recommend starting with the books if you've never forayed into Tolkien's Middle Earth before, although it's hard to find someone who hasn't seen Jackson's films. Needless to say, the film has done some \\"light\\" editing, such as many of the songs, as well as the Anglo-Saxon influence, which makes it in the film as dress, props, and the honorable Boromir.Chronologically the book follows a larger timescale than the films. For example, Gandalf leaves for the archives at Minas Tirith immediately after Bilbo leaves the Shire, and seems to be gone for only a week or so. In the book, his absence is actually three years in length, then a brief visit, and then another nine years. Although this all takes place in less than a page-length, the impression it leaves is that time has surely passed by, and Frodo is not quite the same hobbit as before. There has also been some shifting of the dialogue in the films. Example; the line \\"I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear\\" comes in the film at the Council of Elrond scene. In this book, it comes in Chapter two.Also cut are the smatterings of Old English, such as the word \\"glede\\" which is \\"hot coal\\" (haven't translated in years). As for the story itself; modern mythology, legendary, enchanting, superb. Yes, all these things.Finally, the maps in back are the authentic ones by Tolkien himself. They are printed large enough to trace your own pen-marks on them and make notes in the margins, useful especially if you're teaching.The quality of materials is good as well; you can beat these editions up a fair amount, dog-ear the pages, and they'll hold. The binding is very well done as well, no breaking or falling apart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit are one of the best series of books ever written.

Many will complain that it is boring or pays too much attention to details, but do not listen...Warning: if you get stuck on the chapter \\"The Council of Elrond\\", know that after that chapter it gets very interesting, and you can skip a few pages if you like. Also, the movie-lovers will proclaim that this is not anywhere as good as the movie. Some will tell you that the book does an injustice to the movie. But do not listen to them.

The characters are complex and believable, the land itself is the most detailed fantasy world ever created; it has a very vivid history.

But I always tell people to look past this to the themes of the book: the importance of community, of friends, of family."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo Baggins has to save the world from the evil Sauron, with the help of his trustworthy friends, the wizard Gandalf the Gray, and the mysterious Aragorn. Against him stands the monsters known as Orcs, under the lead of the feared Nazl. The plot is good, but simple and predictable. The characters are mostly good, but sometimes they do things totally without reason. It's a little bit plain, and would have been better if there were at least one person who wasn't white, black or absolutely gray (yes, that's possible). My main complaint however is that there are no women! They simply don't exist in the book, one of the biggest signs of tFotR's writing-date. And while this book is good, it's not as great as many will have it, though it's a nice read, not the least since it's one of the first real fantasy books.

(The Lord of the Rings) His was the first of the fantasy epics, and still the best, because his world comes Alive like none since. The amount of detail which he put into it is staggering, and by the end, you are convinced that Middle Earth truly existed. Add to the mix a compelling quest, and a mix of believable characters. They truly evolve as the books go on, none are left untouched by what they encounter. There are huge battles, character conflicts, monsters, demons, and excitement galore. Yet, what keeps the Lord of the Rings unique is that he believes in the individual. All those battles and glorious deeds, while exciting, are ultimately unimportant. Everything in this series truly hinges on the efforts of two individuals, seperate from all else going on. It is this high drama which keeps the books interesting even today, when the shelves are stuffed with fantasy books about huge adventure"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"THE original fantasy novel.

Actually, I was forced by my English teacher. I thought, since the book was good enough to have a movie after it, it probably wouldn't be such a bad book.Well, I started to read the prolouge. Bad idea. My biggest advice is, DO NOT READ THE PROLOUGE!!! It took me days to get through the ten pages of it. This part is so confusing and worthless information that you really don't need to make sense of the book. Anyways, the rest of the book was very slow. If you want a quick read, this book is not for you. The details go on and on and there really is no action what so ever.However, this book wasn't all bad. I got through it, but I could only read about ten pages at a time or i would lose intrest. At the end it is a nice story but I don't know if the pain reading it amounted to the pleasure of finishing it afterwards."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I've given a lot of good reviews on Amazon--generally, I don't review books I don't like because I don't finish them--but The Fellowship of the Ring is the absolute crown jewel of fantasy novels. In Tolkien's original plan, this was merely the first part of a single, enormous book: The Lord of the Rings. The afore-mentioned superlative could apply to the entire series, but being quite large enough on its own without the added weight of its successors, Fellowship is the all-time classic.I feel sorry for anyone who saw the movie before reading this book. I have two reasons for this: firstly, all those moviegoers, even if they read the book now, will be tempted to superimpose imagery from the film in their brains as they read, cancelling out the imaginative power of Tolkien himself. Secondly, these newer readers will be unprepared for Chapters 3-8, which are comprised entirely of matter omitted from the movie. Such readers are likely to find the story slow-starting, or even boring.Tolkien spends a lot of time working up his hobbit characters, establishing their peaceful and essentially inconsequential existence in a larger world. Only Gandalf the wizard seems to care for them at all ... until it becomes clear that one special hobbit has come into possession of an especially dangerous and powerful artifact, the Dark Lord's omnipotent ring, within which he has invested his hold on life and the potential to enslave the world.In Book I of The Fellowship, we travel with Frodo and his three hobbit companions into exile, \\"from danger towards danger, drawing it after me.\\" In Book II (the one from which the movie was largely drawn), representatives from the societies of men, elves, and dwarves accompany these hobbits at the start of an impossible mission towards the fabled Mount Doom, where alone the ring may be destroyed.Tolkien takes his time in his prose, establishing every character and setting with such talent and such a love for the language, that those of us who loves these things will be instantly and forever enchanted. Impatient readers, however, are likely to become quickly bored--and that is too bad, because the payoffs in the action scenes are worth the price of the book unto themselves.It's the best--period.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth\\".)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a marvelous story. J.R.R. Tolkien certainly had a large imagination. I was emotionally attached to all the characters, for they were so well developed and the writing is quite wonderful. Being a Christian writer, J.R.R. Tolkien put many different Christian themes in the story like good vs. evil, he was in fact C.S. Lewis' best friend, who wrote the beloved Chronicals of Narnia seiries. This story will touch your heart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is simply great, even better than the films.

It is a delightful combination of poetry, lovable characters, beautiful descriptive writing, and adventure. Tolkien is an incredible wordsmith and paints beautiful (or terrifying) pictures of scenery, from the clouds in the sky to the grass on the ground. The reader can see the forests, the mountains, the rivers, even the clothing worn by the characters. The characters in this story are diverse and fascinating, coming from different races, speaking different languages, but all having a common purpose and a profound friendship. Frodo, a hobbit, the humblest of all creatures, is chosen to embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, the greatest instrument of evil known to Middle Earth. Together with eight other companions, they begin the first leg of their heroic journey to Mount Doom."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read this way back when I was an undergraduate student at Bradley University.

If you like a fast paced plot and lots of action, this is not for you. If you like to savor the moment, you will absolutely fall in love as I did.Tolkien takes you step by step and describes EVERY step. His dialogue is simple natured and simply put which adds a hint of humor in and of itself. The plot is profound. It deals with fighting evil through friendship, loyalty, and tradition. There's food, dancing, poetry, storytelling, magic, tragedy, adventure, suspense and humor. I liked reading this in the wee morning hours when the world was quiet and when Tolkien's detailed accounts would draw me into Middle Earth. Yes, the story could have survived with less scenery descriptives, but I believe it would have been different. I believe there is something to be gained from savoring the moments in a story and Tolkien does it beautifully. The characters and settings linger in my mind which says something to me."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read this trilogy in high school and was captivated by the \\"Middle Earth\\" universe created by Tolkien. The book has lost some of its popularity, and I have been unable to get my children (captivated instead by Harry Potter) to read it. The excellent movie version of Lord of the Rings has helped a bit in restoring the book to its proper cultural status. The audio CD version of this makes the book very digestible, and the reader (Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis) is excellent.In re-reading this first volume 35 years later, I am struck by the vulnerability of good and the primacy of evil in Tolkien's universe. It is no accident that the standard bearers for good are brave little hobbits; good is a distinct underdog in this world.The triumph of good against all odds is our most basic human myth, and Tolkien tells this oldest of stories in a fresh and entertaining fashion. I suppose that Harry Potter is the updated version of Tolkien, but try to get your kids to read Tolkien as his telling of the myth is unrivaled."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This has been a perennial personal favorite of mine since I first read it in the 1970s. I don't know how many times I've read it since then, but a conservative guess would be at least a dozen times. I just finished reading it again last weekend - it was once again, outstanding!So, what should you know if you are pondering your first foray into Tolkien's tale of Middle Earth? Lets see...1) \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" done not include a complete stand-alone tale. It is, rather, the first book of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy which also includes the volumes \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\". So, when you get to the end of this volume you are left hanging there...you MUST get the other two books to complete the tale. (That's what happened to me when I read this book the first time [as an assignment for a college English class I was taking])2) This is a classic tale of good versus evil, but, as you can read in the forward, Tolkien states that it is not meant to be an allegory; it is just a tale that he wanted to tell.3) Be prepared to have your traditional views of what an elf, wizard, etc., are to be challenged.4) This book can be enjoyed by readers of many ages. I read it first when I was in college, and, later, when I had children of my own I read this trilogy to them while they were in elementary school (one was even a pre-schooler - that was years before the movies of the same names were released).5) There is no objectionable language in the books, though many parts convey a dark image of a world under the sway or impending threat of evil.6) You do not have to read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading this book. And I found this trilogy to be far superior to \\"The Hobbit\\" when I did read it.At first I wondered at the Amazon-indicated reading level of 9-12 yrs for this book. I would not have guessed that when I first read it, but now that I have children of my own that have consumed the entire \\"Harry Potter\\" series as well as many other long novels, I can see how a 9-12 yr range could work for these books as well...depending on the child. Be aware though, that there are many places in the book where Tolkien's characters launch into sometimes extensive recitation of verse as part of the story. That can put off some younger readers (I sometimes skip over those parts myself...though that may offend some Tolkien purists out there)If you have children that like books like \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Eragon\\", etc., and they are looking for a new adventure, you might suggest this one to them. I have read the \\"Harry Potter\\" books, and if I were to compare them to Tolkien's works I have to say that Tolkien's story conveys a richer image of a world to me than do the books of JK Rowling (though I also enjoyed them).All in all, this book launches a top-flight story and represents what I consider to be the prototypical modern fantasy story - \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"Definitely 5 stars (only because I can't award more)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien was the master of fantasy, and that's not just because he was the first to write a very popular modern epic.What makes Tolkien superior was how he used his extensive knowledge of mythology and linguistics to create his own complex world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College where he studied and taught the linguistics of early English. Over many years he created his own elvish language with a complex syntax and grammar, and a complete history and mythology of Middle Earth (see the twelve volumes of The Histories of Middle-Earth below.) This gives his works so much complexity and texture that when you read them, you feel like you've dropped into the middle of a real civilization.Besides the amazing world-building, Tolkien builds excellent characters and uses them to explore such heavy human themes as friendship, love, greed, power, redemption, gender-roles, self-sacrifice, and death. This is not a light epic for a Sunday afternoon. This is intense, bone-chilling, goose-bump raising stuff. You can feel the weight of the world on the shoulders of Frodo and his companions. And, though there's a happy ending, it comes with much suffering and loss.And all the while, Tolkien's writing is beautiful and poignant. In my opinion, the only writers I've read who even begin to compare are Ursula LeGuin, Susanna Clarke, and perhaps Lois McMaster Bujold.~FantasyLiterature.net"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It would have helped if I read the Hobbit first.This book had a depth, I had never read before.

I lived in Israel for a year and when times were tough or I was lonely for home.

The question has lasted for twenty years and since the world is standard of good literature or simply fun with words then I will contribute my opinion.You are most likely familiar with the Harry Potter series, and it is the perfect example of a child's tale. J.R.R. Tolkien studied the language of our past and used it to write his story, and as you know their form of language, the early english written tradition, has proven not to be useless long sentences and foolish puns,(hint:Shakespeare),the context is so full of language and wit it would be an insult to call it a child's tale. Also out of the many books I have read, none have portrayed the imagination into an adventure like he has..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book. The author is J.R.R. Tolkien. His writing style is very unique. This book is the first in a trilogy of three.The book is about a young hobbit named Froto Baggins. He has inherited a ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. Little does Froto know what perils this ring will bring him. So he is set out to destroy the ring before it is too late. Froto sets out with nine others to bring evil to an end once and for all. If the ring is not destroyed they all will be destroyed.This would be a book well worth your while to read.

I personally enjoyed this book and finished it in less than week. The story follows this theme, \\"Three rings for the Eleven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne, In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\\" The story begins with Frodo the little hobbit, who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. Unfortunately, he learns from his friend, Gandalf the Wizard, that the ring is extremely evil, and wants to get back to his master, The dark Lord Sauron. Then starts the adventure of the Hobbit, who goes on a journey with a few companions to the only place where the ring can be destroyed, the Cracks of Doom in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. Chased by evil that does not sleep, this book gives you more than just entertainment, it also throws in some values and other ideas, like friendship, loyalty, courage, respect for one another. J.R.R Tolkiens did a great job developing the characters, and I recommend this book to the fans, but also to those who don't know Tolkiens, because this is a true piece of art, and also the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is soo awesome! I have not yet finished reading it but it has a great beginning! Every part is so interesting and it makes me want to read more!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings at least two dozen times or more, and it is far and away my favorite book of all time. Although each time I've re-read it I have gotten yet more and more out of it, listening to this unabridged reading has made me appreciate the work even more, if possible. Listening to it without the printed page before your eyes renders everything so much more vividly it is truly astonishing. It also modulates the pacing of the experience, since it takes longer to read aloud than to read silently in your head. And you can appreciate the nuances of Tolkien's elegant and stately prose style so much more this way, too.Rob Inglis's reading is wonderful. His vocal characterizations are excellent, particularly for Gollum, Treebeard, Gimli and Gandalf. His emotional range is a bit narrow, unfortunately, and some of his intonations can be a bit repetitive or occasionally off, but this does not really detract from the whole. An especially nice thing is that he actually sings each of the songs that are interspersed throughout the story. I don't know where the melodies came from, but they are very fitting, with a sort of English folk-music style that fits in perfectly with the ambience of the whole.Listening to these CD's has been absolutely delightful in every way. I am going to be so, so sad when I get to the end, I must just turn right around and start them over again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is a true classic,and it\`s popularity is enormous.And why,you could easily understand when you read it. I would be surprised if there exists any person who hasn\`t heard of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or J.R.R.Tolkien.The plot is a true classic,which has inspired a huge number of other books and movies (among them Star Wars and The Wheel of Time). 19 rings were once made. Nine for the mortal men,seven for the dwarf kings,and three for the elven kings. But the Dark Lord Sauron also created his own ring - The Lord of the Rings,whose power will make good into evil because of temptation!The nine mortal men where once mighty kings,but became Sauron\`s servants by temptation.Sauron was finally defeated by a human named Isildur(though his spirit continued living in the shadows),but then he also became evil when he took the ring. Later,the ring took his own life and he dropped it into the river,where it remained undiscovered for 3000 years.Thousands of years later,the hobbits (a kind of small people) wants to live in peace,and having nothing to worry about. One of the older hobbits,Bilbo Baggins,cheated himself the almighty ring from a creature named Gollum,and suddenly,the servants of the dark lord finds out where the ring is. Bilbo leaves the ring to his relative Frodo. The wizard Gandalf decides that the ring has to be destroyed - that\`s the only way to defeat Sauron forever. Frodo later becomes the leader for The Fellowship of the Ring,which consists of four hobbits (Frodo,Sam,Merry and Pippin),the wizard Gandalf,the two humans Aragorn (or Strider)and Boromir,the elve Legolas and the dwarf Gimli.And I think most of you recognize those characters,so I don\`t have to explain in detail who they are. The fellowship is now thrown into a fantastic adventure,where they have to meet a thousand dangers on their way to Mount Doom.What amazes me mostly with this book is how complex the world is. And imagine Tolkien has found out all of it himself!He really must have had a lot of fantasies!But this isn\`t just some wild imaginations - because the world feels so complex,it is so real you can believe it really has existed. He creates detailed cultures for each of the people in his Middle Earth,like comparisons between different religions today. Over all,the world is similar to the medieval Europe,but with fantasy creatures like dragons as well.As Tolkien was an expert of Nordic mythology,he also figured out the names like Frodo,Bilbo and Gandalf very easily. And The Middle Earth is actually an english translation from the Swedish Midgard,which was the place where the humans lived in the nordic mythology. That could be interesing to know.Many people claims the book is too short - and sometimes,I do agree. A hundred pages more would not have been a bad idea.Over all,this is a difficult book to review,because there is always something that remains incomplete.Now the book has been made into a film,which is one of the most popular today,but before you see the film,I recommend you to read the book. It\`s not enough having seen just the film and skip the book. You have to read it to really understand the whole complexity of Tolkien\`s world.The three books are all in all like one great adventure,but this is my favorite,because it is the most classical and introduces us to the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This narration is tremendous! It is COMPLETE and not overdone with stupid special effects or a whole cast of characters. Rob Inglis has the most wonderful voice and creates all of the characters as though they were in the room with you. He makes you feel like you're cudled in front of the fire in the House of Elrond listening to tales of old lore. I can honestly say that my favorite part of the day, the part I look forward to all day, is the half an hour before bed when I listen to these CDs. It's strange to say that a set of CDs brings you closer to inner peace...but I dare say that if any could do that, these are among their number."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is beautiful and rich in texture, character development, and writing style, and in my opinion transcends the realm of \\"book\\" and \\"fantasy\\", becoming true literature and a classic. The book should not be confused with the movie, as the two are aimed at different audiences with different expectations. Fellowship is without a doubt dated. As some reviewers have pointed out, Tolkien may spend 80 pages walking down a road, or 2 pages in a song. He may spend pages developing a character's style, then mere paragraphs describing an action scene. Tolkien wrote to a British audience back in the 30s and 40s who didn't mind this and actually expected it. An audience who were not as rushed as we are today, who did not expect the instant gratification TV and computers bring and were used to pure imagination to visualize action scenes. An audience who had 2 or 3 hours a night to become absorbed in a book and who were willing to put forth the sustained effort to delve into complex character development. The movie in turn is geared towards maximum action and gratification in a short time period. There's nothing wrong with that; in fact I think the movie is brilliant, a visual feast. But that is not, nor can it be, the aim of the book. The point of this book is to close yourself off to the real world and lose yourself entirely in Tolkien's fantasy. If a sentence has to be reread a couple of times, or only 20 pages are read in an hour or two, than so be it. This is not a novel to be rushed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think this is a great book. There are so many different interesting characters. I also like fantasy.

For example, Sean Astin's \\"Sam\\" was as good as it could have possibly been on screen, yet Inglis nailed Sam even better, in my opinion. He nailed Bombadil, nailed Treebeard (and Quickbeam), nailed Gandalf, nailed Gimli, nailed Butterbur, as well as all other more difficult characters (not to mention all other main characters). Absolutely BRILLIANT. 10 STARS![LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN \\"DRAMATIZED\\" VERSION OF THE HOBBIT (and I assume the matching LOTR version is equally embarrassing) AND THEN SEE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT INGLIS!]"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It's been thirty years since I read The Hobbit and only recently that I began reading the Fellowship trilogy. I have just finished Part 1 and am well into Part 2, The Two Towers. What a marvelous writer Tolkien was! Though my experience with fantasy literature is limited, these volumes have more than earned a place in my permanent Classics library alongside Baum's Wizard of Oz, Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia and Rowling's Harry Potter series. The illustrations in this edition alone are worth the price of admission. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My oldest son and I are big Lord of the Rings fans, and usually listened to the books from our library. They no longer have the first of the trilogy, so I started to look for an unabridged version for my son's 10th birthday...as we hadn't been able to listen for over a year (gasp!).This recording is wonderful. It is verbatim and does not have a lot a background noise to deflect from the story itself, yet at the same time the reader does an amazing job of making the story come alive.I definitely recommend this set of CDs if you're looking for an UNABRIDGED version of Book 1 of Lord of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There are six \\"books\\" of the Lord of the Rings in all. Two are found in the first volume, two in the second, and two in the third. Apparently, Tolkien originally meant for the books to be divided into six volumes; not three, so I'm taking him at his word.The first \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how Gandalf and Frodo discover the identity of an evil ring, and set out on a quest to get it out of Frodo's neighborhood (the Shire) before it can do any real harm. That is, Frodo and some of his friends set out on said quest, but they need to do it without Gandalf, who has some other things he wants to check up on. They expect Gandalf to reappear and accompany them, but he fails to do so, and in the end, they need to leave the Shire without him.During the first book, the hobbits leave the shire and have some adventures, encountering several strange things in the world outside. Elves, an evil willow tree, a very powerful singing man named Tom Bombadil, some undead called wights, a bartender named Butterbur, and a ranger named Aragorn. In the early parts of the book, not much happens to really excite or hold one in suspense. I got the impression that Tolkien was trying to ease readers into his adventure book. However, once the hobbits get to Bree and meet Aragorn, things start to pick up. They wander in the wilderness with him and quickly fall under attack by black riders. Luckily, they meet help shortly after that. Frodo then needs to ride quickly to the ford, in order to get away from the black riders.The scene at the end of this book, with Frodo in a sort of standoff against the black riders was really something; especially compared to the rest of the book, which was more whimsical and fun than suspenseful and exciting. If all you know is the Peter Jackson movies, you may be surprised by how far the action and suspense were amped up in the movies (though, in my opinion, to great effect.) Still, when I said that this book was whimsical and fun, that was exactly what I meant.Many points in this book are just plain fun to read. The adventure of the hobbits through the old forest, and their many songs and such while still in the shire were amusing and fun, and it was enjoyable to hear some of their stories about odd lands and strange people, as well as find out what happened to many of the characters from \\"The Hobbit.\\" If I had to pick just one character, however, who truly embodied the overall mood of whimsy in the first \\"book,\\" it would definitely be Tom Bombadil; perhaps one of Tolkien's most interesting and powerful characters. He's so powerful, in fact, that it's very hard to feel threatened with him around, and he dances in and out of scenes like a fairy in some children's tale.That having been said, I think that most children would have a hard time sitting still for the whole story. Some of Tolkien's descriptions get a bit lengthy, and children (unless they're very good and have been raised away from television,) would have a tough time with that, as much as they might like the subject matter.The second \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how the ring arrives at Rivendell, a council is held to determine what to do with it, (and to provide some much-needed backstory,) and Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry set out again from Rivendell, alongside Aragorn the dunedain, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir the man and the wizard Gandalf. The party travels through the underground realm of Moria, the woods of Lothlorien, and down the river Anduin towards the fork in their path, where they must decide where to take the ring; to Gondor; city of men, or to Mordor, where it can finally be destroyed. As they move on, party members begin to fall away, until finally, the fellowship is splintered, with only Sam and Frodo left the guard the ring itself. Most of the fellowship members are either dead or in mortal danger by the time this book ends.The humor of the first half of the book is replaced here with high adventure, although some sections feel a bit tacked-on (such as the showboating of many of the characters during the attempt to cross Caradhras.) Additionally, the stay of the fellowship in Lothlorien feels neither humorous nor thrilling. I honestly found it more strange than anything else; strange in a good way, but not really all that engaging, compared to the passing through Moria.It's odd to say that the strangest place in the second half of the book was also the least intense, but that's how Lorien came across to me. I thought that the whole second half of the book was a great deal more interesting and exciting than the first half, if only because of the lethal enemies that get introduced right off the bat, but in terms of overall story quality, I'd rate them about the same. The point of the narrative is never really to set a mood or dwell on how the characters feel, which is probably for the best on some level. When there's evil to deal with, personal feelings really don't matter.We're still not into the \\"war\\" parts of the lord of the rings, exactly, and Tolkien seemed to have enjoyed skimming over smaller battles in his books. The more I read, the more I'm struck by just how much better the pacing was in the films. The books are just as good and entertaining, of course, but they're entertaining in a more high-fantasy, intellectual sense, rather than stressing mood, excitement or drama. Though the story is almost identical, the book and movie versions of the Lord of the Rings are really very different from one another in tone and pacing. Me, I like both, but not on the same day.Lastly, I should bring up my reason for reviewing these books in particular. Tolkien was Catholic, and his writings reflect a Catholic view of the world; where evil and good are both refreshingly-clear, and evil attacks from both inside and outside, hiding in the smallest and seemingly most innocent things. The ring itself seems both like a beautiful piece of jewelery and a fascinating source of magic power, but it's also small enough that people wouldn't normally think of it as being capable of so much harm. There could not be a more perfect allegory for sin, which toutes itself as satisfaction for vanity, greed, the craving for power, and yet, often seems like it's no big deal. Just one little sin. No one would ever know. Then suddenly, you're wounded to the heart by it, just like Frodo nearly was.However, although I view the ring as an allegory, it's important to note that the allegory is far, far subtler than the ones used by C. S. Lewis in the Chronicles of Narnia. In fact, I think that's the greatest strength of this series. Lewis' allegories didn't interfere with the storytelling much in later books, but in Tolkien's writings, they hardly even seem like allegories half the time. The real strength here is in the world view that his books have; the correct world view. That there is good, and evil, and all types of people are somewhere along one of those roads, no matter how normal or odd they may seem.Some might raise issue with the magic that gets thrown around in this story, and the other stories in this series, but it's important to remember that the \\"magic\\" in this tale is fantasy-magic. It bears no real similarities to the real thing. How can I tell? Because of the world view of those who use it. In this book, the heroes are, for the most part, outmatched and on the run from their enemies. Evildoers are very strong, and the good are very weak, but nonetheless, they go on a quest to triumph over their much stronger adversaries. The mentality of the weak prevailing over the strong runs directly contrary to the philosophy of the real occult; which always stresses the selfish pursuit of greater strength. So long as this mentality is present (victory in weakness,) any talk of \\"magic\\" in these books is not dangerous; just a harmless fantasy element. This is why I consider this book so good, overall.The minor imperfections that I spot early on are simply that the pace starts out a bit slow, and doesn't really pick up until over halfway through. Still, a patient reader shouldn't have any trouble getting through them, and even appreciating the sheer amount of detail that Tolkien put into this work."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It was only after playing Lord of the Rings Online that I felt the desire to read the books, & so I started with The Hobbit in January. When the day is done, I curl up with a book in bed & read until I pass out.So LotR was written 17 years after The Hobbit, but Tolkein's memories of his characters was as sharp & clear as if there hadn't been a pause (if only the same could be said for Anne Rice). LotR is more serious, which is a little disappointing since The Hobbit was more of a comedy. The IS comedy, but things get a lot more serious after they hook up with Aragorn.This is a nice fantasy story where a group of men ignore their racial differences & travel as friends to destroy the source of power of a common enemy. I like how the Elves have a realistic scene that even after the ring is destroyed, things will never be as they once were. The Elves are very interesting, being like tall glorious gods who watch the uneducated & unwashed mortals to pass the boredom of eternity.I like how even though these books were written in a time before Womens' Rights, the ladies are not housewives. Actually there are probably only three women in this entire book; Goldberry, Arwin (who in this book is a completely useless character who does nothing) & Galadriel (who is equally as important as Celeborn, yet seems more so because she is a ring bearer).One thing I'm particularly fond of is the lack of token romance that everyone seems to feel they need to throw into every book & movie. If you know of any other fantasy books that have no romance, please leave a title suggestion in a comment.After you read LoTR, it's not over yet; Tolkein's other book are related. You should also check out Lord of the Rings Online; most faithful adaption of the books ever made.Now I really enjoyed this book & the one before it, butt it genuinely has some things that bug me.*Galadriel is terribly annoying & she speaks in a way that no other Elf does & there's a chance that you're going to have trouble understanding what she's babbling about. It's like she's trying to force herself to sound poetic & seems to be repeating herself but changing the wording....& then the characters praise her for it!*Gimli should NOT find Galadriel attractive; Dwarf women are short & bearded so it would have made more sense for him to be attracted to a equating Gandalf than her.*Much like The Hobbit, there is a lot of singing. I'm suprised no one has made a musical out of his collective works yet.The flaw is the enemies. Yes, I can understand now why Dungeons & Dragons revamped Orcs, & even why Rowling's Dementors may be a little more badass than the Nazgul. When it comes to a small band of (mostly) mortal men being heavily outnumbered by the enemy or encountering a single powerful entity, the heroes win too easily & too quickly, all for convenience, making the battles rather boring. The enemies basically sissy-fight the heroes while the majority of them just stand in the sidelines & watch; when the ones actually doing the fighting are struck down, the others just give up instead of retaliate. & I can only describe the Nazguls attempts to get at Frodo as half-assed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I ordered this used book from across the pond. It arrived in a matter of days and the books was in great condition. I would order from these guys again in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is my least favorite of the three books as its split up into two separate books/stories. The first one is entertaining, it tells the story of the people Rohan going to Helm's Deep and their fight against Saruman as well as the Ents battle against Saruman. This part has a lot of history thrown around and it has the exciting battle sequences of Helms Deep and the battle at Isengard. This is all good and enjoyable to read.The second part is the tale of Frodo and Sam and their eventual companion Gollum as they traverse the wasted lands north of Mordor and finally into Mordor, where the story stops. There is not much going on here, and there isn't a lot of history thrown around, this is just character building for Frodo and Sam and the quest. Also the story ends abruptly, without a satisfying conclusion, in my opinion.Still overall the book is a classic, and I liked it. This is at least the tenth time I've read/heard this story in the past 25 years, so it still always gets a run every few years. The audio version I listened to sounded very professional. I also think after hearing this audio book and listening to the orc voices I believe Peter Jackson listened to this well to come up with some of the orc voices in his movies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"this book is such a thrilling book it was hard for me to put it down. all the characters are so real but not at the same time !!!! it was also a very well writen book. tolken is such a good author. i encourage you to read the other books also they are wonderful books to."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When I was 9 I watched the third movie with my dad, and loved it.

When I was 12 I got the first book from the library, since my dad wouldn't takeme to the book store, I finished it withen two weeks. It was amazing, every word was perfect, and I understood most of it. My dad is waiting until we buy it before he reads it. I love the story, it all comes together, and is all connected. My mom and sisters arn't into it though, I wish they were. I just wish there were more stars, 10,000 stars. I am now like 4 chapters from being done with the second book. and then the third.

Excellent read. Can't wait to start the next book!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an epic fantasy set in Middle Earth starring hobbits, dwarves, elves and even a few men.I love this story. I remember the first time I read it, at twelve. It took me three days to get through the Hobbit and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. All I did was eat, sleep, and read.I remember the chills that ran down my spine as Frodo and Sam first hid from the mysterious black riders (Ringwraiths) as they raced through the Shire and later on the road to Rivendell. The simple ring of invisibility (from The Hobbit) having taken on a dark purpose and the formation of the fellowship of the ring to take it into the very heart of Mordor captured my mind and drew me on.The characters, the places and the enemies are what make the story so memorable to me. So I wanted to list each below with a brief description (most are spoilers if you haven't read this before, but probably not that bad if you've seen the movie).The fellowship:-Gandalf the Grey, powerful wizard who still suffers the self-doubt and worry that plague all mankind.-Strider, mysterious ranger who both fears and desires to take on the responsiblities cast upon him by his sires.-Gimli, dwarf from the Lonely Mountain on a personal quest to discover the fate of Balin and his crew who disappeared into the Mines of Moria never to be seen again.-Legolas, the woodelf from Mirkwood, who comes to Rivendell to report the loss of the prisoner Gollum.-Boromir of Gondor, who sees in the ring a chance to turn the tides against the darkness in Mordor.-Merry and Pippin, Frodo's dear friends who conspire to join him in his quest before they know what it is, simply because he is their friend. They come as a pair until their paths diverge in the later books.-Sam Gamgee, Frodo's gardener and loyal companion who is determined to help his master succeed in his quest and make it back to the Shire alive.-And, of course, Frodo Baggins himself, Bilbo's heir, who volunteers to take the ring and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, \\"though he doesn't know the way,\\" although he does know there is every chance he will not survive the attempt.The places:-The Shire, the ideallic home of the hobbits, neverchanging, peaceful, and pure.-The Old Forest, borders The Shire and home of vindictive willow trees with mesmerizing voices, but also home of the jovial Tom Bombadil and his lovely Goldberry, the river daughter, who help the hobbits reach Bree in one piece.-Bree, an outpost community where hobbits and men live together in peace, where the Butterbur, the forgetful barman, redeams himself.-Rivendell, home of elves and the Lord Elrond, half-elven, and his daughter Arwen Evenstar (recently arrived from Lothlorien), the last homely home.-The Mines of Moria, deeply delved, filled with orcs and something much, much worse.-Lothlorien, the golden wood, home of the elves and the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. The Lady keeping secret one of the three elven rings of old.-The Great River, Anduin, the last road of the fellowship before it is sundered for good or ill.The enemies:-Ringwraiths, nine ancient kings of men who were seduced by the power of their rings under the One Ring. They are no more than shadows of their former selves, though the beasts they ride are real enough.-Sauron, the ancient enemy who gained power under the dark eaves of Mirkwood before being driven out and returning to Mordor to cast his shadow over the entire world.-Gollum, scrawny, pathetic former owner of the ring who desires and fears it more than anything else.-Saruman the White (Saruman of Many Colors), the leader of the white council who studied the darkness too closely, becoming it's servant.-Birds, ominous clouds of fowl who spy for the enemy. No place open to the sky is safe from their piercing eyes.-Wolves and Wargs, minions of Saruman who hunt the fellowship and drive them into the Mines.-Orcs and Trolls, dwellers in dark places and servants of the enemy, they are numerous and foul and always seem to turn up at the worst times.Besides the awesomeness, there are a few things to consider (though they don't change my rating):One, the songs are lengthy, numerous and everywhere. Not too bad in print because you have the option to skim past (though I think it worth it to read them all at least once), but I hear you have no choice but to listen to all of them in the audiobook. However, I do have a favorite among them: the longform version of Hey Diddle Diddle, which I believe comes along in the town of Bree.Two, this is a long book, purposely so according to the note from Tolkien in the frontmatter of the book. His goal was to write a long book, and he succeeded. But he did it well, so that doesn't bother me. Considering some of the epic fantasies written since whose individual books are longer than the entire combined Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I don't think they're too long.Three, there is no three. I like everything else.I recommend this to anyone, preferably in print. If you find you can't tackle the book, go see the movie. It's not an exact match, but it definitely channels the best of Tolkien in a format most can enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I like this book because it is a mix of both fantasy and adventure and you will have deep thought about the characters and you will enjoy this book.

Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience.

Hobbits are little people that are cheerful and shy. The main character in this book is a hobbit named Frodo who must go on a perilous adventure. This book also contained a lot of sensory language.

Now that I am reading the Lord Of The Rings series, I knew why I thought that this is boring.It is because I was a little kid and didn't understand it very well. What I am saying is that I think that this should be a book for kids that are in middle school or higher because it has easy understanding but you have to concentrate more on this book than other books (for me at least).I am not saying that little kids shouldn't read this, but I am recommending it to an older audience because it is a little more complex than other books.

Have fun."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is the finest piece of writing that I have ever read. The Fellowship of the Ring though it is a rather old book, it still is very good. The Author starts out by telling about the events of what happened in the book The Hobbit and then goes on to tell about the events that currently are happening in Hobbiton, which is where the majority of hobbits in the story live and are from. Without giving away too much, the story then takes a turn for the worst, and the hero of the story, Bilbo Baggins, Must take the ring of power once held by Sauron, where is must be destroyed. The bulk of the first book in the series is about the journey to rivendell, which is where the elves are located, and then they must get south to the area close to Rohan and Gondor, the humans civilizations in the story. The book in my opinion is a good book because the characters are all developed very well, and they all have a back-story behind them, and they all have something to tell and for the most part seems blank in the story. The author is very descriptive in his writing, and likes to share a lot of details with the reader that would normally be left out of other books because of time restraints, or other reasons that need not be discussed. The basic factor behind this book is that the author is so good that the book works around the few problems that it has, and works through them with tremendous steam driving force. The problems that the book mostly experiences are that, the author sometimes goes too in depth with detail, and he sometimes drags on and on with certain parts. Some may find this very interesting, but from where I stand it goes on too long some times, and doesn't really progress to anything of real importance that may be used by the reader. But some believe that when the author goes into this extreme depth that he gets a point across, he sometimes does this but other times the detail just goes on and on without getting anywhere. The major strong points of this movie are that the characters are given real depth and they know what their doing based on what that type of character would normally decide in that situation, and not what the author would decide if He was there in that condition, and based on this the book accomplishes the factor that those characters have a very humanistic quality to them, and they always know where they are going based on their conditions. The characters though there are many of them, all have a very unique quality that they share with one another and themselves that they always want to accomplish a certain goal for the group and themselves. For example the character Boromir in the story is from the nation of Gondor, he comes with the Fellowship in about the middle of the story, when the fellowship is first formed. He comes to accomplish his own goals with the ring; he wishes to use the ring for good and not to destroy it, without giving too much away this will eventually bring about the end of him, because of his greed for the ring, which shows real humanistic quality and how someone would genuinely react to this sort of instance that may occur for them. Overall I would say that this book is a genuinely the best that I've read, for the most part it overcomes the obstacles and passes through the trenches to become an award-winning book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When I first started this book I thought it to be another boring fantasy adventure book, then Frodo left Hobbiton and from there-on-out I was compleatly hooked.

They are all off on an action packed adventure to destroy a ring of power that evil is trying to get their hands on. If they do there is no stopping them from conquering good. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books. So be sure to read this book by J.J.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I LOVE this series!I LOVE the descriptions of history and the maps as well... they really help create this world. Tolkien is a genious... I have no Idea where he came up with this wonderful story, AMAZING that someone could just pull an entire world out of thin air with such clairity, down to the moss on a single stone!The book was also refreshingly free of lots of writing cliches (how rare!)The only bad thing about this series is the sleep you'll lose from staying up all night reading it.... You wont be able to put it down! I read it in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The movie version is good but the book is where you'll find the true joy. Tolkien can be hard to read if you don't have patience and a strong imagination. Some parts of the book are long in detail and short in happenings. Others seem too quick and light on detail. Tolkien sometimes skips around and you don't get to see everything that's happened. Instead you experience from outside view. But all this is as it's meant to be. Being with a single character every moment and knowing exactly what's happening at every instant would make for a boring read. Tolkien weaves magic by keeping you guessing and not always letting you see exactly what's happening. For the impatient reader I say stick with it. It's a journey worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The book,The Fellowship of the Ring , is classified as a Fantasy or maybe even Science Fiction,but the author writes it likes it's history. It's a lot different than any other fantay I've ever read because it's not the kind of book that you can tell like a bed time story. The story is written like hard-core facts.And who's to say that it isn't?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the RingsThe Lord of the Rings is a novel written by one of the most famous authors ever, JRR Tolkien. The novel is actually broken up into 3 parts, the first part is \`The Fellowship of the Rings', the 2nd is \`The Two Towers', and the 3rd is \`The Return of the King'. These books in that order are a follow up to the even more famous book by him \`The Hobbit'. The Lord of the Rings takes you on an adventure with four young hobbits and their companions to destroy the ring that was placed before them. Before I go on you need to know that a Hobbit is a small creature that is about to of our size and they are peaceful creatures that live in one place and enjoy staying were they are.The main character of the story is Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit that grew up safe until being adopted by his uncle, the famous Bilbo Baggins. If you have ever read \`The Hobbit' then you would know who he is, and if you haven't read \`The Hobbit' then I recommend that you do before reading \`The Lord of the Rings'. Anyways, after Frodo is adopted by Bilbo he lives with him for quite so time, but soon Bilbo leaves leaving young Frodo alone with the adventure in front of him. Once underway, Frodo is accompanied by 3 other hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, 2 men and the famous Gandalf the wizard. Their journey starts from the elf homeland with the new fellowship, although it is a journey just getting there as you will soon find out.This book was one of the best books that I have ever came across, since I have never really found it easy to sit down and read a book, when I do it must be a really good book. If I were you I would read this book and if you don't like reading I think this book will even be enjoyable for you. JRR Tolkien did a wonderful job writing this book and its worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Anyone who does not enjoy this book most likely does not understand the use of language. Anyone who says it does not have a begining, middle or an end and/or compares it to the hobbit obviously lacks the knowledge that The Fellowship of the Ring is the begining to the ongoing story that is The Lord of the Rings. As for The Hobbit, it is one story, one part, it is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, which is one story, three parts. And all three parts are very good...very entertaining...very WONDERFUL. Generally speaking, The Lord of the Rings was intended for an intelligent audience. If you have a vocabulary of 350 words or more...CONGRATULATIONS...this book is for you.Some people may argue that Tolkien created hollow characters, that is a falsity. He, in fact, created complex characters. They each have very different personallities and internal torment (at times in the book). Gandalf is an exception to this because Tolkien does not want you to know more about him than the characters. His personallity is mysterious, it would take away from the suprises in the story if it were any other way.Tolkien's advid decription of the characters' surroundings gives reality to the story. Some may say it is excessive, however, without it the story would lack individuality (which is why it it so great in the first place). Most readers are used to seeing this: \\"The door knob was shiney.\\" Tolkien readers would see this: \\"The glistening morning sun reflected cheerily off the now luminous surface of the door knob.\\" (This line is not in anyway of/by or related to Tolkien and is only intended to give a vague idea of his writting style.)He uses literary devices to enrich his stories much like the ancient Greek poet Homer. (Do not let this referance of history discourage you from reading this book.) THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS NOT BORING IN ANYWAY, SHAPE OR FORM! It is magnificently entertaining to the last page...AND BEYOND! We recommend this book to anyone who loves a good fantasy epic (and anyone else with the capability to read. Do not overlook this book, hidey ho!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Frodo, a young hobbit, has inherited a magic ring from his relative, Bilbo. Little does he know, that this ring can rule and destroy all of Middle-Earth. He and a Fellowship of nine must destroy this ring, or Middle-Earth will perish. Together, they seek Mt. Doom, the only force that can destroy the ring. They face many perils. In the end, for the most part, they succeed.This book was very exciting, I enjoyed it. It was Full of action and adventure. This Fellowship of Nine faced many dark creatures, and with the help of Gandalf, the strongest in their party, were victorious. Many demonic creatures are after them, they want to help their master, Sauron, get the ring. With this ring, Sauron can control all of Middle-Earth, but these nine devoted people will go to any lengths to make sure this doesn't happen. This book kept me on the edge of my seat.My favorite part of the book is when they had to pass through the Mines of Moria, a dark, dreadful place full of goblins and a firey demon. Gimli, the dwarf, helps Gandalf navigate through the dark mines. These mines were once inhabited by dwarves, and Gimli used to live in them. During the end, the Fellowship is attacked by Goblins. They fight them the best they can. They flee towards the exit when something bigger and more evil attacks them. A large, fiery, demon seeks to destroy them and get the ring to Sauron. Gandalf destroys this demon, but in the process of doing so, kills himself."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The first part of The Lord of the Rings is an amazing story of courage, friendship, and the war between good and evil. the story is about a young hobbit and his friends. Frodo Baggins is given the responsibility of destroying the One Ring, the ring that will give the evil Sauron the power to destroy all of Middle Earth. He leaves to the Cracks of Doom with nine companions, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. The Felllowsip is being pursued by the evil Ringwraiths, servents of Sauron. With the orcs and other evil creatures of Sauron at their trail, the weight of the ring on Frodo is terrible. As the Ringwraiths grow near, the desire to put on the ring is tremedous, and that is the one thing that will bring them nearer. The fight between Frodo and Sauron and Frodo and himself is weakening him. What will happen next? Im not telling you! READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book! I do not want to put it down. The ring has truly got me and is pulling me into this book. The closer I get to the end of it, the heavier it is. I can't wait to get into the other books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The entire Lord of The Ring trilogy, starting here, is that rare thing so often mentioned in literature but so rarely true -- the undisputed masterpiece. This book shows that Tolkien's imagination must have been truly boundless. It starts the trilogy by recounting the events of The Hobbit, adding and greatly enrichening them, and weaving them into the tale of the Ring. It then goes on to tell of the Fellowship and sets the characters off on their journey. The book is so epic, so wide in scope that readers come away feeling that they have just read a true account, an actual happening from an actual world; such is the book's power. Tolkien has really described the whole world of Middle-Earth and its people in such striking and vivid detail that one can only be in awe. Apart from the striking array of richly drawn characters, a marvel in itself, Tolkien has created languages and entire histories for his characters, Hobbits of course being gone into in particular depth. This is a tale so epic, so novel, so bold that you are bound to like it regardless of your literary conventions. Tolkien's writing is very smooth -- though archaic seeming and a lot different from what we now see, which of course only adds to the marvel and sense of wonder -- and very poetic at times. It almost feels like reading poetry. There are of course lots of actual songs also. Not that the book is perfect. It is a bit overlong, and some parts drag. The walking bits seem particularly slow, as does The Council of Elrond, necessary though it is. There are also too many songs for my taste, ingenious though they are. Still, few books come closer to mastery. This is one of the books that all should be able to say they've read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is about the journey of Frodo and his companions. Frodo is a hobbit who lives in the Shire with his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. On the day that the book starts, it is Frodo's and Bilbo's birthday and Bilbo celebrates with a grand party with presents for all. In the middle of the party Bilbo vanishes and leaves a ring for Frodo. This ring is the beginning of his journey and the end of his normal life. Frodo learns of the power of the ring and of the dark forces of Sauron, who wish to steal the ring and slay its bearer. Frodo begins his journey with his companion Sam Gamgee. In the rest of the book, they acquire more alliances and companions to aid them in their quest to destroy the ring and save middle earth, and this is known as The Fellowship of the Ring.This book is recommended because of the suspense of Frodo's journey and the story behind it. There are many good chapters in the book, and it will rarely leave readers with a boring moment. Readers may wish that the book had is a bit more detail on the story behind the Ring Wraiths of Mordor. The book is a bit hard to understand if read through too fast because of the old style speech that some of the characters use. In some chapters, readers must really pay attention, such as The Council of Elrond, because of the detail Tolkien goes into and what will become of the ring. If one likes fantasy books with elves, orcs, goblins and wizards, read this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This trilogy has to be one of the greatest epic ever written. The book will be pass on from one generations to the next. It has to be one of the greatest book ever written. Mr. Tolkien started all the middle earth, hobbits, orcs, dwarfts, and etc. He will always be remember as the greatest author ever! A must read for everyone who knows how to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was a wonderful book! I recommend it to people who like long adventurous books. Kids would love this book as well."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"\\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" is about how a small hobbit named Frodo receives a ring. The only thing he doesn't know is that this is the ring of evil power, the one in which evil could engulf the entire world under the power of the Dark Lord. The story is about Frodo's journey with eight companions to destroy the ring. Though people may die on the way, the fellowship still holds up but faces dangers. In the book there is a suspenseful paragraph about the beginning of the story. \\"Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, one for the Dark Lord on his dark throne in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\\""},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read a great deal of books. When I first purchased this book, I was asked if I have ever read this book. My answer was no. I was told that I could never be consider a reader until I read this series. After reading fellowship, I understood why. I really like Tolkein's imagination. The characters (especially Legolas and Tom Bombadill) are incredibly interesting. Also, I can see that there are two storylines brewing, which makes this story all the more captivating."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is an amazing book... If you've seen the movie, see how much it deviates from the original story (hint: it's a lot)! 'Tis a wondrous tale, that deserves recognition, the world over.

It really gives in-depth details and allows you to imagine the setting clearly. There were very exciting and fun parts of this book that keeps your attention. One of my favorite parts is in the beginning with the party, when Frodo gets the ring, and the plot starts to take form.On the down side of this book, the details and descriptions I mentioned can get too long. There was simply a lot of dialogue. If you can manage the downside, this book is for you, it will leave you with memories of a world that you will not forget."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the rings dosn't really stand out in my mind even though I read the book only recently. I did however relativly enjoy reading it. This is probably because I have never read the rest of the series. The book is based on a long journey of a group of people across various lands throught you get this great sense of an adventure.Looking back on the story as if you were actually their yourself is not very difficult with this book. The problem is that the book leaves you at a very odd place. This seemed strange even though I do know of the rest of the series. This was one of the better stories I have ever heard even though I am only a third of the way through, but I defenitly recomend reading the rest of the series along with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What Clancy and Ludlum did for mystery trillers and King did for horror Tolken did for fantasy. When I first read the book 4 years ago I was amazed at the great attention to detail Tolken paid to the world he had created inside of his head. This isn't just a story of 9 guys being chased through the woods for 400 pages, it is about their myths, culture history and way of life. Now some have criticized the language and I can see where that would throw some people off, however if you just let it flow over you it can really get insense. Now personally I myself feel a little annoyed with the characters seemingly endless urge to compose songs and poems, but I can see how this adds a lot to the storyOverall-This book is incredible and you need to read it become you see the movie, otherwise you will be absolutely clueless."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I must admit, I read this book purely because of the movie, partly because I&iexcl;m curious about the similarities between the two and partly because everyone says it&iexcl;s a good book.After reading the book, I&iexcl;m going to agree that it is a good book. IF you can read through the first 100 or so pages and have a faint recollection of what it was about. It&iexcl;s not that it&iexcl;s written badly, more like it&iexcl;s written too detailed, often I&iexcl;ll find myself reading a long paragraph and catch my mind wandering instead of taking in what&iexcl;s happening in the story. And I can tell you, it&iexcl;s extremely irritating to read the same paragraph a hundred times.For the most part, this is a serious book, it also contains some comic relief from one of the supporting characters like Merry or Pippin.There are heaps of action and adventure in the story C At Moria, meeting the nine riders and a lot more. But unfortunately there are also quite a bit of boring parts, mostly describing the scenery, that would've been fine if it wasn't described every other page.But there&iexcl;s a reason why this is a classic, it is an engaging and grand story, and if you haven&iexcl;t read it, definitely do, even if it is just to find out what the fuss is all about."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"My mother has been reading this book aloud to us.

And I was not wrong. THe Fellowship of the rings is a unique novel unlike any I've ever read before. With a colorful cast of characters (my favorite being Aragorn), The Fellowship of the rings is quite an entertaining novel. I had very high expectations when I first picked it up, and though I was a bit disappointed I still found it to be quite a wonderful read. I am defiantly reading the next two books in the trilogy. I recommend it to any fans of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I've read so many bad things about the Lord of the Rings books that I really didn't think that I would like this book. Now that I've read it, I don't think that the word &quot;like&quot; would do the book justice. The Fellowship of the Rings is a true classic, and the book really deserves its popularity.This is the well-known story of Frodo. He has the unfortunate destiny of being the bearer of a ring that could give the dark forces of Middle Earth unbeatable power. Frodo, along with some friends is given the task of traveling into the middle of those dark forces to destory the ring.That is a really, really, really simplistic synopsis of the plot of the novel. Tolkien created an entire world within the pages of the book and the reader gets all of it. The creation is really amazing, and the writing itself is not bad. The characterizatioin are very good. The prose isn't archaic, and it flows nicely giving the reader each emotion that Tolkien meant for the reader to have. There is a lot of action. It is always exciting. I am only sad that I put off reading the book until I saw that a its movie was about to come out. I know that millions of readers have enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and millions more will surely read and be captivated by this in centuries to come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the GREATEST book of all times(besides the rest of the Lord of the Ring trilogy and the Hobbit.)!!! The reading is a little tough. It is the best book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"He is the Shakespeare and Homer of the 20th century. He takes a genre once associated only with acne-faced teenage boys and elevates it to literary excellence. His selection as Writer of the Century was well-deserved to say the least.Written mostly during Europe's WWII years, the symbolism of that war lies heavily in his novels (See especially &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter in Vol. 3 &quot;The Return of the King&quot;)His epic story has a background color and richness that rarely exists in today's literary works. He built his own languages from the syllables on up, his appendices and notes lend depth and history to his works, he is truly the only fantasy write to literally create a world. Every sentence that spills from the mouths of his characters hints at a world that we are only scratching the surface of.The poetry and lore that his characters express hint at the many volumes that Tolkien could have written if time would have allowed it. Rarely have I seen a fantasy writer who could put such a large amount of high quality verse and rhyme into their works.Almost every fantasy author of the last 30 years must tip their hat in Tolkien's direction. I have yet to find a noteable fantasy author who didn't mention Tolkien in their list of inspiring/influencing authors.I can only hope that on the eve of the long awaited Lord of the Rings movies that would-be Tolkien Cinema fans take the time to read the epic fantasy saga that made the movies possible."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

This book cannot be classified as fantasy, epic or anything because it truly stands alone. I was a bit suprised to see it only got 4 1/2 stars, but then I read the reviews. I can understand the frustration of the half dozen people who gave it one star. By their own admission, most are under eighteen and were perhaps forced to read it. I also put this book down as boring when I was in high school because it was like taking a valium; it put me to sleep. I picked it up again when I was about 28 and could not believe how good it was. It is undoubtedly one of the great English language works ever created. Over the next ten years I re-read my copy of the trilogy so many times it literally fell apart. My wife gave me a deluxe edition a few years ago and I once again cruised through it this summer. I don't attempt to read it word for word but simply dwell in Middle Earth for a while. I am now 41 and appreciate it more than ever. So if you are having trouble with it now, wait a few years and try again. You may eventually catch up to it.

The fellowship of the ring is from the beginning to the end a linguistic maze; those who have troubles with beautiful; almost poetic, language; will not appreciate this, but set aside that; and look only at the contains of this work, and you'll realize what a brilliant mind Tolkien had, noticeably is that he took much inspiration from Nordic, Preussic and Greek mythology; which adds to the atmosphere and feeling of this book, everything feels real; authentic, as if it was written in experience, I've read David Eddings, I've read Elizabeth Moon, but they are just mere pale copies compared to J.R.R Tolkien, (not saying they're bad though, just emphasizing on how great Tolkien is). This is a book that really is best experienced alone, in a dark room, with some soft moody music and just enough light to read, be terrified, be amazed, be astounded.To those who have yet to read this, and these books: I am in envy, the first experience of them is incredible, just put a little effort into it, and you will be rewarded times 1000."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the best fantasy novel that I've ever read!

However, not only does Tolkien's Middle Earth capture us, we also are taken by Frodo's brave journey.

Tolkien. It is a story of Middle-Earth, where Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and all sorts of other races live. Set in a medieval-type setting, with medieval weapons and archetecture while combining fantasy and magic with realistic things. Though this book starts off a little slow, like a marble down an inclined plane it gains momentum til it reaches the suspenseful conclusion (to be continued in The Two Towers).Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit), relative of Bilbo Baggins who found the One Ring and took it from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, inherits the Ring from Bilbo. He soon learns that it is a corrupting Ring, the One Ring into which Sauron the Dark Lord poured all his wrath and malice in to. Gandalf the Wizard advises him to 'keep it secret, keep it safe' until he returns. He returns to tell Frodo that the what the One Ring really meant and that it must be thrown into the Cracks of Doom, the one place where it could be destroyed. This happened to be in the middle of the evil kingdom of Mordor where Sauron was regaining power, searching for the Ring, and preparing to destroy all that was good. Frodo, along with Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Sam, journeys to Bree where they meet Aragorn the Ranger and eventually reach Rivendell, all the while pursued by the Ringwraiths. There in Rivendell, the Fellowship that would take the Ring to Mordor to be destroyed was formed: Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard, Boromir of Gondor, and Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam. They then embark on there quest: through Moria and Lorien, and many other places wonderful and terrible. Will they ever finish their quest?J.R.R. Tolkien weaves a masterful tale in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, to be continued by &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. His style of writing, plus the constant surprises and happenings, make this a wonderful story, a timeless classic for generations to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I believe that Lord of the Rings part one deserved 4.5 stars(out of five). It started off slow, but it leaves you wanting more. If you liked the Hobbit, this book is a must read. If you have not read the Hobbit, and you are planning on reading the Fellowship, I recomend reading the hobbit first so that you can see what the ring appears to be, and get an idea of what the main characters are like. But if your even going start to read it, you should at least be a little bit interested in fantasy types of books. And if you are even thinking about it being like Harry Potter, Ill tell you now, its not(its better).The main characters are frodo(A hobbit), Gandalf(A wizard), Aragorn/Strider(A king and a ranger),Sam(A hobbit),Merry and Pippin(Also hobbits), Legolas(An elf),Gimli(A dwarf),and Borimir (A king of men). These individuals were banded together in Rivindel to make the Fellowship of the ring. Thier mission was to destroy the one ring. Why destroy it?Well,the Dark Lord Sauron forged a ring that he invested all his powers into wich made him powerful enough to destroy Middle Earth. But only was it powerfull when he wore it. It was in the last attempt to fight against the armies of Sauron that Isuldir the king at that time, cut the ring from Saurons hand and took it for himself. Although the ring when in possetion of someone other than Sauron had a way of persuading the barer to wear it,for when they put it on it reveals to Sauron were the ring is. Isildir was ambushed and the ring was lost at the bottom of a lake for thousands of years until a creature named gollum or smeagol found it and hid far under the mountains under its influence. It wasnt untill Bilbo Bagins found the ring and brought it back to the shire(His home),that the ring was in good hands. Although the ring can only be destroyed in the fires of MT. Doom were it was forged, and is also were the armies and the stronghold of Sauron lay. Therefore the book is about the struggle to destroy the one ring and what the Fellowship has to do to get the ring to MT. Doom. Many battles will be fauhgt to rid the world of something so small.So if that plot doesnt interest you, I dont know what will. So I encourage you all to read The Fellowship of the Ring and all its sequals."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I'm sure much has been written about the Lord of The Rings series but basically, get through the first 100 pages or so and you'll get caught in the most masterful fantasy saga written to this day!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I am writing this critique as an English project, but also as an active reader.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R. Tolkien's gift to the world. Tolkien did not just write a book, he created his own world full of different people, places, cultures, creatures, legends, and languages. The land of Middle-Earth is a place that he describes so vividly that you can just envision yourself there. The way he builds each of his characters' personalities, you feel an amazing amount of empathy towards them... Its almost as though you are right there with Frodo and Sam eating mushrooms, or fighting the evil Uruk-hai with Legolas and Aragorn.In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, we follow a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins on his path to save the world. You see, young Frodo inherits a ring of power that was created by a dark lord named Sauron. This ring has incredible amounts of power that Sauron wants to use to take over the world. Frodo, along with his hobbit buddies, a powerful wizard named Gandalf, an elf called Legolas, the dangerous human Aragorn, who is heir to the throne of Gondor, a dwarf who calls himself Gimli, and another human called Boromir, are on a path to destroy it. The ring that they are on this fateful quest to dispose of has a mind of its own. It wants to return to Sauron, and will manipulate the minds of its beholders until it gets there. Ridding the world of the ring is not an easy task. The ring can only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was created, and Mount Doom is in the center of Sauron's fiery kingdom. This book is part one in a trilogy.I gave this book five stars, because its one of those you just can't help but enjoy. I would recommend it to those who like to read, but be warned, its plot, with it's many characters, can be complicated."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is maybe one of the best books ever written. This book is a must read for anybody that enjoys fantasy novels. get it"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read Lord Of The Rings The Fellowship Of The Ring. The book was written by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is the first book of the trilogy.The book is about Frodo inheriting a magic ring from old Bilbo Baggins. Frodo left his home in the Shire with three other Hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They go to an inn and meet Strider who helps them on their quest. They go to Rivendell to seek the council of Elrond. After they get there, the four hobbits and Strider get some help. The new company is made of Strider, Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gandolf the Grey, Legolas, Borimier, and Gimli. Now they must go to Mount DOOM!This book would be best for anyone who likes swordplay and gore. You should read the Hobbit first. It will give you a good background of the Trilogy. The book gives you a lot more detail but you can&#65533;t get a good picture in your head. The movie of course gives you an extreme picture but lack&#65533;s some good detail, but no character background. I liked them both the same."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was an incredible book. I couldn't believe how much I was in the adventure, and how much I felt for the characters. J.R.R. Tolkien does a tremendous job of attracting readers of all ages. This book, along with the others, are loaded, from cover to cover, with adventure. It seems that as soon as the fellowship gets out of trouble, there's another group of orks, wizards, or any of these creatures that are described in great detail. This is one of only a couple of books that I actually felt and cared for what would happen to Frodo, Aragon, and the rest of the fellowship og the ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the novel The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring as an exercise for his profession in linguistics. The beautifully written adventure is about a man and an important task that befell him.The tale begins in a small hill in Hobbiton called Bag End where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins dwell. Frodo receives and heirloom from Bilbo that will put him on an adventure of a life time. He leaves Hobbiton with only one companion but ends up with eight, also meeting friends along the way. As Frodo passes through the land of Middle Earth, he meets great evil, but he also has his friends to help him through.As I read this book, I kept thinking about how the story was an epic battle between good and evil. Every day Americans face bad situations with drugs and violence. This is a great book for the adventurous at heart and people who want to travel to a distant land with out actually going anywhere. Tolkien uses great feeling and emotion when writing the elvish songs and chants. He also describes the landscape so well you can visualize it in your mind. In one of the songs, it talks about an elvish queen, Galadriel, and the land she rules, Lothlorien. \\"An elven-maid there was of old, a shining star by day: Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, her shoes of silver grey. A star was bound upon her brow, a light was on her hair, as sun upon the golden boughs, in fair Lorien the fair\\". I highly recommend this book to any one who loves adventures and I also would recommend that you would wait to read the series until about seventh grade. Over all on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 15!In conclusion, this story about a man and his adventure was excellently written and well thought out and a wonderful story for all who might take the time to read it. I think that you should definitely read this series starting with The Hobbit so you will fully understand the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings twice, and each time, I have a hard time putting it down. I've got my son reading it now."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I choose to read the classic J. R. R. Tolkien book Lord of the Rings, specifically the Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of the now famous trilogy. I choose to read it because I am a fan of both movies and have heard from several people that it is an outstanding book. I would have to say that I agree with these assessments, though I feel it was a little long winded at times.The story is entertaining, at time engaging, and the most wonderful aspect of the entire book is that Tolken masterfully creates a world of fantasy that becomes alive in the readers mind. If you really try, you can imagine a Middle Earth consisting of Dwarfs, Elves, and Hobbits fighting for the survival of the human race. Tolken takes so much care in depicting the ordinary lifestyle of hobbits that it almost makes their life seem interesting when really it is boring. However, it is brought to life with astounding detail to their habits and makes it very easy for the reader to imagine knowing a hobbit.One thing that must be made clear is that there is a world of difference between the movie and the book. Though the movie moves at a thunderous pace the book opts to be more cautious and deliberate as the tale unfolds. Of course Tolken had an entire book to work with while the movie has only three hours to unfold one of the premier science fiction stories of all time. The movie also leaves out important details about the story such as the time which passes when Frodo seizes control of Bag Ends, and the departure of Bilbo. In the movie it seems as though very little time elapses between these events however in the book it explains that no less than nine years passes before Gandalf comes to Frodo with news of the ring.Also there are several chapters in the middle of the book which tell of the hobbits journey from the Shire to the rendezvous with Gandalf. Important characters are introduced and bonds are strengthened and it seems like a relevant part of the story to me, which should not have been completely overlooked in the movie.The story is simply unique in its ability to capture the imagination of readers from many age groups. Though younger teens may have difficulty understanding more of the abstract aspects of the story the action and adventure of the story will surely keep them interested and older readers appreciate the shear genius of the story as they watch the carefully crafted tale unfold in three dazzling installments.Though I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the book more than the movie (I am of the MTV generation after all), I can truly say that the book was enjoyable to read. It has interesting underlining themes I believe about racism and judging people and the ability of people of all size and stature to achieve in the most outlandish of tasks. If you need a little inspiration or you feel that you just don't measure up to the task at hand, just look at Frodo Baggins, the small hobbit who had to save the entire world from doom. It will definitely make you feel just a little bigger, and perhaps push you to achieve your goal.The Fellowship of the Ring is a classic, and all classics deserve to be read. So if you are looking for a good book to read be sure to keep the Lord of the Rings as an option because books of it's quality are rare, and if you are a fan of the movie ( which has broken into the top ten grossing films of all times) it will help you garner a new appreciation for the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Call me a heretic if you will, but while I found _The Fellowship of the Rings_ to be an incredibly vivid and imaginative tale, I also found that in many places, it dragged. Tolkein was a genius, no doubt about that; however, he was also a bit obsessed with an insane number of details about the world he created. Naturally, this is partly why so many people love his books immensely, but for those of us who are more interested in advancing the story than in the lineage of a hobbit or elf, the intricate details can truly weigh the book down quite a lot. On the other hand, the details in the scene-setting are wonderful - it's probably more a case of \\"one woman's drek is another's dream\\" and so forth. I reckon there's more than one person out there who hates the lavish settings, but loves the history and storytelling-through-song.As a linguist, Tolkein definitely got the language details *right* throughout this series - his efforts there are extraordinary. And, while some people no doubt find the frequent songs in the book charming and entertaining, I generally found myself clenching my teeth to get through them. Further, characters like Tom Bombadil had really interesting elements, but most of them were buried in his too-merry flouncing and bopping about. I would have loved to have seen more discussion of his relationship with nature, and less of the \\"hey-ho, Bombadillo!\\"Overall, though, this is the kind of story that parents should read to their children, letting them get swept away in the vast realm of Middle Earth. Fan of fantasy will likely also enjoy seeing where many of the standards of the genre came from. While there are parts of it went really slowly for me, it was worth the time spent.Now, for the inevitable comparison between the book and the film, for those who have experienced one but not the other. Personally, and I could easily be hunted down and thrashed for this...I enjoyed the movie more. It eliminated many of the slower areas of the tale that I didn't enjoy, yet still remained largely true to the story. Many of my die-hard Tolkein-loving friends agree that the movie did an excellent job, and that secretly, some of them enjoyed it better, too.Still, it would be worth picking up a copy of the book to see if you'd really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole, when it was written, founded a new genre in the world of Literature. It did not &quot;set influence&quot; the concept of fantasy writing, it INVENTED the concept. These books are timeless and are rightfully placed in the ranks of books such as Candide, The Republic, Paradise Lost, and other truly classic literature. The levels of meaning range from the literal to the esoteric. While the new movies may be spuring new interest in Middle Earth, one must recall that Bilbo has lived for almost a century despite a previous movie that was disgraceful. To read The Fellowship of the Ring simply as an introduction to ann upcoming movie is a disservice both to the reader and the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I came to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" straight after reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" which is one of my favorite books of all times. (I've read it about ten times). Although \\"The Fellowship\\" picks up, in a sense, where \\"The Hobbit\\" left off, the two books are quite different, and the difference for me was a bit of a culture shock--enough in the past to prompt me to quit reading about after fifty pages. But this time I persevered, and did not regret it!The culture shock: totally different pace. \\"The Hobbit\\" flies along, wastes no time, goes into less detail, and covers huge distances of time and geography in a few pages. \\"The Fellowship\\" goes about ten times slower, poring over detail, which, once I got used to it, became rather interesting and at times welcomed. (I admit, though, at times I did some skimming, especially when I sensed that Tolkien was revving himself up to create his own Hobbitish version of Norse mythology.)That said, the book, overall, is excellent (so much so that I'm presently three-fourths of the way through \\"The Two Towers\\"). It's a true adventure story, spirited, passionate, deep, and for me inspiring. (I'm soon embarking on a major life adventure, and have found myself surprised to find comfort from Tolkien.) I heartily recommend it to everyone and anyone, especially if you like \\"The Hobbit.\\"But here are my criticisms, though take them with a grain of salt, because again, I find \\"The Fellowship\\" excellent overall.1) Too many poems and songs! Boring! AAH, I started skipping them after about page fifty, with NO regrets at all. Tolkien gets a little poem-and-song happy for my taste.2) The whole scene with Tom Bombadil is pointless and boring--and too grandiose for my taste. Worth skipping over entirely, because not only does it detour from the tale, but actually detracts from it. Why did Tolkien put that in?3) Tolkien makes some silly and/or inconsistent plot decisions from the get-go. To give one of many possible examples, Strider's whole mission is to save the wandering hobbits, and yet he moronically lets them walk right into a dangerous tavern, whereas he could have introduced himself to them while he was spying on them earlier (when they were with Tom Bombadil, who knew Strider!), and prevented a near calamity.4) I felt it inconsistent that the Ringwraiths were on one hand so TOTALLY powerful and yet on the other hand so foolish and stupid. Didn't add up.But all that said, J.R.R., you ROCK!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I've been meaning to read it for years but never seemed to get around to it. I've loved the Hobbit and knew I would enjoy the Lord of The Rings, but just kept putting it off. Tolkein is truly a great writer. Typically I find that older books take more effort to read as the writing style just doesn't seem to flow easily. Pleasantly, this was not the case in Fellowship of the Ring. I was amazed by how fluent his writing style was for me. I was also very happy to note that a lot of the dialogue from the recent movie was taken directly from the book. It really made me appreciate the movie more. Peter Jackson really did a great job on the movies and it's evident that he's a true fan of the novels. That's about one of the highest praises I can give a movie, for they're usually nowhere near as good as the book. On to the review of the novel... *spoilers follow if you aren't familiar with the story*The Fellowship of the Ring takes place several decades after the Hobbit left off. Bilbo is now 111 (eleventy-one as Bilbo would say) and ready to go quietly off and enjoy his life to the end of his days. The ring is entrusted to Frodo's care. Through Gandalf's inquiries, we come to find out that the ring is the One Ring.\\"One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.\\"Frodo must leave the Shire to keep the Shire safe and keep the ring out of the hands of the Ringwraiths and Sauron. Frodo's travels take him through many treacherous paths and eventually he makes it to Rivendell, the house of Elrond. This seems to be where Frodo shows his true valor. He originally thought his journey was over since the ring was in Rivendell. But, he vows to take the ring to Mordor once he sees the turmoil it creates. It is truly an evil ring and will corrupt even those who would use it for good. Nine set out for Mordor to destroy the ring; Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragron (known by many names - Strider, the Ranger, and Isildur's heir), Boromir (a man and a son of Gondor), Legolas (an elf), and Gimli (a dwarf and son of Gloin who was one of the dwarves in the Hobbit on Bilbo's grand adventure).The book follows them through the mines of Moria (where Gandalf stands against a Balrog), to Lothlorien (where we meet Lady Galadriel), and down the river towards a decision yet to be made - through the marshes towards Mordor, or over the mountain pass towards Gondor. This is where the Fellowship of the Ring ends - the Fellowship has a parting of the ways - Frodo and Sam go in one direction and the fate of the others in another."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have to say that Tolkien is one of my top authors, period. The extensive work that he put into his literature is astounding. The man was a genius.I have to say, though, that the first 100 pages were hard to press through... and I couldn't get the characters from the movie out of my head. Anyway, after the first pages, the story really takes off.I literally could not put it down, which I don't do. I cannot wait to get the next two to read.Tolkien purposely made his stories without allegory, unlike his companion C.S.Lewis. He wanted people to draw many things from his stories, and not forced to comply to one story. However, there are a lot of lesson to be drawn from them.For instance, Borimere's state of weakness for betraying the fellowship that resulted from his personal lusts. However, he was redeemed and had his honor restored before his death."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Against all odds good overcomes evil in a struggle for middle Earth. Frodo is the ring bearer, he carries the all powerful ring. He is being hunted by the evil Sauramon, the creator of the ring. Frodo's goal is to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, the only place the ring can be destroyed. The only problem is everyone is turning evil, and they are al after Frodo. Can Frodo and his companions make it to Mt Doom. In this book I had many favorite parts. My favorite part is when they are traveling through the mines of Moria. This is my favorite part because that would be really cool if the mines were real. There are many themes that you can get from this book. The theme I got is never give up on what you are trying to do. In the book Frodo is going to make it to Mt Doom at all costs. There are many things that I like about this book. The main thing that I like is how descriptive the author is. The author describes things so well that it makes a vivid picture in your head. The only thing that I would change about this book is the reading level. He should lower the reading level and make the book easier to read.

Just finished The Hobbit and now after finishing the Fellowship I am on to The Two Towers. The best of the three is still The Return of the King. I am in my late 50's but I am prompting my grandchildren on being Tolkien Fans!If you haven't read the Hobbit and The Trilogy, please do. You will become instant Tolkien Fans too!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSilmarillionlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first publisher-created volume. It starts out much like THE HOBBIT: Bilbo Baggins throws a magnificent going-away party and sets out for parts unknown. He leaves most of what he owns behind to be inherited by his nephew Frodo, including a magic ring which has the interesting ability to make its wearer invisible. The Ring (always capitalized) also has the ability to confer apparently eternal life and youth, and this makes Gandalf, the Grey Wizard (who appeared in THE HOBBIT as well), suspicious of its provenance.Ultimately, Gandalf discovers that Frodo's Ring is indeed the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than a thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.Closely pursued by \\"The servants of Sauron\\" Frodo flees The Shire, taking the One Ring with him to the temporary haven of Rivendell, where lives Elrond the Half-Elven, a master of wisdom. After a long council, it is decided to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast.The Ring sets out in the company of a Fellowship consisting of four Hobbits, two Men, an Elf, a Dwarf, and Gandalf, but almost immediately their steps are dogged by The Enemy.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, particularly Book I, is very unlike the remainder of the trilogy. Tolkien was still clearly trying to write a sequel to THE HOBBIT, and so in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING there are some of the avuncular narrator's asides which either made THE HOBBIT so charming or so irritating to a reader, and a kind of chattiness and droll humor that is absent from the rest of the LORD OF THE RINGS, as in\\"Why are you eavesdropping?\\"\\"Beggin' your pardon, but there ain't no eaves in Bag-End, and that's a fact.\\"\\"He took along a supply of pipe-weed (but not enough, I'll warrant).\\"Tolkien also includes many of his own original poems and songs.Ironically enough, this disparate tone works spectacularly well, since it was entirely organic and not planned out. What starts out as a second journey There And Back Again transmogrifies by small increments into a classic epic tale of a Quest, drawing the reader along with it.Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, set a high standard for fantasy authors who came after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail. Thus, we are told that \\"wisps of fog, like steam, rose off the surface of the dark river,\\" and we know what the \\"muddy\\" ground is like, that a \\"sullen\\" rain fell, and even what the phase of the moon is.Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Elen sila lumenn' omentilvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting.\\" For what it is, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.And since this is being rereleased for the 75th Anniversary edition, apparently they've cleaned out some errors and replaced certain words with more archaic ones that Tolkien preferred.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I highly recommend this Audiobook version of The Fellowship of the Ring narrated by Rob Inglis. He has narrated each book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as The Hobbit. It is the only version of these books that I will listen to. I am currently acquiring all of them. Rob Inglis is a great narrator, his voice is not grating, his variations of the characters & creatures voices are wonderful, and his singing is also great. I, personally, think there are no other versions of this on audiobook that can come close to comparing. For some, the fact that they are not available for download (or at least, not that I have found) maybe be an issue, but I think it is more than worth it to buy each set on CD."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I remember reading these books in the 6th grade.

Everyone wants it, including the evil Sauron, who sends dark riders after Frodo to get it. Frodo flees, but he's alone on the road with his witless hobbit friends. They somehow manage to make their way to Rivendel and regroup, and agree to start on a long trip to destroy the ring. Frodo is given suitable escort. This escort is made up of the best sword, bow, ax, and magic warriors around. Even with this escort he is hounded every step of the way by the enemy. If you love a great fantasy world with a vigorous journey, then this is the book for you. I would recommended this book to anyone who is able to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Because &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is only the beginning third of the Lord Of the Rings novel, readers should know that it will not follow a typical plot line. Instead, the reader will find an extraordinary amount of time dedicated to introducing us to the fictional world of Middle-earth. For the fan of fantasy books, the read will be an engulfing experience, but for the person just venturing into this literary area and who are use to more straightforward prose that moves the plot forward, it may be challenging.Many may find that they are unsure if they can continue on with the following two parts, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King&quot;. Let me reassure you that as the novel progresses you will not be disappointed. At the end of Fellowship and into the Two Towers, the book will literally hit its stride as the adventure of Frodo, Strider, and the rest of Fellowship unfolds.The entire story of The Lord of the Rings is truly a classic and one that will be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to immerse themselves in this glorious tale."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have a friend who for years tried to get me to read the Tolkien books. She fell in love with them in the 70s when they were very popular and wanted to share them with everyone. I'm not really into narrative prose--although I occasionally read a murder mystery of the classic \\"who-done-it\\" type--so I have never read the books, Fern's efforts not withstanding. When the recent Peter Jackson film Lord of the Rings came out, I was very taken with the trailers for it and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was about. Needless to say, like many people, I was totally taken with the color, the scenery, the characters and the adventure of the movie. I decided to read some of the books before the advent of the next film, The Two Towers, so that I could be better prepared to enjoy and appreciate it. My first venture into Tolkien's style was The Hobbit or There and Back Again, which I managed to read in a matter of a few hours.Because the film had initially sparked my interest, I read part one of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, from which the action of the movie was taken. This book is considerably more complex in style than The Hobbit, and probably represents a more mature writer. (In checking the copywrite dates, I discovered that The Hobbit was, in fact, written in the 1930s, while the Fellowship appears to have been copywrited in the 1950s shortly before the author had retired from his academic career.) It's narration is much more convoluted, with great attention given to environmental detail and more space devoted to poetry, some of it exquisite--and I don't normally like poetry--than in the earlier work, perhaps reflecting the author's intention to appeal to a more adult audience. While The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the Lord of the Rings is a more sophisticated fantasy. The bard like style, the poetical interludes, the almost Celtic character of the story, and the author-created languages reflect Tolkien's background as a linguist, philologist, and translator of Anglo-Saxon poetry. It is almost as if he is writing a history of the parallel world of elves, halflings, and dwarves that mankind believed existed around them during the early middle ages, a delightful and frightful world of magic and mystery that modern man misses for all his scientific and technological advances!An enjoyable if brief suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and the mythical, mystical world of Middle Earth in which it takes place, have enthralled millions of readers. This book, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" is the first part of that legendary saga, which tells of the discovery that the magic ring given to Frodo Baggins by his uncle Bilbo is indeed the One Ring, forged by the dark lord Saroun, which would give him unstopable distructive power if he reclaims it. Therefore, it is decided that Frodo should embark on a perilous quest to destroy the evil, corruptive ring by casting it back in the Cracks of Doom where it was originally forged - in the very center of Saroun's stronghold, the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie - resulting in the ultumate good-versus-evil struggle - one which will captivate you, shock you, thrill you, scare you, and, yes, deeply move you. This first part will leave you breathless.If it is possible to improve upon Tolkien's already perfect text, Rob Inglis has done so in this complete and unabriged audiobook performance. From the moment he begins to read the story to you, you are totally immersed in the world and the peoples - both good and evil - that inhabit it. Each character is given a distinctive voice that perfectly suits his or her personality as described by Tolkien in the novel. He shifts from character to character flawlessly, perfectly balancing them all, almost making the listener believe that the real character, not just an actor, is providing their lines. During the passages where Inglis simply acts as narrator and not as any perticular character, he proves himself the perfect person to guide the listener through Middle Earth. He embraces the diversity of the story, and uses just the right tones to set the mood for the scene and to get his audience truly involved in the groundbraking epic.This performance - like the book - is flawless, and is a true listening experience. Pick this title up; no matter if you have loved Middle Earth for a lifetime or are just a kindly newcomer seeking to immerse yourself in the exciting, perilous world, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The first part of the book shows what the Hobbits are. This partis rather too long and maybe boring. You can learn all about theHobbits though. The book becomes really enjoyable from the nextchapter. The story is very thrilling and mythical. Tolkien usesmany motifs of medieval epic, Arthurian romance, Celtic legendand Old English poems. We can entry into the old-fashionedworld of story of adventure.Also Tolkien uses many styles of English- a colloquial expressionbetween the hobbits, a bit Middle- English like dialog by theelves and kings, a daialectal talk by the hobbit Sam and others.Reading this book, you can read all kinds of speeches and evenpoems."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy are one of the finest books written. Many other fantasy books included a lot of magic, evil wizards, big wars and happy endings. The Trilogy are fantasy books that are like no others. It mainly centers on a great journey to destroy an evil, with wars and evil wizards as just additions. Even the usage of magic is rare except when it comes to the evil Rings' seduction. The evil seduction is just one of the aspects that makes this books' plot dark so you should not expect a fairytale Narnia story.Many would find these books strange, for example, Tolkien does not create the characters personalities etc. throughtout the books but only changes them yet this makes the characters more believable. The books though, are not for the weak-willed readers since you need patience and a good imagination.Tolkien does not just create a plot and a load of characters in the books, but a whole new world so the books aren't simple. Yet this makes them amazing. It's the Star Wars of fantasy fiction. Every detail that Tolkien has written draws you further into that world. This is the difference between the movie and the books: the movie doesn't draw you in. These books are not for you if you are looking for a Harry Potter, quick read kind of book the centers mainly on the plot.This is definatly one of those books that seem hard and boring to get into but then you keep reading and it gets better. We've all had one of those books so with this one you can't give up. It is the best book i have ever read and it beats the rest of the fantasy books. (And segmented into 7 books make the chapters fly.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books in The Lord of the Rings; a story set in the fictional world of Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that holds much of his power. His really wants his ring back and is controls some of the inhabitants Middle Earth. Through unknown ways, the ring is given to Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. Because of the ring, however, Frodo is caught up in business that will change Middle Earth forever.With Gandalf advice, Frodo sets out with three of his hobbit friends to keep the ring out of Sauron's hands. Lord Sauron's minions attack them, but, with the help of a man named Strider, they make it safely to Rivendell, a home of elves. There, with the help of Elrond, Frodo takes the task of taking the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the pits of hell in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. A Fellowship is created to help him, consisting of Frodo, his servant Sam, two other hobbits, Strider, Gandalf, an elf named Legolas, a dwarf named Gemini, and a man from the south named Boromir.The Fellowship heads south and tries to pass under the Misty Mountains through Moria, the ancient realm of the dwarves. There, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dum while protecting the party from a terrible demon called a Balrog. The rest of the party continues on to Lorien, the forest of the Galadrim elves, where the Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. From there, they go down the Anduin River by boat. When they must return to land, they cannot decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the sanctuary of Minas Tirith on the west. Boromir wants the ring and confronts Frodo, who decides that he must go to Mordor. However, Frodo cannot bear to take his friends with him or to subject them to further temptation, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. He does not, however, manage to escape his faithful friend Sam, so they set out together for the realm of the Dark Lord.I really liked this book it was good easy reading. I am a complete Fantasy guy so I loved that and it has a great plot. I really like Strider a lot but Lord Sauron is the coolest by far."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is the grim lesson learned by many who have sought the One Ring Of Power, a relic with powers of astonishing magnitude. Anyone who has ever possessed it has succumbed to its power... Except one. Frodo Baggins is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit. The ring that Bilbo found in that story is the One Ring, which was thought to be lost for centuries. Frodo is asked by Gandalf the Wizard to deliver the Ring to the town of Rivendell so that a council can decide how to destroy it before its maker Sauron revives himself and reclaims the Ring, then destroys the world. At the council, no one can agree on who should be the \\"Ring-Bearer\\" and bring the Ring to Mordor so that it can be destroyed. Along with Frodo go eight others, who are dubbed the Fellowship of the Ring. This includes Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn and Boromir, the humans, Legolas, the elf, Gimli, the dwarf, and the hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. But this is no easy task. Ringwraiths, trapped spirits forced to serve Sauron, are relentlessly searching for the Fellowship. What's more, Saruman (not to be confused with Sauron), a former ally, has become corrupt and obssesses over the Ring, and wants its power for himself. This is a great book, so if you haven't read it, at least check it out. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book was awesome!!!

There is a lot of anticipation as the journey progresses. No sooner do you think that the fellowship is in the clear that they are on the run again from the Black Riders and Sauron. This is a must read book, even if you saw the movie. Having seen the movie, it interested me even more to read the book and finish the trilogy to see the next two movies.

I look forward to listening to the other two books in the trilogy and The Hobbit unabridged once I'm finished listening to this book on CD."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have now passed my 50th Birthday several years ago and am having more difficulty reading the small print in some books. These Charnwood Series of books are just what the doctor ordered for me and those like me. I'm now looking for more from this line."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I came to the start of this trilogy of books as a reader that had only ever seen them portrayed in movies. So to actually read them for the first time was absolutely amazing. For any fan of the movies I highly recommend it! The world is much richer and more vibrant, with greater nuance and detail, and just an all around more vivid and brighter world than the movies could ever hope to portray. They still did a great job though!The characters were richly displayed and wonderfully drawn. The scenery and descriptions were like paintings with words, and the world as a whole was just unique and layered and believable. I loved reading about the mythology and history behind the story, as well as the built up languages and the songs and poetry that helped make it all have such a rich tapestry. Some people complain that it reads like a historical text and that it is dry and heavy instead of entertaining. I didn't find that true at all for me, but then again I love to read history books so perhaps that's saying something when I say I really loved this book!Since this book was supposed to be just the first two parts of a very long book it didn't follow the standard story arc and that ended up bothering me a bit. I'm used to a certain level of excitement and lead up to some sort of a climax to finish off the first book, but that didn't end up happening. A lot of the deviations that the movie made makes sense in this light. They needed to make the movie have more of a traditional arc or risk not having people come back for the rest of the series. Tolkein never intended the books to be published separately and so his story reflected that. As a result, for me, the end of the book after the Fellowship left Moria really dragged out for me. I didn't end up enjoying it as much as I had the earlier parts.All in all though I really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring. I highly recommend it for fantasy fans and for anyone that is a big fan of the movies. Getting to read more about your favorite characters is just one small part of getting a peek at the mythology, poetry and language of Tolkein's richly imagined world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"What can one say in a review of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that has not been said before? I do find reading the trilogy through adult eyes to be a very different experience than that which I had as a child. One focuses more upon the historical detail of the epic, like a connoisseur savoring the undertones of a rare vintage, rather than letting the adventure of consumption dictate the pace of the novel. Minutia surrounding the days of Numenor is appreciated more, as are references to the events of earlier days, such as the fate of the kings of Arnor. Personages like Elrond and Galadriel loom more powerfully due to their connection to the Eldar Days.The experience is also changed now due to the ever-present figure of Peter Jackson lurking just behind the text. At first, I found myself confounded by images of Elijah Wood as Frodo (despite the obvious age mismatch), Ian McKellan as Gandalf, and other character associations from Jackson's epic. As the story unfolded, however, I found Tolkien's characters emerge from out of the shadow of their silver screen brethren. (Indeed, it was partly to emancipate my imagination from the tyranny of the screen that I chose to re-read FOTR at this time.)Ultimately, the story springs forth just as magically as it did when I first encountered it at the age of twelve, with important differences. Above all else, I feel the great sadness of characters like Galadriel, who realize that their time in Middle Earth is finally drawing to a close no matter what the outcome of the quest. An unfulfilled longing lies beneath the text which surprised me as something I had not felt so keenly before.The word reserved for such books is overused, but nonetheless appropos:Masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The fellowship of the ring is the first instalment in J.R.R. Tolkien's THe Lord of the Rings (technically it is the second, it takes place after The Hobbit). I liked the book very much. I very recently have seen the 3 movies.Then I started reading the books.The book had words that I couldn't pronounce. there was stuff like tumbalemorna.Seriously. The book was alittle on the long side so only read it if you wil stick with it.It is boring in the beginning but gets awsome action.You guys should read the book it is a great read!-Alex"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is a classic. If you haven't read this book your missing out. It is one of the best-selling books of all time and I can see why. The eloquent vocabulary and side storylines are what make this book great, along with the incredible sensory detail which prints a picture in your head of exactly what the author means to tell you. It's less like reading and more like imagining.The story takes place in a pre-medieval age but not in Europe, in a place called Middle Earth. Middle Earth is inhabited by many magical creatures including elfs, men, wizards, orcs, dwarfs, dragons, monsters of all sorts, and hobbits. A hobbit is a smaller version of a man, only 3 or so feet tall. Our story follows Frodo Baggins, a small but curios hobbit on his adventure to overcome evil and destroy the one magic ring that can cast the entire Middle Earth into darkness if it falls into the hands of the evil being Sauron. He created the ring in the volcano Mount Doom and is the only one who can control the power within this ring. Frodo must take the ring into the heart of the volcano which is the one place the it can be destroyed. He is aided on his quest by his three hobbit friends, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadock Brandybuck, and Perigren Took, two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. Together they set out to destroy the ring and save the world from the powers of evil.I would recommend this book for kids and adults over they age of 12. This is because the vocabulary and depth of the story are almost to hard for a child to comprehend, let alone be interested by. Also some knowledge of medieval times helps greatly to understand this book. Overall I give this book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Take a head-trip to wonderland of the medieval times in J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. In an epic adventure across foreign landscapes, join an unlikely band of humans, an elf, a dwarf, and hobbits in the first installment of the three, The Fellowship of the Ring. Envision their every movement as they brave dark, treacherous, caves, and as they fend off their attackers of trolls,orcs, goblins, and other unknown evils in their perilous quest. Tolkien's tapestry of history and thought throughout the book is incredible as he weaves his complicated history of his imagined world and flawlessly brings the book right out of the pages and into your room. His novel inspires everyone to do what is the courageous and right thing to do in their everyday lives to bring evil to its knees and to promote righteousness in the sinning environment we live in today.Frodo Baggins is the main character in this action and adventure series. He and his comical looking friends add humor to the violent scheme and his other counterpart, Gandalf the wizard, expresses his wisdom throughout dramatic scenes. Along for the trip are several humans and others humanly creature that add their own affairs of love giving the book a unique blend of everything. inn reality this book will only benefit us through stimulating our minds and bringing what truly could happen to our eyes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien brings you to the small and lovely Shire. In the Shire lives an ordinary hobbit named Frodo, or at least he thought he was normal. Little did Frodo know that he would one day have to leave the dear Shire to go on a wild adventure to the darkest of all places.When Frodo was young he was adopted by Bilbo Baggins and was loved dearly. Bilbo was a rich hobbit and lived in the fairest hobbit hole. He gave the hole to Frodo when he left the Shire. Bilbo also left behind a very precious gift to him, a golden ring that had magical powers and could be very dangerous. Gandalf, an old wizard and a great family friend, made sure that Frodo got it and kept it safe. In the movie Frodo leaves the Shire with the ring almost immediately with Sam and ends up bumping into Mary and Pippin on the way. In the book it is a lot more complicated and more interesting too. Shortly after Gandalf left he came back to tell Frodo that the ring was evil and need to be taken away soon because it belonged to Sauron, who was evil.Eventually Frodo, Sam, Mary and Pippin left quietly on an adventure that would last forever. From the time they left the Shire to the time they got to Mordor there was not one time where they were not in danger. On this adventure they meet many new and interesting people, such as elves, and learn many things about life and the world around them. You follow these amazing hobbits through a wonderful, but dangerous adventure through all different types of unknown places.This is an excellent book. Most people have seen the movie and so have I, but the book answered all my questions about the movie. The book is just as interesting too. You can see everything clearly in your mind. Then the next time you watch the movie everything seems to piece together like a puzzle and you catch things you never would have noticed before. Read this book, it is excellent!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is a virtuoso performance by Rob Inglis. His portrayals of all the characters is superb, and he (almost) never mixes up their voices. His understanding and interpretation of Tolkien is marvelous, and he has the perfect voice for the job. Wouldn't it have been nice if Jackson could have found a role for Rob Ingis in the films? He'd have made a great Tom Bombadil, but let's not get into that.An earlier reviewer pointed out the problem of inconsistent disc and track naming, but that flaw exists with the online database, not the CDs themselves.For any fan of the book or the films, get these audio CDs. Nothing better on a long drive."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Even today, almost six decades since its first publication, J. R. R. Tolkien's magnificent work of fantasy is still attracting readers and scholars - more so now due to the publicity surrounding Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy. Perhaps for the first time ever, the movie release of a book adaptation has actually boosted sales of the book involved. And this can only be considered a good thing, as one cannot claim to be a literary reader without exploring Tolkien's Middle-Earth at least once in their lives.To outline the story seems almost redundant, but here goes: in the idyllic pastoral land of the Shire lives the hobbit Frodo Baggins, who is intrusted with an immense task. The magical Ring that his uncle brought back from his adventuring is revealed by the wizard Gandalf to be none other than the ruling Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is now mustering his forces to find his possession and overthrow the world once more.And so Frodo sets off, with his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippen Took, and his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee in order to conceal the Ring from the enemy and seek out a way in which to destroy it. His journey throws him into the path of the mysterious Ranger Strider, and the terrible Ringwraiths sent out to fetch Sauron's prize. Finally reaching the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, Frodo becomes a part of a larger Fellowship of men, hobbits, elves and dwarves, in order to make the perilous journey across land to the volcanic Mount Doom in the land of Mordor: the only place where the Ring could be destroyed.On the way of course are dangers galore - the betrayal of the white wizard Saruman, the legions of orcs plaguing the land, the pattering footsteps of an unknown stalker, and of course the lure of the One Ring itself, whose corruptible nature endangers Frodo from within the Fellowship as well as without...\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first of the three books in the trilogy, which in turn are divided into six books (two books for each volume). This new edition of the text involves several new additions; a note explaining Tolkien's terminology and linguistic decisions (such as writing \\"elven\\" instead of \\"elfin\\" and \\"dwarves\\" instead of \\"dwarfs\\"), a foreword by Tolkien himself explaining how the story came about, and the famous prologue \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which introduces the reader to the culture of these small creatures and the history of the Ring that took place in \\"The Hobbit\\". Then of course there are the meticulous maps of Middle-earth, and the wonderful story itself.In creating his work, Tolkien had done something that no author had done before, or since (despite the dismal attempts at copying by the likes of...well, I'll let you fill in the blanks) - the creation of an entire world, complete with history, flora, fauna, landmarks, star plotting, folksongs and a thousand other details that make Middle-Earth the most vivid and three-dimensional sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen. In many ways the land itself is the protagonist of the story - it is what the characters are fighting for, and at times the land itself helps or hinders the Fellowship's progress.You can read this story from a thousand different viewpoints, whether it's the irrevocable fading of the magic in the world, the battle between good and evil (both internal and external), a beautiful love story between a mortal man and an elven maiden, the impossible journey of the ordinary-man to change to course of the world...the list goes on. Most touching for me however was the gentle touches of Christian idealogy imbued and combined with the realms of Faery, creating a harmonious and magical whole, not as heavy handed as C. S. Lewis's Narnia allegories, but meaningful, deep and beautiful.In reading \\"Fellowship\\" for the first time, one may be put off by the rather slow pace of the first book, in which Tolkien takes his time to set the scene, establish what's at stake, gather together his information and then throw in a singing Tom Bombadil. Trust me, if you hang in there to book two (when Frodo reaches Rivendell) then the pace will pick up.Tolkien has a beautiful poetic prose used throughout the story, sometimes soft and gentle, sometimes grand and epic. There has never been a better time to get involved with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" than with the release of Jackson's movie trilogy on DVD - read the book, and then watch the world unfold on the television screen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;One Ring to rule them all.

You can just stay in the world of this fantastic novel for a longer time! He takes you to a beautiful world of puzzles, story, love, poetry, song, and exitment.My advise READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring not only lays the foundation for the rings trilogy but shoots the reader off on an entertaining ride through danger, intrigue, mystery, and battles between good and evil. In this book, Tolkien develops the characters and backgrounds of the story and also includes suspense and excitement along the way.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.When you buy this, you might as well buy all three books of the rings set because it is essentially one story divided into three books. This book does not complete the story but only a section of it.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books that make up the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Its about a simple hobbit named Frodo Baggins who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. He soon learns from a wizard named Gandalf that the ring isn't just any ring, it is the most powerful ring ever made. Now he is sent on a quest to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom before the Dark Lord, Sauron, finds it. If it ever got into his hands, the word would turn to darkness and all things once peaceful and beautiful would be destroyed and Sauron would rule the world.Frodo and Samwise Gamgee then go on an adventure together with seven other companions. These seven are: a dwarf named Gimli, an elf named Legolas, two men named Boromir and Aragorn, and two hobbits named Merry and Pippin (Gandalf also joins them for a little while). Merry and Pippin are bothe cousins of Frodo while Samwise is his faithful gardener. Frodo is a normal hobbit who loves food and friends. He is also the kindest person Sam knows. Aragorn is the heir of a great kingdome who has finally decided to take up his throne. Boromir it the son of the steward of that kingdome who wishes to represent it by joing the company. Legolas is the prince of a far away forest and Gimli is a well respected dwarf.The beginning of the book is a little boring but it pays off when their quest begins and conflicts begin to come up. In the beginning, Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam begin their journey alone through their country called the Shire to a little town called Bree to meet Gandalf. After going through and meeting new and interesting people and being chased by Black Riders (servants of Sauron), they finally make it to Bree. The trouble is, Gandalf isn't there!Can the whole world depend on hobbits to save them from destruction? Will Gandalf ever come to Bree? How can the hobbits go on without him?

It just got boring after a few pages discribing tiny detail.I lost interest during the climax, and put it down for what I meant only to be that day, but ended up being several months. When I finally picked it back up, and managed to finish it, I really didn't feel fulfilled.There were good things about the book, like the overall story.But it could have been a huge amount better. Like if they shortened the detail to like a page per place, and blew up the important events more, rather than letting peaceful moments dominate the story.It could just be that I need to read it again. I sometimes find that the second time around is more enjoyable.Overall, I thought it was perhaps worth the chore of reading it, but would have enjoyed it more if the detail hadn't droned on quite so long.Oh, by the way, I'm halfway through The Two Towers book, and it's much better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I would give this book two thumbs up. I read its pre-quil, The Hobbit, it was excellent as well and helped to understand this book. The Lord of Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a book that is placed in an earth-like world, but it isn't earth. The time would be medievalish, with such things as dragons, orcs, elves, dwarfs, wizards, trolls, and hobbits of course, plus many other creatures. The content of this book is very similar to that of an AD&D (advanced dungeons & dragons) storyline. This story starts off at a mild pace, a peaceful setting in the hobbit town known as The Shire. The story is about one hobbit, Frodo Baggins. His long time friend Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, visits him and that is when the story really takes off. They set out on many adventures, most of them unintentional. This story is filled with adventure, and the suspense never stops throughout the duration of the story. There is a great conflict between the good and evil in Middle Earth, where the story takes place. Evil forces are threatening to destroy everything good in the world, Frodo and his fellowship set off to prevent that from happening. If you like all of these things that I have just described, this book if definitely for you. It has one of the best storylines I have ever read. It helps to read The Hobbit first however, it will give you a much greater understanding of what is going on. This story doesn't end in this book, it stops right in the middle. To finish the story you have to read the next two books, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"If you are like me and loved the Harry Potter books, there is little chance you won't go crazy over this book. I was very disappointed I had to wait for the fifth book so to fill my gap I purchased the collection of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It was one of the greatest decisions I ever made. Suddenly this series I bought to &quot;fill in the gap&quot; became something better than anything Rowling ever wrote in a book. Tolkien gives a far more vivid world, much more complex, with characters that are far more three dimensional. I can't understand why there is so much buzz around Harry Potter when the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is so much a better fantasy story. Then again, it is written above a second grade level."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"One of the things that was a little tough about finally reading the fellowship of the ring was the fact that I am used to reading thriller novels and historical fiction. Therefore the language of this book took some getting used to. I felt at times that I was wading my way through some slow parts. But slow compared to the stuff I usually read I guess. So I have to take that into consideration. This was worth reading and I am glad I did. I would certainly recomend it especially with the movie coming out and all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the first volume of Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is a wonderful introduction to Middle Earth and it's residents. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As so many cynnical people deftly point out, most of this book is &quot;just people walking around doing stuff.&quot; However can't anything be reduced to utter simplicity? Like Frank Herbert's Dune was just &quot;a bunch of people in the desert doing stuff.&quot; Please, we're not infants here. So, with that cleared up this book perfectly sets up the stage for the next two. Please consider that the trilogy is written continuosly, and is in excess of one thousand pages. Therefore, for you to know what they are talking about, they will have to put you through a little boredom. This is a good introduction to the final two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"With great action and suspense I believe this is one of the best books i've read so far. The plot to this part is woven intricately like a web, that all comes together. Its exciting how Frodo, the relative of Bilbo who got the evil ring in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, has to run away from all the henchmen of Sauron, the evil being searching for the ring to become the ruler of the world again. Along his way Frodo meets many characters with different personalities. After travelling near to Sauron's country, Mordor, Frodo finds out that one of his trusted companions wants to take the ring and rule for himself. He is faced with tons of enemies and then finds that one of his own friends is one of them. He uses the ring, which makes him invisible, and escapes. But he is still faced with the dreaded mission into Mordor. This is where the second part, &quot;Two Towers&quot;, starts.

I started with Clarke's 2001 a Space Odessey, Asimov's Foundation, continued with the Tolkien's Hobbit and Herbert's Dune. Don't get me wrong, Tolkien is a master, and I loved this book, but I thought it was very slow, and very little action. The best book ever as some have said? I thought Dune by Frank Herbert was a much more intriguing read, with much more &quot;depth&quot; but still, I'm glad I read it as it was enjoyable and I want to read the other books. I just didn't &quot;blow me away&quot; as it did other readers. Maybe I'm shallow, but I failed to see the signifigance. Tolkien sometimes puts too much in the journey, and not enough problems for characters to deal with. I liked the Hobbit MUCH more, though I understand the series continues and isn't finished. I would still recommend you read it, but try your hand at Dune first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"to all who have never read this book, and to all who have found it boring, I am forced to tell you I couldn't care less. To those of you who find the books rich in symbolism, let me just say that Tolkien despised symbolism, and allegory, and other tricks writers use to inspire depth in their works. tolkien simply wrote and let his works stand for themselves. while current fantasy readers are inclined towards the &quot;brute force&quot; angles of fantasy, in which mighty wizards throw fireballs all day long and retire on dragonback at the end of the day(Jordan and Goodkind, I AM talking to you!), Tolkien created a world in which power is wielded with care, the meek overcome the mighty through humane virtue, and magic itself is falling into darkness. this is a parable of our times, fantasy or no, and it pains me that Tolkien's works have been relegated to the realm of Jordan and Terry Brooks: his place is in high literature. if you hate fantasy, it doesn't matter- savor his words, cry for the woes he shows you, marvel at the depth of his imagination. just don't dismiss his work as fantasy; he deserves better than that. as I said, the works stand for themselves."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"One of the major comments you will hear about this book is that it is a bit slow getting started. But hang in there and get through the set up; its SO worth it! Even the parts of the book characterized as slow are useful; this exposition helps immerse you into Middle Earth, which is one of the more common positive comments you will read about here in the reviews. Reading LOTR is a commitment, treating it like a weekend novel will result in disappointment. But when you are on the edge of your seat as the fog closes in on the hobbits on the Barrow-Downs, or letting the phone ring off the hook, forgotten, as Glorfindel urges his horse to flee with Frodo on its back at the attack of the Ringwraiths at the Ford of Brunien, you will be glad you took the time to do it right. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The primary influence of this work is deeper than storytelling. If you read the Lord of the Rings, it will change your life for the better. Some perceive the changes immediately; others perceive them over time. As Gollum descended into shadow, you will rise from it. If you have not read the book, I'm sure these comments sound contrived and condescending. After you read the Lord of the Rings, you will get a feeling for what I am trying to express. The reason the Lord of the Rings is so popular is because it has a profound psychological effect on virtually everyone who reads it. This influence is pervasive and obviously not the reaction of just a few fanatics. The most mysterious aspect of this is the fact the influence becomes more profound with subsequent readings. You will get more out of the book on the second or third reading than the first. Middle-Earth becomes a place you will visit over time and this is one of the few books that you will read again and again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I started this book.

The Fellowship was here to introduce the characters that would become of great importance later on in the series. In this book it gave the reader time to absorb the character's traits so he can read the other books flouidly and withouth doubt. So you can see why the Lord to the Rings is referred to the book that set the standards for modern fantasy and is considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship Of The Ring is about a hobbit named Frodo and a wizard named Gandolf who get possession of a magical ring. This ring has great powers .The ring also has an evil past. Now the hobbit and the wizard are trying to learn more about the ring. The main characters are Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandolf. The plot is Gandolf &amp; Frodo are fighting against the evil Gollum and many others. The setting takes place in an imaginary world.I think this book is good for skilled readers. It takes some skill to read a book like this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is far superior to any fantasy book. I was stunned by the amazing ability possessed by the author, Tolkien, to create such a masterpiece. Being the first author to write books that belong to this genre, I think that Tolkien should be honoured and respected by any fantasy-lover. This book includes a serious study and realistic description of characters and their motives, beautiful descriptions of Middle Earth and its different cultures, and, of course, an interesting and complex plot. The fantasy books I had read before were merely average, and thus, when I started to read this book, I had low expectations. However, the book became better and better as I read, and impressed me in a way that I cannot begin to describe. If only modern writers had half the talent and imagination possessed by tolkien. My advice to young reader is: do not waste yourselves on trashy romances: this book is the vital core of children's literature. Enjoy this book! From a 14 year-old in Israel."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"If you appreciate science fiction, fantasy, history, or just a fireside tale, you will be awed by The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as it's companion books. The attention to detailed history, fictitious though it is, is amazing. Blended with a pinch of magic and a touch of good humor, the story is gripping. The struggle between Mordor and the rest of Middle-Earth is always present, whether the characters are in the comfort of a nice, soft bed, or in a dank cave or tunnel. Middle-Earth, Tolkien's realm of storytelling, is so diverse and ever-changing, that no matter how many new places the hobbits or any other member of their fellowship visit, it's never just another stop along the way. The poems and songs of Tolkien's creation are so beautiful and, sometimes humorous, that The Fellowship of the Ring would be a 10 no matter WHAT chapter you selected to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have read Lord of the Rings at least 6 times and each time I do I still feel the same emotion I felt the first time, even more.

For those who haven't read it WHAT ARE YOU WAITING for....!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This whole series, has, by far, proven to be the best that I have ever read. It is a vast epic of sweeping proportions and implications. Tolkien is a genius when it comes to portraying a character's emotions, and the storyline is first - rate. Anyone that enjoyed The Hobbit will definitely like these books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book, as well as the Hobbit, and the rest of the Lord of the Rings, have given to me a gift of experience.

All other fantasy pales in comparison; R.A. Salvatore and the rest of his TSR cronies are mere hacks. Tolkien stands alone as the master of the Secondary World."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This was the greatest trilogy I have ever read!Ibeg you to read these books. The first book is called the Lord of the Rings. The second is called The Two Towers. The final book is called The Return of the King, which was my favorite. The books have two parts. The first part is about 4 hobbits taking the great Ring of Sauron to be destroyed at Mount Doom which is located in the black land of Mordor.The second part tells of the War of the Ring.Which occures in the capitol of Gondor (Minis Tirith) to draw Sauron out of his land so Frodo can finish his quest. I had many character that l liked. Such as Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Gandalf the wizard, Theoden the King,Treebeard the Ent, and finnaly the evil creature gollum. I strongly suggest reading this trilogy. I also strongly suggest readin The Hobbitfirst, so you can understand it better.READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I hate to be one of the only ones who don't give it totally amazing ratings...I think Tolkien was GREAT in description, and bringing you into his little world of Middle-Earth. I read the Hobbit in elementary school many years ago. I also LOVE READING, and everyone and thier dog has always told me to try reading &quot;LORD OF THE RINGS.&quot; I gave it a try...I even bought nearly everything Tolkien has produced, and I must say, he is talented beyond many people dreams. I love his work...but far too often, as in this book...it had way too many boring dull parts that dragged on. He loves being extremely detail oriented and will go off for 10 pages at a time describing the scenery and exactly how some little bush looks. It does help to bring you into the fantasy and escape from life if that is what you are looking for, but the action (that you see on the movie) is all by-passed and you only see the AFTER-EFFECTS and rarely get details of combat or anything intense as the movie tries to depict. I must say the books are worth reading at least once, and even I own them all...but there are many pointless drawn out parts that never seem to end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Imagine a story about love, betrayal, war, and heartbreaking victory and you have the science fiction book called The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. This outstanding book is part one of the series of The Lord of the Rings. The one ring that Frodo carries is the one ring that can destroy evil once and for all. So the urakies are trying to stop him from doing that so they could take over the world.Part one is about a little hobbit named Frodo Bagins. He is chosen to be the ring carrier. He is given a fellowship: a fine swordsmen Aragon; a skilled elf named Legolas (who does quick magic with a bow and arrow); Gimly, a master at an ax with power like a bear; and a wizard named Gandalf. The fellowship and the ring carrier are trying to bring the ring to the land of Mount Doom in order to destroy evil once and for all.They travel light and miss turns. They lose people and gain people. One day while the fellowship is trying to get the ring one step closer to Mount Doom, they stumble against some of the urakies and start to battle. Boramier, son of King John, was protecting two little hobbits: Merry and Peppy. The leader of the urakies shot one arrow at him and hit him, but he stood strong and still fought back. Then another one hit him, but he was still standing till the third one hit him. He fell on his knees and an urakie went up to him and tried to hit him in the head with an arrow. Then Aragon came and helped him and he killed the urakies, but Boramiers life was lost -- he was destined to die. Aragon made a promise to him that he would protect Frodo with his life and sword.I feel like this is the best book for people who have an imagination beyond the unthinkable. I admit I watched the movie first and I loved it. So I picked up the book and I started reading it. It ended up being the best book that I ever read. It took me to another world. So now get up and pick up The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and don't forget about the Two Towers and The Return of the King. They are miraculous books.~Jaime Guevara, Grade 8, Patrick Lyndon Pilot School, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the first part in the &quot;LOTR&quot; trilogy.

Read it today!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When Frodo Baggins accepts a mission to destroy an evil ring, he doesn't know what he is getting into. In this book, the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, many things happen to the young Hobbit, Frodo. This was a well written book, and a wonderful story.In the book, The Fellowship of the Ring, there lived a hobbit (a small creature, looking much like a man, only smaller) named Frodo Baggins. Frodo's uncle, Bilbo, came across a ring on an adventure of his. This ring, as he later found out, was the ring of power, made in the fires of Mount Doom, by Sauran, the dark lord. The man who told Bilbo about this was a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. This wizard knew that this ring had to, and could only be, destroyed in the mountain in which it was conceived. For this task, Gandalf chose Frodo. When Frodo this mission, not knowing the danger of it, he set off to Mount Doom, along with three friends to destroy the ring. On the long quest there, he stopped at Rivendale, an elven fortress, and meets with Gandalf, and various known warriors. At this meeting, a fellowship was forged; it was called the Fellowship of the Ring. This Fellowship is to protect Frodo and the evil ring. Throughout this book, this group falls apart. Some die, some are captured, but some still survive.The Fellowship of the Ring was a very well written book. It is my opinion that this is, because it presents a higher level in a book that almost all age groups read. Also, it explained things with an obvious presence of higher writing. Some examples are, the book itself, it is an example because there are no weaknesses at all in this book. The book also is a great storyline for a book. I feel this way because it shows the struggle for good or evil.In The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins goes on a dangerous quest to destroy evil for all eternity. Overall, this was a very good book. It had more than the necessary components to be called a, \\"good book\\". Unquestionably, this was an excellent book because it had a fun storyline and was extremely well written."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"In the book The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, the One Ring of the Dark Lord is found; so a fellowship of nine people set out to destroy it. This book is very well written but a little confusing to understand.The main character, the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. In the book Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, discovers that the ring is that of the enemy. So Frodo sets out for the Elf city, Rivendell, with his best friend Samwise Gamgee and his two cousins Merry and Pippin. Along the way they meet the Aragorn, the Man, who helps them to get to their destination. In Rivendell the Elf Lord Elrond makes a fellowship of nine people consisting of the four hobbits, Gandalf, and Aragorn, with the new members, Gimli the Dwarf, Boromir the Man, and Legolas the Elf. They set off to destroy the Ring. Since this book is part one of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings books, the rest of the story is continued in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The characters struggle through many injuries and problems but somehow the manage to get through them.This book, although a little confusing to understand, is very well written. By \\"well written\\" I mean that it was very well thought-out and because Tolkien had a very big imagination he wrote a good story, for example he made up all the languages and places in the book. It also pulls you in making you think that you are there. The weaknesses are the book being a little confusing a pretty long. For example some of the words are hard to pronounce, like the names of people and places. Another example of it being confusing is it is a little hard to follow, you really have to pay attention to the book so you know what is going on. As long as you do this you can be sure to understand and enjoy this book.In conclusion this book was outstanding, probably the best book I've ever read. Tolkien is very imaginative and writes well. If you read this book I would recommend the other two books and the three movies that are based upon the book. If you've seen the movies I recommend the books to you. I think the best part about this book is when I finished it because I knew that there were always two more books to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed the movie Lord of the Rings. This book takes you back and tells you in detail how Bilbo found the ring. You will laugh, you will cry, and best of all you will fall in love with the wee little ones known as Hobbits."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Plain and simple, this is one of the greatest masterpieces of literature on the planet. No author has gone to so much work to creat a practical world, 5+ languages, histories of characters, and many maps for this world.Tolkien provides a thrilling story to read. Although the detail is often boring it is worth reading for the rest of the book is exciting and interesting. It also helps reading the book before the movie, you'll appreciate the movie alot more.Characters are so detailed and lovable (or hateable) that you love to read about them. Again the detail is worth it, it lets you believe you are in this created world and that it does truly exist.All in all, the book is in the top 10 of fantasy books written and should be in the top 50 of books of all time. Read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Dark Lord has returned. He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves. What will Frodo do when this happens? The answer to this question, and the fate of Middle Earth will be revealed in the next books, The Two Towers, and finally, The Return of the King.By: Jud"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a very good book. It starts out in Hobbiton of the Shire, where Frodo lives. His uncle, Bilbo, who just turned 111, tells him to go on a quest to destroy the ring of power. This is the ring that gives the dark lord all of the power to rule all of the middle earth. He is sent off, with a few companions, to bring it to the same place it was made, Mt. Doom of Mordor. Along the way he encounters many obstacles, sometimes almost killing frodo. The ring has much power, one power being when the bearer puts it on he will become invisible. Frodois very tempted to use this power, but he later decides not to use it because when the ring is on, the enemy can sense where he is and find him and take the ring back. I would highly recommend this book to anybody who likes to read Fantasy/Adventure books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I read this book after its first movie installment. Movie is not my passion and usually I watch movies after its peak period (when the price is slightly lower). This time the wave of The Fellowship of the Ring was taking the world like a hurricane. After deep thought, I made some seriously weird attempt. Read the books first then buy the DVD.The first chapter is very inviting. The Long Expected Party is sure a very delightful time for both the characters and readers. The songs are simple yet charming. Then the journeys began and I was drifted inside the Tolkein's fantasy. Long and breath-taking."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read!

Well, stupid me, I haven't saved the receipt. So, I am out $50.What really irks me is the 'customer service' attitude. They don't want the serial number of box the product came in. They are not worried that there may be a whole 'lot' of defective product out there.They don't keep track of whether there are other similar complaints. They won't call the bookseller to assist you. They express no concern other than 'we can't help you when our product is defective.'If you buy from this company please open the box in the bookseller and check for every disk, then save your receipt in case there is another problem. If you buy from Amazon, be prepared that you may have to take an hour off from work to box up the defective product and ship it back to Amazon.

The meticulous attention to detail does not create vivid imagery, rather it bogs down the entire story. Have you noticed how the pace of the book seems to speed up toward the end. It's almost as if his editor's said, &quot;Um, describing every tree in the forest is nice, but do you think you could wrap things up soon?&quot;With respect to you Tolkein fanboys out there, this book is garbage.

It's close to 400 pages of Frodo et al walking, being cold, encountering danger, getting rescued, walking, being frightened, being cold, getting lost, getting rescued, etc.For those of us sturdy enough to make it through the first part of the book, we are rewarded by the epic Council. Like the rest of the tale, the Council could have been dispensed with quickly and with relevance. Instead, we get numerous paragraphs on the lineage of everyone present, as well as those who are to be discussed. It is a terrible reading experience.Interestingly, after the Coucil, Tolkien's characters adopt an Olde English manner of speech, which only adds more weight to an already suffocatingly heavy load.Is Tolkien clever? Yes. Is he creative? Absolutely. Is Middle Earth a wonderfully imaginative effort? Quite. But all of this fails to make the story compelling and readable and fun.I'll admit I've been spoiled by Harry Potter. The difference in eras notwithstanding, J.K.

When the reproductive cycle of algae is more interesting than this work of fiction, you know you're in trouble.Let me sum up the plot of this 400+ pg book for you: Frodo and co pack their bags, rest, eat a good meal, and walk. Walk, walk, walk through the forests, walk to Elrond's house, walk to Moria, walk to where the elves live. AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. Occasionally, some &quot;dark forces&quot; strike, but it is all very anti-climactic. Tolkien's writing style is never intense, so if you're getting drowsy as you read, you might gloss over the fact that the characters were just attacked and think that they were just walking as usual.Ok- let's give Tolkien credit for creating this extremely detailed world, new languages, for defining the genre and influencing generations of fantasy writers to come. Fine. But plot? No. Characterization? None whatsoever. Entertainment? You've got to be kidding.I really wanted to like this book. Everybody else does, even people who don't generally like to read. What am I missing? Perhaps that I never read this book as a child?Tolkien has inspired some really amazing artwork and the previews for the coming movies look awesome.

After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed &quot;Not another goddam elf!!??&quot;. Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner).

I finally gave up at about 4/5 the way through. A few months back, however, I decided to give the LOTR another try because everyone kept talking about how great it was. I painfully got through the first book for the second time and was halfway through the second book when I just got so bored I started skiping pages. Finally, I got through the second book and I guess if you read the first two books you have to read the third. So, I bought the last book and pretty much skimmed through all the pages.

There are many reluctant heroes, and many that once in a position to make a difference did. It is about friendship, honor and respect. Things the modern world has seem to forgotton.(FOR CHRISTIANS?)I hold a Doctorate in Christian Theology, and I have to say Tolkien knew what he was doing when writing. You are being ministered to...and dont even realize it. You come away from the story wanting more, craving it. Once you find the basis of his story....the Bible, and put the two together you see the kinsmenship. Middle Earth are like parables, take them as such and any doubt you may have about them will soon disapear.I will admit Fellowship is not the best of the four books (JUST my opinion) but that is not to say it does not blow away most modern books...because it was an absolute blessing to me, and an eye opener on who I wanted to be."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"If you were a little Halfling called a \\"Hobbit\\" and all of a sudden a ring of power and evil comes to you, what would you do?

Three rings for the Elvin lords under the sky. Seven for the Dwarf lords in their halls of stone. And nine, nine for the race of men who above all else desire power.

In the fires of Mount Doom, Souron the deceiver made one more ring in which he poured all of his cruelty in. with that all of Middle fell to his hand.But there were some who resisted.

Building upon the story that was told in 'The Hobbit', this story tells the tale of the discovery by Gandalf the Gray, that the magic ring found by Bilbo Baggins on his journeys, is none other than the ring of power, the One Ring, the master ring that was created by the Dark Lord, Sauron, himself.Together with several companions, three other Hobbits, an Elf, a Dwarf, Gandalf, and two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Frodo sets off on the quest of Mount Doom, the quest to destroy the One Ring forever. This story is wonderfully done, a true masterpiece in fantasy fiction. Tolkien expands upon the world that he has only touched upon in 'The Hobbit', and we find it a place inhabbited by creatures of various kinds, some are evil, others strive for good, and others do only what they think they must. Yet now, with Sauron, the Dark Lord, rising to power once again, and gathering his strength, they find that they must choose a dreadful course, a course into peril.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Bilbo Baggins has been living happily in his hobbit hole for many years with his magic ring. Suddenly, he gets the urge to go traveling again. He disappears in the middle of his 111th birthday party, leaving the ring to Frodo, a young hobbit he adopted. Gandalf the wizard comes and tells Frodo that the ring is evil, and he has to take it to Mount Doom to destroy it. Otherwise, the evil Sauron will take over the world. Frodo and his hobbit friends journey to a few places, then they go to the Council of Elrond, a meeting about the ring. It is decided that a few others will accompany Frodo to Mount Doom. There are nine of them in all, and they form the fellowship of the ring (hence the title). They have to encounter many hardships, and the end of the book isn't even the end. It leaves you hanging until you read the Two Towers.This was a very complex book. It started out really slow and boring. It took about ten minutes per page, and I had to re-read some of the pages to understand. But after Bilbo leaves, things start to get darker and scarier, and the plot moves faster. I felt so bad for Frodo because so many bad things happen to him, and he didn't even want the ring. It was a little slow, but very well written. If you don't like descriptions, then you may not like this. The page are filled with descriptions, but they don't bog the story down, they add to it. I thought it was an awesome book, and I wanted to start the sequel right away.*To understand the book better, read The Hobbit first.( By the way, the movie was great too. Go see it!)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring, first in the LOTR trilogy and basis for the sensational movie, is a must read for anyone. In Fellowship, Tolkien begins to weave an intricate story, laying the foundation for a bold adventure. A seemingly ordinary member of an unnoticed race of hobbits is thrust into a quest that will determine the fate of everyone.For anyone who has read The Hobbit, Fellowship is much more sinister, complicated, and grand in scope. Over 400 pages, Fellowship contains a rich treasury of details of characters, thoughts, and conflicts that The Hobbit does not contain.For anyone who has seen the movie and is curious about reading Fellowship, do it! From the book one gets a much greater feel for the degree to which the Hobbits struggle just to make it to Rivendell. The movie leaves out fantastic characters like Tom Bombadil, a jolly, mysterious care-taker of the Old Forest who is the oldest known creature of Middle Earth.Also, if you're interested in history, you will love Fellowship of the Rings. Inspired by old European history, Tolkien creates his tales out of the myths and legends of what happened before mankind existed.I must, however, give one caveat: if you read Fellowship, you won't stop there. When you finish you'll be dying to read the rest of the series too!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of the Rings is an outstanding work that has defined the field of heroic fantasy for two generations. I would recommend it to anyone who loves narrative sweep, an extraordinarily compelling world, and a master's use of the English language. Be warned, however, that it is one continuous story, published for practical reasons in three volumes. The Fellowship of the Ring is not complete in itself, and indeed, ends on an excruciating cliff-hanger. I guarantee, you will need to know what happens next. Once you know, this is no problem, as the other two volumes are very easily obtainable. This is one fantasy work that is never going to go out of print. Another book that follows in the steps of Tolkein is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock and it is a book that should be read at least once"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was without a doubt my 3rd fav. book ever, the 1st two places being occupied by the 2 LoTRings follow up's.

Usually 5 star reviews are over the top and too much to actually trust. But on this occasion, I believe that the one star reveiws have missed the mark.Tolkien's works ARE extremely detailed in their nature. I agree that it slows the pace down drastically. But this isn't a quick little adventure that the characters are on. This is a long journey to save their lives, the homes, and their civilization. You can't expect to solve something so grand without writing it in a grand scale.As for those that have compared this work to an encyclopedia, it is. Look at all that Tolkien wrote about Middle-Earth. This is just one piece of the history. I, myself have yet to finish the Silmarillion do to it's extremely detailed presentation. Do I count that as a terrible book? No. Just detailed.For everyone that said the book was slow and too much, give it another chance sometime in the future. I too enjoy Terry Brooks's Shannara novels, but in my opinion those novels lack a certain amount of detail that Tolkien provides. Yes Mr. Brooks's novels are more action oriented but they lack a &quot;feel.&quot; A Tolkien novel gives me the &quot;feel&quot; of Middle-Earth. It makes that a reality. No other novel has that quality for me. Others are simply escapist fare. Tolkien takes me to another world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the only way you can get the unabridged version in audio format right now.

I was scared to live in a big city for the first time in my life, so I comforted myself by inhabiting Middle-Earth for a while. The sense of location in this book is palpable; from Rivendell to Lorien, from Bree to Weathertop to the Mines of Moria, one feels as if one has truly visited the locations described.The structure of LOTR is in the manner of a picaresque -- the callow hobbits journey across a wide world and have various adventures on their quest to deposit the Ring in Mt. Doom. Characterization is for the most part simplistic, but Frodo and Gollum achieve some depth, and the story throughout has the force of myth, full of rich archetypes. One ought to read this book the way one might read Homer or Chaucer: it is an old-fashioned epic, drawn in broad, bold strokes. It is a spectacularly successful exercise in literary nostalgia."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This book is fascinating from cover to cover. Tolkien is at his very best in this book, wielding adjectives about Middle Earth that make it seem so believable I felt I was actually there, and unlike so many fantasy books today, the plot and character development don't take a back seat. It's one huge tour-de-force that is just hurled at you. Some people will argue that it's just too boring, and I'll go with you on that, but that's no reason not to like the book. I guarantee that half of the people who say that didn't get past the first hundred pages. What we have here is a masterpiece of fantasy and fiction, and a fine line drawn between a fantasy world and the real world, and Tolkien gives us an epic fantasy that will stay in the mind's of it's readers for years to come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"It is hard to get into the book at the front of it but after about 100 pages or so it gets pretty good. It is the first part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really did not have enough action in it, all it really did was just talk about what they were going to do with the ring and they walked around a lot. It was still a pretty good book but I liked The Hobbit better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"As another reviewer said, \`\`forget Harry Potter!'' This is the real thing.

Don't wait until then to find out why this movie will predictably out-do all the Star Wars movies, Titanic, ID4, or any other movie made to date. The movie, even with modern movie-making technology, could not possibly hope to live up to this book.The Fellowship of the Ring was meant for adults, and is not for children. It has a marvelous plot, wondrous detail, and believable, realistic characters, some you will love, and some you will love to hate. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best in Fantasy. True, there are a few problems with the plot, and a few indiscrepencies along the way, but it is only with repeated readings that we spot those. You will spot some problems, however, because this is a group of books that will keep you coming back for more. While the Hobbit may not be the best book in town, these may very well be.

It's narrated by one man, Rob Inglis, doing the entire thing as he apparently used to on stage. He does the voices, he sings the songs. He also did The Hobbit for Recorded Books, and Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea books. He's marvelous. It's like having a wizened grandfather read you a story.

And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them: William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R.

There are elves, wizards, dwarves, orcs, and hobbits. This story appeals to readers young and old. For someone who enjoys other fantasy books, this would be a great book to have because you can read it over and over again. However, this is only one book in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. To be able to read the entire tale you also need to purchase The Two Towers and The Return of the King which complete the story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because of my own love of fantasy. I read this book for my school PACES Paideia and they provide a Study Guide that can help you with the book. It is divided into weeks and it gives you different assignments to do. For each week there is vocabulary, parent questions (questions for the parent to ask the student), occasionally a small writing assignment, and a theme tracker chart which helps get the literary elements straight. The study guide really helped me understand some of the deeper meanings of the story not just what is obvious to an average reader. This book is perfect for any fantasy lover or just a reader looking for a new adventure. Even if you do not like reading much you will cling to this book because it is extremely interesting and an overall great book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Classic book. Can read over and over. Much better then the movies!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Having never before read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", or even seen the movies, I decided to give the \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" a try to see what all the fuss is about. I wasn't disappointed. Tolkien presents a stunning world of ancient legends, characters and vivid scenery that is as real to the reader as any movie could produce. This is a stunning work and well worthy of all the praises it has received.The most potent aspect of this novel is the vivid descriptions as the voyagers trod through the vast lands of Middle-earth on their epic quest. Tolkien describes sweeping panoramic vistas, roaring rivers, and foreboding mountains with such detail and elegance as to transport the reader into his own world. Indeed, if the reader has but an ounce of imagination, it is not hard to picture the glory of Middle-earth with all of its inhabitants, such as the majestic and grand elves of Lothlorien, or the loathsome and evil Gollum and the Dark Riders. Yet, the detail is not too burdensome. Tolkien has a gift for using just the right words to paint a vivid scene, yet to not burden the reader with too much unneeded detail.Tolkien's Middle Earth comes through as a mythological wonderland, one that has survived for ages of legends and kings, tales and history. Tolkien's attention to detail is remarkable. Not only in the songs and language of the different races, but also in the history and legends of the ancient days. There is a long, detailed chronology of the different races. There are a myriad of tales of the ancient kings and rulers of Middle-earth. Indeed, this may prove to be too burdensome for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novice, as the novel begins with a lengthy account of the Middle-earth and its history. However, these stories are interwoven into the very fabric of Middle-earth that makes it so real, yet lend it a mythological aura.The recurring theme of the corruption of power illustrates the peril of the One Ring, the ring who brings its wearer ultimate power. Yet, this power is ultimately evil, for it will corrupt the wearer, no matter how inherently good he is. This aura of power corrupts even the most pure of heart. This is a stern warning that the pursuit of power will inevitably lead to evil, despite what the original intentions may be.Another warning is about the pursuit of knowledge, for knowledge is a kind of power. It is the dwarves and their pursuit of knowledge that originally awoke the \\"evil\\" lying beneath the mountains. Although knowledge is usually desirable, Tolkien makes a distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom puts forth a moral dimension to knowledge, for it is knowing the consequences of actions, and also the ability to choose between good and evil.It is significant that Frodo, a hobbit of diminutive size and stature, is chosen as the ring bearer. The hobbits are usually only concerned with their own petty lives in the Shire and love good food and drink. Yet, Frodo is chosen to be the penultimate bearer of the One Ring. For strength and might do not make a hero, but a strong heart and iron will to resist temptation are the rigid foundations of a hero. Frodo may start out as a young, inexperienced hobbit, yet he leaves on an epic quest and is determined, despite all odds, to complete his mission. Indeed, Frodo proves that even the unlikeliest of heroes can shine when their time comes due.So whether you're an avid fan and have read the books and seen the movies many times, or whether you're a Johnny-come-lately like myself, this novel is a must-read. Now it's on to the part 2 of the saga - \\"The Two Towers.\\""},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"There is no need to review Tolkien's work, his plots and characters, here. But this is simply the best audio version there is. Peter Jackson's movie trilogy is great, the BBC audio versions are fine, but this version is unabridged and that is what matters. All of the events, all of the poetry, all of the imagery, are here. Rob Inglis does a superb job of narration, with enough vocal variation to distinguish the characters. If the Lord of the rings is in your blood, and Tolkien's words are part of your soul, then this is the version for you. I lost the ability to read, to hold a book, to turn a page, but now I can go to Middle Earth and any part of Middle Earth any time I choose. And that my dears is precious!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The first part of the trilogy that helped fantasy get where it is today. If you've seen the movies and not read the books, you are still missing so much of what Tolkien has to offer."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.We open some sixty years after the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is &quot;Mad Baggins&quot;). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the &quot;feel&quot; of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential &quot;little guy&quot; hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say &quot;everyhobbit.&quot;We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of &quot;Hobbit&quot; -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. A must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I chose to read \\"Fellowship of The Ring\\" for a class project. It is a very well written book, which is the first of a trilogy. The author of the series of books is J.R.R Tolkien. It is a wonderful story of adventure in a different world.It all starts with a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, finding a ring. A hobbit is a man like creature but only smaller. He then gives the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. Then Gandalf the grey a wizard friend of Frodo's figures out that Frodo's ring is the ring of power made in the mountain of Doom. It is made to control all the other rings and all the inhabitants of Middle Earth. It can only be destroyed in the Mountain of Doom where it was created. So Frodo sets off on a journey to destroy the ring. Along with him were Sam, Merry, and Pippin some of Frodo's hobbit buddies. During their long journey they stopped at Rivendale, a place where elves live. Then there Frodo meets up with Gandalf and other great warriors. The warriors consisted of two men, an elf, a wizard, a dwarf, and the four hobbits. Then they all head for the Mountain of Doom. They come upon many obstacles and different adventures.Tolkien writes this book marvelously. The way he describes the lands they go through makes you feel like you are there in middle earth. This book is for anyone who loves adventure tales of good and evil. This book has a great storyline and will keep you hooked the whole time you are reading it.

This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves. What will Frodo do when this happens? The answer to this question, and the fate of Middle Earth will be revealed in the next books, The Two Towers, and finally, The Return of the King.By: Jud"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien was born on January 3rd 1892. He grew up in Birmingham, England where he earned a place at King Edwards school. He then went to Oxford university to study languages. He eventually became a profess of anglo-saxon there in Oxford. Lord of the Rings was published in 1954.The first part, Fellowship of the Ring, was about a young hobbit who inherits a very powerful ring that changes his life greatly. His mind is opened to things that occur outside the peaceful life in the shire, his home. He has to change from a peaceful hobbit minding his own business into a courageous hero.The book was very entertaining. After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book. The book offers many more details that were not in the movie. Many scenes that were in the movie are lengthened. Many events in the book aren't even mentioned in the movie. Even some new characters that aren't mentioned in the movie are in the book. However after seeing the movie, some parts of the book were portrayed in the movie were less interesting and hard to read through. That contributed to the length of time it took me to read the book. Overall the book was a very good read. It might be more entertaining if you read the book before you see the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I think this book is the best one I have ever read because the way Tolken wrote,like when he talks about how much they travel it made my feet even hurt reading this book I think anyone who doesn't read this book is crazy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the first book in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;The novel tells us the discovery of the magic ring which have given to Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit) by his uncle Bilbo.

After a series of adventures , returns to the Shire and retires to a remarkably long life.This novel is strongly recommended by my friend.She told me that this novel is incredible and exciting.But at that moment,I really have no interest on this novel.But after the film Lord of the Rings came out,I decided to see what all of the things were about.So i started to read this book a month ago.At the very beginning,i found that this book is too complicate and difficult to read . It goes slowly and boring.I need to read it again so as to understand what it mean . I just want to give up to read this book.But after Bilbo leaves , things go faster.it becomes darker and scarier.It makes me think about the scenery of the movie which is dark and terrible.And the sound is around you .&quot;Saroun ! Saroun !&quot;it is sooooo horrible!But the ending of the book is not really a ending.It is followed by the next book , &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.Now,I have much interest to know what would happen.So I think, sooner or later ,I will read it.Finally,I greatly appreciate Tolkien who can write such a incredible book.I am deep down in it.

Nothing changes in the book, at least hopefully. Most of the time artists try to make a living by remaking and selling the book. They change the cover of the book. I mean come on, the people at the copyright industries need to stop this, or else it will just keep on happening. WHATCH OUT J.K. Rowling, your Harry Potter series might be next. You should get a lot of your own books and keep them and sell them later. You need to do this because in years, artists will start taking advantage of this and give your prized books a new cover. One that you wern't there to see. If you hold on to some books they will be worth a great deal of money for the original book. The very first book with the same cover and same illistrater. You need to grasp what is yours and hold on to it.Well anyways, I need to tell you what this great novel is about.It startes off when a Hobbit ( almost like little migits ) find a ring. Acually it is one Hobbit. His name it Bilbo Baggins. He finds a ring of great power. When Bilbo puts on the ring it makes him invisible. But with great power comes great responsibility. Poor Bilbo i so cought up in the fun that he does not realize that a great evil is amoung this ring. See a great ruler of darkness and evil forged many great rings of great power. In these rings were the power to guide and rule each race. Three rings were given to Elves. Seven were given to the Dwarves. And nine rings were given to the race of men. All of the ring bearers were fooled by their greed and were blinded by the power of the great rings. For there was another ring made that they did not know of. In the land of The great ruler Sauron there was a mountain. It was Mount Doom and in the fires of Mount Doom he forged the 'one ring to rule them all'. It had the power to corrupt and decive all other great rings of power. One by one the rulers of Middle Earh ( where they live in ) fell to the power of The Ring. There was an alliance of men and elves and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought. They fought to distroy the One Ring. The alliance almost won when Sauron took matters into his own hands. He distroyed hundreds of Elves and Men. At that moment the king of Men stood up. He fought a use less battle and lost his life for it. His son Isiliadur, heir to the throne of men took his fathers sword. From the blow of Sauron the sword was broken. And with all his might he gave one last slash. Isiliadur had missed . . . wait he hit him. He had sliced of all four of Saurons fingers. Sauron was defeated. Isiliadur took the ring and stood at the heart of Mount Doom. He had but one chance to cast it from which it came from, but he refused. Insted he decided it to be a token to the heir of the ruler of men. On the trip home, Isiliadur was bumbarded by a band of orcs and killed him. They then tossed him in a great river, the Anduin. Although they threw him in the Anduin, they were not aware of his great burden. For over two thousand years is sat and waited at the bottem of the great river of Anduin. Until the Ring was found. It has been found by a Hobbit. No, not Bilbo Baggins but some one else. His name was Gollum. He Brought it in a great range of mountains east of were the Hobbits lived,the Misty Mountains. The Ring gave Gollum a very unusually long life. In the deep caves of the Misty Mountain he sat there ever thinking about it. Until Bilbo Baggins came and found the One Ring and kept it, not knowing what is did or does. He then passed it on to his nefew, Frodo Baggins. He then had to find a way to vancwish this evil that poisened Middle Earth.Will he suceed, or not?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I know people always hear how Tolkien is so great and it is a must read. I am just writing this to say that it is completely true. This book was outstanding.It's the tale of young Frodo Baggins coming across the one ring of power given to him by Bilbo Baggins. Throughout the story there are exciting battle scenes. My favorite of all being the Balrog in the mines of moria.I encourage people of all ages to start reading the LOTR series you won't regret it. Even if you don't read very often this is a good book to start you reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"When his uncle disappears, Frodo receives his uncle's magic ring. The ring has the ancient power to make the person who wears it invisible. The only catch is, if worn too long, the wearer will begin to fade, and soon become invisible altogether. The ring can also make it's possessor very powerful when used correctly. Soon it becomes apparent that there is someone who wants the ring for himself, so Frodo and his friends set off to take it to the only place it can be destroyed, the heart of the enemies fortress, The Cracks of Doom.I liked this book a lot because there is a large amount of suspense and really exciting action. The characters are really interesting, have deep backgrounds, and interact with each other very well, to create a great story. J.R.R Tolken uses incredible description to paint a detailed picture in the readers mind. This book could be considered a Harry Potter of its time. I recommend this book to people with patience, and an iterest in fantasy. I suggest that children under 9 do not read this book (they may not have the patience to anyway.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I thought tolkeins books were gonna be lame and dumb. whell at least the begining was. i started out reading &quot;THE HOBBIT&quot; the first of tolkeins series. mr. baggins was sitting down at home and then was doing something he never thought he would ever do ever, he went on a journey a few years long. he went through many dangers to lead him to his final task, destroy the evil dragon smog. when he came home he then realized that his house was being sold.after i read that book i got really happy to notice that i had tolkeins next book the lord of the rings. i read it very quickly for it was outstanding. when mr. baggins left the ring for frodo his adventure truly began. my favorite part of the story was when they were stuck in the room of records were the great balin died. when the orcs attacked it was suspensful to know if they would make it out alive. of course all did but gandalf the grey. there were many happy times like when they came to lothlorien and bad times when they found balin dead. these books may be stupid at first but almost all books are and then become more interesting through the end. so buy these books if you dont have them there outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I have to admit, I had never read any of Tolkien's works until now. I had a niggling doubt in my mind that his writing was dry due to the time period in which he wrote his novels. But with the movies forthcoming, I figured I should read them and see what they were all about. I must say that i was presently surprised.The first thing that jumped out at me was exactly how much he has influenced fantasy both as a book genre and also from a role-playing game standpoint. His dwarves and elves are templates for how they are used in modern FRPGs.The story moved along at quick pace, although the beginning was a little dry and slow. But once it started it went at a breakneck pace that kept me glued to the book. I'd sneak it into work to be able to keep reading it.This starts the journey of Frodo Baggins. He is given the Ring that Bilbo won from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and sets out on a journey to destroy it before the evil forces from Mordor can get their hands on it and return it to the one who created it. (Can't recall the name right this second) The only problem is that the ring causes it's bearer to desire it with an intesity that can bring about murder to obtain or keep the ring.If you plan on watching the movies when they come out, I suggest you bone up on the books so you can see the movies with a trained eye to the details."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Really, so this reads like a book report. Those who hate that kind of thing should skip this or succumb to its lack of opinionism. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is J.R.R. Tolkien's sequel to his previous book, The Hobbit. It starts with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of The Hobbit, giving his nephew, Frodo Baggins, a ring that hasa the initial power to make you invisible, but has other strong powers that few are privelaged to know. Dark forces in the world are gathering, and Frodo's ring is their last key in their quest to take over the world. So Frodo, accompanied by a powerful wizard and several other companions, sets out in a quest to destroy the ring, which is too powerful to eliminate by conventional means. In his journey to the land of Modar, where he could destroy the ring, Frodo is pursued by many strange beings. Among them are three mysterious riders clad in black. With black steeds they tracked Frodo from the beginning of the book. They seem to have strange powers, like the ability to sniff out Frodo from a mile away. They are but a fraction of the diverse, strange characters that are scattered throughout this book. All the strange characters and the way the environments are described in such full detail bring Frodo's world to life. Whoever likes adventure books will surely be pleased by this book, which is one of the benchmarks of the genre."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This is the final instalment in my reviews of the three volumes of the Lord of the Rings as read by Robert Inglis.Anyone who has read my first two will know by now that I am no fan of his style OR delivery. Having said that, and I feel it necessary to say this at the outset of each review to forestall the lynching: this is the ONLY unabridged version that is available, and it not nearly so objectionable that it can not be recommended. Indeed, I feel compelled, my misgivings notwithstanding to place this version in a \\"must have\\" category - but only until a better version comes along - Frederic Davidson? Where are you? Your country and Tolkein's readers need you!It is my view that Inglis does Tolkien and his characters great disservice in many and varied ways. Aragorn comes across as an arch, cloying, pompous lout. The Hobbits are uniformly presented as servile, unctuous, country bumpkins - Sam is the worst. Legolas is fay and effeminate - almost goofy. There are times you just want to smack his Frodo and say, \\"oh for god's sake man, get a grip on yourself.\\" I was NEVER annoyed with any of these characters when I read the book, but one can easily become annoyed with them as presented by Inglis.An interesting \\"acid test\\" for this is Peter Jackson's movie version. Virtually ALL of his actors and characters get it \\"right\\" - and Inglis does not do well by the comparison.When Inglis does get it right, he is capable of \\"nailing it\\". Gandalf is excellent, Gollum brilliant, and Treebeard surpassing.The problem is that Inglis has a deep voice and is incapable of pitching it into the higher registers. His performance rapidly degrades with the number of characters he is required to present in a short period of time. \\"Return of the King\\" is the worst of the three volumes because there is a welter of voices - most of them men. At times it is hard to remember who the heck is speaking - so similar do the voices become.And there is another, more insidious problem - my brother Ross first noted this. When Inglis is required to deliver scenes of great drama - he becomes somewhat shrill and affected.And now I will allow myself on comment on the book itself. I read this book as a youth - I was enchanted. And I came back to it as a perhaps jaded 47 year old. You know what disappointed me the most? It is the PRFOUNDLY undemocratic nature of Tolkein's tale. Of course the immediate riposte to this is that it is a fairy-tale. And fairy-tales are all about kings and queens. Well, yes, sure, SOME of them are - but by no means all of them.But The Rings is a tale of a pagan time and as my friend Fox and I were discussing, the pagan world was distinctly non-aristocratic. And it is not as though Tolkein didn't have loads of democratic or semi-democratic models to crib from. I cringed as the aristocratic leaders made ALL the decisions for their men - there is no HINT of collective decision making. I thought constantly of the Iliad and the Anabasis of Xenophen -- where the lords and their men regularly debate policy, strategy and even tactics. Does this destroy the book? Of course not. But I do view the apotheosis of Aragorn, for that is what it is, as the central failure of the book. Tolkein had a magnificent opportunity to have his Aragorn cast off the tyranny of aristocratic blood-lines and establish a democratic society wherein men were governed by elected officials and the rule of law. And this could have been done without compromising the romance of the story one whit.But that's just me...a 47 year old curmudgeon! You'll find me happily ensconced in hell with the tyrannicides and regicides."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Just bought all three parts of the LOTR trilogy on CD. The reviews talked about how it was read by someone and it wasn't different actors or voices, etc. However, it is exactly that different actors reading the parts. It is not a person reading the book to you. I'm going to listen to it and then either sell it or gift it but I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to be careful in lumping together reviews of products that once existed with new ones and with different formats, etc. This is not acceptable."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I originally read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy about 25 years ago while still in college. At the time it was all the rage as a leisure time read.With the release of the movie we are now seeing a resurgence in popularity of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.As a work of fantasy , the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stands out from the rest of the pack of would be fantasy novels like a Rembrandt at an amatuer art exhibition. In this regard I have concluded that GOOD fantasy is extremely hard to write. There are alot of wannabe fantasy writers that simply attempt to imitate Tolkien (for the most part they just don't get the job done!).The \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first book in the\\"Lord of the Rings\\" , trilogy and introduces the One Ring , or the master ring of power forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. In the novelette that timewise preceeds this book , \\"The Hobbit\\" , Bilbo Baggins finds the magic ring and after a series of adventures , returns to the Shire and retires to a remarkably long life.\\"The Fellowship\\" begins with allusions of a stirring of evil power attributed to a resurgence of the power of Sauron and the issuance of the nine dark riders , the high Nazgul , who are afield in search of the One Ring.Gandalf the Grey , apparantly a jolly old wizard , comes to Bilbo's birthday party to provide fireworks , and convinces Bilbo to leave the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins before once again going on the road for an adventure.And thus begins an epic quest for Frodo. Gandalf arranges for Frodo to take the ring and depart the Shire , accompanied by his faithful friend , Samwise Gamgee. On the road to Bree , Frodo and Samwise encounter two other young Hobbits , Merry and Pippin , who also enter the \\"Fellowship\\" . \\"Strider\\" , as he is called manages to rescue the young Hobbits from the Nazgul at Bree , and becomes the guide of the group.Along the way , many other amazing characters of Middle Earth are encountered , and many adventures transpire. Gandalf emerges as a mighty and powerful wizard , who uses his awesome powers to aid Frodo and his companions on the ultimate quest to the fires ofMount Doom , into which Frodo plans to cast the One Ring and forever destroy the power of Sauron.In my mind what sets the entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy apart from it's imitators is the author's knowledge of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon legends and language. There is also a warmth to the characters , the Hobbits in particular , that is missing in other fantasy works. Frodo and Samwise exhibit reservoirs of strength , determination , and courage that is unexpected.Altho' fantasy is not my favorite genre , I am rather fond of this particular work. It is exceedingly well-crafted and written by a master of his discipline. I rate this part of the trilogy 4 stars ; this is a comparative rating to the other two segements which I rate as 5 stars. I enjoyed it 25 years ago , and again recently ; recommended."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the first of the movie blockbusters (as you can tell by the pic of Elijah Wood on the cover). And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, and quite eccentric. He has also adopted his bright young nephew/cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life after that. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the aghast young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the dark lord Sauron. It corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him...Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. (The reader almost wants to yell \\"Don't do it!\\" when Frodo is given the Ring) The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't overdo the descriptions of such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.I will warn you that you should have the second and third books on hand when you read this. As this was originally intended to be one huge chunk of a book, it ends on a semi-cliffhanger. (The movie ends in about the same place, so if it frustrated you there, you'd be frustrated here as well) If you're a person who can't handle anything more complex than a half-hour sitcom, or think that Harry Potter is the pinnacle of modern literature, then this book is not for you.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit with a fascination for Elves to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I first read The Hobbit in grade school, and loved the adventure and excitement of Bilbo&#65533;s journey to Lonely Mountain to defeat the evil dragon. But I grew bored mid-way through Fellowship of the Ring, as the second half of that book focused on the ancient histories and alien geography of Middle Earth. I never finished the trilogy.When I picked up both books fifteen years later, I had the reverse experience. The Hobbit was still fun to read, but rather childish and simple. On the other hand, FOTR captured my imagination because of the incredibly complex, detailed lore surrounding Middle Earth. Tolkien spends much time discussing the differences in attitudes, customs, and languages of his three major races &#65533; men, dwarves, and elves &#65533; almost as if he were writing an anthropology textbook rather than a novel.Frodo&#65533;s mission to destroy the Great Ring, while exciting, serves primarily as device to flesh out the mythos of the Middle Earth universe. Indeed, some of the most exciting action scenes in the recent movie version (Gandalf&#65533;s battle with the evil wizard; the capture and escape of Gollum) occur &#65533;off camera&#65533; in the book and are related to the reader second-hand. Other important sequences, such as the battle with the demon balrog, occupy only a few brief pages.This book is not for everybody. It demands a lot of patience through long passages of exposition and backstory. It leaves gaps in the narrative for readers to flesh out in their imaginations. But, once you begin to understand the intricacies of Tolkien&#65533;s world, it becomes an engrossing experience. I will wait another year before reading the next volume (just in time for the movie, probably). But I plan to buy a copy of the Silmarillion this week to brush up on the stories of ancient Middle Earth, events alluded to in FOTR but never fully explained."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"...the book is better. Better in the sense that Tolkien's language is so rich and his descriptions of Middle Earth and his characters so vivid that these are virtually impossible to capture in full in the film-makers medium. With that said, however, I think Peter Jackson's film is a phenomenal piece of work and probably as true to Tolkien's vision as possible.I am not a fan of fantasy fiction, but this book (the Lord of the Rings, that is, of which this is just a piece) transcends the genre to rank as one of the 20th century's greatest works of literature in English language. Give it a few pages, and then be prepared to be swept up in a world utterly unlike our own, and yet, particularly in light of what's going on in the world today, so chillingly similar.Fantastic - almost prophetic - stuff."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Many of the negative reviews here conjure up an image of a single type of critic. There may of course be exceptions, but the complaints seem to come from people born within the last 25 years, those who are mostly indoctrinated in the fast and the flashy, the dumbed-down, the highly edited movies and TV shows of their youth, those more comfortable punching a remote control than turning a page. Well, this isn't for them, pure and simple, and they should have known that when they saw the size of it. Tolkien's lengthy descriptions of the landscape are welcome as far as I'm concerned; he had a love for the natural world and it shows. At the very least, if anything in print can get you away from asphalt and cell phones, this is it. In my mind that's a great part of its charm. His description of the Shire is based on rural England as he knew it and loved it before the First World War, and he wants us to experience that through a fictional medium. And many years ago, when I first read it, the references to the earlier histories of Middle Earth, whether expounded in conversation or song, were among the most fascinating aspects of it, and I can't imagine why anybody would object to that if they're voluntarily reading the thing in the first place. It adds greatly to the depth and involvement in this other world, and does not - repeat, does not - noticeably slow down the action. The style has been criticized as &quot;archaic&quot;. If they want archaic, they should try William Morris' fantasy novels of the 1890s. Tolkien keeps the archaism under control. In fact, the style is one of the most remarkable things about the book. Since The Fellowship of the Ring follows immediately (plotwise) upon The Hobbit, which was written as a children's book in the 1930s, to smooth over the transition to this more serious and complex work the author starts out in a style similar to that of The Hobbit, and gradually brings it up to a more mature level before Frodo makes it to Rivendell. This is done so unobtrusively that I've never seen it mentioned before. It's one of the more subtle strengths of the work. The style, admittedly, changes somewhat in later situations, but deliberately, and the so-called archaic writing that appears when the action is in the field before Minas Tirith in The Return of the King, for example, is entirely appropriate and adds just the right atmosphere. In any case, it's very readable and never difficult going, unless you need everything spelled out in monosyllables. A comment that Tolkien borrows too much from Arthurian fantasy is just meaningless. Everything borrows from something, and most of the motifs of Arthurian fantasy are found elsewhere anyway. Arthurian legend itself was a series of borrowings until it reached the form we know today. If I have any criticism of the book, it's that at some places in the plot things are obviously rigged for the good guys to succeed. For example, in Book 1, when Frodo and his pals are in the Shire one night lying low as a Black Rider is creeping up on them, drawn by the power of the Ring, suddenly a troop of Elves, rarely seen in the Shire, just happen to show up to scare off the Rider. Whew! That was close. Something like that happens several times in the Trilogy. But such plot abuse is so common in fiction and movies that it's almost forgiveable. Is it the greatest novel ever written? Hardly. But it's certainly one of the most sheerly entertaining things I've ever read. To repeat what a lot of readers have said before,&quot;The book is too short.&quot;(BL, Tucker, GA)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I purchased the CD version of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; which states on the back of the box that it contains the both the original Forward and Prologue.

In The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien a malicious ring is passed on to a young hobbit. The hobbit though is doomed to take the ring and destroy it at on of the darkest corners of the earth. However, black riders that work for Sauron (the creator of the ring who rules them all) want the master ring and want to kill him. the nine black riders,(sent by sauron) are owners of the nine other rings which are specially made for them.I think this is not a boring book but a different book that is just a different way of writing. I think it is very cult. I also think it is obviously very fictional and it is a book that is also very adventurous and mysterious. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a classic and cultural book. I warn though, that when reading, the person needs to have patience if they think \\"Book 1\\" is too boring to read. I you are a person that likes only the books like the Da Vinci Code which is a thriller you wont like it that much. However, someone that likes Science Fiction will like it, since it is a very mysterious book that has from evil rings, to adventurous hobbits.Though most of the book is pretty boring it does include mystery especially after the council of Elrond, when the fellowship sees the glowing eyes appearing and disappearing into the darkness of their journey."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I remembered from years ago when I first read The Lord of the Rings trilogy that these were really wonderful books. After watching the first two of the movies I decided to buy the books again and read them after many years to see if the books are as bad as the movies or if my memory was faulty.I feel redeemed. The books are wonderful, just the movies were bad.For those of you who were shunning the books because you found the movies to be a steaming pile of excrement, do yourself a favor and spring a few bucks at the used book store a copy and see what a real work of literary excellence looks like.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection.

And yes, he wrote this. You must be pretty stupid not to know that the book came before the movie. The way you wrote your review, you made it seem like you thought the movie came before the book.

The story on the screen is captivating and the special affects were astounding. The book though was tedious. It was just a boring discription of history and observations about the nature in the journey. I could hardly connect with any of the characters on an emotional level and I really coundn't get into the story and missed some of the important plot point because i just wanted to finish it. I do like the story and plot so that is why my rating is this high."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I know I'll probably go to hell for saying this, but I really do not see why Tolkien is so popular. I can not deny that he writes intelligently. His world is undeniably well thought out. However, it seems to me that his style of writing is out of date and if he wrote the Lord of the Rings Trilogy today-- it would flop. His story is bogged down with detail (most of it unnessasary), the plot is typical (yes I know his story is the protoype for modern fantasy writers)and his characters seem very flat as compared to the demand we put on writers today for well rounded characters. I have great respect for Tolkien, but I think some readers love him only because of his reputation and not for his work. His style of writing is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"Has some engaging bits in it, but really only for real fantasy die-hards"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"This Houghton-Mifflin hardcover edition has an inexcusable misprint--buyer beware.

If not, read The Hobbit, its a good background and a good book in its own right, then pick up this and read away. You'll never want to leave. Although there are many fantasy writers, none can compare with Tolkien (still, I really like The Wheel of Time series). He is the master of fantasy, undisputed.

Each story (averaging around thirty pages) tells everything that needs to be said about their characters. Their lives are there in their entirety. These are real stories of a simplier time, in a pleasent,more docile place. And what happens as modern day begins to seep in, casting a gloom on all the old glories of the past. These people do not understand what is happening. They are upper class rich white folks of the near south, clinging to an old way of life that is somehow becoming irrelevent. It's the coming and,later, the going of The Great War, when Hitler was making it life or death, and the ole red white and blue is gonna die fighting. This is how life seems to these privilaged folks, and their uneasy relationships with their Jim Crow servants is starting to show signs of wear and tear, and even the good ones are acting all uppity and haven't they always been decent to their HIRED HELP?Attitudes like this were very much in existence during the eras where these narratives take place.Now I usually don't go in for stuff this tame, but the emotion is true, the stories are wonderful and any aspiring writer could learn more from this book than any creative writing class could teach (unless they taught the book--then, good job.) This is how you want to tell a story. Not style, not mood or tone or pitch or pace--this is what a beginning, a middle and a climactic end should look like. It is a model of short fiction. You know how plays have acts and novels have chapters? Here is the short story"},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"I have trouble with assessments of great writing that tend to subordinate every concept to setting. We know that Chekhov wrote about the Russian provinces, Cheever wrote about WASPs in New England, William Trevor writes about lower middle-class Ireland, and Faulkner wrote about Mississippi. We also know that Taylor writes about the upper South (not the so-called &quot;Deep South&quot; that some others have mentioned). So what? What many of us realize, but often fail to mention, is that Taylor is writing about the human condition, as all of these great writers have. I'm a firm believer in the notion that the setting is incidental--a product of the world Taylor understood. So, as we can say with Chekhov, Cheever, and Trevor, Taylor writes about people. We appreciate these stories because they are about us, whether we're from Maine, Mississippi, or Maryland. If you have any belief in a universal human condition (whatever that may be), in the truth inherent to archetypal stories about people, you'll find that the setting only serves as the metaphorical framework in which the author works. It's our own problem if we have trouble shedding our regionalism, not Taylor's. Also, this book is not an obituary to the death of any particular culture, but a celebration of life and universal human relationships. How can &quot;The Gift of the Prodigal&quot; be about anything but that? Who would say that &quot;The Gift of the Prodigal&quot; is about Charlottesville, VA? So, by all means read this book. Don't be turned off by its Southern setting or its WASPy characters anymore than you would be turned off by Chekhov's rural Russia."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"This is a fantastic collection of short stories by the master of the genre in Southern literature. Each takes place in the old south of the 1930's and 40's and are stories of simple events of everyday life. However, these simple events are not so simple because of the complex and unusual social structure and race relations. Taylor masterfully brings out the tension beneath each relationship and in each seemingly simple situation in a way that accurately transmits the feeling of this most troubled time and place. Two of the stories \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Two Ladies in Retirement\\" appear in another collection \\"The Widows of Thornton\\" but are worth rereading.You can read about the old south and Jim Crow before the Civil Rights movement in history books but Taylor, along with other great writers such as Richard Wright, help you feel and understand the myriad of unresolvable conflicts, unstated resentments and tensions simmering just below the facade of life.Taylor masterfully documents how Blacks and Whites live intimately and form a greater family unit with mutual yet unequal duties and obligations, live so close yet be separate and far away. He also shows how domestic servanthood for Blacks was very much like slavery in that they were free but highly dependent on their white employers. Long-term domestics even form family-type relationships with each other.My favorite stories are \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"The Old Forest.\\" Don't miss this wonderful collection."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"I have a confession to make. I don't like these stories. I recognize the strengths of Taylor's story telling - the elegant language, the depiction of emotional tension in simple things, the clear progression of 'story' or theme from setup to inevitable conclusion, but I can't get past a deep dislike for his characters. This is a personal failing. Taylor's fiction depicts a world that is inhabited almost exclusively by a certain class of affluent, white, middle class city dwellers whose lives are bounded on the upside by manners, fashion and ritual (in imitation of an upper class to which, presumably, they aspire)and on the downside by a stiff reticence and correctness of behavior to insulate them from their inferiors (not only their black servants but also whites of a lesser social and economic standing). I grew up in Nashville, TN at a time when this world was rapidly passing away, but I have met people, more than a few, who could have stepped from the pages of these stories, and almost without exception developed a deep antipathy for them. Their overt arrogance which seemed to mask a great fear of the world 'outside' always made social intercourse with such people strained and unsatisfying. There is nothing like being politely condescended to to make the recipient want to deliberately break convention and strike through the mask. So it's personal.I have read, and reread, these stories enough to see that Taylor's characters are frequently as frightened of change and the possible corruption of contact outside their little world as I had sensed in the real Taylor-type folk I have met. There is great skill in his presentation of this tension, but it doesn't lead me to empathize, much less sympathize, with his characters.Any given person's response to a piece of fiction is going to be colored by a host of factors over which the author has no control, and no writer ever had universal success at generating the response he desires the reader to have. In the case of my response to Taylor's stories, I fear that my dislike of the specific milieu (and its inhabitants) that is his chosen subject will forever keep me from a full appreciation of his work."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"Peter Taylor, from an upper class Southern family and a Harvard man, is the kind of writer one doesn't see that much of these days. If he transgresses, he does so politely, with an awareness of the sensiblities of the civilized white reader. His characters are mostly proper, well-off white Memphians, yet their lives are frequently involved with the less fortunate, particularly the black folks whom they employ. His prose is very nicely put together, with a good amount of realistic detail, along with interesting insights into his characters. In fact many of these stories turn on the subtle revelation of a character, or the true nature of a relationship. His big subjects seem to be family relationships, loyalty (of family members, of servants and masters), and the interdependence of white and black folks in the South.'\\"The Old Forest\\" is the best story here, and it was encountering this that made me want to read more of his work. It is a real classic, a gracefully written, almost novella-length tale of troubled young romance and class in the South. In it, a young man of means is running around with a lower class girl in the weeks leading up to his marriage to a proper young lady. This kind of behavior is quite the norm in the world of this story, and the guy is a decent sort, but still totally clueless as to the feelings he may be arousing in others and the pain he could cause them. He gets into a car accident, and his semi-paramour flees the scene and vanishes, thus causing a big problem for all concerned. The police begin looking for her, and his wedding has to be postponed. Finally his fiancee takes charge and begins to sort things out.I was hoping the other stories would be up to this standard, but most of them are not - which is not to say they are bad, just that they are not as riveting and outstanding. \\"A Friend and Protector\\" was fascinating and eloquent, the story of a troubled black servant and the white family that always rescues him and forgives him. \\"The Little Cousins\\" is a nice look at the excitements of a bourgeois Memphis childhood, and is one of several stories that looks at the relations of young folks and their elders. In \\"The Gift of the Prodigal\\", a rascal of a son provides his bored, lonely father with some vicarious excitement. \\"A Long Fourth\\" was also very enjoyable, a study of an extended family, focusing on the matriarch, as it goes about a summer get-together. There is not much of a plot, but the piece as effective as a family portrait in a certain time and place.If you are interested in Southern literature and stories of bourgeois families, this is well worth a look."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"The Washington Post's Jonathan Yardley called \\"The Old Forest\\" the greatest American short story. The story is amazingly powerful -- touches on issues of race, class, love, family -- and will haunt one long after finishing it. Some of the other stories in this collection are equally exceptional and involve complex situations-- my two favorites include \\"Rain in the Heart,\\" which reminded me of a world my grandparents must have experienced and \\"The Gift of the Prodigal,\\" which reminded me that imperfections often are what makes life worth living."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"In this book of short stories, I chose this one because of the locations and main character. Miss Betty moved from Nashville to St. Louis in 1926 where she had unofficially adopted the Tolliver family as her own. For years, her cousin Flo had \\"visited\\" but Miss B. had sold her ancestral home on West End Avenue for a new start in life. She had a rivalry with the black cook for the young boys' devotion. They enjoyed listening to the old stories.Christmas was the time -- and the only time -- when she was allowed to give expensive present like bicycles. She had to compete with the storytelling of the servants, especially the old cook who always had a chocolate cake hid to entice their favor. Even Amy, the mother, treated her Southern servants with the same miixture of cordiality and formality she used with her neighbors. Their home was on the underground railroad.Much is made of in-house maneuvers and wrong doings. It was a time when the world was changing, preparing people for one thing and giving them another. An unexpected ending makes you wonder exactly who is the winner.'The Old Forest' and rest of the stories are based on Taylor's family and appeared in such magazines as 'The Kenyon Review,' 'Sewanee Review,' 'The New Republic,' and 'The New Yorker' of which \\"Two Ladies in Retirement\\" is an example. He was the precursor of James Agee, writing personal accounts of Old South, 30 years apart. Things were never the same for this area after the Civil War and reconstruction. Not many went to St. Louis as in this sordid account, as the carpetbaggers came to us to change and ruin gentility and our way of life."},{"Title":"Old Forest and Other Stories","review":"There are amongst the hundreds of styles of short story, those that hug the side of pure narrative and those that offer a snippit of the complexities of human life. Of the latter, there is none greater than Anton Chekov, but modern masters also abound... Tobias Wolfe comes to mind. In my reading of Peter Taylor's \\"The Old Forest and Other Stories\\", I couldn't help but feel that his audience has passed. I enjoyed many of the stories, some quite alot, but they did not speak to me. They did not resonate. Personal favorites like 'Promise of Rain','The Scoutmaster', and 'The Gift of the Prodigal' contain more of an element of a narrative style, sprinkled with those ominous gaps that lie behind a person's mind. The titular story is perhaps my favorite except for its being bogged down with expository literacy. I have a distinct feeling that I have read a book that added to my knowledge of writing and reading as a whole, but I have not read a book in which I have thoroughly enjoyed.With full acknowledgments for the differences in taste, I must express a total dislike of many of the other stories: the final play, 'The Death of a Kinsman' in particular. The underhandedness disguised as cleverness on the writer's part is obfuscating and patronizing. In fact, I think patronizing is a good word to sum up the collection. However, good writing intentionally raises opinions. If you've come so far as to read the reviews on this page, it might just be worth investigating these stories yourself."},{"Title":"Getting them sober,","review":"I needed a copy of Getting Them Sober for a family trying to deal with an alcohol problem.This book has been around for a long time.

We need to take seriously the lessons conveyed in this story and in the Scriptures Strong quotes. Otherwise, we will be just as doomed as the wicked antediluvians."},{"Title":"Song of Eve","review":"June Strong successfully manages to portray the world before the flood, the sinfullness of man, his lust, his greed and the loving God.

It literally brought me to tears with a smile on my face."},{"Title":"Song of Eve","review":"A friend recommended the book to my wife. I bought a copy on Amazon and she read it.

When I began to read it it immediately captivated me. It is the only book I have seen about this time in history; the time of the flood. It flows nearly from the bible itself, with all the reference verses it contains. it made me laugh, cry, and rejoice, honestly. I am now in my 20s and this book remains one of the few books I have read more than once. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting some light in their books. read it please."},{"Title":"Song of Eve","review":"I first read this book when I was a young woman and it made such an impact that it genuinely coloured my view of the area and country I wanted to live, the type of lifestyle I wanted to live, and the type of partner I wanted to share my life with.It's going on for 30 years since I first read it. Finding another copy and having the chance to re-read the story, I'm struck again by how much it still made me yearn for a simpler acceptance of the good in the world, and made me weep during the sadder parts as I looked back on all of the dark times that have occurred in my own life during the years since I first discovered this beautiful story.Read it!

I was right to do so...This book is quite small, and can fit in the average shirt or pant pocket, which is good, as some 'pocket books' can't even do that! However the contents of the text are simply satisfactory; the essentials are covered, however this is done in a manner which prevents the average 'layperson' from understanding them to any useful degree. After consulting some other texts, such asHomework Helpers: Chemistry, a great book by the way, I was able to use pocket chemistry as a supplement, but a mediocre one at that.Target Audience: Those with formal education in chemistry who need a quick refresher on essential topics in this area, and will be able to recall minor, but important details, pertaining to certain concepts."},{"Title":"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Chemistry","review":"This book gives good expanations of most of the bigger concepts in a college Chemistry(I) course. It does skip and skimp on important subjects though. But, I guess that it to be expected from a limited pocket guide. If your looking for examples there are very few. If you want percent composition or a half descent explanation on chemical nomenclature there will be none. The point, if you want an in detail solid understanding inorder to earn an \\"A\\" in chemistry get a more detailed book. This book can be too vauge at times.

Its a big book desnsely packed with information. I wavered between a 4 and a 5, because theres a couple of faults with the book, but on consideration theres so much information packed in, compared to some of the photohsop books on the market it doesnt warrant the 5.My main complaints with this book are firstly the design and layout of interior pages is very poor, the screengrabs range from shoddy to badly captured, and ive a feeling a few older screen grabs ahev found their way in here as well. whatever software you guys are using for screen grabs you ned to think again, some of the screen grabs havent been cropped well and just look messy.As to the layout, with such an information heavy book, layout would have made the readers life so much easier, the vertical sideways title page are terrible, and to be honest the rest of the book just looks like a quark template stuffed full of content in a hurry.Hire a new designer and this books probelms are dealt with. compare with the layout on some of the other books around, a design orientated book just should not look this bad.my other problem is that some of the graphics and examples in the book are just poor, of little practical use, and some of the artwork used in examples is just laughable, i get the feeling that the authors do know a lot about photoshop, but some of their design work is bad.despite the horrors of the books design, and some really stupid unrealistic examples, there is so much information in here i think it warrants a high rating, this book would serve well as a guide to learning photohsop, and it seems evident that this is where the approach and material have been created from.There is an enormous ammount of information here and it is very learning orientated, the ammount of information can work against the book in one respect as its somewhat daunting and can be hard to find things, but it covers a lot of information and thats the imprortant thinig.i would disagree about some reviewers commensta bout this being the most authoritive book for photographers using photoshop, but it has a few elemnts which are useful."},{"Title":"Photoshop 7 Artistry (Voices (New Riders))","review":"Great book.

But I guess most people entering digital photography need to learn the same things.It is an excellent book and a must have for anyone working with photographs, and Photoshop.Trying to find a negative point (and it is hard to find), I would say only this: the book covers Photoshop 6 and 7, and using Photoshop with machintosh and windows. Being a windows user I keep getting confused as to what the option key is? So I have to keep looking it up -- I am going to have to make a cheat sheet. This makes it harder to read sometimes.

After purchasing and working my way through most of the popular Photoshop instruction books, I believe that Photoshop 7 Artistry: Mastering The Digital Image, by Barry Haynes and Wendy Crumpler, is hands-down the best available.Rather than focusing on drop shadows, bevelled edges, chrome effects and other &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; Photoshop features (although these techniques are also well explained), Haynes and Crumpler provide a logical, complete, and in-depth process for creating a &quot;master image&quot; file that can be used for producing superb digital prints, web-site graphics, and other image applications. Each chapter is packed with detailed information, and more screen displays than I've ever seen in a Photoshop book. The examples are well chosen and the reader can load the tutorial files from the CD that comes with the book and gain hands-on practice while studying each chapter. The authors also provide an in-depth evaluation of many of the state-of-the-art hardware/software capabilities for scanning, color calibration, and digital printing. Barry Haynes' photographic background allows him to clearly explain techniques such as the Zone System and color correction.You'll learn something new each time you open this outstandingbook. It's a &quot;must buy&quot; for aspiring Photoshop artists!"},{"Title":"Photoshop 7 Artistry (Voices (New Riders))","review":"If you are buying one book to learn Photoshop 7 (or version 6), this is probably your best bet. Learning Photoshop is similar to learning Economics -- you must learn a number of different topics and bring all of that knowledge together in your mind to understand the subject. This is a great book to help you bring together the essential topics and it covers a wide range of interesting and useful areas.Here are the main reasons this is the best book I have seen on learning Photoshop:-Conceptually, the authors have clearly thought through what is essential about learning Photoshop and have indicated which chapters focus on the essential material.-The authors have substantial experience teaching and writing about Photoshop and this experience comes through in the clarity of the writing and examples-The book is big (just over 450 pages), it is full color and every page is densely packed with valuable information that is easy to read, understand and absorb. Most other books on Photoshop are either filled with fluff, filled with white space or short.-The examples are well designed and available on the included CD ROM-This book is useful to the photographer, too. There is even a chapter on digital photography and the Zone System.-I have found the index useful and the book has helped me quickly resolve questions that I could not answer with other books.The table of contents is available here on amazon.com (go to \\"look inside this book!\\" and select the introductory pages) and will give you a pretty good idea of the scope of this book. The material available will also help you get a feel for the authors' writing style.If you find this book intimidating, I suggest you look at books by Scott Kelby such as \\"Photoshop X Photo-Retouching Secrets.\\"Kelby is easy to read, gives good instructions, is easy to understand and really knows what he is talking about (you would be surprised how many Photoshop authors give bad advice which causes degradation of files, for example. Kelby understands the product deeply enough to avoid doing this and to give you good, simple ways to deal with images).My two complaints about Kelby may be his best charms for some readers. First, his books have a lot less content than they might, but the extra white space may make the books more approachable for some readers. Second, he injects a bit too much humor into some of his books. But, as I said, many users may value these \\"features.\\"Other books on Photoshop worth considering:\\"Real World Adobe Photoshop X\\" by David Blatner and Bruce Fraser\\"The Photoshop X Wow!

As a rule I have been disappointed with many of the current batch of Photoshop titles. I don't have time to filter through pages of [weak] puns or endless tutorials that either have no real point or make something that useless (one book showed how to make a red rose into a blue one - when was the last time you wanted to do that?). With that prejudice in mind, I skimmed through PS 7 Artistry, then sat down and read it and now I am using it like a cookbook when I work. It is sitting next to my computer and has become part of my library of essential Photoshop books (all 4 of them). I also love the fact the book is all in color (really great color too)on good paper so I can see and not just read what they are explaining. If you work with photographs using Photoshop 7 and you don't have this book, stop what you are doing, buy the book and (here is the secret) sit down and read it.

It requires something on the scale of the grand alignment of the planets. Haynes and Crumpler have without a doubt mastered Photoshop. They have spent years honing their teaching skills. They are both excellent writers. They have the rare discipline to go the extra step when assembling information. This is the fifth edition of their book, and it is obvious that they listen to their readers. If you thumb through the book, you will be amazed at how densely packed every page is (I've seldom seen such narrow margins). This is not clutter. Each page stands as a miracle of organization. The text and diagrams complement each other to near perfection. This is the book that should come with Photoshop.

This one goes step by step in exercises that help you grasp the concept and apply it to an image for practice. The basics for new comers are all there (set up, preferences, color calibration, layers and actions.... plus much more) and they are followed by exercises.

Nenah Sylver's books are written professionally. Simply stated, her books speak to years of dedicated study and hundreds of hours of diligent research. Dr. Sylver's incredible resources have quickly become the standard reference guidebooks for sauna therapy and rife treatment. In fact, without Dr. Sylver's books, much of the information related to these topics would be unknown and unpublished to the public in the U.S. and abroad.I highly recommend Nenah Sylver's books. They have contributed greatly to my healing journey, my writing, and my big-picture knowledge of alternative health treatment options.If you haven't already, check out Nenah's other book: \\"The Handbook of Rife Frequency Healing: Holistic Technology for Cancer and Other Diseases.\\"Bryan RosnerAuthor, \\"The Top 10 Lyme Disease Treatments\\" and\\"Lyme Disease and Rife Machines\\""},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"The book is quite expensive but it is a good one as other reviewers have said.

Finally, you get a step by step of how to properly take a sauna both before and after. I have the book out for reference and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy was truly a delight to read. Dr. Sylver has a gifted ability to do comprehensive research, perceive the technical information that is available to the analytical mind, and then transform it into an enjoyably readable book for globally minded random thinkers such as myself.Having read Dr. Sylver's previous book The Handbook of Rife Frequency Healing, I expected the comprehensive writing skill and outstanding layout of her quality work. That was all present in this new book, but I was also pleasantly surprised at how much I learned about saunas, and how important they are for detoxification. Indeed, I was able to see that in some cases saunas may be the only therapy that can eliminate drugs, chemicals, and heavy metals especially in a rapid time frame.Dr. Sylver begins by reviewing historically documented evidence of the long history of sauna usage, construction, and cultural and social aspects of the sauna. She explains, in incredible detail, how and why the body produces sweat, and the positive benefits of deliberately inducing sweating.As in all of Dr. Sylver's work, she goes above and beyond the subject at hand by giving an expansive education of all complementary aspects of the subject. For instance, in discussing the many types of saunas and the benefits and weaknesses of different types of sauna construction, she touches on the FIR (far infrared) saunas, and gives a comprehensive education on the electromagnetic spectrum, complete with wonderful graphic charts, to make wavelengths and cycles per second theory very understandable to lay persons. She goes on to discuss the heat spectrums of visible and infrared (invisible) spectrums of light. All this comes into play in FIR saunas. As I've said, she puts so much more into her books than just the topic of the book, and this makes it so enjoyable to learn.Another thing that was so interesting was her discussion of toxins that we all come in contact with, and how each of these are directly and indirectly responsible for allergies, syndromes, disease -- in fact, all kinds of chemical and hormonal problems that we might not ever suspect are responsible for our diseased states. Even for nerve diseases that we think of as incurable in the medical world, she give evidence of significant measurable relief of symptoms directly due to the elimination of chemicals and heavy metals. The detoxification is so noticeable that it shows up in pre-program vs. post-program tests. For instance, Dr. Sylver shows conclusively that in test subjects having central nervous system afflictions as well as autoimmune diseases, in a specified program of 50 days sauna therapy gave a 99% reduction of symptoms. While we may not be able to say that medically this person was \\"cured,\\" we can say it sure made a measurable difference in the quality of this person's life.I must say that I was totally impressed. My own husband is in construction. He is constantly exposed to various chemicals in building products, paint, thinners, etc. He and I also live in an agricultural community where crop dusting goes on for days several times a year, so we are constantly exposed to abnormally large amounts of chemicals. After reading Dr. Sylver's case for how these various chemicals affect different systems, including neurological and endocrine, I was convinced that finding a sauna soon was not just a luxury to experience, but a necessity for achieving a healthy life -- free of toxic symptoms. Dr. Sylver states her case most eloquently.This book is truly a must have resource. I really enjoyed it, and learned more than I ever anticipated. Very well done!Health, Hope, Joy & Healing :May you Prosper, even as your Soul Prospers 3John 2Jennifer Rubyhttp://www.rubysemporium.comhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SymphonicHealth"},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"I know someone with MS who has used many alternative regimens to combat his illness. He did well for a couple of months on holistic therapies, but after going to the dentist to get the last of the mercury in his mouth removed, he needed his crutches continuously. Now he is in a wheelchair.What I found odd was that he had mentioned that he didn't sweat.Years ago I had an emergency root canal. The dentist packed it with a whopper mercury filling. I remember that my arms lost a significant amount of strength, my left much worse than my right (the filling was on the left side if that had anything to do with it) and the left was also a bit sore. Exercise with swimming and biking did not help the problem. This lasted through the winter months, but as springtime and summer came to Atlanta, with the 100 degree F days and me working in the yard and being \\"blessed\\" with the capacity to sweat a great deal, the strength returned to my arms in about two weeks.I thought back on this and wondered if perhaps the problem with my friend was he just did not sweat enough to get the mercury and other toxic metals out of his muscles and other tissues. Further study on the matter revealed that it may not just be the mercury in \\"silver fillings\\" that causes neurological and muscle disorders, but other toxic metals including tin and nickel.Then I read Dr. Nenah Sylver's book, \\"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy.\\" It confirmed my suspicions.Sylver explains that this is indeed the case - that sweating can be a major avenue of detoxification for the body and not just for metals but also for toxic chemicals and metabolic wastes. She explains the processes by which they are eliminated. She cites and examines studies which show how many toxic elements can be removed by sweating and it is surprising that certain types of toxins, including some metals, are most effectively excreted by the skin than by the usual avenues of elimination - the kidneys, liver, and bowel. As Dr. Sylver states, a sauna can be a necessary piece of medical equipment.The Handbook also details many other aspects of sauna use including the available types including how to construct one's own, instructions on their use, who may use a sauna and who may not, details on how to use a sauna for detoxification purposes, and how, why, and *what* we sweat.Besides the excellent content, Sylver's writing style is a delight. It is thorough yet accessible, with just the right amount of technicality to satisfy the practioner without losing the laymen in the details. Highly recommended!Brian McInturff"},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"When I first got this book as a present, I thought, what is so complicated about sweating that someone would write 325+ pages about it?But midway through the first chapter, I was hooked. This lady really knows her subject. She has done a great job making even hard-core scientific info understandable. And she writes with conviction and verve. It's easy to be engrossed by amusing historical anecdotes, but when I got to the chapters on biology and heat, even stuff I didn't think I'd be interested in, I was interested in. Turns out there was lots I didn't know about the body, including simple things I could do to keep myself healthy.One big revelation was the differences between steam heat and far infrared heat. People actually did studies on this, even one hundred years ago. Another revelation was how long toxins (chemicals etc.) can stay in the body, where they come from, how they are stored, and how dangerous they are, which is why sweating them out is such a great idea. Another revelation was the extensive charts showing how many health conditions respond well to sauna therapy and why. Apparently even those who are quite ill can be helped by sweating. I was skeptical, but Sylver has detailed quotes and protocols from doctors who specialize in detox programs for the seriously ill, and what they say makes sense.Another interesting section was what materials you should use to build your own sauna. This has a lot of detail too, from which materials are best for the chemically sensitive to which heaters work best with certain building materials. There is a good guide in the back on where to purchase components to build your own, and where to buy a ready-made sauna if you've already got the bucks. There's another multipage chart, this one comparing different types of saunas in terms of cost, construction materials, heaters, space allowance, durability, compatibility with ozone, compatibility with the chemically sensitive, etc. This will save people lots of time when they're shopping around.The chapter on how to take a sauna contains plenty of commonsense advice, including a few surprises and some info about heatstroke. No stone seems unturned in this book. Thankfully, Sylver doesn't appear to make any unsubstantiated claims, her book is heavily referenced. But although she is really into the science, she never makes you feel stupid, she walks you through all the explanations step by step and when you're done you really feel as though you've learned something.While reading this book, I really wanted to start sweating immediately. There is a handy compendium in the back of the book of resorts, health clubs, and spas all over the US (and some overseas) that have saunas and steam rooms. There was a place nearby with an infrared sauna, so I went there and had a real sweaty time.I don't yet own a sauna, but this book definitely convinced me to start saving to buy my own.

As a columnist for the Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients, I have often written about the need for increased awareness of how environmental toxins lead to degenerative disorders. We are exposed every day to pesticides in the home and in our food supply, to preservatives and solvents in personal care products, and numerous other categories of noxious chemicals. These common and dangerous toxins interfere with the body's immunity, and over a long period of time affect our ability to maintain health and stamina.In order to avoid the numerous degenerative diseases that plague Americans, it is crucial that we eliminate these accumulated toxins from our bodies. Nenah Sylver has written a very readable book--informative, clear, interesting, well researched, ideal for both the layperson and the professional health care provider. The documentation is comprehensive and covers many areas. A few sources are over a century old and quaint by today's standards, but still relevant. I was familiar with much of the research, but this book makes everything accessible in one place.This book is well organized. Its index and \\"how-to\\" instructions are user-friendly, and the medical tables are inventive. There is also an excellent explanation of Far Infrared, which comprises most of one chapter, with an unusual chart of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition to medical studies and data on biology and physiology, there is information on saunas themselves: design, heaters, how heat is transmitted, construction materials etc., which helps the reader sort through the hype of sauna manufacturers. I was pleased to learn how Far Infrared exceeds the value and benefits of other heat treatments.The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy is well worth the price. Not only is the information superlative, but the design of the book is excellent, with good margins and easy-to-read print. The book is also extremely comfortable to hold, like a well loved lap dog.This book is an excellent tool for anyone interested in health maintenance and disease prevention.

I feel that it saved me months, perhaps years, of personal research. When it comes to health it is not wise to learn the facts after the fact. You can make a bad situation worse this way.

There is a safe way to do it and a multitude of not safe ways to do it. If you are seriously interested in improving your health through the use of saunas I would seriously encourage you to get this book and learn how to do it correctly, and safely from the start.Donna Crowhttp://www.excellentthings.com"},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"A few years back, I purchased a FIR sauna after becoming aware of their value from readings on the Internet. After my purchase, I decided that it might be good to buy a book on the topic of saunas to ensure that I was properly using the sauna. I guess that I was a little backwards in my thinking. I should have purchased the book first and then the sauna. Anyway, I am glad that I purchased the book as it did shed light on the proper way to use a sauna. It is important to replenish lost minerals from the sweating process. I can tell you that I have experienced what I consider to be a miracle from my sauna. I was experiencing what I can only imagine was arthritis in my hands and wrist. The pain was excruciating. I was afraid to open a jar for fear of the searing pain that might accompany it. After dedicated use of the sauna, the pain is gone. I also know that I am sweating out toxins and actually enjoy the time in the sauna. Nenahs book was a smart buy. I would also like to share my experience with my order of her book. My order was late to the point that I was convinced that the book was lost in transit. I called Nenah and was apologized to and assured that a second book would be sent. I received the book a short time after the phone call. I also was sent a second book by her(The Handbook of Rife Frequency Healing) as a gesture of an apology. This was way beyond anything that I expected. I know that the first book lost in transit, was not her fault. I am sure a lot of merchandise gets inadvertantly lost just due to the shear bulk of items mailed. When I received this book, it held little interest to me due to my ignorance on the topic. Well, this book blew my mind with the introduction to Royal Raymond Rife and his amazing invention. It is an incredible invention and book. Is there an actual alternative cure for cancer? Did Royal Raymond Rife invent it? I believe it. Buy this book also. It is amazing. If you, or anyone you know is ill, with any type of serious affliction, check this book out. The information in it could save your life. This has become much longer than I intended. I only meant to write to thank Nenah for her great books and to write to tell people who might be interested in their health, to consider purchasing her books.

Applying her inquiring mind to the subject of sweat, she soon realized there was far, far more to say than she had realized.Modern medicine seems to be gradually coming to terms with what traditional cultures from China to Europe to Peru and beyond have long known about disease: It's the toxins, silly. Toxins in our food and in our environment build up in our bodies, resulting in a host of maladies from the annoying to the life threatening. Modern life, of course, exposes us to toxins our ancestors never dreampt ofThose same cultures, as Sylver makes plain in an early chapter, understand the value of simple sweating- brought on by heating the body- as a way to flush those toxins out and leave room for health to happen. And although saunas may have caught on as an essential component of the modern American health spa or club, it's doubtful that most people really understand the depth and breadth of benefits they can realize by making sauna therapy a regular part of their health regimen, as the Finns have done for generations.The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy aims to correct that situation, and does so admirably, with chapters on sauna history, how and why we sweat, what's in sweat and why our bodies need to get rid of it- and goes on to discuss heat types, sauna construction, various health conditions that may benefit from sauna therapy and a few that rule it out or require modifications, how to sweat properly, overall detoxification problems, and where to find the nearest sauna or get one of your very own.The author's intelligence and depth of research are formidable; thankfully, her writing style is not. She manages to be both in-depth and conversational, not to mention extremely convincing- her enthusiasm is backed by exhaustive study, which she clearly enjoyed, and the sense of enjoyment shines through in the text. Sylver has found out something good to share with the rest of us, and does so with panache, sincerity and sensitivity.Should you read this book? Do you inhabit a human body? (If you don't, and are currently reading this, please contact the Bluestone Press for a feature story.) Would you like to regain or maintain health and vitality for the rest of your years, without relying on the pharmaceutical industry and the wizards of managed care?The book is available at www.NenahSylver.com, along with a host of other intriguing stuff. Check it out. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy","review":"This book is easy to sum up: without doubt, the most well-researched and comprehensive book on the topic in the English language.As a physician and author myself, I was absolutely impressed with Dr. Sylver's thorough research and writing style. It is rare to find someone who can write about complex medical and scientific topics in such a clear, even fun way.This book is a presentation of what is one of the two or three best techniques anyone can use for getting and staying well. Saunas -- applying heat to the body to induce sweating -- has been in continuous use as a healing method for tens of thousands of years. It is applied today in virtually every therapeutic approach to treatment of a wide range of conditions, ailments and diseases. Saunas are affordable enough to be part of everyone's home regimen for health.I recommend this book to everyone interested in discovering one of the best healing methods available, anywhere, at any price.Hakim Chishti, NDhttp://www.unani.comauthor ofTraditional Healers Handbook &Book of Sufi Healing(both available of Amazon.com)"},{"Title":"Bakers Dictionary of Opera (1 Vol)","review":"Actually, when it comes to \\"primary\\" references, there are only two \\"musts\\" for opera fans (ASSUMING said fans want a single, TRULY COMPREHENSIVE encyclopedia of operas and opera composers):(1) One would be either the (1993 hardcover edition) \\"Viking Opera Guide\\" or its more recent (renamed) softcover incarnation, the (2001 edition) \\"NEW Penguin Opera Guide.\\" [Ignore all earlier or \\"concise\\" opera guides bearing the word \\"Penguin\\" but not also the word \\"New\\" in their titles!](2) The other would be the huge, four-volume \\"New Grove Dictionary of Opera.\\"The four-volume \\"New Grove\\" is the ultimate, but it also costs a small fortune.

Black and white photos enhance a well-rounded coverage which will prove a 'must' for opera fans."},{"Title":"The Multiple States of Being","review":"This book has a reputation for being the most difficult of Guenon's purely metaphysical works. Perhaps this is because it is an explanation, or rather introduction, to the totality of Creation- manifest, unmanifest, higher, lower, and probable.Here are described the manifest worlds of the material plane (the least part of creation), the higher planes of more subtle states (touched upon in _The Symbolism of the Cross_ as lying along the vertical axis), and all the possible, but unmanifested worlds on any plane (which sounds remarkably like the modern conception of the &quot;multiverse.&quot;)Yet, it is pointed out that all of this still falls far short of true infinity- it is a small included subset of the unlimited Source.The human intersection with creation is also covered. This includes hints of &quot;non-corporeal modalities&quot; of human existence and consciousness. This covers simultaneously existing aspects of human consciousness on higher planes, that ordinary waking consciousness is ordinarily unaware of (yet, which comprise the greater part of consciousness.) Above all, it is emphasized that the human state is in reality only one small state of manifestation among countless others. There are an unlimited number of levels in the hierarchy of degrees of existence. Moreover, the human state occupies no privileged place in the ensemble of universal existence- the human state is in no way &quot;metaphysically distinguished&quot; in relation to other states. It just happens to be the state where most of us find ourselves at the present. That is all it is. If there is anything &quot;special&quot; about the human state, it lies in that spark of the Divine that lies at the heart of all of us, where the divine ray intersects with gross matter. And this intersection can occur at any point on the vertical axis of creation. It is also suggested that nonhuman, never human, entities share this creation with us.All of this is not just idle &quot;New Age&quot; speculation; these are the conclusions of Guenon, the great metaphysician and mathematician."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"This book is such a great read.I'm pretty sure there was a sequel, based on Ian, another brother.

Through Storm and Tavis's relationship you experience humor, mystery and passion so deep you feel it also. I fell in love with the seven up gang and Tavis's brothers and would love to read a book about them."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"I first read this when I was about 14 and fell in love with the characters. This has been recently re-printed under the new title \\"His Bonnie Bride\\".The story starts with the battle between the Eldons of England and the MacLagans of Scotland, who have been sworn enemies for centuries. We meet a 10-year-old Storm for the first time, who endears herself to her families' enemies, and leaves a mark on Tavis MacLagan, her future lover. Seven years later and Tavis stumbles upon her by accident and ends up saving her from the advances of Sir Hugh, but in return she was taken as a hostage. Of course we know the other reason for this, but that is what makes this book so exciting. As the story progresses, Storm and Tavis find themselves more and more drawn to each other. Storm falls in love with Tavis, and Tavis finds himself struggling to suppress his feelings for her for fear of being burned once again.The main characters are very likeable. Storm is funny, quick-witted, passionate and strong. And she certainly doesn't mince words! Tavis is handsome and sexy and a perfect match for her. You will love every moment of them together, and will laugh at all their fights. The author has done really well to make the readers feel for the characters. This is a very sweet, witty and exciting novel, spiced up more by the sizzling love scenes. The appearance of their family also adds to the fun of the story.I wish that there would be a sequel, as this book is a real favorite. Don't miss this one. A wonderful book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"Amber flame was the first romance novel I ever read. I found it in a local drug store for two dollars and from the beging I could not put the book down. I was caught in the story from the start. I loved Storm her will and charactor was a wonderfull twist on other females in romance novels. She was so strong and till the very end faught for herself. I loved her strong will and her graudual process of falling in love with Tavis. I did feel sorry for her in the beging but came to love both charactors through out the book. I loved how Tavis orginally statted using her as a way to show power but then became protective of her and fell in love with her. But even till the very end of the book (like a true man) would not confess his love. I loved the scene where they parted and the scene where they came back together. And I was happy for the wonderfully happy ending I couldn't have asked for more. If I could recomend any book this would be it. From start to finish you will love this book. And I thank Hannah Howell for giving me such easy charactors to love. I look forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put the book down! The characters are well developed, and Hannah Howell did a great job on the plot. The only thing is that the love that Storm felt for Tavis came to early in the story, yet didn't really give a reason to why she loved him. It's easy to see how everyone could love Storm, I was moved when she got beaten up by Sir Hugh and her stepmother. I don't see how Tavis could have accepted his exmistress back into the castle nor could I see how he could have gone back to kissing her after she told Sir Hugh of Storm's whereabouts in which she was captured and beaten badly.All of Hannah Howell books are great, if u havent' read them, go buy them, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"Tavis and Storm are perfect for each other. Storm is one of my favorites. She is strong willed, outspoken, honest and &quot;calls a spade, a spade&quot;. She is incapable of mincing words. Ms Howell does a marvelous job expressing the true, deeper feelings of these two people. Couldn't put it down with so much going on in the story. Another great find at auction. If you can find a copy don't pass it up, it will be worth the search."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"This book was re-titled HIS BONNIE BRIDE and published again in 2004. Don't buy it twice. In fact, after reading it, I wouldn't recommend you buy it once.

The maturity of the storytelling really doesn't reflect well on later Hannah Howell efforts."},{"Title":"Amber Flame","review":"I guess I'm getting too jaded in my Romance reading but I'm sick of the \\"hostage falls for her captor\\" storyline.

It's still too \\"forced\\" and coerced to be romantic. I for one would like to see more Medieval heroes written with some sort of honor.

The so-called troubled teens being treated at the Riverside Adolescent Psychiatric Center are, in fact, resourceful, determined, independent young people who easily outwit a whole bevy of corrupt and/or inept caretakers.The colorful cast of characters runs the gamut from trailer trash to secret agents, all tripping over each other to side-splitting effect. The scenes in Colonial Williamsburg are especially entertaining, and when everyone converges on tiny Ocracoke Island for the climax, I couldn't stop laughing.Mr. Johnson clearly knows and likes his teenaged characters, giving their dialogue snap and authenticity. He also has a great deal of fun skewering the administrators, therapists and social workers of the Riverside Center. Underlying the substantial humor is a gentle message about the decisions we make about how to lead our lives as we grow up.This is a book both adults and young people can enjoy equally; I plan to pass it along to my 14-year-old daughter.Just one word of warning: once you start reading THE LOONEY BIN BLUES, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Loony Bin Blues: The Next Generation Flies Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book has a great story line and is a real page turner."},{"Title":"The Loony Bin Blues: The Next Generation Flies Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The Loony Bin Blues moves along with gusto taking it's colorful characters to a satisfying climax.

He writes about an area of the country (Richmond, VA) and a subject (adolescent looney bins) I know well, as does he. He vividly captures a number of teenage &quot;types&quot; and blends them into a story line that engages and entertains. His humor is sometimes subtle, sometimes raucous, but always -- well, humorous!While this book is fiction, the underlying theme could usefully be adopted by an enterprising, muckraking journalist who wants first crack at a &quot;business&quot; which could stand outside scrutiny."},{"Title":"The Loony Bin Blues: The Next Generation Flies Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What a fine first novel by Greg Johnson! Money is what drives the whacky characters and engaging plot, but just when you think you know where the author is heading, things veer off in another direction. But for all the highjinks and escapades, the ending returns us to a moral center that makes a sense we wish was more common in our world. Johnson obviously knows the subject area as well as the machinations that might be employed by both the inmates and the staff of a mental health institution. To shape a story in this setting with humor, compassion, and sharp dialog takes a special eye, ear, and language skill. Well done. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gousha Pennsylvania Road Atlas (Gousha State Road Atlas)","review":"The maps in this book are easy to read and have enough detail to actually get you where you're going without confusion.

And while both of the books have their flaws, I enjoyed both of them, especially \\"Phantasy\\". This story really sucked me in! I guess the hopeless romantic in me was entranced with the idea of being loved so much by someone, that their soul would follow and guard me through time! This book provides an interesting modern twist to the story of Erik and Christine, one that has its foundation in the past. Although this book could stand alone, being familiar with Meadow's previous book made this one all the more enjoyable for me.The prologue takes us back to Christine Daae's death. As her spirit struggles to stay with Erik as she has promised, a \\"presence\\" compels her to drink from the river of forgetfulness, in preparation for her reincarnation into her next life. Our present story begins with the aftermath of an argument caused by the purchase of a theatre ticket! Catherine and Charles have been married for several years. Although they love one another, there is something missing, at least for Catherine. Having tried a series of different careers, she is currently stuck in a job she really dislikes. Her one outlet is attending the theatre, especially ALW's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", which she has already seen many times. Charles can't understand why she needs to see it again. She has become so obsessed with it, that she has joined the local theatre group, hoping one day to be able to play Christine. She even has a picture of Erik, as portrayed by Michael Crawford, on the wall of her study and on her desk at work. She has gotten into the habit of talking to it when she is troubled or lonely. She has always felt that Erik's eyes have followed her movements around the room, but now she notices that his image seems to smile when she talks to it. The eyes seem to glow with a warm golden fire, and Catherine feels an ecstatic quickening of her heart.***SPOILERS***She starts to experience blackouts, during which she seems to be living the lives of other women, especially a woman imprisoned in a tower and injured by her husband, and the Phantom's Christine. What happens next sends her to a psychic, Mr. Fermen. She wakes from one of her blackouts bearing the knife injury her alter-ego received in her \\"vision\\", and when her friend, Sabine, stays with her while Charles is at work, Sabine sees Erik sitting on the bed next to Catherine, comforting her. Charles is skeptical about seeing a psychic, but agrees to go. When Mr. Fermen hypnotizes Catherine, she regresses and seems to experience several past lives, specifically one as Christine. Charles, thinks they are all nuts, until Erik actually materializes. Catherine is ecstatic and throws herself into his arms, prompting Charles to attack a very solid-seeming Erik. After Erik dematerializes and Mr. Fermen has a chance to think about all they have witnessed, he believes Catherine actually called Erik's spirit to her, and has increasingly strengthened his presence by talking to his picture so often. Fermen recommends further study and tests. It is from here that Catherine, Charles, Sabine and Fermen begin their journey of discovery, which takes them to Paris, the estate of the Chagny family, and ultimately, the cellars of the Paris Opera House.There are several different \\"camps\\" of fans. There is group that tends to pick apart any story, searching for all errors, whether of spelling, syntax, grammar, etc. or analyzing the story for hidden meaning. Then there are those that I call the purists, which feel that all POTO genre stories should remain true to the source material, whether that source be Leroux's novel or the ALW adaptation, which, itself, takes liberties with the original. The last group, in which I feel I belong, enjoys reading other authors' ideas and doesn't mind situations or characterizations that stray from the original. To these last 2 groups, I would also add a sub-group who choose not to over analyze the \\"hidden\\" meaning behind every action and/or search for flaws, and still enjoy the story.This story does have flaws; there are several plot details that remain unexplained, as there were in the previous book. However, I didn't feel that they compromised the integrity of the story. There were also some spelling errors, as in the first book, but these are not necessarily the fault of the author. If you can overlook these, and don't mind a genre story that deviates somewhat from the original, I think you will enjoy \\"Phantasy\\". But, if these types of \\"flaws\\" bother you, or if you are offended with the idea of psychics or reincarnation, you may not want to buy this one."},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"One of the worst books ever.

I feel sorry for the trees that lost their lives to become this book..."},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"This book is an absolute must for all Phantom fans! At times it san be a little hard to fallow due to the writing style that flits from one point of view to another, but it still retains more than enough pure passion and plot to keep you gripping the book until the heartwrenching conclusion. You never know what is gonna happen next, but be sure to read the prequal, Progeny first. I HIGHLY recomend this book to everyone! It's worth it!"},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"Phantasy was a book I was quite prepared not to like based on my dislike of Progeny. I was, however, suprised to find my self enjoying it. That being said the novel is a grab bag of good and bad. First I'll focus on the good. The idea of a modern story based on Phantom was interesting and Ms. Meadow's story telling skills were better suited to this time period than to the 1800's piece Progeny. Also, Erik is more of a secondary character in this book which worked well. You tend to FEEL him more than SEE him in the chapters which had an eerie effect. The end chapters where Erik gets to take out his revenge were some of the best in the book. The well read Phantom fanatic will also pick up nods to various stage productions and books. Now to the bad. One was the cost. At nearly $30 you will be out in the cold if you end up disliking the story. Another is the constant spelling, grammar, and plot goofs. At times I felt like I was reading a rough draft of the story which was very distracting. The book drags on in parts and then scurries to a so-so ending, not to mention the times it goes crashing over the top in eye rolling wonder. The characters that I had the most problems with were Charles and Catherine. Catherine was the better of the two, but why would Christine's soul seek her out, a bland actress/Phantom fan? Charles was hard to take. I dislike the Raoul character in general except in the original Leroux version. I think that he should at least though have some good qualities that would draw Christine to him. Charles was pure evil. As a warning there is some sex and lots of swearing in this one, so be prepared. In conclusion, approach this with an open mind and you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"you see, i had made the terble mistake to pay for meadows' progenym a draedful thing that i still regret. so, i waa reasonable enough not o pay for this new book: a dera friend of mine lent it to me. god knows who anvised her to buy the crap in the first place! anyways, phantasy is about 10 times worse than progeny, and that should be enough. awful writing, horrible plot. poor raoul!!

I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the plot! :) I was gripped from the moment I opened the first page, and I couldn't put the book down.

It's about time someone took the original Phantom tale and did something completely different with it. How boring it is to read the same old stuff all the time! Meadows's tale brings the POTO legend into modern-day and incorporates reincarnation and supernatural events, very effectively combining aspects of gothic fiction with our favorite characters. Now, for all of you who are whining this tale paints Erik as evil--wouldn't you feel pretty darn evil if you had been watching Christine all those years, but were unable to interact with her physically? Get over it, people--open your minds and enjoy this journey into the supernatural! :) If you just saw the POTO movie, this book will lead you into new adventures with your now-favorite characters! :)"},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"I had the fortunate chance to read this book before blindly purchasing it for the simple sake of having what might possibly be a gem in phantom fiction. Thank goodness I was spare the waste of money I would have spent on it. This story spirals into a chaotic mishmash of fantastical and unbelievable tale that left me annoyed that I had wasted my time reading it.This sequel novel half-heartedly picks up where Becky L. Meadow's last book, \\"Progeny\\" left off. \\"Progeny\\" left the reader hanging, wondering what would happen to the characters, and this novel does not even begin to answer half the questions we were left with from the last book. Rather than picking up where we were left at the end of the last book, we are transported forward through time to a place where some of our previously favorite characters have become mere shadows of themselves.Rather than being an entertaining novel, I found that this work was little more than the author's attempt to live out a dream that isn't possible; our dear Phantom is not likely to come looking for his beloved Christine reincarnated in the body of a phantom phan, but this book would have you believe otherwise.The characters are poor imitations of how Meadows portrayed them in her first novel - rather than being interesting and having an added depth to them in their newly reincarnated state, they seem to have become dull-witted and inclined to argue tirelessly.All in all, not worth the time to read, nor the money to purchase, unless you simply want to own it for the novelty."},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"OK I loved her first book but this doesn't even resembel the Phantom to me.I'm not even half way done but I am all ready disapointed.Cathrine acts imature and Charles is a whiney bastard who says *Christ* too many damn times.Erik doesnt even remotly resembel himself.I wonder why she took extra care in changing Christine's and Raoul's name and not Erik's!*Big let down for a sequel.Stick with the first one.*"},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"I disliked this book intensely. I loathed the plot, the characters, especially Erik, and believe me, it pains me to say that. This book achieves what even Gaston Leroux's book could not; to portray Erik as a truly evil, self-serving monster. There is a scene toward the end of the book that is so unnecessary and offensive I had to put the book down and later force myself to finish it only because I paid for it with my hard earned money! Read the first book in this series; Progeny, but don't bother with this one. Definately two thumbs down!"},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"...If I had to meet Mrs. Beacky Meadows, let's just say it would NOT be the prettiest meeting in the world. After beeing a Phantom of the Opera fan for a VERY long time, I will now give my thoughts about this book.1.) It's simple fan-fiction, only the author decided to be all \\"cool\\" and get it posted on a site where it allows you to post fan-fiction if you have the money.2.) The grammar is dreadful! Honestly, I stumble across words I hardly know ever existed or \\"words that she invented\\".Now, I am currently reviewing this book (I have no idea why), and I have to say I have almost reached the end and I am ready to demand for the countless I.Q points I have lost due to this book.Catherine is the most STUPIDEST Christine EVER--in any fan fic, which this is. I don't care if she was Christine in a past life, she is still stupid. She whines, complains, she has sex, she wastes her money on Phantom of the Opera tickets, she is egotistical, she is everything BESIDES a Christine. I have no idea in BM's universe why Erik would love her.And even if Ryan IS Raoul, why would he become so out of character context (hitting his wife at one point, coddling her next)? He seems to be half the time to be the only sane person in this novel. But then again, he is Raoul, and in BM's mind, Raoul is an evil bastard. So she had to do something to his morality.Erik... now he is a ghost in this book. Anytime that he and Christine meet, there is always the one page description (which is TOTALLY un-needed) of what he is doing, what he is wearing, and how much Catherine likes him. Each time they meet, there cannot be a scene without him saying \\"my dear\\" over 12 times, or \\"child\\" over 20 times. Its as if BM based this solely on Webber's version (and I am sure she did) and to have Erik impersonate Michael Crawford and butcher anything he ever stood for... in her case, she thinks that she is making some odd homage to him.This is not funny, I want to ask if she was drunk when writing this. I swear, half the book is smut and the other half is just her on \\"Phantom crack\\". There are times in this book where I'd be like \\"what?\\" and times when I'd be like \\"who?\\" There is so much Kay refrence in here that I just want to throw this book in the garabage. (I acknowledge Kay, but I don't like her \\"Phantom\\" book.)When asked in an interview and in the \\"Dedicated to\\" part, she writes that \\"Erik helped me\\", or \\"This is dedicated to Erik\\". If that does not lead you into how stupid this book is, and you are still going to buy it--Phantom Fan or not--you are so sad.Save your soul and perhaps your sanity by NOT reading this book.

I am a HUGE Phantom of the Opera phan! Alright, I adored her first book, Progeny, but this one didn't quite match up to it. Charles (AKA Raoul) whined way too much and curses wayyyyy too much!! They say &quot;Christ!&quot; and &quot;God!&quot; so many times its annoying, however besides that, it was quite enjoyable to read... She didn't do Erik very much justice, however.

Worth every dime."},{"Title":"Phantasy","review":"\\"Phantasy\\" by Becky L. Meadows is a very clever story which is set in modern times. As the title suggests, it is a fantasy based on the Phantom of the Opera, and although it is the author's second \\"Phantom\\" book, it is not a direct continuation of the story told in her first book, \\"Progeny.\\"The main premise of \\"Phantasy\\" is that the events that took place in the Paris Opera House really happened, and that Erik, Christine, Raoul and the other characters in the famous story of the Phantom of the Opera really lived. Christine and Raoul have been reincarnated and are husband and wife again, this time their names are Catherine and Charles. Their lives are changed forever when Catherine becomes obsessed with Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\"Although I enjoyed Ms. Meadows' \\"Progeny,\\" I liked \\"Phantasy\\" even more. It was a very refreshing, original tale of soul mates, reincarnation and the possibility that the Phantom legend is based on fact. After all, Leroux said it himself in the opening line of the introduction of his famous novel, \\"The opera ghost really existed.\\""},{"Title":"Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (Studies of Religion in Africa)","review":"Peter McKenzie has sifted through the field notes, diaries, and other archival materials of tourists, adventurers, missionaries, military officials, and others to paint a picture of Orisha worship as it was practiced in Yoruba speaking territories in the mid-nineteenth century. It is very interesting that by comparison it seems that the rituals of veneration of the Orishas on THIS side of the Atlantic in modern times bear more in common with the Orisha worship of the past than the practices in modern day Nigeria. It is as if a snapshot of Orisha worship was taken by the people who would be torn from their homes and enslaved in the \\"new world\\" and that it has remained faithful to their socio-religious heritage and, in contrast, the forces of missionary Christianity and Islamic proselytization in Nigeria have birthed a very different form of veneration in the cradle of its own origin."},{"Title":"Hania","review":"Sienkiewicz ranks high as a story teller, historial and authentic period writer.

Mr. Byrnes gives the reader a unique &quot;inside-the-Black-World-programs&quot; perspective, while giving absolutely amazing explanations on some of the most outstanding engineering feats achieved by those involved with the Blackbird family - the author somehow manages to make complex systems such as the side-looking radar, the optical correlator, the astro-inertial navigation system and so on easy (if I can put it that way...) to understand.

And it's short, ending just under two hundred pages, especially when most books could use a good pruning of fifty to hundred pages.I pay by the \`good read', not by the pound, and Leonard Wibberly, author of \\"The Mouse that Roared,\\" which was turned into an outstanding comic film starring Peter Sellers, could make a reader laugh.\\"Feast\\" is a sweet little satire which ultimately pits the United States against Omo Levi, a little island nation (consisting of two islands) recently released by the British at US urging during a secret meeting, so that the island nation's new found freedom came be used as a bargaining chip in a Cold War gambit against the USSR.One: The people of Omo Levi liked being a colony, being on their own brings about a major reality check. Two: To solved the problem the island people petition the US to become a US colony and failing that--a state.You see all the wonderful problems here? The read is fast and a good number of chuckles are provided. The writing is streamlined, with no extraneous anything. Yes, the book is dated--the USSR isn't around anymore, for one.Also for entertainment purposes and general consumption, some cannibalism is thrown in, along with some primitive religion. You're just going to love this."},{"Title":"A Feast of Freedom","review":"I read this book when it first appeared and enjoyed it at that time.

Then, I bought the audio version so that I could finish it in the car. The two don't even compare! This book is so abridged, it ends up sounding like, \\"Then she met so and so, then they went here, then they got married, etc.\\" I mean, all of the beauty of the descriptions and character development and nuances are gone.

So if you totally disagree with my point of view, then you can conclude I just don't get it. Fair enough, because I just don't get it.I'd heard so much buzz about this collection that I picked up a copy and gave it a couple reads. It's short enough to read several times. The collection includes three sections, each section has four stories. Each story averages seven smallish pages. So the stories are definitely minimal. I would consider roughly 10 of the 12 to be sketches or vignettes rather than short short-stories. There is no plot, no sense of place, no characterization, and no character development in most of the pieces.Eleven of the stories focus primarily or exclusively on female characters, one of the stories has a significant but unexceptional and largely uninteresting male character. The typical character is female, twenty-seven, works as a writer, has been through one or more bad relationships, and is in another bad relationship and feeling bad about it. However many of the characters are just \\"the woman\\" with no other substantial details given.The central premise of most of the stories is that men (unemotional, detached, and always looking for the next sex partner) benefit greatly from numerous sexual relationships; women (emotional, inescapably drawn to obviously emotionally distant men, and always trying to build a permanent relationship) suffer from the same relationships. If that meshes with your world view then you'll probably like this collection. Otherwise, the writing will engage you with its technical proficiency, the linguistic construction will astound you with its beautiful crafting, some of the passages will nail you between the eyes, some of the ideas will interest you, but the entire collection will leave you looking for a more engaging read.I might note the title is pretty fierce compared to the contents. There's no big sex scene or anything like that. In fact, there's not much discussion of actual lust."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"i first read the title story in this collection during high school. it was included in some kind of short fiction anthology used for an english class, but this particular selection was not assigned by our teacher. regardless, and intrigued by the title, i delved in one night. i have never made a better literary decision. the author's phrasing is sparse and careful, and it stays with you. i could not shake my mental images of the story after walking away from the book, and certain elements resonated even though i had not yet gained enough life experience to fully understand them. such is the power of susan minot's pen.i purchased the entire collection at city lights bookstore in san francisco some months later, and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the selections. &quot;lust&quot; is definitely the cornerstone, written in a more illustrative and almost instructive manner than the other pieces, but there is grace and gravity to each tale. &quot;sparks&quot; and &quot;blow&quot; are continual favorites, not only of mine, but of all my friends who have read the book. many times, i have reread a story and gained an entirely different perspective on its meaning. there is enough space left in the writing to allow the reader to superimpose him/herself in the situation (often featuring much less action than dialogue), and of course that reader's perspective will change over time. the beauty of &quot;lust &amp; other stories&quot; is that it travels well. the stories stay with you. it is a unique piece, perhaps impossible to top, and the author seems to understand this, having returned to writing novels since the release of this collection.i also find the cover art on my copy to be very unique and interesting. it features a slightly dated, 80s style photograph of a woman standing with her back to the viewer, arms crossed, looking down and slightly away. in other words: rough road ahead.there simply are not enough words to express the indelible imprint that ms. minot's work has left on my psyche. short stories are like tattoos. and susan minot's work is subtle, intense, artful ink."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"When I usually purchase collections of short stories, its with the intention that the book will be a series of easy reading to spread out over a long period of time. However, the first time I opened Lust, I was hooked. The first story was so real, I felt like I was telling it myself of listening to a good friend. It articulates the young 20's culture of today perfectly--why we use sex, drugs, alcohol, friends, family in the way that only this generation does. I've loaned this book to every one of my friends, and strongly encourage every young woman to read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"After reading this (and this feeling followed suit after reading each of her books) I wanted to simultaneously call the author every female-related curse word I could muster and crawl into her lap and just bawl. What I actually did was throw the book at the wall.This is a collection of short stories / snippets that as one reviewer (professional, I believe) put it, &quot;small moments that yield larger truths&quot;. Each piece will stir something within you, whether you've been there or not. Its so blatantly human and yet its difficult to believe that someone else can feel something only you thought yourself capable of. Emotion runs high. Understatement of the year.She's so poetic yet so devastatingly honest you can't help but love it. I mean, who wants to be depressed? Yes. Its THAT good.If you purchase this book and fall head over heels in love with it, read all of her other books. You will not be disappointed. What will disappoint you is that she cannot seem to crank out these little gems fast enough.Also, as a bit of trivia and perhaps interesting tidbit, she wrote the screenplay for the film Stealing Beauty. I loved the film because you may have a wonderful imagination but its amazing to see a film that so captures all the emotion with which she writes."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"This is a book I always recommend to girlfriends. I have given my personal copy away to a friend, as well. Susan Minot is a beautiful writer, and Lust, the title story of this book is one of my favorites of all time. Every woman who has ever loved, lost, or been hurt will find resonance in this story.If you like Lust, definitely read Monkeys, and check out other amazing female writers, such as Lorrie Moore. Her short stories are masterful. Also, Raymond Carver is sort of the male parallel to Minot or Moore.

I highly recommend it to everyone and especially to women!"},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"I have wanted to read a Susan Minot book after reading Rapture. Lust and Other Stories is one of the most beautiful short-story collections I have read. The theme is centered on women and their bad choices with men. The stories are to the point and hit close to home in more than one occasion. I was enthralled by Ms. Minot's precise characterization and dark, compelling language. My favorite stories are \\"Sparks,\\" \\"The Knot,\\" \\"The Swan in the Garden,\\" \\"The Man Who Would Not Go Away,\\" and \\"The Breakup.\\" These stories have beautiful prose that borderline at being poetic at times. And, as said earlier, a lot of the subjects here hit very close to home. Don't let the title of the book mislead you, for you'll get more than you'd bargained for with this collection. I cannot recommend Lust and Other Stories enough."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"When this book first came out, I picked it up out of curiosity and to this day, it is still one of my favorite reads. With haunting poetry and beautiful prose, the verses whisper of things left unsaid and desires fulfilled.

However, I think that beautiful style that works so well in novels actually works against her in the short story setting. Because there is so little time in a short story to set up a character's life and the world in which they live, and therefore so little time for the reader to get to know these women, Minot's protagonists come off distant and cold more often than I think she intends them to. This is a worthwhile buy for a true Minot fan, but more casual readers would do better to purchase her outstanding novel, Evening."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"wonderful book...edgy, tense stories that explore lives where people are not necessarily comfortable in their own skins. of all the short stories in this book, the title story &quot;lust&quot; has stuck with me the most. the perfect book for delving into on a gloomy day..."},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","review":"This collection of short stories is so brilliant, so completely enthralling, I didn't want to put this down.

I have never read or seen anything as sexually charged as this. Whatever happened to purity?"},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"I had read this book years ago, and although the material is presented in an entertaining and interesting way, I had trouble understanding how Einstein came to his conclusions. Having now read it again, I was able to follow his thinking, but still cannot grasp his theory as it pertains to time. However, I can certainly recommend this book for anyone who wants to approach his work in a very humorous way. I wish schools would have had this for a textbook, rather than the dry and boring material they tend to favor. I actually bought this book to give away, and since I knew what it was, since I already had a copy that I recently found, it would be ridiculous for me to not recommend it.It is certainly unique in dealing with a very heavy subject in a very light hearted manner. For young people and those who might be intimidated by ole Albert, here is an approach that makes it fun."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"Don't get fooled by the cartoons, this book is the best explanation of the Einstein's Relativity Theory I ever read.

If you like the subject and want an easy way to understand how this stuff works, then buy this book. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. If I meet you in the future, please don't try to talk to me about einsteinian physics if you haven't read this book....it's annoying. cheers."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"There is no question that the Einstein theories of relativity are difficult concepts to grasp. They are so counterintuitive to what we experience at the speeds with which we travel that at the beginning they seem impossible to comprehend. Yet, much of the structure of the theories is comprehensible to a non-physicist, as long as it is presented in the right way. That is what is done in this book.The authors use cartoons, captions and the occasional and necessary mathematical formulas to create an understandable and complete overview of Einstein's theories of relativity. While the title includes the word \\"beginners\\", some fundamental knowledge of mathematics, specifically algebra, is needed. If you can overcome this hurdle, then you will find it very helpful if you have an interest in or need to know the basics of relativity."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"This is an OK outline of the special theory described within its historical (physics) context. As expected with the &quot;...For Beginners&quot; series, diagrams are used well. The general theory is not covered. Note: Dollops of the authors' crackpot Marxism are found throughout."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"This is more of a cartoon than a book. It tries to cover so many topics and fails to help you understand any of them. So many cartoons and wierd illustrations are present. If you want to learn about Einstein, or his theories, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"Hey! Guess what? Albert had a life. A pretty goofy one at that. And still he manages to come out on the top of so many lists they saved his brain for study! I'm glad I found this reprinted - I have bought and loaned so many copies of this I was sure I'd never see it again. Yes, it's a cartoon book. That's probably its best feature. There are plenty of books that can take you through Einstein's work, equation by equation, scholarly treatments, rigorous in their dicussion of the minute details of unseen physics. This is not one of them, thank heaven. But if you want to know WHO Einstein was, you want to see him as a child and what incident started him on a world-changing life of inquiry, want to know who helped him and why, who threw obstacles in his path and why, whom he loved, and what place he takes in the rivers of history, this is the book. As a scientist, I know where to go to look up and learn the math of Einstein's work. I can read his original papers, I can review the problems he solved. But that's not who he was, it's not enough info to solve Albert himself. All the equations in the world won't tell you why he married his cousin. And if this book is broad enough to cure most folks of two myths: (a) he invented the atom bomb (FALSE) and (b) he got the Nobel Prize for Relativity (FALSE) then it's worth the eight bucks. Read it anyway, but especially if you think you know how science evolved in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"Einstein for Beginners acts more as a visual representation of Einsteins work. An easy to read format for anyone interested in knowing Einsteins theories without the mind-boggling formulas. I would suggest this as a place to begin. A nice read, although the theories one still needs to comprehend. The author, Joseph Schwartz puts it in a perspective that both challenges and educates. Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"Goes through Einstein's though processes, the math (algebraically) and having to cope with the dizzying concept of trying to cope with 2 frames of reference at once. Does so in a lighthearted manner. Makes relativity approachable and maybe even comprehensible."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"Einstein for beginners (aka Introducing Einstein), is a brief history of the early life of Albert Einstein incorporated into a history of electrodynamics but is focused on Einstein's discovery of special relativity (SR) which is explained with a thoroughly detailed mathematical walkthrough in this book.Introducing Einstein is not a complete biography of the life and times of Albert Einstein. If you want a complete biography of Einstein, go elsewhere. If you want a graphical explanation of Einstein's special relativity or a brief history of electrodynamics then this book does just that. Introducing Einstein does not cover general relativity.In terms of actually being able to sit down and go through the calculations, Introducing Einstein will help anyone get through the stages of each proof for special relativity. After 100 pages of the history of electrodynamics the reader gets 70 pages of SR. This means that unless you are willing to sit down and actually work through 70 pages of mathematics (really the pages are filled with illustrations and commentary so we can condense it down to about 10-20 pages of solid mathematics) you are only going to get the benefit of 100 pages of the history of electrodynamics and a short burst on the history of mathematics. These 100 pages are actually quite good and fit in well with other science books from the Introduction series, such as Introducing Newton and classical physics, Introducing Quantum Physics but especially Introducing Relativity. Introducing Relativity explains special relativity and general relativity but not in the detail that Introducing Einstein does for SR. There does not appear to be any Introducing book that covers the mathematics of general relativity like Introducing Einstein covers SR. If you are in for this book then you are in for Introducing Relativity, but that is how the Introducing series works.Einstein became a household name with his formula E=MC2 meaning energy is mass. As a consequence he established that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light because the energy required to accelerate mass to this speed would be infinite because acceleration also produces an increase in mass.Einstein understood Newton. Newton showed with his laws of motion how matter moves with and without force and established gravitational effects while Maxwell unified magnetism and electricity by showing that shifts in either electricity or magnetism produces a shift in the other. Newton however also implied that there was no absolute standard of rest because everything is moving. There was no such thing as absolute position or space in his mind. Newton did not believe that time was part of space but separate and could be measured with a good enough clock.Reality without time is actually like saying that everything is flat and we now know this is an error. This flatness can be imagined by saying that when all questions about matter (sun, moon, planets and forces) was connected through Newton's mechanics of explaining nature it was explained \`linked' in a flat sort of way.Einstein discovered because of the properties of observing light that these \`links' have an underlying nature that would change the Newtonian model with his SR.In SR Einstein showed time dilation at near light speeds. A simple theoretical model for this is a train with a light that goes off inside the train cart that strikes the front and back door at the same time. An observer standing in the cart will see both doors open at the same time. An observer watching the train go by will see the last door going past open before first door going past. This proves time dilatation.Newton's flat model was not in agreement with SR. Time could change relative to the observer. Only the speed of light remained constant and the law that it could not be broken.Ultimately Einstein for beginners aka Introducing Einstein, is a prelude to buying a complete biography of Einstein and is a partial guide to Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Albert Einstein. If you collect the books mentioned in this review then you are well on your way to thinking and working out something very important about how the universe works in the same way Albert Einstein did.(Note: This book does contain proactive references to Socialism by Einstein himself.)"},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"This book is a very engaging tool for acquainting young people with Einstein and his work.

However, some of the more silly and irrelevant cartoons might distract the reader.All in all, not a bad introduction to A.E. (In fact a damn good place to start discovering relativity). My grouse is that it does not cover all of A.E.'s works. The treatment of relativity touches the tip of the ice-berg only, so to speak.Still, it really makes you want to read more about A.E.'s works, at least for this reader."},{"Title":"Einstein for Beginners","review":"This lively, historically accurate cartoon version of Einstein's life is a solid summary of his life, work and the ideas that helped make him famous. It is more than enough for a layman, and a handy historical reference for anyone who admires the man and his works. The main themes of his life are well known. However the book adds the kind of detail that gives color and context to his legend.He was born in Ulm Germany in 1879, the same year that Wilhelm Marr had coined the word \\"anti-Semitism.\\" Germany at the time was coming out of a financial crisis similar to the one we are in now. Jews were described as \\"white Negroes\\" (but without the same robust physical attributes). As usual in that era, Jews were blamed for the crisis and virtually run out of Europe, beginning one of the first migration of Jews to the U.S.Einstein's father, Hermann, lost his shirt in the depression of the 1870s and the family moved on to Munich where he went into the electrical business with his brother. The electrical business was the rage at the time and was dominated by monopolies like Seimens.Little Albert was a slow and dreamy kid who did not learn to express himself verbally until almost nine. He attended a Catholic school, and as the only Jew, hated it. Urged to be inquisitive by a compass he had received as a gift from his father, and books from an uncle and a family friend, he picked up both Algebra and Geometry on his own. Once he began reading, in addition to being drawn to science, Einstein also quickly learned to detest both religion and the militarized nature of the German state. From that point on, he remained suspicious of all authority and at the earliest opportunity renounced his German citizenship.While in High School, his father's second of many businesses failed and the family moved to Milan, leaving Albert to complete his schooling in Germany. He fashioned an excuse and bolted to Italy without a diploma to be with his family. Without a diploma he nevertheless took the exam to enter Germany's most elite technical school, the ETH, and failed all subjects except math. But because of his high math scores he was allowed to enter a lesser prep school and a year later came back, passed the test to enter the ETH.The ETH in Zurich was the \\"big times,\\" the best education a Scientist could get in Europe and Einstein made the best of it both socially and academically. His real love was electromagnetism -- especially as James Clerk Maxwell had formulated it as an \\"electric force field.\\" Maxwell's role in shaping Einstein's thinking and theories in my view cannot be overestimated and has been much underrated. The notion that light was an electromagnetic field was taken as a given in Einstein's mathematical worldview -- but initially only on the condition that it also was supported by the ether. Once it was determined by precise measurements of the speed of light that the ether did not exist, the door was opened for Einstein to re-examine what it meant to travel at the speed of light. Einstein's own thought experiments convinced him that the speed of light was a limiting constant in the universe therefore making the ether unnecessary, it also made it necessary to rethink what time and space actually meant.In a world where there was no such thing as absolute motion, it was clear to Einstein that the other parameters of motion -space and time -- had to be re-conceptualized in order to avoid a contradiction and to make things come out right. This led to the formulation of a new concept Einstein coined \\"space-time\\" -- as a kind of joint dimension.When these ideas were coupled with the views of Ernest Mach and the equations of Konrad Lorentz, which demonstrated how the coordinates of motion could be transposed from one frame of reference to another, a clear conceptual path to the special theory of relativity was all but a foregone conclusion. Taking the relativity of motion as a starting point, and the speed of light as a universal constant, Special Relativity resolved all the contradictions, opening up a whole new world of non-Newtonian Physics.Although the book's transition from the Special to the General Theory of Relativity does not quite get off the ground, the discussion of Special Relativity is a very useful introductory tutorial to Einstein's main theory. Three Stars."},{"Title":"Yussuf the ostrich","review":"Unlike the pabulum that our children are fed in today's books, YUSSUF THE OSTRICH presents the real world and the stark details of the United States at war through the eyes of a child's pet bird. Americans are shown as kind heros, while the Nazis are portrayed as the villains they were! Children living in 1943 naturally heard about the great war, but this book most certainly brought the North African Campaign to life in a way they could understand. We see all sides of Arab Culture with children both good and bad behaving the same as their US counterparts. A great read for all ages, especially for those of us who lived in the shadow of this war. Beautiful b&w and full color illustrations by the author keeps the action alive. Some of today's books try to convey a message, however you won't find a modern book of this quality and insight on any shelf today!"},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"This is a really interesting book indeed that points out that there is a male hegemony that dictates how female bodybuilders develop and present themselves. Its a constant struggle for bodybuilders because they never know whether they need to develop more muscle or go for a softer more feminine look and are in a state of constant confusion and frustration. These women who represent power are really quite powerless in their sport the author asserts. Its a very interesting read but I deducted one star because the author has a terrible habit of having passages of some great quotes from bodybuilders and the contest judges and then she proceeds to simply repeat what was just in the quote. Its like reading the same thing twice. It is annoying indeed. Still I do recommend this book for female bodybuilding fans."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it provided some fascinating perspectives on women in bodybuilding. This narrative research report examines the motivations, relationships and formative experiences of female bodybuilders. The insights lifted the two dimensional physique pictures of athletes to a deep,rich and empathic portrayal of women in a largely frustrating sport.It's hard to believe that women who are so strong are dominated by shallow definitions of 'femininity' and by the unimaginative, sexist male gatekeepers of the industry. The research is a little dated (1992), and the small sample size of female bodybuilders did not provide sufficient diversity to broaden application of findings. I was left hoping that follow-up research would be conducted on these athletes, to examine their departure from the sport and the effects of their bodybuilding history on their current life."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"Let me save you the money and trouble of ordering this book. I will state the essential arguments put forth in this small-type tome, minus the repetition that causes these few sentences to swell to fill 150 pages: 1) Joe and Ben Weider own the sport of bodybuilding, exercising a \\"hegemonic\\" and monopolistic control unparalleled in any other pro sport. 2) Whether because of old-world thinking or economic reality, they decree what kind of female physique will win the top awards, favoring symmetry over muscularity and insisting on a show of femininity in the forms of heavy makeup and breast implants. 3) As long as the Weiders hold the purse strings, women bodybuilders who want to earn a living from the sport will have to limit their muscularity if they expect to succeed. There, I think that about sums it up. I have also included the author's favorite word, \\"hegemonic\\", which appears in this book more times than I have ever heard the word used previously in my life. Finally, there are some nice photos of women bodybuilders, who manage to look both sexy and sinewy, but you can find these online elsewhere free."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"This is a very informative book on women in the realm of body building, but the writing is really poor to horrible.

It served to clearly instruct in the way of salvation by having the Good News in contemporary plain Arabic. Language was and is the main draw back to the Van Dyke translatiom, that served weii for 150 years.The other alternative is the Living bible which is a paraphrasing, while the Catholic translation by Jesuits is good but reltively expensive, which render it out of the reach of the population.To complement the excellent review by Didakialex, I would like to emphasize that the present translation took into account the power of habit of hearing certain expressions. I recommend to compare and check against this transltion whatever translation you use,in Arabic or English."},{"Title":"Arabic-Middle East, Egypt Bible","review":"The Arabic TranslationThis is the first ecumenical translation ever in Arabic and one of the fruits of the blessed labors of the Bible society which coordinated Catholic scholarship (mainly society of Jesus), hand in hand with the continuos efforts of the evangelical missions since Dr. Van Dyke of blessed memory, started his first Arabic translation with Lebanese support more than 150 years ago.How unique is this edition? Very unique indeed.Here comes the genius of the Orthodox Church tradition: the Controlling authority of the Septuagint and the wider canon of the Alexandrine fathers, as stipulated by Papa Athanasius in his Pascal letter 357, still applicable in the Roman Church, even if the sequence of the Catholic epistles followed by the Pauline was reversed long ago by Amphilochius of Iconium.Translation principles and rules:Starting with the best available Hebrew text (Stuttgart: 1968-76),with reference to Aramaic (Syriac) whenever needed. As for the New Testament translation (4th edn.,1994) Koine (Old Greek) the used text was UBS 3, and Nestle Alland no 26. The goal was ultimately rendering in Middle Eastern Arabic speakers a simple modern Arabic language understood by a wide spectrum readership. The word to word translation was avoided in favor of the dynamic equivalent given that translation from Hebrew to Arabic is more expressive due their Semitic brotherhood.So beautiful is the statement of faith \\"Throughout history, Bible scholars labored with great erudite and hard work to recover and preserve the original text unblemished\\" Starting with the ancient clerical traditions the Jews learned in Ancient Egypt illustrated by the ten commandments inscription on stone to the great Alexandrine tradition of the Scriptorium that produced all the great Uncial codices: Alexandrinus, Aphraemi, Sinaticus, and Vaticanus.Two Variant Editions:The Bible society has chosen to produce two editions, the full Alexandrine Canon used by the majority Orthodox of the Orient from Antioch to Alexandria,and a minority Roman Unite Churches.A shorter 'mutilated' edition ( in the words of F. Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury), without O.T. Apocrypha, for the scattered born again brothers. The color code is Brown for the full canon and blue for the shorter, shown by Amazon.com.Study bible:Sure, and a good one, which avoids dictating dogmatic influenced interpretations, due to the blessings of ecumenical fellowship.How? Simply by supporting this annotated Bible with commonly agreed footnotes, and scholarly proven facts, explanations and comments. Four colored maps and two indicative sketches, are helpful tools for novice students, together with general introduction and brief introductions for each book."},{"Title":"Ludwig Van Beethoven (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers)","review":"Mike Venezia's Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers series tends to focus on biographies rather than music appreciation because unlike his companion series on the World's Greatest Artists you cannot include a sonata the way you can a reproduction of a painting. However, for Ludwig Van Beethoven the author/illustrator makes an exception. This volume begins with an appreciation for how Beethoven changed the sound of music (no more party music). Within that context Venezia provides the expected biography, complete with historic ethics and paintings as well as those funny cartoons; just think Beethoven as the Liberace (if you are over 50) or Elton John (if you are under 50) of his day. There is also a photograph of his eyeglasses and metal ear trumpets. However, Venezia only mentions a handful of specific works by Beethoven, touching on how the 3rd symphony represented Napoleon, the four-note theme of the 5th Symphony, and going into some depth on the 6th Pastoral Symphony (but no mention of the glorious 9th Symphony or his other masterworks). Still, I appreciate the attempt to get more into Beethoven's music than he has done in other volumes of this series, which covers not only the great classic composers like Handel and Mozart, but also contemporary composers from Aaron Copland and George Gerswhin to Duke Ellington and the Beatles. As always, the recommendation is for young readers to have listened to some of Beethoven's masterpieces before, during and after reading this engaging juvenile biography and mini-music appreciation lesson."},{"Title":"Ludwig Van Beethoven (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers)","review":"fun and clear way to learn about composers. check out his other books. they are on a second grade level, fun caricature cartoons combined with real pictures and sometimes pictures of artifacts as well."},{"Title":"Ludwig Van Beethoven (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers)","review":"I have gotten really positive results from my students with this book.

I think I found my copy in a remainder pile. It's just over 200 pages and I found it fun to read.It won't tell you about how to make a web page; instead, it speaks about what NOT to put on a web page.Web pages they frustrate me. My bank should hire Steve Krug. So should the government and all those businesses who want our money and pretend to service us with their web pages without really giving us any service at all. Often you'd think they are spy agencies who do not want you to know their phone numbers and addresses.\\"Don't Make Me Think\\" in a nutshell says do not put so many words on a web page that I can not find what I'm after. It really means that if you design your web pages well enough I'll have more time to think about whatever it is that I came to your web page to discover. Instead, badly designed web pages frustrate me so much that even if I find what I was looking for, by the time I find it, I sometimes forget why I wanted it in the first place or I'm so put off that I don't care anymore.People like you and I should read Steve Krug's book and then demand simple, thoughtful, easy to use web pages from our banks, governments, et cetera. Google won the search engine war, or at least my vote, because Google lets me find stuff I want without frustrating me.You can read a chapter for free at his web site sensible.com. It's worth you time.If I were to start a new career as a web designer, I'd probably reread \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" before and after every web site I'd design. Steve Krug says if you can't afford a person like him to help you, at least get people like you grandmother to try to use your web site; if they can't use it, then people like you and I won't want to use it either."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Steve Krug's \\"Don't Make Me Think! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" focuses on the steps necessary to ensure that your Web site is user-friendly. Steve Krug firmly believes that if something is too hard to use, people just won't use it. The number one priority that Steve believes people should focus on to ensure that their Web site is easy to use is simply \\"Don't make me think!\\" This means that as far as humanly possible when a user looks at a Web page it should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory.Throughout his book, Steve focuses on the importance of understanding Web users and their needs. Krug's \\"Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" is broken up into these 12 topics:1. Krug's First Law of Usability2. Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through3. Designing pages for scanning, not reading4. Why users like mindless choices5. The art of not writing for the Web6. Designing navigation7. Designing the Home page8. Why most Web design teams arguments about usability are a waste of time, and how to avoid them9. Why user testing--done simply enough--is the cure for all your sites ills10. Usability as a common courtesy11. Accessibility, cascading style sheets12. What to do when your boss wants you to do something you consider a bad decision.Understanding Web users, their needs, and the basics of what makes them think will help with the design of any Web site. The most often things that make users think according to Krug are cute or clever names, marketing induced names, company-specific names, and unfamiliar technical names. He also describes links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable as \\"another needless source of question marks over people heads.\\" Understanding the basic principle of what causes confusion for people and how to eliminate that confusion is the most important thing you can do to stop users from having to \\"think\\". The main reason it is so important not to make users think is because \\"most people are going to spend far less time looking at the pages we design than we'd like to think.\\" Therefore, Websites need to be as self-explanatory as possible so they can be effective even at a glace.Krug spends a lot of time explaining how the design layout of the Web site should look to ensure easy usability, the importance of the search bar/box, as well as how the text content should be written in order to be most effective. This book provided a lot of visual examples which helped readers to better understand what the details of the site should look like. Without the visuals, I would have been completely lost. A large portion of the book was also dedicated to Web navigation and designing the Home page. This is simply because the Home page is the first page users see and if people can't find their way around your Web site then they won't use it. I found these chapters to be particularly useful.For those people who are working either alone or on a Web design team to design a Web site for a company or organization, this book offers great information on how to perform usability testing, particularly how to perform usability testing on a budget. It also touches on how to make your team the most productive they can be.\\"Don't Make Me Think!\\" is the second edition to Steve Krug's first book that was published five years ago. Steve was reluctant to write a second edition, he worried that if he added more material the book would no longer \\"practice what it preaches\\". The book itself is a good example of what Web usability means, it's easy to understand and very straight forward. It was designed to be a short two hour \\"airplane\\" read which made it all the more appealing. As someone who hasn't read the first edition of the book, however, I don't know to what extent they differ but I feel that the additional chapters of the second edition (Usability as a common courtesy, Accessibility, Cascading Style Sheets, and you, and Help! My boss wants me to ______.) were unnecessary and a little off topic. I really enjoyed reading the entire book until chapter 10, the information provided after that was not useful for me personally and but perhaps others will find it valuable and enjoy it.Overall, I would rate the book four out of five stars. I found it to be very interesting and an enjoyable read. The fact that it is so short, simple, and to the point made me feel as though Steve Krug was indeed \\"practicing what he preached.\\" He talked a lot about making the Web users feel like you do understand and respect that their time is precious and that's how I felt when reading this book. I also found myself laughing out loud a few times which always helps to make a book more pleasing. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is designing a Web site. The little time that it will take you to read this book is nothing compared to the money that you will save by creating a functional and user-friendly Web site."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a great book - clearly written, easy reading, good examples, good references to other books/websites/sources.

I tend to think in terms of visual appeal instead of funneling visitors towards a conversion.

I think about things like \\"I shouldn't just name that button Salons, because we can't have people even second think what it could mean for a split second\\", and therefore choose to name it something self-explanatory like 'Find a salon' etc.Couldn't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is the best book on how a website should look that I've ever seen.

Conciseness is a main theme of the book. It gets right to the point without forcing the reader to read anything unnecessary. He has very valid points about web page design and format. Not only are they valid but they should be the rules for any web designer. If you are a web designer, this book is a must.

I decided that it had to be a permanent part of my collection because it is just so well-written and concise in its message. The title doesn't lie- it definitely is a \\"common sense\\" approach, but after surfing the internet for so many years, banging my head against the wall, and pulling my hair out, it's obvious that \\"common sense\\" isn't so common on the web.Just a fair warning: if you're looking for something to open your eyes and tell you about things you've never noticed, you might be disappointed in this book.

He made it clear from the title of a book that essays on the importance of offering a web user with the opportunity of easy navigation. And he shows us the way to negate every chance where subjugating a visitor to ponder on the points of \`what' and \`how' is no less than a crime in the world of web.We at Synapse Communications know how plentifully the book has helped us in the times of need. If today we are amongst one of the leading Indian companies in the arena of we development, books like this, wonderfully serve as the guiding force ahead of each of our steps towards delivering efficient web development solution to our clients world-wide.I am thankful to Mr. Shamit Khemka, the CEO of Synapse Communications, for introducing me to a book that is so excellently simple and yet explicit in elaborating the subject of web usability.Be it Synapse Interactive or Synapse India - the two sister concerns of Synapse Communication; for all the individuals associated with the company, \`Don't Make Me Think' helps us to think right and put all the essentials into practice."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Simply put, this book is as entertaining as it is easy to read.

It's not an in-depth treatment, as he readily admits, and he does direct the reader to other resources for greater detail. But what he does provide is golden. There's not a wasted page.

I can vouch that the advice he gives about usability testing makes perfect sense. That's only a part of this book though, and not the best one at that.The meat of this book is the approach to usability that makes it less of a \\"personal opinion of the highest ranking stakeholders on the project\\" and more of a \\"predictable practice with verifiable results\\" kind of thing. After reading this book you will have a chance not to judge usability by a vote or by a developer who was asked to build a feature.One thing the book doesn't do is make the case that usability is important, with any significant evidence for or against. You'll have to make this choice and find support for following up on this choice by yourself.One last thing: I happen not to like most of the suggestions for additional reading, especially for more recently published books.

You will want to buy a good book on Cascading Style Sheets after reading this book."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is extremely useful for anyone interested in web design and development. Reading this book really explains how people view websites in an easy-to read format. Very insightful and a grerat read. Helpful for marketing your website to advertisers as you will know the optimal positioning for your ads, text, logo, header, and so much more!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"The book provides a clear and simple description of how to design web sites so they will be usable."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I'll bet that every person who builds a web site, personal or commercial, big or small, thinks that, even if it has a few faults, it's pretty good. I'm not certain that people who visit sites have as charitable a view. Steve Krug believes that the visitors' views could be improved with a common sense approach to web usability.The theme is set out in the title. Web users don't want to have to think. In order to incorporate that fact into web sites, Krug sets out some simple concepts for web designers to follow. I hesitate to list these rules because they are so simple that if you read a summary here, and pay attention to them, you almost don't need to buy this book. But Krug's skill is in convincing you that you should take his advice, and suggesting how to implement it. His guidance is simple, including: design pages for scanning, not reading; make sure the user knows where he is on the site through navigation design; and test sites with real users.The author suggests that the book is so short it can be read on a longish airplane ride. But the points he makes are so important that everyone responsible for a web site, whether designer or CEO needs to be reminded of them. I know that I consider myself pretty savvy when it comes to usability, but I came up with several tips for quickly improving my web site as I read the book. (I also saw a few weaknesses in my site that the author identified that weren't so easy to correct quickly, but I'm working on those problems.) Moreover, while I didn't laugh out loud, I found the book so good natured that it was easy to become absorbed.The book has little of a technical nature about browsers or web authoring software, but instead deals with a few broad principles of web usability. That's enough reason to recommend that everyone with a web site of any kind should read this book, especially since it is so easy to go through. I can't guarantee you will find something of use, but I'd love to get your URL if you don't."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I am a web UI developer and I have bought a lot of books already including (theory and implementation books)but no book has been as useful as this book so far."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I can't honestly say that I learned a lot from this book, but I considered it to be a very accessible book, and it explains the topic well, along with sharing some important ideas and some specific recommendations. I'm glad I read it, although it hasn't really altered the way I work very much."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Many of Krug's findings are very true and helpful to analyzing the effectiveness and usefulness of a website! I appreciated the short length of the book, but at times still found myself skimming some parts. Overall a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a very helpful book for web design. A very easy (and short) read also independent of any technology."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I was in the middle of redesigning one of my own web sites, and had a coupon to redeem for Amazon, so I picked up this book. Steve does a great job with this book. Very well written, concise, and to the point. For someone like me, who is an amateur web designer (just doing several sites of my own), this was just what I needed to get me thinking about how usable my site is, and how people really use web sites.There are no specific coding examples, or HTML, or CSS, or anything like that. It's not meant to be a book to teach you how to actually build the web site with HTML or CSS. Instead, it is more of a higher level, overall picture, type of thing. That's just what I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed.It made me go back and rethink how I was laying out some things on my web site, and how I always include WAY too much text. I'll be using a lot of the ideas in this book to eventually go back and rework all of my sites!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"A very accurate and realistic look at the sociology behind user interface development and philosophies on how to deal with it.

It was assigned reading for a Masters program in Instructional Technology in which I'm enrolled. The book stands out like an island of rest in a sea of confusion.You could have written a book with a lot of filler, and gone on and on as if no one was listening. But instead you wrote in a way that makes it seems like your talking directly to me.And in an environment where most everyone else seems to be just throwing up a verbal smoke screen, being addressed personally has been very affirming. The result is that you've encouraged me to be a Mensch in my own work, even when I'm \\"sure\\" there will be no direct payback.When I treat people with respect, I find a new world opens up before me.Drew"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I am a Web/Multimedia designer at a large corporation and happen to be currently in the midst of a major site redesign project with too many cooks in the kitchen. This book not only confirms a lot of what I already know, but gives me some insightful ammo to combat the arbitrary decision making process of others involved in the project, particularly when those decisions might otherwise result in unclear or confusing interface design decisions being made.Sadly, after a couple of lunchtime reading sessions it's almost over. I wish there where more chapters to read, which really isn't much of a complaint at all.Buy this book if you do any type of web design at all. I think many of the principles discussed in the book apply to other tasks/roles such as graphic design and page layout in general as well. Light reading, short chapters, easy to get into, filled with lot's of \\"Aha! I knew my intuition was right about that!\\" and a few \\"Oh, really? Maybe we should try it that way instead\\" moments.

A quick read with good advice and guidance. The author definitely knows his stuff and does a good job of communicating the information in a succint manner. My only minor complaint is that the website samples are very dated and it would be nice to see those updated.

If you are the big fan of Krug, it's ok to buy it. It still be the classic book for web usability. Actually, I will give the rate only 3 stars, but I add 1 more for the effort of Krug who try to add 'something new' on this edition.Well, I shouldn't buy the 2nd edition since it should contains the new thing more than this.
