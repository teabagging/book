I saw some of his movies: The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Sum of All Fears, Clear and Present Danger... I chose The Bear and The Dragon because of the topic. I am a Chinese guy living in Hong Kong. When I saw the book, I wondered what Clancy would write about China, considering he is a rightist.I have just finished about half of the book. The two clergymen were just killed in China and the Ryan administration was dealing with it. That means the whole plot has just picked up. But it has already gone for 400-odd pages. The book is full of unnecessary details about characters' thoughts, backgrounds, etc. The book is also full of minor details about the military. A military fan would like it very much. But I am not a fan of it. So I skipped all those stuff. I usually do not skip pages especially if it's a book that I actually bought, not borrowed from a friend. But this book is really lengthy. We're in an era full of TV programs and movies. I think we no long have a lot of time to do reading. And we've got used to quicker plot development. So pls cut the...unnecessary details.OK, besides that, when the plot picks up, it is quite unputdownable. Hope it is still entertaining.Then, as a Chinese guy, I don't like Clancy's attitude towards the Chinese people. The pages are full of hatred. I understand why some Americans would not like the PRC because the government has really done something bad. But pls stop preaching, OK?Someone says Executive Order is the best. Is it true? Should I give Clancy another chance?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While not engrossing, this book managed to keep my intrest. Its main flaw was its length (unless you're on the NYC to Cape Town flight) and predictability. It starts with the head of the SRV [KGB]nearly getting blown up by an RPG (who done it, the Russian Mafia, the Chinese, or was it just an accident?) and the resulting investigation. At the same time, gold and oil is discovered in Siberia, Russia; whose military is grossly undermanned. Then it focases on a CIA agent seducing a Chinese Politburo secretary (no detail ommited) and then having her put a bug on her computer, which sends notes of every Politburo meeting straight to the CIA. You also get to see how Jack Ryan does as President, feel free to laugh.The novel then launches into the lengthy process needed for China to invade Russia. For this to happen, the following occers:1. CNN twice films the Bejjing police killing diplomats and beating up Christians.2. This offends the world, who prompltly sever trade relations with China-plunging them deep in dept.3. The Chinese Pulitburo (I hope to God that Tom Clancy made everything he wrote about them up)-as opposed simply to apologizing-decides to invade Siberia and take control of the gold and oil.4. All attempts to dissuade the Chinese fail and they invade.As soon as the Chinese cross the border, a remarkable thing happens. The Russians stop acting like undermanned, undertrained, and ill-equipped ... and start acting American. And speaking of Americans, despite the fact that they deployed a tank division and lots of aircraft to Siberia, I didn't count one American causualty in the whole book.Anyway, the Russians let the Chinese advance unnopposed, then a bunch of B-2 bombers cut their supply lines. The Russians then kick their butts, thanks to the Darkstar drone. I'll leave the ending a mystery, but I'll say it includes a nuclear missle overWashington D.C., Jack Ryan becoming John Wayne, and some renegade Chinese college students.So why did I give this book 3 stars? Because its plot was at least possible (as possible as Rainbow Six's anyway), it had some belated action, and it had what I wouldn't mind seeing, Russia kick China's butt."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is my second Tom Clancy novel. I have read the first 700 of the 1000 pages and expect to finish in a day or two.Tom Clancy is full of interesting information on the operation of the NSA, CIA, KGB and the US, Russian and Chinese military. Very interesting. But the book contains too much small talk that does not contribute to character development. For example, you are told about almost every cigarett that the hero, Jack Ryan, lights up. This book would be much better if it was condensed to 500 pages by eliminating the small talk.Also, even though the book was copyright in 2000, key aspects of the plot related to China are already obsolete. China is now a \\"most favored nation\\" for trade purposes. China is also accumulating a huge foreign currency reserve. So, it no longer makes sense for Jack Ryan to deny China \\"most favored nation\\". And it no longer makes sense for China to begin a war because it runs low on foreign currency reserves.But the idea of a large find of gold and oil in northern Siberia is still a little romantic and keeps this novel firmly in the fiction/fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was my first Clancy book and was very easy to put down. Perhaps in a few...weeks, months,Pick up another &quot;heart-stopping action &quot; as quoted from the Washington Post, book of his and read what I've been missing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;Not Clancy's best work,&quot; is a common reaction to this book. The problem with that is it implies that Clancy &quot;worked&quot; and that conclusion is doubtful. Many reviewers have noted that &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is full of repitition, that Clancy repeats himself, says the same thing again and again. Others have noted that Clancy is becoming too &quot;preachy.&quot; All of this is true.So, only read this novel of you are a true Clancy fanatic; otherwise, re-reading &quot;Red October&quot; or &quot;Without Remorse&quot; would be more rewarding."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and The Dragon was high on my Christmas wish list. Had I known that Clancy's ability to write fiction had declined so much, I might not have been so thrilled to receive this gift. In this effort, Clancy has gone overboard in both the amount of technical information included in the plot lines and his racist remarks against Chinese people in general. As one other reader wrote, it is okay to give us a character to hate but not a whole culture. I also found it very annoying that someone who could write so technical a book could not be bothered with making sure that the proofreading had been done correctly. In the copy I own, there are typo's throughout the text and it proves to be a stumbling block to what is already a slow read. I can normally blow through one of Clancy's novels in a couple of days because of the intensity and the on the edge of your seat excitement. This one lacked in both areas and took me an entire week to complete. On a positive note, it is still a Clancy novel and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There is no question Clancy sees himself as a patriotic american. he has proselytised the great american values in all of his works. and I agreed with them in most occassions. I have always thought he makes a legitimate point weather I agreed with him or not. the latter is simply because he uses facts to back up all this points. this book, however, strays from his usual facts based arguments. I find his points on international free trade to be shallow and inaccurate and his knowledge of China next to nothing. I have not finished reading this book and I must say deviations from facts make this a very daunting task. as a result, I must ask, is clancy a has been?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is a victim of his own success. Instead of trying to write a compelling story, he is coasting on his reputation. The Bear and The Dragon is a bore! It is nothing more than a pulpit for Clancy's personal political views. The reader has to wait about 400 pages for the first halfway decent action. Most of the remaining 600+ pages are equally limp. Jack Ryan would be ashamed by this sell out!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have had enormous pleasure reading (and re-reading) the offerings by TC over the last decade. I was hooked with the HFRO movie with Connery &amp; it led me to Red Storm Rising, which was an excellent 2nd offering. Over time I have looked forward to each TC book, the pinacle being Executive Orders. Since Executive Orders, TC seems to be putting out books under some oppresive contractural obligation. B&amp;D is his worst. Little character development, implausible plot, and an ending that has made me wonder whether TC has lost his passion, will now make me think twice before I put out $$$ for his next hard cover. I'll probably buy his next book but only because it woud be difficult to get any worse. I hope TC recognises that what he started all of those years ago with Jack Ryan has resulted in an enormous responsibility to his devoted readers. His only saving grace recently was being sent up on the Simpsons --- but then, an Icon is an Icon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this book was well written, with several interesting parts. Tom Clancy kept me reading this book for several hours at a time. But, his books seem to be getting more and more predictable, almost like he's running out of ideas. It seemed easy for me to guess what the ending would be like by about half way through the novel. I still thought the book was full of action, and recommend it to any one else, but either get it at a library or wait until it's out on paperback. Still, I hope Clancy comes out with a new book soon, his action sequences can't be beat!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read all of Clancy's books and the last few have become slow reading bores. I use to wait with eagerness for his next book. After attempting Bear which I gave up within 250 pages, i'm threw with him. TO LONG, TO BORING! Let him teach @ Annapolis or West Point or Harvard but his fiction is so bad compared to Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger. I just hate his books have developed into a insomniacs cure."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It started off well, but the finish was flat. Clancy concentrated on numerous &quot;dead end&quot; sub-stories that eventually became irrelevant, and cut off other that looked as though they would have been quite substantial and enjoyable for the reader. I would have liked to have spent more time with the Chinese and Russian field commanders, instead of trapsing around Moscow and St. Petersburg. Clancy did an excellent job of describing hyper-war, but would have done better to add a few &quot;survivng witnesses&quot; to the destruction to add some color. This is the first Tom Clancy book that I wouldn't buy again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Has anyone else noticed that Mr. Clancy loses a half a star with each new book? And it seems each book gets many pages longer as well. And how can they not when there are so many references to Golokov holding a gun to Ryan's head and other inane self-promoting marketing jabs for his past books? Honestly, 1000 pages of lukewarm, mundane, blase storylines, Mr. Clancy's own interpretation of historical events, and finally 28 pages of a climax you could have predicted on page 792, but still had to read another 200 pages to get to. It wasn't enough in my eyes."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although not one of Clancy's better novels, this novel was quite entertaining (if only at a shallow level). The plot isn't too stunning; its standard thriller far- Chinese intrigues, missile attacks. Clancy's trademark style is apparent through the book, which is the primary quality distinguishing it from other run-of-the-mill action novels. Another good point about the book is that its a Jack Ryan book, which satisfied me, a long-time Ryan fan.If you liked Clancy you'll probably like the book. But if you're not a fan of shallow action novels don't expect to be enthralled."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wow - another techno thriller that I could not put down. The content and structure, for the most part, was great and sure listed some very likely screnarios with all the techno info that Mr. Clancy is famous for. Unfortunately this will probably be the last Clancy book I read. Similar in nature to Without Remorse, Mr Clancy, with this book, is setting a new tone for this and coming books where gratuitous profanity and sex have a much higher profile than ever before. I wish that Mr Clancy would take a queue from Mr Cussler, who wanted readers of all ages and sensibilities to be able to read his books, and took his books to that level by taking out the gratuitous profanity and sex with great success."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First off, I'm a huge Clancy and Techno thriller fan. However, I found this book long and very un realistic. Do we need to know how much Ryan hates his job over and over? The US would do nothing after a Nuclear missle attack? Probably not. Fang would go talk to the people at the end of the book? Talk about a change of character from the beginning of the book. Was all the &quot;sausage&quot; talk necessary? Run out of bombs? Why were we not using B-1B's? B-2's All of this equipment could strike at China's forces from the beginning? Ever heard of in flight refueling? We do it all the time? Cruise missles? F-22's?I was totally disappointed with this book. Normally it is much more difficult to find discreptencies from reality in his books? As another review said wait for clearance or get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have a first edition of &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and all of Clancy's other novels. This one is an average techno-thriller, but not a Clancy. Years ago Clancy stated that he couldn't write a love making scene &quot;to save his soul&quot;. Well, in this book he proves himself right. I can almost tell which chapters that were written when his divorce was not going well. In previous books four letter words were used to make a point, but this book it sounds like Nixon or Clinton was talking and it takes away from the story line. I hope Tom does not listen to his editors on the next book and that it matches his previous books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Why does Tom Clancy owe me twelve dollars? Because the editor could have eliminated the first 700 pages of this 1028 page book, and it could have been a pretty darn good book. Since 70 percent of the book was useless, I feel that I should have only paid approximately 30 percent of the purchase price. So Tom, feel free to wire me the money as soon as you can, with interest of course.Anyways, besides wasting hours of my time, this book is borderline racist. Clancy often compares the Chinese to Klingons, and is littered with the word Chink. Even though these references somewhat fit in context, it could have been left out without hurting this book.Another reason that why I didn't like this book was that in some aspects, it was too unreal. Do Russians constantly talk about World War II in every other conversation? Is every single Chinese cop and soldier a complete idiot?Finally, this book annoyed me. Clancy switches between people, and refers to them in the stupidest ways. It took me some time to realize that Jack Ryan, the President, was also code-named POTUS (President of the United States). Also, there were numerous references to former Clancy books. If you haven't read some of his other books, you could be like me and wonder if you've missed something. Also, he loves into to go to technical details about weapons or software that just detract from the story. I'm so sick of seeing military weapon names: AWACS, F-22s, any letter-any number, etc. I found myself thinking that I'm reading a manual. Basically, this books lacks fluidity and readability.If you like a good story with interesting characters and international flavor, I suggest reading a James Clavell novel instead."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First, did you read ALL of the other books? This is an important part of the book.From the Japanese spy from Debt of honor, to the nuclear attack. Remember, Clancy made a parrallel world, not an exact replica of ours. (don't read on if you haven't read any other books yet) Red October was based on a true story, Patriot games and Cardinal of the Kremlin shared more of Ryans personality. Cardinal of the Kremlin is when the true series began, DON'T skip it. Clear and present danger shows Ryans advancement through the agency and introduced John Clark as a main charactar. Sum of all fears, this is an important book right here. This is where he seperates from reality, in an important way. This leads to the end of Russian-American Nuclear warheads in debt of honor, furthering Yamoto's plans, and the chinese's. Sum of all fears began to focus on something other than Russia/Soviet Union for a longer period of time. I know this is a review on The Bear and The Dragon, but these things must be understood. The book itself has a great story, the end is not a happy one, a Clinton-esque leader is put into power(remember Chet Numori?) who is portrayed as a ...leader that the government never condoned of. Since Bill Clinton never existed in the series, it went Regan,Fowler,Durling,Ryan. His fabric is showing weakness, which is why it earns a 4, not a 5. He mentions writing letters to each family that died in war like Bush Sr. did.Overall, this is a great book if you can handle the rhetoric(which i enjoyed, theory is important to his stories) and he isn't rascist, if he was he wouldn't have a black vice president."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books (with the exception of RED STORM RISING) &amp; immensely enjoyed every one of them. BEAR &amp; THE DRAGON, unfortunately, marks the 1st time that I had to discontinue reading a TC novel. I was able to read more than two-thirds of it, though.I am (very) conservative in my politics so Clancy's unabashed conservatism was not the problem. In fact, the first 600 pages (out of 1,027) are actually readable and enjoyable.At the point in the novel when the war begins, however, is when my interest really began to fade. What potential there was as an interesting story dramatically fades in favor of excessive (and boring) military-technical mumbo-jumbo. I read at least 100 pages of it in the hope that the book would become intersting again (as has been the case in prior Clancy novels which were not immune to including technical details about tanks, guns, fighter planes, etc.) but, sadly, it does not!I never thought that I would ever say this about a TC novel but I was thoroughly disappointed with BEAR &amp; THE DRAGON. If you must read it, just for the sake of trying to prove me wrong, then, please, at least wait for the paperback version."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The new Jack Ryan novel by Mr. Clancy delivers on every level, but still falls short of his best novels, because, by now, his books become just a little bit predictable. Dear Mr. Clancy, you may want to consider restructuring your next Jack Ryan novel, otherwise the reader will always stay one step ahead too much. So, in this novel, you get the usual following: 1. Dozens of characters and sub-plots are introduced, which seem to have no connection at all. 2. At about the half-point, the reader gets a picture of what it is all about. 3. In the last third, a millitary conflict erupts. Yes, that sounds familiar. Yes, that's the same structure as in DEBT OF HONOUR and EXECUTIVE ORDERS. Now the good news: This book is better than the two I just mentioned. Although more than 1000 pages long, the book moves at a swift pace, you have characters you care about and the sub-plots and locations feel REAL and interesting. I cannot agree with many readers that there are too many sub-plots which are not important to the novel. Although this is perfectly true, it is the &quot;spice&quot; of the novel. Sure, you could condense the whole novel to 300-400 pages, but then you would lose a lot, you would lose to much. It you're only interested in the bare bones, read a non-fiction book. As Ray Bradbury said: Digression is the soul of the wit. Now, three notes: 1. One reader said that the sub-plot involving a chinese girl and a japanese guy is &quot;leeringly written and offensive&quot;. I strongly disagree with that. Even a Tom Clancy book should have and does have the room, between all the tanks and figher-planes, for stories about what is going on between (a) man and (a) woman. If you can't stand such stories, buy a military non-fiction book. 2. Another (this time Chinese) reader pointed out that this book is offensive and racist against the Chinese people. Well, if you don't want to write science-fiction novels all the time, you have to pick a villain. And if you write a global spy/military thriller, the villain has to be a country. So, yes, Japanese people can complain about DEBT OF HONOUR, Iranians can complain about EXECUTIVE ORDERS and Chinese people can complain about this one. But this is beside the point. Again: If you don't want to pick Klingons all the time, someone has to play the villain. AND, the novel doesn't portray the Chinese people as a whole as evil and stupid, but just some members of their government. And who can, Chinese or not, argue with that?!? Every government on Earth has evil and stupid people in their ranks. So, please, whether your Chinese or not, couldn't you put your (politically correct) complaints aside and relax a little bit? Look, I'm German and am very, very used to German villains and I wouldn't mind Clancy picking the Germans as the villains in his next book. 3. Last note to Mr. Clancy himself or one of his agents: Mr. Clancy, you have the great talent to describe even the most ridiculous events in a way that they seem realistic. You do that my showing us not only the government-level but also the events from the view of ordinary people, switching places and locations every so often. You also employ this technique in this book, but in the end, you just show us a war and only that, without showing us the effect on the TV-news, the people or anything else. This has the undesired effect that the reader places those events in the realm of fantasy because you do not root them (by showing us what normal people think about this) in reality anymore. The more you leave the realstic world, the more you have to suspend the disbelief of the reader. You did a great job here in the first two thirds of the book, but not in the last. Ok, let me close now, I can highly recommend this book, it is Clancy's third best after CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER and THE SUM OF ALL FEARS."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When it comes to international intrigue, Tom Clancy is a master of making the inconceivable plausible. Here he conjures a fascinating conflict between China and Russia in an imaginary world where only China has nukes. Though far fetched, the scenario contains just enough facts and credible premises to be dangerously entertaining.As always, Clancy loads the book with high tech weapons and an inside look at espionage and military decision making. The book sometimes gets bogged down in minutia, but it has enough suspense and twists to keep the pages turning.Jack Ryan is back again as POTUS, but he is marginalized in this story, taking a back seat to characters in Russia and China. In fact, Ryan is probably one of the least important characters in the story. To make matters worse, Ryan is beginning to get a little flaky. For instance, at one point while Washington is under threat of nuclear attack he decides that the best place for the President of the United States to be would be aboard an Aegis Cruiser at ground zero. Some time later, he transports the entire crew of that same Cruiser to the White House for drinks as if it were some kind of frat party. For a writer who concentrates so much on realistic details, Clancy really warped out in this segment.All in all this is a very engaging book. While probably not Clancy's best work, it is certainly a strong addition to a genre that has lost a good deal of horsepower with the end of the cold war. I rated it a 7/10. Modern warfare lovers won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I couldn't finish the last Clancy book and this one is hopeless. Just hundreds of pages of research by his staff, I'm sure and no story. Plus it bears NO resemblance to what really goes on in the White House. I will not buy the next novel from Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is very good if you skip the first 300 pages. With the exception of the first 30."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I bought this book understanding that Clancy is just to the right of Attila the Hun, however he can write an incredibly tight techo-military thriller. Unfortunately, I had to wait until almost the end of the book before Clancy hit his stride. The rest of the book was right-wing, racist, xenophobic dribble. Clancy's knowledge of China and Chinese culture is totally MIA. Buy his earlier works, if you want, but stay away from this misguided tome."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I made the mistake of taking this book on a long plane flight, much to my regret. Complete waste of time and insult to one's intelligence, unless one likes the Ronald Reagan simplistic view of the world. Though now the white Russians are the good guys, and why not they are white and probably even good Christians, and the yellow Chinese are the bad guys (non-white and non-Christians). In addition to Clancy's obvious racial bigotry, he obviously shares Bush II's love for war from a distance where smart bombs kill dumb enemies with no American lives risked or lost. He has shown that beyond a fascination with war machinery and strategy, he has a school boy's adulation of men in uniform and a tremendous desire to demonstrate to the reader that he is &quot;a real macho man&quot;, i.e. a soldier, brave and true. This book might be of value to a psychologist probing Clancy's insecurities about his manhood as he ages, but it provides little entertainment value and certainly provides no insight into war or the men who choose to make a living out of war."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. I have read all of Tom Clancy's books (some multiple times), except for his Op Center series. No one except maybe Larry Bond can write a techno-thriller like Tom can. Unfortunately, this book is well below the level of quality we've come to expect from Tom Clancy.To begin with, Tom has decided to spend the first 400 pages writing a cheap sex novel. I have never read such filth in any of his novels. He has a CIA operative seduce a Chinese national to get government information. I think it is possible to describe this without going into extreme graphic detail when there is no relevance in doing this. He also seems to want to portray all the leaders of China as depraved sexual predators.Tom Clancy then goes on to insult basically all genders and races in the novel. He continually refers to the Chinese as barbarians and calls them Klingons because he can't understand the way they think... He seems to have a field day with respect to women. I don't know how he can rationalize his duality on this issue. Most of the female characters in his novels have been strong, competent professionals. This is still the case with Cathy Ryan and Andrea Price (Ryan's secret service chief). However, he continually trivialize women in this book with statements like:&quot;Women were all the same. Treat them in the right way, and they turn to wax in your hand, to be kneaded and shaped to your will.&quot;, and&quot;You just couldn't turn some women loose on computers. It was like loosing a four-year-old in a gun shop.&quot;Tom also spends a large portion of the book ranting about his thoughts on abortion rights, gun control, the environment etc. This is supposed to be a techno-thriller. Next time he should leave his soapbox at home.On the positive side, the last 300 pages are vintage Tom Clancy. The action is exciting and riveting. The ending however is very abrupt. After the US successfully shoots down a Chinese ICBM right over Washington DC, Jack Ryan goes home and gets drunk. The Chinese send an apology and the novel is done... It was almost as if Tom Clancy got sick of writing and just stopped.While it had many bad points to it, the novel was still fun to read. I would not recommend spending the money on the hard cover. Wait until the softcover edition comes out. Better yet, wait until the softcover is available in the second-hand shop."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is one of my husbands favorite authors, with the 4 for 3 sales thatAmazon.com puts on ANYONE can afford to fatten their reading library!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a previously devout Clancy fan, I found this book to be boring, excessively sexist, racist, and a complete waste of my time. It was so bad I vowed to never again buy a Clancy book. If you liked Hunt for Red October or Cardinal of the Kremlin, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a fan of the Jack Ryan series but this one is surely a dissapointment. The main problem is Tom Clancy's ignorance of China. If only he has been to China in the recent years, he will find things vastly different than he depicted. Instead he depicted China the same as Russian in the 70s which makes the novel looks much less real and repetitive."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm actually surprised, given all the insightful reviews here, that no one else is irked by his characters' \\"Hollywood\\" dialogue. As much as I admire Tom Clancy's story development and research, his characters' conversations are stilted and 1950s Hollywood. In his earlier novels, his work has been a sort of antithesis to Stephen King's universe: in Clancy's world, all men are overachievers, Decidedly Republican, and if not in possession of a Master's Degree, most assuredly working on one! Conversely, in King's realm, all men are drunks, given to child molestation, and of course had abusive parents! But I'll give it to Stephen King: his characters' dialogue is so true to life as to be, well, a bit scary. Contrast that with a typical exchange between Clancy's ongoing protagonist Ryan and his wife:\\"Hi, Honey. Do anything today?\\"\\"Went to the mall. Didn't buy anything.\\"\\"Bargains?\\"\\"Didn't see any. Came on home.\\"Earth to Tom: having spent a few years in the United States Army, I can confidently say that there are very few guys in or out of the military that actually talk that way ( clipping pronouns and articles in speech )...and absolutely NO females I've encountered that do it! However,like so many avid Clancy readers, I absolutely love his meticulous attention to detail ( Earth to Stephen King: stay away from the military and UFOs!! ). Nobody does his research quite like Tom Clancy ( although I've always thought the Late Michael Crichton came very close, plus some very realistic conversations between his characters ). So I too was disappointed with this gargantuan effort. As to political leanings, the not-so-subtle digs at the Clinton administration didn't surprise me, although I also wondered just who, other than President Fowler in Clancy's universe, represented the token Liberal Democrat...Clancy probably would like to go back and reissue his novels, substituting Fox News in place of every reference he made to CNN.One more point on the dialogue critique, Mr. Clancy: Please stop assigning stereotypically poor grammar to enlisted folks! I've met more than a few NCOs throughout my tenure in the U.S. military with very eloquent speech...and quite a few officers who were never taught the finer points about employing double negatives in speech, much less pronoun/antecedent agreement. Characters in Clancy's universe fall into one of two categories: Overachievers ( the vast majority of every American he introduces, along with his educational resume ), and the token wino/terrorist/criminal. Where are ordinary, average people in Clancy's world? Nary a store manager or public school teacher is introduced. Oh, they live; just working out their underachieving lives as best they can...but, in Navy parlance, just \\"below the radar\\".If you approach a Clancy novel as one more platform for Tom showing the world just how smart he is, you won't usually be disappointed...I only wish he could find a way to be less didactic about it ( something Mr. Crichton achieved in virtually every one of his novels ). And one final note, Mr. Clancy: very, very few people actually \\"chuckle\\" anymore. Most of us Laugh, sometimes Uproariously!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"You have to admire the scope of the story and how he does such a good job of tying the many pieces together. I especially admire how he builds the story from lengthy serials to rapid-fire cuts from storyline to storyline as the book progresses. The military lingo can get a little geeky, but most of the time hits just the right &quot;that sounds pretty cool&quot; note. And it's fun to have Ryan as the Prez (although you do start to wonder what Americans in Clancyland are feeling, what with global crises erupting every year or so).But ...the story really suffers from all the indoctrination that infuses even something as simple as a character taking a sip of coffee (which prompts the drinking character to go on and on about the evils of Communism, etc., etc.). You can almost detect 'em coming, after a while you get good enough that you know when to turn on NPR to have your antidote. This sets up interesting duels between the part of your brain that processes Clancy using some minor character doing some minor thing to make a point about lily-livered liberals and the part of your brain that gets hooked by a profile of an underpaid inner city teacher who bicycles to work.Ahem. Back to the review. The problem with the fixes the US gets into in Clancy's books is that the resolution always seems just a little too easy. This one takes the cake, and doesn't overcome the &quot;yeah, but&quot;s that you keep thinking as you get to the end. For the investment of time necessary to finish this behemoth, I'd have to say you'd be better off re-reading Executive Orders or Debt of Honor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book uses way too many abbreviations. I mean he goes out of his way to add them...POTUS(president of the united states)...why use it?!.....this was my first clancy novel and i'm not so sure if i will return for another after this loooooooong disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you are a seasoned Clancy reader you will enjoy this book. A new reader of the author may have trouble with its length and style. As with most of his books it is a plot that is feasable. Many of previous character are back, such as Nomuri from Debt of Honor. If you are a Clancy fan, read this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a 14 year old high school student and i've read all of the Clancy novels. while this one may not be his best (i like Red Storm Rising more), it was still a good book. there were the usual details on weapons but i think it should have had more action."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Is this the same Tom Clancy as the one who wrote such great books as &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;? I don't think so. I was very disappointed in this, even more disappointed than I was with &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. I wonder about a Pen Writer on this and the last. Come on, Tom, give us back the old Jack Ryan!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has reached his bottom in this book, which he uses merely as a pulpit for his political/saocial preachings. The plot is thin and not plausible, the characters are stiff and unreal, and the language is stilted and meaningless in many places. He uses his word of the day several times in a few pages, then it disappears. Don't bother. I read 200 pages, then quit!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When Executive Orders came out in 1996, I snapped it up right away. I had it read less than a week after it came out. When Rainbow Six came out two years later, I did the same thing - and I thought it sucked. I've been waiting four years for a new Jack Ryan book, with Clancy scattering Rainbow Sucks and Net-Force and Power-Play and God only knows what else in between. So, when I heard that a new Jack Ryan book was coming out, I anxiously awaited it and bought it the day it came out. I thought it was great. I thought that Clancy did a great job of showing exactly how tedious the office of President can be, though I did question making Robby Jackson VP - after all, most Presidents don't make their best friend VP. However, over all, I thought it was probably Clancy's best since Without Remorse."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read numerous reviews and my feelings are both &quot;with you&quot; and &quot;against you&quot;, but in the final analysis.... #1. You have to keep in mind that this is fiction, not the real world.....that is why all of us are Clancy fans. #2. Yes, it was kind of long and probably could have been condensed somewhat, but Mr.Clancy's claim to fame is refining his very intriguing characters to the best of his abilities.....and I would doubt anyone who is a true technocrat would say that he has not lived up to his superb abilities. #3. My bottom line.....GREAT----Very lively read and simply let your imagination run wild----as a intellectual excercise---at the starting point of the battle and continuing, draw yourself a map and plot for yourself the actual war stategy for both sides----FUN!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, the book was long, but it still had great detail and was very interesting. I have read alot of his books and this just had to be the best. The profanity could have been cut down a little, but he's trying to make a point that Jack Ryan is not your normal president. The part about Ming and Nomuri went into a little to much detail but that really happens in the world."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yes, as with all Clancy novels, you must endure the set-up. A good 300 pages worth of setting up the characters and plot of the book before the action explodes. It was well-worth it to keep reading. A truly incredible book - it stands out among his novels as one of the great ones, and I've read them all. Clancy's President Jack Ryan makes you long for such a President in real life. Again, if you just make it through the first 300 pages, you will be richly rewarded with a fantastic story that makes the rest of the book seem to end too soon. I'm looking forward to the next one, Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...what the early Clancy books never were: Boring."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you have to read this book, borrow it from a friend or wait until it is in papperback, don't waste any more money than you have to. Clancy has become lazy or has a poor ghost writer. Perhaps it's a lazy, poor ghost writer. Either way, the book is a let down full of repetition, dogma, and typoes."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having snapped up all Tom Clancy's previous books, I eagerly awaited this one and bought it at the first opportunity to enjoy on holiday. After a few hundred pages, I found myself plodding through it dutifully, reluctant to consign it to the bin where I felt it belonged. About page 700 the military plot began to roll, and for a few hours I was enthralled by the kind of writing for which Tom Clancy became famous.What is wrong with this book? For my taste, the author has overreached by tackling characterisation, extensive dialogue and political philosophy. While his personal opinions are as valid as anyone else's, the resulting book bored, annoyed and upset me. I was bored because of the lack of a tight, suspensful plot. I was annoyed by the dialogue that seemed modelled on Nixon's White House tapes and the clumsy depiction of a US President who seems completely unqualified for the post. Although I am by no means a prude or a bigot, I was upset by the bad language and what I perceived as racial stereotyping.In conclusion, I have always enjoyed Tom Clancy's books because I felt that he was a superb storyteller, with an unequalled grasp of military detail and the ability to tell a story from many concurrent viewpoints. An important part of his art seemed to be that even the \\"black hats\\" always had believable ideals and convictions. In \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", I feel that Jack Ryan has succumbed to the Peter Principle - he has been promoted far beyond his level of competence. This book could have been about half the length, and if the right parts were cut, I think I would have enjoyed it much more.I don't know if I will be buying any more books by Tom Clancy. I certainly won't buy any more in hard cover - my criterion of a favourite author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Except for the 1000+ page volume, this is a first rate and every bit of an equal work to his previous efforts! The characters and the plot are enthralling! Every time you set this book down, you will find yourself drawn back to it! It is a must buy for any true Clancy fan!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, let's start by pointing out the obvious here:Jack Ryan = Tom ClancyThe guy can't get any more obvious. I suppose I'm one of those damned liberals that Tom always rages about in his books, but I've managed to ignore his increasingly bombastic political diatribes in most of his books until now. I realize that the guy is conservative to the core, but it is only through this book that I have come to realize that we disagree on almost every political issue he has chosen to express his viewpoint on. Normally this would not make me avoid his books- if a guy can write, a guy can write, right? But TC has made his viewpoints so ingrained in his writing that I can't manage to read a page without thinking &quot;Where the hell is this guy coming from?&quot; He casually slanders Asians, Asian Americans, Gays and Lesbians, and even Women- all in about 100 pages of the book. Call me easily offended, but I resent the repeated use of the word &quot;chink&quot; in this novel and the increased profanity and sex content. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, but there is something to be said for using those types of passages sparingly. Clancy seems to have lost the knack for keeping a storyline interesting, and as a sideshow he has allowed his arch-conservative political beliefs to distort his characters so much as to make them unrecognizable to someone who has read all of his other novels. I will finish this book, but next time he puts one out I will not buy it, unless he manages to clean up his act and write a decent, honest and interesting ACTION-ADVENTURE novel, not a &quot;What I would do if I were president&quot; storybook full of ignorance and bigotry. In truth, this book would be wonderful if you took Jack Ryan out of it completely, (it would be about 3-400 pages shorter too!) but since that would be removing Tom's mouthpiece I doubt he'd ever do it.Just my 2 cents"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read several of Tom Clancies books. His best was before he turned into book and PC game packages. This book is terribly long but is full of repetition (paid by the word?) and a LOT of foreign bashing. I mean, I would be inclined to think that TC is xenophobic.The book is nothing but a lame \\"confidence booster for americans\\". I have even skipped whole pages but now that I am mostly bed ridden for a few days it was the only book I had at hand so I had to go on reading it or face getting even more bored."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After slogging through Tom Clancy's Bear and Dragon, I feel sure that Mr. Clancy has thought himself above his editor's advice. My advice to Mr. Clancy would be to listen to your editor a lot more, and if you did, get a new one!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I really enjoyed this book although I was a little leary as the previous two books were not up to par, but this one is a great read and all the characters are back; Ryan was elected back as President, Robby as VP, his staff from before, Clark and Ding, Nomuri the Japanesse American spy and the main Chinese bad guy from the former books. As the title implies, The Chinese go against the Russians and we jump in to help our Russian freinds. I particularily liked the interactions in the White House and with other government agencies and the battle descriptions. My only disappointment was that even with the 1028 pages I still wanted more storyline about Clark and Ding plus I wanted to know more about Nomuri and Ming afterwards.A great book that stands alone but is helped by prior knowledge of his other books. I strongly recommend it for all Clancy fans but recommend new readers to start with earlier books and read as fast as you can to get up to this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I like this book. I am a great grandmother that has read a few Clancy books and though this is a long very detailed book I stayed with it. Maybe Mr. Clancy felt he had to write this book in this way to tell the \\"story\\" he had to tell. The story line was fantastic, the plot was outstanding and when I read the last word I was sad to see it over. The only thing in my life that I like to get in and get it done fast is housework. When I sit down to read I am never going to a fire so to speak so the length of this book didn't bother me in the least. Is this Mr. Clancy's best work? Probably not but when have we all been at the top of our game. This book will grab you and get you absorbed into the complex world of politics, spooks, and last but not least the villain. I just know that I could not sit down and punch out this many pages and still keep a reader interested enough to turn the page."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you like Clancy, I think you'll really like this book. It does start out a bit slow, and it is a bit difficult to follow in the beginning. But if you can stick with it for 5 or 6 chapters, the book really starts to drag you in. At about 30% into the book, It is hard to put down. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been reading Tom Clancy for a really long time......I have enjoyed all of the 45 to 50 books I have read and hope to continue to to follow the exploits of Ryan,Clark, &Chavez into a lot more. I have read Net Force, OP Center, Power Play, Splinter Cell, End War Series,Ghost Reckon and just today picked up THREAT VECTOR..........So I am in seventh heaven. I think that his grasp of what his fans look for and require in action books is captured completely in the JACK Ryan series. I a hard pressed to tell my friends which book is better than the other With these books,,,,,Rainbow Six, WIthout REmorse, The Hunt for Red October, The Teeth of the TIger ,,,,just to name my most favorite few. I have read all of W.E.B Griffin books and I put him on a par with CLancy ,,,,,,,,but they both have what I want in a book,action,mystery,intrigue,plot within plot keeps the pages turning and me happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,poppie927"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is complete junk. Very little research must have gone into this book. It is almost as if Tom Clancy decided to stop writing books but the publishers wouldn't let him. The characters have very little depth and the book reads like the script of a b-grade movie. A huge fall for this once great author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I enjoyed the parts detailing the military and special forces operations but was less interested in his political ramblings, probably because he knows much more about the former than the latter. I could be wrong but he seems to inject quite a bit of his own politics into those sections."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I enjoy Tom Clancy's book, but some times there is a little to much detail in the overall discreption of the mechanical equipement. I guess to the average American who has been in the forces, it is all clear. But to a Canadian women it is clear as mud. But I still enjoy his books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a big Tom Clancy fan, so it didn't surprise me that this book is another great one. He never disappointments me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"like all clancy's books this one is excellent, especially as far as it is a continuation of the series, I wish he were writing some more such books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is 1137 pages long. It could have been less than 600 if Clancy had left out the political propaganda.The book's focus is anti-China rhetoric. President Jack Ryan's trusted advisers refer to the Chinese by many combinations of racial slurs and 12-letter or 10-letter curse words. All non-Christian Chinese characters are evil, (except one naive girl who likes sex), and Chinese-Americans, even those in the CIA and military, aren't trusted with sensitive information (and don't get a word of dialogue). The president's private discussions refer to Chinese as \\"aliens\\" or \\"Klingons\\". The president calls China's policy \\"incomprehensible barbarism\\" with \\"incomprehensible stupidity\\", and refers to the people themselves with curse words and \\"barbarians\\". President Ryan compares them to Nazis, visits Auschwitz, then promises to defeat the Chinese so it will never happen again. There's lots of actual preaching, including ten pages of evangelical sermon (broadcast by CNN) in the middle, and the pastors focus on the \\"heathens\\", \\"godless pagans\\", and \\"Sons of Satan\\" in China, how evil they are, how Mao was \\"the voice of Satan\\" and the \\"mouthpiece of the fires of hell\\" and how they love pretending they are gods. The main sermon ends with:\\"When Jesus looks into our hearts, will he see people who support the sons of Lucifer? Will Jesus see people who give them money to support the godless killers of the innocent? Will Jesus see people who support the new Hitler?\\"Anti-Communism statements are omnipresent. Dozens of characters monologue about how stupid and unworkable communism is and how only idiots could believe it. Even the thoughts of the Communist characters are depicted as stupid. In a book set in 2000, the focus on Mao's sex life is mind-boggling. Stories about Mao taking advantage of 12-year-old virgins are told on pages 52, 130, 168, 505, and 794.The book also focuses on China's one-child policy. The secretary for a top Chinese official tells a Japanese businessman that as a woman, \\"I suppose I'm lucky to be alive\\". The middle 200 pages is devoted to a couple who wants a second child after their first child dies, climaxing when doctors attempt a forced birth-abortion, a Vatican City cardinal and a Chinese Baptist stop him, and the police murder both, with the government supporting the police. Wait - a police officer murders an unarmed diplomat and a pastor in front of CNN cameras, and the government supports them? The next day Chinese police brutally beat 34 Chinese Christians, including the dead pastor's wife, on her own front lawn (again in front of CNN cameras). Clancy even suggests that the Chinese government might be harvesting the organs of aborted newborns and selling them on the black market.Besides constant rips on China, Mao, and everything Communist, there's lots of pro-capitalism. A big theme is China's unfair trade laws and how America deserves a level playing field (ignoring that we have unfair trade laws against most 3rd-world countries). There are speeches about why wealthy people are the smartest, the hardest working, and make the best government leaders. Jack Ryan is Clancy's consummate hero, and the book brags about his $80,000,000 bank account, million-dollar jewelry, and collection of fine furs. President Ryan also emphasizes that there is no such thing as \\"class\\" in America and everyone can have wealth if they work hard. He lauds the superior morality of Wall Street capitalists several times. At one point the ultra-rich SecTreas and former Wall Street tycoon declares that Wall Street would never purposely screw someone over, and expresses incredulity that America even does business with the Chinese. Copious displays of wealth - private jets, fine cigars, fine jewelry, fine art, fine clothing - are made by those smart, hard-working, and righteous enough to have earned them. Clancy attacks politicians for being greedy while mocking them for not making enough money by his standards.There's lots of other conservative propaganda. Roe v. Wade was a mistake and abortion is wrong. Government is evil and politicians are corrupt (except Ryan and his already-wealthy friends). More oil must be drilled and environmentalists are mocked. Clancy's adoration of violence is throughout. Our law enforcement should \\"take justice into its own hands\\". \\"Real men\\" have killed bad guys, or die with a gun in their hands. Pro-military rhetoric is constant, with all past and present US military actions described as \\"liberation and never conquest\\", even using Vietnam as an example. Clancy minimizes the significance of killing enemy soldiers, stating that they should have trained harder or not put the uniform on. Clancy says that the US military relies on massive bombing, rather than manpower, because we place a higher value on human life than other nations. Is Clancy unaware that our massive bombing campaigns kill far more civilians than our manpower-intensive infantry campaigns, or did he mean \\"American life\\" when he said \\"human life\\"? After talking about how the Chinese were going to hell, a pastor comments that he loved comforting dying U.S. Marines because he \\"knew they were going to see God\\". A different pastor, getting full-on with the war effort (before the Chinese had even invaded anyone), states \\"Let's give those Sons of Satan a reason to fear us\\".There are typical anti-liberal attacks. The \\"bad guy\\" in the State Department is a close friend of the liberal ex-vice president. He is ripped on for going to Harvard. A Brown professor is a detached academic callous about human life, as opposed to the military personnel he's speaking to. There's a reference to \\"fairyfied French food\\", and rips on Europe. The American media, with \\"lingering liberalism\\", are said to not respect the public and have \\"great solicitude for communist countries\\". Feminists are mocked, of course, and homosexual and lesbian sex is derided as wrong.Speaking of that, genital size are frequently referenced. Chinese characters have small ones (literally and figuratively), while Americans have large ones. An American spy's \\"sausage\\" is referenced frequently by his Chinese lover and compared favorably to her former Chinese partners. Every Chinese male's sexual act is some form of perversion, but the Americans have \\"boys must be boys\\" sexual conquests. The use of Asian prostitutes by the American military is condoned as expected and acceptable by numerous characters. Though there are no Japanese characters (just one Japanese-American), the \\"sexual perversions\\" of the Japanese are referred to multiple times.As far as plot goes, it's one of Ryan's worst. From the beginning you know the Chinese will start a war with the Russians to get their gold and oil, and the Americans will help the Russians defeat them easily. You know the old hunter will shoot some Chinese, the spy will produce critical information, the Rainbow guys will run a mission in Russia, the missile-defense software will prevent a nuclear attack on Washington. I saw one surprising plot turn - at the last second President Ryan makes an idiotic decision, but in Clancy's world it's heroic. Every military engagement, every spy move, every government decision goes perfectly for the \\"good guys\\". Clancy is really sloppy with repetition. Over and over the same jokes are repeated, insults made, explanations detailed, wisdom given. We hear that one secretary gives her boss better oral sex than the other secretary at least 5 times from at least 4 different characters. Most of Clancy's old characters are recycled with no development except a new rank. It's tedious - I grew up loving Red Storm Riding, The Hunt for Red October, and Clear and Present Danger, but this book was trash. I leave you with its final words:\\"Ming went out to dinner--the restaurants hadn't closed--with her foreign lover, gushing over drinks and noodles with the extraordinary events of the day, then walked off to his apartment for a dessert of Japanese sausage.\\""},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels and I have generally liked them-except for this one. The novel has several problems including: 1) It is long and boring. The super-secret military techno gadgets are not very impressive and he is repetitious and long winded in his descriptions of them. For example, he spends a lot of time gushing over unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with high resolution optical and thermal cameras that provide detailed, real time data on enemy positions-yawn. His descriptions of the Chinese and Russian governments seem naive and unrealistic. 2) The plot is silly and naive. China invades Russia to take away its newly discovered oil and gold fields thinking that the world will sit by and allow this and then buy these ill-gotton gains from them. Right. 3) The dialogue is painfully awkward. This has been a problem with Clancy's books and this one is no exception. The dialogue used to describe government workings, gadgets, etc. comes off as a droning college lecture and the speaker sounds arrogant-like he is talking down to his &quot;pupil&quot;. The lecturer will speak for several sentences uttering an &quot;ok?&quot; after every 2-3 sentences to make sure everything is sinking in. He also sprinkles in a lot of unrealistic and unnecessary expletives I guess to keep the reader's attention?This book had some good points such as the opening in which the head of the Russian intelligence agency almost gets killed and the recruitment of a spy in the upper ranks of the Chinese government. Clancy does well when confining himself to small-scale plots like this and in the Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Without Remorse, and Clear and Present Danger. When he tries to tackle large-scale and global war (Sum of All Fears, Red Storm Rising), his stories become ridiculous. Skip this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I haven't finished this one yet but I'm most of the way throgh. Like several of his more recent books this one is more drawn out. Part of this is due to the fact that he is taking on bigger issues and providing more history, but the other part of it is that it's repititive and he wants to voice his political views through the characters. On many occasions he goes out of the way to repeat various characters titles and thoughts, which adds up to a few hundred extra pages. Also, I don't quite buy his descriptions of Chinese politics and life. In most of his previous books the bad guys are intelligent and competent adversaries, but in this one he portrays the Chinese as morons with guns. This doesn't mesh very well with the impression I get from talking with some of my Chinese friends. The excitement and action are there as always, and the police work is very well done, but I prefer some of his earlier books. Also, don't read this if you aren't a little familiar with some of Clancy's characters, because it'll really help to know who he's talking about in some cases. All in all, it's not a bad read..but far from his best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"this book took so long to write, that clancy forgot things he wrote and repeated it in the following chapters over and over.He takes you on a journey of all, and i mean ALL that goes on in the characters heads, and there are whole chapters that you could skip and not lose the thread of the story.And then there is POTUS, he can do no bad, he is a saint, he knows what to do and the right time to do it, hes got to be the most flawless character of any book i've ever read, and by that i mean hes just never wrong and he could teach a thing or two to the pope about morality, iv'e enjoyed all of clancy's books, but this one just [stinks]."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This tome shows multiple writing styles which begs the question: How many ghostwriters compiled this book? I've about given up on Clancy for any character development. Rainbow Six and The Bear and the Dragon show the same pitiful unidimensional characters. The conclusion was obvious, predictable and unsatisfying.For a good read, go back to the classics: Red Storm Rising is still his best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is one of the few authors I will buy in hardback; that is how much I enjoyed &quot;The Hunt For Red October,&quot; &quot;Red Storm Rising,&quot; &quot;Patriot Games,&quot; and his other early works. Unfortunately, I can't say I've enjoyed any of his recent works. I couldn't believe the plot of &quot;Rainbow Six,&quot; reworking the ebola virus angle of &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; and the IRA terrorists of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; both in the same story. I suffered through that book and &quot;The Bear and the Dragon.&quot; I must have known it would be bad; I waited a year after I bought it to start it. It had very poor, simplistic dialog. Every time the book turned back to Jack Ryan, a man we want to like, we had to listen to him whine about being &quot;POTUS.&quot; Every damn time. We suffered through too many pages to count of a trade negotiation, when it could have been summarized in two. We only got about two pages of a U.S. submarine engaging Chinese submarines. Clancy has me by the wallet, I'll probably always buy his hardcovers. Do yourself a favor and wait for his paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This has got to be Clancy's literary version of color-by-numbers. The plot is far-fetched, while at the same time too thin. The characters are so well-developed from previous books that all we're left with is Jack Ryan's whining about how he's not right/adequate/suited for the job of president. And while I like Clancy's books, Ryan's philosophizing on subjects ranging from abortion to religion to government smack of the arrogance that Clancy often puts across in personal appearances. Puh-leeze, keep your views to yourself, willya? On top of that, the book was poorly edited, with typos (excusable) and recurring dialogue (inexcusable). To be fair, I read the first edition hard-cover, so maybe this has been corrected in the subsequent editions, but I doubt it. The author's and publisher's philosophy seem to be &quot;ah what the hell, throw it out there, it'll make money&quot;. Come on, Clancy, you know you can do better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a Clancy fan ever since &quot;Hunt for Red October.&quot; However, I will think long and hard before investing any of my time in another one of his books.The Bear and the Dragon reads more like a political lecture than a techno thriller. Clancy has managed to take previously well developed characters and and make them boring and downright irritating at times. As an added insult, much of the dialogue is openly and unnecessarily racist in nature.They say that the back third of this book speeds up and reads more like his earlier work. I wouldn't know - I threw it out in disgust half way through."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There are so many things wrong with this book that it is impossible to know where to begin. Besides the blatant racism and gaping plot holes the story is just boring. It is about a one sided victory against a militarily backward foe. Does this story sound familiar? I guess in that way it is somewhat realistic. What I find frightening about this book is not its depiction of a possible conflict for the U.S. Rather it is the discription of the leaders in Washington. If our current Secretary of the Treasury is as stupid as Clancy's Whinston we should all be very afraid. He displays a complete ignorance of little things like the meaning of a trade deficit. If our diplomats are as incompetant as Gant then we are certainly due for a major land war here soon. Please God let it not be so. Amen."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the first Clancy novel (and I've read most of them) that I could not finish...actually could not get started. May have been the beginning or simply the weight of the book at over 1100 pages. I switched to a Vince Flynn novel instead."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"i think the book might present a better and more logical backdrop to the chinese invasion of siberia by mentioning the historic facts concerning how siberia was lost to russia in the 19 century by the corrupt and incompetent Qing Dynasty regime. This may provide a more balanced reasoning for the poliburo members, rather than depicting them as simple minded greedy thugs. Shouldn't Mr. Clancy be reminded that every politician in every part of the world is inherently greedy, since it is just part of the job description for politicians."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not usually one to criticize the literary efforts of another, especially a very successful author as Tom Clancy, and to be perfectly honest, Mr. Clancy is quite talented. He can weave a multi-layered story and somehow still hold the reader's interest over the course of a thousand pages or so. But with that kind of ability and talent, it's wasted on his own political agenda and closet prejudices. I have not yet finished reading this book and I will finish it for the sheer stubborness and satisfaction of completing something I've started but this latest effort is disappointing on so many levels. It starts out as a whodunnit murder mystery and quickly evolves into a presidential temper tantrum that somehow never ends (grow up, Jack. You're the fictional leader of the fictional free world, for crying out loud), a lengthy dissertation with a focus on racially slandering every ethnic group on the planet, and a forum for voicing Mr. Clancy's own love of the military and disdain for anything else. It's hard to enjoy a book that refuses to acknowledge the fundamental and universal truth that all men ARE equal. He's infused all the characters in this book with a primitive and cavemanlike attitude and does no justice to any of them. China may be a communist country, but once upon a time not so long ago, America still had slaves. The next time Mr. Clancy publishes a novel, I will follow my friends and colleagues and not bother reading it. It isn't worth it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"An *outstanding* story by an outstanding storyteller. Clancy not only portrays the technical details of statecraft and war in a believable way, but captures the very personalities of some real life counterparts of his fictional characters as he writes. May easily be the best book printed this year."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Dear all,After you read Tom Clancy's novel &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot;,it is not necessary for you to take it so serious. Take it easy.If you are Chinese or Russian and you read this novel, you just read the book and spent your leisure time. I live at Taipei,Taiwan. You know, like Hollywood movie, you buy the ticket andenjoy the happy time with your family. Good guy always won. Who care? Above all, take it easy. OK!Larry"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was an astonishing display of talent from Tom Clancy. I truly enjoyed this book, it was my favorite of all of his. It may have been a little slow at times, but it picked up easily and kept me on the edge of my seat. My only regret was the number of explicit scenes portrayed in the book; however this was only a small shortcoming."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Folks, if you have not yet read this book, and you're a Clancy/Ryan fan, you can safely ignore the dullards that gave this book a 1 or 2. This is classic Clancy. He has you following multiple plots, knowing all along that they're going to all come together in the end. Like a lot of other people, I enjoyed Jack Ryan a lot more when he wasn't the president. I too got sick of the endless whining about the trappings about being the president. OK, Mr. Clancy, we get it! You don't have to have him complain upwards of 50 times throughout the book about not liking being the prez. Sheesh. Other than that one gripe, I loved this book from start to finish.I just hope his next book (Red Rabbit) is as good. I've read all of his books, and The Bear and The Dragon is by no means my favorite (Red Storm Rising still holds that place), but it fits nicely in the Jack Ryan series.And to the people that complain about the language in the book ---grow the heck up. That's how people talk. Thank god Clancy hasn't gotten all politically correct on us like many other more hackneyed authers have."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Since the introduction of Clancy's work, there has remained a single fundamental philosophy behind the focus of the novels, that was the demise of the Soviet Union. I've personally read through the series of novels that depict the expoits of a dewitched Dr. Ryan, who incorpates the psychic abilities of a Gypsy and an experienced, but downplayed, politican. Despite the low marks given by these fellow readers, The Bear and the Dragon, is a psychological study of the last remaining psuedo-Marxist regime. As seen by recent events, the Chinese have become the next super power, filling the void left by the Soviet Union. Though the text is extensive, the message given by the novel is apparently to touche for these liberated minds to comprehend. To believe, again, that there exists another superpower threatening the Western world appears to compromise the sense of security these so-called critics have placed upon this insightful, detailed look into the Maoist nation. Despite the style of Clancy, the normal thoroughly explained positions and reasoning behind the actions of the antagonists has been glossed over in some accords, though the remainder of the text holds true to the Clancy style of fiction. The familiarity formerly associated with the evils of the Soviet Union, are now embodied in the Chinese government that Americans are fairly unable to grasp from lack of exposure. However, the studious Clancy has once again done his homework on the Chinese government and strains upon the population."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a fan of Clancy, i looked forward to the book...it didn't let me down..the espionage drew me in..the relationship of Ryan with his VP..the CIA couple...the inside of the Chinese Politburo...the leftover Russians from the old days...Rainbow Six...All Clancy fans could see it all coming in this saga...New Clancy readers will learn all of this as they read along...What struck me the most was the selfishness of the Chinese government..the people had their say in the end..The US secret weapons were really entertaining...If you like Clancy this is a must..try it out you won't regret it..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Bonzo! Dead Eye! Fire Away! This sequel to \\"Executive Directions\\" is dyanmite! No movie could ever do justice to the multi-layered dynamo of War, Espionage, and International Intrigue. What a whale of a story! So fast-paced that it leaves you on the edge of your seat! No other work of fiction on current issues on war and intrigue could ever match this! A complete course in international relations--- all contained in this incredible book! Tom Clancy is a national asset! Politicians and military alike could benefit from this master genius with so much awareness and depth from whom we all could learn so much!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book, maybe not great by Clancy's standards but not as bad as many reviewers are giving it. Obviously if you are of the political left you will not like it. However, i am bothered by the number of typos that i found in this book.Clancy needs to go back to writing techno-thrillers and get new editors!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am an avid fan to TC's past work. I think every novel up to and including Executive Orders was fabulous. Rainbow Six was a drag and Bear &amp; Dragon is UNREADABLE.I am reminded of a once incredible athlete who has played about two seasons past his prime. We see this all to often. Tom, please just retire rather than subject us to another one of these. As it stands, TC has gone from my buy the hardcover first week it comes out list to wait for the paperback. If the next one is this bad, he has squeezed his last penny out of me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book was not the best one that Clancy has written but not his worst either. He does a great job showing the reader how the military work and also the political side. The Chinese at times are shown a little too one dimensional but I have no problem with that. The last 200 pages are excellent in showing the US military in operation. As my title of this review state an editor would have been nice. The book runs too long at times and sometime it is repetitive on some issue. Such as the constant fixation of the CIA agent's &quot;sausage&quot; and Russian prostitution. I also agree with some reviewers that Ryan whining as President gets tiring. But overall the book is very good but not perfect. I also have no problem reading a long book but I do like them tidy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A few days after Sept. 11, I bought Tom Clancy's novel from 2000, The Bear and the Dragon, as a relatively painless way to learn the current state of American war-fighting technology. It ends with a detailed description of how 21st Century American air power pulverizes a Chinese armored invasion of Siberia. I finished it and said, &quot;Okay, we're obviously going to crush the Taliban from the air. No problemo. (My biggest worry then became that the Taliban would hand over Osama to us before we could devastate them, which we had to do in order to encourage the other regimes to not allow anti-American terrorists to operate from their territories.) I was incredulous when so many pundits decided around Nov. 1st that the Taliban were winning. &quot;Don't they know anything about our current air power? Don't they read Tom Clancy novels?&quot; A week later, of course, the fearsome Taliban threw down their weapons and ran into the hills, screaming like little girls. The answer to both questions about our commentariat I realize now is &quot;No. They didn't know anything about military technology and a big reason was because they hold Clancy in contempt.&quot; Well, now the joke's on them. - Steve Sailer"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I feel that The Bear and the Dragon is a perfect mix between the excitment of battle, espianage, and mystery. It is a wonderful book for anyone who is a Tom Clancy Fan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I didn't like all the f-words he used even when it wasn't called for. I spent 3 yrs in the Air Force and worked in public until retirement and still think filthy talk is uncalled for to get your point over .LOOKS LIKE i WILL JUST HAVE TO QUIT READING HIS BOOKS.ijfishcatcher"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy does it again! While certainly not his best work, this one is in-line with not only the technology of the times, but also with the politics of the time. China breaks out as the real villain in this continuing saga of Jack Ryan and one thread of potential history. Like every Clancy novel, this can be read cover to cover at least once, then reread as an abridged version - just picking out the action parts."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What an incredible book. Even though this book was over 1000 pages it didn't have a dull moment. It also had an ending that will leave you breathless.Also recomended: Blood Covenant By Douglas De Bono. If you like Clancy You'll love De Bono"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wow! It is hard to believe the reviews this book has gotten. I often wonder why some of you people are reading fiction in the first place. I am currently on pg.605 (just a little over halfway complete), and, although I would have to agree with those that said it has taken quite awhile for Clancy to get into the meat of his subject in this book, it has still been very entertaining reading. I am now just at the point where things are starting to heat up, and I'm looking forward to what will soon be happening. True, up until this point, there has been little to no action whatsoever, but I don't mind, because I know it's coming.I think Clancy, just like in many of his other books, really likes to provide an absolutely thorough setting of what's going on prior to the fireworks. True, there are frequent passages that could have been skipped without having any impact on the plot (i.e. OK, Jack, we KNOW you don't think you are cut out to be President, and yes, we KNOW you think of yourself as just an ordinary Joe. So let's move on), probably trimming 50 pages off the total length so far. But I think these sequences just genuinely add to the realistic aura Clancy gives to his stories, and help build character development.I just wish people could read books without the intention of having to disect it from beginning to end. It must not be very enjoyable for them."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although I found some of the same plot elements of Red Storm Rising in this book(i.e. oil attracting an aggressor (neighbor)nation that is economically strapped for cash), I was able to sit down and definitely enjoy this book. I was a bit dissappointed at the predictable usage of Clark and the Rainbow team, but I found the political dynamics, economical considerations, and social/cultural factors at work in the book addictive, and too compelling to ignore. This book was a remarkable piece of fiction that takes a close look at how ideology sometimes gets in the way of what's really important. It could have used a slightly better ending, one that didn't have the ubrupt ending comparable to a roller coaster ride coming to a screeching halt. While the story did have it's peaks, and it's lows, it takes the reader on a fantastic ride nonetheless. Definitely a worthwhile book to read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like all Tom Clancy books, this one is engaging and suspenseful. You'd never guess some of the twists. I picked this book up a week ago Saturday and could not put it down. The plot isn't believeable, but that's one reason you read Clancy - to escape from reality into the worlds he creates. If you like suspense, sharp plot twists, and incredibly detailed technical info, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Either you are a fan of Tom Clancy or you are not. Those who enjoy Clancy are not going to be able to put this book down, as President Jack Ryan faces his biggest crisis as President. The Chinese government is stirring up trouble, in Russia and in trade talks with the United States. An international incident erupts when the Beijing police kill 2 clergymen live on CNN, then are seen again by an international audience oppressing religious freedom. The Chinese go to war against the Soviet Union, not thinking the United States will do anything. The United States, though, goes to the aid of the Soviet Union, who had just been invited into NATO. Two old enemies of the Cold War are now on the same side, trying to avert a Third World War, and then, the book tenses up for an explosive climax. Although a lot of the readers' reviews of this are negative, at best, this book is typical Tom Clancy, and to Clancy fans, it's exactly what the doctor ordered!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This may be the last Clancy book I read, and I've read all of them so far. I want books to beg to be read. Clancy goes into such minute detail about military matters that are not needed that it is becoming a chore to get to the end of the book. I get the feeling that he really wants to write military books, or to truely be military, but enough is enough.This book is over 1000 pages long. Take out the unneeded details (100's of pages) and the excessive bad language and you would have a good readable bestseller."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"when I was thirteen I read The hunt for Red October. From that book on I was hooked onto clancy's writing, most notably the Jack Ryan books, But it would seem that Clancy's ego has grown as large as his books. This book while entertaining is about 400 pages to long. He is certainly stretching for material and needs to end this series with a final book. One that is 1000 pages long. He was at his best when his books were 500 pages or so ."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had really high hopes for this book. Before it came out I knew that it was supposed to have Clark AND Ryan in it, and thought it had great possibilities.However, it just didn't deliver.The language is atrocious compared to earlier books. Clancy must have spent the last few years in the gutter learning how to talk.I really got the feeling that Clancy must be out of new ideas.The book started with the concept of Red Storm: A country goes through a calamity and decides to invade another and take what they want.Then, he delved into the area of Executive Powers and spent a long time talking politics, and ended with a small blitzkrieg.Yawn. I'll test his next book via the library before spending my money."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let's be a little more diplomatic. Clancy is focusing on size first. Lots of stuff happens. If you like diversity of topics, and a lot of it, you'll be pleased.Clancy is like a television writer. Not too deep, plenty to read, you'll still learn a lot, like always. For all those who wanted War and Peace, I have a pretty simple suggestion.Me personally, I take months to read Clancy books. I give myself an hour or so, once or twice a week, and the experience is enjoyable. The point of a thousand page book is not to finish it in a week. A work of this size is meant to accompany you through a season or two.Be warned, though... Clancy books are basically unedited, straight from the man's typewriter. There are some ill effects. Tom Clancy repeats himself a lot in this book. Tom Clancy repeats himself a lot in this book. Everybody calls computers: 'puters. Everybody knows that an ICBM drops 7-8 times faster than a rifle bullet flies through the air. Everybody compares Chinese to Klingons. There are as many references to the 'd' word and 'sausage' as there are paragraph breaks. And yes, everybody uses the word: puke. Ryan doesn't reflect much deeper than: why the 'f' am I here? And Ryan does this a lot. So Clancy doesn't read his own stuff... the dude just keeps typing... fair enough.I could have given a more literary review of this work, but that's not what you are here to read, is it? ;) You're at this page, you're gonna drop the [money], and you know I'm right. Click the order button and get on with it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Sadly, this latest effort is well below the standard of the Jack Ryan series. Briefly.... - It is overlong but then has a rushed conclusion. - Clancy has taken to using characters as little more than mouthpieces for his own political opinions. Come on Tom, if that's what you think then have the guts to say it yourself. A Clancy book on his opinions of modern american politics may offend many readers but at least it would be more honest than doing things this way. - If you are going to refer to the British PM as 'Tony' then don't have him speak like some member of the aristocracy....&quot;I say, old chap, time we sorted out those damn Chinease.&quot; - I'm intrigued...having read all the Ryan novels I dont recall one of his predecessors getting up to the alleged horizontal activities to which Ryan frequently refers; did i miss book somewhere or is someone opinionising again??? - And finally, unless i am totally stupid the Euro does not exist as a tangible currency in Europe yet. There are no Euro notes or coins and won't be until next year. Someone should tell all those Russians who seem to be spending it quite happily."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Just finished it and threw it on the stack of the rest of my clancy collection. Looks to be the thickest one yet, although the stories have changed from &quot;techno-thrillers&quot; to Tom Clancy's view of the politicians of the world. He devotes hundreds of pages to setting up a storyline which is blown through in just a few pages. All and I found it disapointing, longing for the days where Jack Ryan was a small character and Jon Clark wasn't an old grandfather. I think there needs to be a new story line, his first books weren't so closely sequenced, and quite frankly a lot more enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wow, where to begin. How about &quot;Wish I hadn't blown $17 plus shipping on this book&quot;?I have been a loyal reader of Clancy's books from the beginning. Even suffering through dreck like Executive Orders and Rainbow Six; but this is it - probably the last Clancy book I'll purchase.The editing and the plot are weak: I present Exhibit A: numerous inane turns of phrase hammered mercilessly to death, and Exhibit B: completely implausible techie tricks upon which the whole plot hinges.Memo to Tom: &quot;Woulda been prudent to quit after The Sum of all Fears or perhaps Without Remorse&quot;. And lose the Navy ball-cap. Can you say &quot;Wannabe&quot;?Clancy (and editors) obviously believe that readers (such as myself) will buy any piece of junk he publishes. My recommedation: If you really need a Clancy fix, go read The Cardinal and the Kremlin again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Turgid, tepid, tautological, terrible. Predictable, profane, putrid. Chauvanistic, racist and reactionary claptrap by a Clancy who has exceeded his use-by date. Success has obviously bred contempt for his readers. Thank goodness it was a present - it's only unfortunate that my son wasted his money on this dreck."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's previous works. I was disappointed with this one. Previous reviewers have expressed my views up very well: this book is repetitive, polemical, self-indulgent and *way* too long. Disabling the cut-and-paste ability of Mr. Clancy's word processor would have improved this novel greatly.Is Mr. Clancy really writing these novels anymore, or has he sold the franchise? It is difficult to believe that this is the same author who wrote 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Red Storm Rising'. The poor editing of late makes me wonder if the credit for these earlier should really go to Mr. Clancy's editors of the time.I deeply regret buying this book. I won't buy his next."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I give. After taking 1028 pages to tell a 350 page story, I wave the white flag of surrender. Clancy clearly doesn't trust his reader base to remember characters from one book to the next. Hence, ever expanding tomes of work. We all know who Ryan is and how he got there. We Jackson, the Foleys, Sandbox and the rest. Why retell all their stories. There was a great story buried in this novel. They say the devil is in the detail and Clancy shows us hell. The only reason I finished the book was to write this review. I'd give it a zero but not an option. Isn't he supposed to have an editor to save him from himself?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Have read all of the Jack Ryan and/or John Clark books and enjoyed most of them immensely. This latest, however, was a major disappointment. It continues to pull down a formerly refreshing character. I understand that reality does not always present us with perfect heroes and Jack Ryan previously was probably a bit too good to be true. I am sorry to see a character I liked becoming far more crude with each of the latest books. The Ryan character (and the personal character he exhibited) used to pull me through a lot of the technical material that went somewhat over my head. No longer. I will not likely purchase any future novels by Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I wish I could give negative stars. I am somewhat compulsive and always finish an entertainment book even if I don't like it after a few hundred pages, but I couldn't wade through more than 200 pages of this droner. With each of the last 3 Clancys I promise myself, never again, but then I find myself in an airport or something needing a page-turner. This isn't it. I got thru about 200 pages of this and threw it away in disgust. The biggest sin is inserting dead prose (and to my mind brain-dead) political screeds in the middle of scenes. The conversation or action pauses for a page or more while he rails against abortion or for the honor of military men (which counts him out, of course). If it's not a political screed, it's a tin-ear (and often inaccurate in the areas I'm knowledgeable about) explication of technology or military structure, or Chinese history, or... I could put up with the right wing ranting if it didn't break the story so badly. The next biggest sin is the god-awful dialogue. Try reading one of his &quot;character's&quot; words aloud, go ahead, I dare you. Tell me with a straight face that any human would ever speak like that. Swearing is just an obvious clunker - I'm not opposed to swearing per-se, and probably swear as much as anyone, but these &quot;characters&quot; swear like seventh graders, plopping inappropriate obscenities in the conversation like loogies on the gym floor. I could go on (Clancy would) but I'll leave it here. With a good editor, there may be a worthwhile 400-500 page novel in here somewhere, but I'll never know."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let me begin by saying that with the exception of Executive Orders, I find Tom Clancy's writing to be excellent. After a Japanese kamikaze in a jumbo jet elects Jack Ryan President a la Executive Orders, Clancy begins character development of Ryan's family which lends little to the whole SPY/Military/Political novel. This trend seems to worsen in B&D. Who cares about Ryan's kids? They aren't part of the story in B&D yet they keep on surfacing to detract from the real plot. Secondly, anything liberal in Clancy's world is wrong and misguided. Although I consider myself conservative, He is not fair to the liberal points of view in his portrayals of liberal characters. They are always sanctimonious and smug without any redeeming qualities. 1 or 2 characters of this ilk would be fine without painting ALL of them as such. Finally, there are a few serious historical errors. Example-Russian tanks being built in 1946 to fight the Germans. The main plot line was pretty good (if he could just stick to it) although it was somewhat of a... of Red Storm Rising. He has done better work for sure, I would have liked to edit this book (I doubt I'm the only reader who has had this thought)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon novel was a success because it was one more Clany novel I couldn't put down. There was one point, though, I had to stop and check the cover to make sure some one hadn't slipped me a Harold Robbins book. Clancy's books are read by those who love his techno-babble and the action connected to it. If I wanted to read about &quot;Japanese sausage&quot;, and excessive trash talk, I would have picked a different author. I am disappointed with Jack Ryan's turning into such a hot headed potty mouth. It is unfortunate Mr. Clancy fears his book can't stand on its own merit, that he must infuse it with excessive vulgarities to sell.As usual Mr. Clancy has used technology to his best advantage and given us all a thrill of feeling like we are there. I just don't know if the negatives out weigh the positives."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I can't believe how long this took me to get through. And I can't believe this is the same author of Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. Rainbox Six was a pretty rough read, but this one has it beat by a mile. Don't expect any real action before, say, page 750 or so, and even then it's tame. Do expect extremely long and boring dissertations by Jack Ryan as to why he hates being president. And lectures by his friends as to why he should be. Do expect everyone to know everyone else. Nary a character is mentioned that Jack or Robbie or someone else doesn't &quot;know&quot; or has &quot;heard of.&quot; Avoid spending your money on this massive, yet boring, book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the last Jack Ryan book I will read. Clancy has dropped below my acceptability threshold. From an interesting premise and apparently reasonable research, The Bear and the Dragon becomes unacceptable by page 50. The most annoying aspect of this book was the quality of writing. The literary quality in Red October was acceptable -- not in John Le Carre's class, but acceptable. Long, torturous sentences, some simple grammatical errors, repeated cliches, and over-elaboration all combine to make a difficult read. I have to wonder if Mr. Clancy's editor has become intimidated by his success and refuses to confront him. And I also have to wonder if his success hasn't left him arrogant. I know that the adjective that first comes to mind when I see the stock picture of him (on the back of the dust jacket) is 'arrogant.' The ending is weak and incomplete. It was a let-down, after the work of getting through a book with an interesting premise, inadequate development of plot, poor and sloppy writing, to be given such an ending."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"... or was it one of the net force writers? I loved the first 7 books in this series, so I tried one of the Net Force stories (Tom Clancy's XYZ, written by John Q Doe). I hated it. The story was ok, but the writing, which distinguishes, or at least used to distinguish, Clancy from other authors in this genre, was mediocre at best. Which made sense - Clancy didn't write it.The Bear and the Dragon leaves me with this same bad taste in my mouth. You'll find an unusual expressions uttered by one character and then repeated by a different character whithin pages of the first utterance, but then never again. Swear-words fly at an ungodly rate and temper tantrums are frequent (in general the characters are represented as too volatile to be believable.) And the really sad thing is, the book is a chore to read. Too much build-up, too little execution.I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon was not a bad book. The only problem in my opinion was that it built every thing up and then didn't deliver. I love the way Clancy starts with several subplots that slowly combine and interact with each other resulting in one final confrontation. In this book that didn't really happen. Other reviewers seem to think the book was too long, I personally thought it ended a little too quickly. Maybe Clancy should cut out some of the building up and give us a more satisfying final conflict and resolution. Still, it's a good read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It is amazing that there's anything left to add after 736 reviews, but here goes...First, I went ahead and read the thing despite all of the trash talk on this page. I took everyone's advice and skimmed the middle part. Having done that, the book wasn't half bad. I think the cries of &quot;racism&quot; are overdone. Certainly there were a few racial slurs tossed around. But that is something present in every one of Clancy's novels--probably for the simple reason that such words ARE used by MANY people, particularly in wartime, when demonizing the enemy is considered natural. (In fact, many of Clancy's protagonists use such slurs to describe themselves....) The battle scenes were well done. I cannot speak for accuracy, given that I am not a soldier, but they were done well enough to hold my interest &amp; credulity. The premise--Chinese attack on Russia--is plausible enough from an historical perspective. And the crusty old Great Patriotic War sniper was an excellent minor character. That being said, I think that the portrayal of Zhang and the rest of the PRC leaders was rather one-dimensional. In his other works, there was more character development--even Sean Miller from Patriot Games got better treatment, and he was just a minor-league thug when it came right down to it! Second, the whole war plot thing, well, Clancy has it down to a formula and it is getting tiresome. Evil Bad Guy Enemy Leader decides to wage war on innocents to take their oil/destroy their alliance/avenge himself. Thanks to the byzantine nature in which politics in the Enemy Country are done, he is able to manipulate the government to get his way. Moderate Enemy Government Official tries to dissuade Enemy Leader, but is pushed aside and reluctantly goes along. EVeryone is scared of him, so his underlings tell him what he wants to hear, rather than the truth. America's plucky intel people twig to the plot too late to stop it from happening but with enough time to sound the alarm. American technology and skill triumph on the battlefield, the bad guys ponder using nukes, but before armageddon can be unleashed, Moderate Enemy Government Official sees his chance, ousts Enemy Leader with the help of (or at least, in the name of), The People and sues for peace. Just seems tiresome. And, may God forgive me, but I was actually rooting for the ICBM to hit the U.S....would present an interesting problem to solve....Third, the novel was decent at 1100 pages. It would have been good at 800 pages. It could have been GREAT at 500.Fourth, contrary to what Clancy has Zhang opine in this book, Ralph Peter's RED ARMY was a novel about a NATO/Warsaw Pact war in which the Commies won....and after only three days, no less!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found this book to be terrible. I am fan of Tom Clancy ever since reading Red Storm Rising and Hunt for Red October over a decade ago.This book seems to have no basis in reality at well. His description of China and its people are off the wall. It is obvious that Tom Clancy has never been to China or interacted with its people based on this book. I have been to China about 8 times in the last year and visit places as varied as Beijing to Guangdong to Kaifeng to Suzhou to Shaolin.Tom Clancy has this distorted view of China..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"One of things I've liked about Tom Clacy's books is their realism: military, political, diplomatic. And I've appreciated how well researched his books usually are.BUT, he's gotten really lazy, in my opinion. While the military scenes are up to his usual standards, his portrayal of diplomats in general and American diplomats in specific is nothing short of insulting. If they were really as inept as Clancy would have us believe, I'd start building a fall-out shelter ASAP. His portrayal of White House crisis decision making is just about as bad: simplistic, adolescent-minded characters who see everyone else as thugs with too much testosterone.But worst of all is Clancy's portrayal of Communist China, which has undergone tremendous changes in the last 20 years (and still has a long ways to go) as if it were frozen in time, circa 1980(and this story is supposed to take place in the near future, not the past). Unfortunately, I'm afraid that too many people will think Clancy's imaginary China is the real one. If so, it will prove to be as irresponsible as it is ill-informed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had waited the two years necessary for the next installment of Clancy's writing with baited breath, eager to find out what had happened since I last had an opportunity to spend time in his novels. Unfortunately, I will not be waiting so eagerly next time.This book stunk. Clancy was terribly unfocused. Characters would state a single line of text, only to go into 2-3 pages of retrospect about what that person thought or background on that person's reason for existence. It got so long and uninteresting that I actually read three other books (Preston/Lincoln novels - very good!) while in the middle of \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\".Another reason I felt this book was horrible was the action didn't really start until around page 780 (of a &gt;1,000 page book). And even then, the war scenes that so impressed me in Clancy's last books were dry, unimaginative and very slow moving. Hardly worth the wait!Finally, I don't remember Clancy's other books being so foul mouthed and lacking in morals. Hardly a page goes by without multiple uses of the &quot;F&quot; word, and to top it off, the last sentence of the book brought rather disgusting imagery to mind.For Clancy's next book, please do something original. I am tired of how much Ryan hates the presidency. Do something original - this series is DONE!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If one wanted to read Mr. Clancy's views on everything from Social Security to proper discourse between nations in the new world order, then this is the book for you. If you already follow news or get a daily paper and don't feel like being preached to for eight or nine hundred pages, then move on."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used to love Tom Clancy as an author. I waited months to get my copy of the Bear and the Dragon. I even went to a bookstore across the street from my job, stood in a long line and got Mr. Clancy to sign my copy. After reading about 190 pages or so, I threw the book, with autograph, in the trash. This was one of the worst books that I have ever opened. The profanity, vulgarity and explicit sex scences were too much for me. I could also mention the typos and the strange languge, i.e., &quot;honey-bunny.&quot; This was not a good book! I am sure that some could argue that I should have completed the book before I formed his opinion. Believe me, I tried. However, when Mr. Clancy had Mary Pat use a vulgar four letter term for the male sex organ, I knew I was through. This was the third time the term had been used. Needless to say, this is my last Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"\\"This is Clancy at his best - and there is none better,\\" is written in the book description on the dust jacket. I can name many authors such as Harold Coyle and Michael DiMercurio, who consistently put out much better material than this long, contrived, repetitive waste of time and paper.The Bear and the Dragon is basically a combination of the plots in Red Storm Rising, Debt of Honor, and Executive Orders, just with different antagonists and updated military equipment. For the entire book I felt like I was reading chapters that I had already read in his previous novels. In addition, the book was so predictable that I knew at around page fifty how and why the war would begin, and how the winners would go about achieving victory. Needless to say, I felt it was a chore to read the remaining 975 pages, and I am very surprised that I willed myself to finish the book.It seems to me that Clancy stopped writing good books when he got to Debt of Honor. I did not think he could write something worse than that, but he just did. I do not mind an author inserting their political beliefs into a novel, but the way the entire story was written makes me question whether Clancy intentionally meant to expound his right wing ideas and make writing a techno-thriller his second priority.I also felt that Clancy's book came very close to plagiarism. With a couple differences, Eric L. Harry basically wrote the same book two years ago when he published Protect and Defend. Stephen Coonts also wrote a similar book, Fortunes of War, except Japan is the antagonist instead of China. The basic plot is the same. Combined, the two similar novels are still over a hundred pages less than the unoriginal The Bear and the Dragon.If you have not read this book yet and are pressed to do so, get it from the library, as it will be an incredible waste of money to buy it. It would also be a waste of money to buy this book in paperback at a used book sale for a penny. The library is the way to go, and I am glad I went there.By the way, the misleading quote on the dust jacket should be changed to, \\"This is Clancy at his worst - and there is none worse.\\""},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I WAS a big Tom Clancy fan until I read this book. His last couple of books have been getting less gripping and readable, but this sets a new standard for poor writing. It is just plain bad--and very boring. He must now publish books without an editor--there is a lot of repetition (like every scene between Jack and Arnie) and other scenes just go on endlessly. He used to have a lot of good detail that used to make any poor writing more palatable--and actually one of the great, distinct items of Tom Clancy's books, but now he has also gotten lazy. There are some hints of interesting classified information, but Tom must have lost all of his contacts in the government and has replaced this detail with horrible caricatures of foreigners and his biased political views. Time is better spent re-reading Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Cardinal of the Kremlin. Do not read this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The last time I tried to read a Clancy book, I put it down half way through it, never picked it back up; finally gave it to a friend who wasn't able to read it either. This book is about the same way - i'm into it about 250 pages and it is BORING, BORING, BORING. I can't think of anything good to say, so i'll stop here. I won't waste my money again buying another Tom Clancy hardcover. He goes on the list with Patricia Daniels Cornwell and Ann Rice."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm sorry. I've bought and read every one of Clancy's books since his first, the Hunt for Red October. But the more years that pass, the less I like his work. Even Executive Orders was a chore. I was in a bookstore recently and compared his books to War and Peace, and his are longer. I mean seriously, can't it be done better? His stories are pretty good. But his way of telling them has become tedious and now, for me, unendurable. Way too long, way too jerky (from one story line to another, many of which just don't matter), and ultimately dark and humorless. I'm done. No more Clancy for me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was disappointed when the publication date of this long awaited book was delayed. I am now sorry that I ever bought it. I have read all of Tom Clancy's books but this one. I have had it for over a month and am on page 100. It is filled with rambling drival. Jack Ryan shouldn't have run for reelection. I do not think that I will ever buy a hardback of a new Clancy again. Paperbacks will have to come from the half price store. This appears to be the sad end of a brilliant writing career."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has obviously reached the point in his career that he can tell them to publish whatever he writes without any input from an editor. The book should have been hundreds and hundreds of pages thinner. It became embarrassing to read all of the \`Ryan as Clancy's mouthpiece' regarding various \`morality issues' that had little or nothing to add to the storyline. Even then, the same things were said, over and over again. Does he think his readers are so stupid that he has to drill his thoughts into their heads?The only way to get through the entire book is to skim the pages and pages of text that has nothing to do with the story. If someone actually reads every page, I would have to say that they to much time on their hands. I wish I had read a review before I purchased the hardback edition. Otherwise I would have waited for the paperback edition. I could only recommend this to diehard Clancy fans that feel the need to read everything he has ever written.I hope the reviews sink in. I really enjoyed his previous work. Maybe he can return to that level of quality in the future."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What I thought I was getting when I picked up a copy of this book was a typical Clancy techno-thriller; tight, suspenseful, and satisfying, with &quot;could-be&quot; world conflict scenarios, high-tech weaponry and spycraft, and maybe a glimpse of Armageddon before a tidy win for the good guys.Instead what I got was bludgeoned over the head with some of the most jarring, heavy-handed conservative diatribe since...well, the last time Pat Buchanan said anything.We all know of the author's political sympathies, and generally, it's not kept me from swooping down on his new material...but in this book, it's glaring, mean-spirited, and smacks of racism and xenophobia. Even if you could care less about politics, it's distracting enough to take away from what would otherwise be a great story.The story deals with events leading to the discovery of oil and gold in a previously unexplored part of Siberia, which promises financial salvation for Russia. Unfortunately, the Red Chinese are having financial problems of their own, and aren't above a little subterfuge to take advantage of a weakened post-Cold War Russia.The United States, under the bold (and increasingly whiney - why did he run for re-election?) leadership of President Jack Ryan, catches wind of the scheme, and before you can say &quot;Yippie-ki-ay&quot;, jumps into the fray...after 700 pages or so.The book bogs down halfway through in long, slow tracts of dialogue, and rehashed narrative. Some of the characters seemed almost parodies of themselves, particularly the Chinese ministers that are drawn so outrageously, you expect to read about them stroking their mustaches and cackling evilly.There are a few subplots that eat up too much paper, and I found I was skipping ahead quite a bit to get to some more meaty sections.Overall, the story was good, but the book really suffers from poor (and perhaps nonexistent) copy editing, repetition, and above all, the tiresome right-wing proselytizing. It's about 500 pages too long.If you're a diehard fan, by all means, read this book. If you dabble in Clancy novels, be warned: there are much better ones than this."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Very disappointing, in fact. First of all, this book is HUGE and you need a notepad handy at all times, in order to be able to follow the plot. I agree that the book sounds like a family reunion, but what the heck happened to Jack Ryan? From a believable and likable guy, he became a foul-mouthed wimp! I am sure that POTUS does not need to use language like that to get his message accross. As far as the ending goes, what happened? It looks like TC ran out of paper/memory/patience and just stopped. Or he decided to end our misery?This is not even close to his previous books. A thoroughly disappointing read, especially to all Jack Ryan fans, who anxiously waited to see what happened next."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This not as much a review as it is a warning.The Bear and the Dragon is by far the worst book Clancy has ever written. Rainbow Six could be excused by being in reality a backstory for a computergame, but this is supposed to be a novel. Now Clancy has never been an expert user of metaphor, simile, charcterization or even grammar (I'm neither, but then I'm not a native speaker) but he's always been worth reading because of his knowledge of politics, technology, military and his intelligent plotting.This is sorely lacking in this novel. The Sum of all Fears was the best Ryan book - The Bear and the Dragon is the worst and hopefully last. 800 pages of boring build-up to 200 pages of predictable warfare. Throw in some old friends, some small twists and a bit of Rainbow Six and you have this book.If you enter all of Clancys books into a computer, and ask it to write a new Jack Ryan novel, The Bear and the Dragon would be the result. Consider yourself warned."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"My wife is not a Tom Clancy fan. She typically takes that same condescending attitude towards Clancy that I reserve for her liking of Krantz or Steele. I mention this because I put Tom in the same category as Danielle or Judith. You read their stuff not because you expect to be enlightened, but because they are fun to read, and typically not to taxing on the brain pan.So with great pleasure I sat down around 6pm last night and began to read \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\". At around 11, my wife looks over and sees that I'm almost 2/3 the way through the book. She knows that I'm not a graduate of Evelyn Wood and asks: \\"How can you be so far along?\\" I reply that typically Tom spins at least on subplot that I usually have no interest in, and on the first go through I skip over subplots that I don't like. I tell her that the trouble with his latest is that in this book, I pretty much have no interest in any of the subplots.There is no heart in this book. When Clancy was at war (declared or undeclared) with the Russians, you could tell that under it all he had respect for the Russians. They were a worthy opponent, and even though we always won, it wasn't in the bag from the get go. In this one, there is no respect for the \\"ChiComms\\". I think I counted repeated use of 10 different racial references to them. Clancy also used a number of irritating Star Trek\\" references (\\"what would Commander Spock do?\\" \\"The Chinese are Klingons\\").There is some good stuff in here. The battle scenes are typical Clancy. The ending is exciting but very hackneyed, abrupt, and unsatisfying.On the whole, I think there are 200 pages of great stuff and 750 pages of boring filler. In other words, the exact opposite of what you typically get in a 1,000 page Clancy novel.I wish he'd spent less time in Moscow, in Beijing, and more in Siberia and drawing out the ending.I'd also like someone to explain to me why Chet needed to get Ming to install the \\"Trojan Horse\\" in the computer after he sold it to he. Why not install it before it was delivered? Oh well...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a Clancy fan since Red October, which I loved, and I've enjoyed many of his books since. But he is on a downward spiral, with quality decreasing in direct ratio to length. His characters, who used to be human beings with real lives and conversation, are now cardboard cutouts who mouth military jargon and acronyms, and talk about a WWII macho myth of honor and courage which few of them ever demonstrate. Even Jack Ryan has become a puppet, and many the older characters (e.g., Bart Mancuso) have lost all their juice.TC's plots used to be gripping and complex (I was disappointed that the movie of Red Oct. left out so much of the book), but they have degenerated into a disjointed melange of military strategy and weapons deployment that I can't bring myself to care about. Perhaps there is a reason that none of Clancy's recent books have made it to the screen.Bear/Dragon certainly doesn't deserve its length -- a real waste of trees. I'm 58 years old, but I found the newest Harry Potter book much more interesting, fun and worthwhile than this doorstop.I'm sorry to say that this is the last time I will hoodwink myself into buying a Clancy opus. I read just one of the counterfeit, ghost written fakes of the Op Center series before realizing that I had been taken for a marketing ride; it's taken longer, but I have arrived at the same conclusion about his (purportedly) personally written &quot;novels.&quot;You can fool all of the people some of the time, and you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool me any longer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am an avid fan of Clancy's books, of Jack Ryan, John Clark, Ding Chavez, and his other recurring characters. I have read every one of his books (and RED STORM RISING was not my favorite). I agree with many who said that the story ended badly, but my biggest problem is that it is the SAME STORY.In DEBT OF HONOR he had the Chinese angling to take over the &quot;Northern Resource Area&quot; in Russia by conspiring with some Japanese business leaders and the Indians to weaken the US. In EXECUTIVE DECISION he had the Chinese angling to take over the &quot;Northern Resource Area&quot; in Russia by conspiring with the Iranians and the Indians to create religious instability in Russia and weaken the US. Now, in THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, he has the Chinese simply attacking Russia to take over the Northern Resource area.At least in the other two books, Clancy had something original to say. In DEBT OF HONOR he demonstrate the vulnerability of US financial markets to enemy attack and the link between economic interests and national interests. In EXECUTIVE DECISION he gives his view of life at the top of the most powerful government on earth, and how that government makes its life and death decisions.But in THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON we get nothing new, not from the story line itself or even from the characters. At the end of this book all our favorite characters are in basically the same positions of responsibility as the were by the middle of EXECUTIVE DECISION (except Robbie Jackson). They faced no new challenges, and received no new development."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm beginning to think that Clancy is this century's Jonathan Swift - that Jack Ryan and his surrounding story is a skeleton that Clancy hangs his political rants on. I get tired of the endless anti-abortion, right-wing demagoguery that has been slowly filling up his books and accelerated with Executive Orders and Rainbow Six. He's a good storyteller who has let his politics poison his books... because the political/social rants REALLY - really - slow down the story.Are there any editors with guts anymore? 200 pages could have been cut from this book with no ill effect."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I travel frequently to Bejing and the decriptions in this book are prefect.....If you were there 10 years ago. how much trouble would it have been to fly to Bejing and actually look around??"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After a long list of right wing idiocy. Clancy has frankly outdone himself with over 1000 pages of a mindless, thoughtless, silly monstrosity. Appealing to lovers of cheap tricks over realism. This is populist trash at its worst."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There were so many things wrong with this book that it is difficult to know where to begin other than to simply give a laundry list of its flaws.1. Poorly researched: Tom Clancy clearly loves the idea of an imperial president who is unencumbered by any constraints such as treaties, international law or the Constitution. In this novel, Jack Ryan commits the US to a war in Russia without even pausing to consider the fact that the power to declare war resides in Congress. Most people who have taken a freshman level Poli-Sci course have at least heard of the War Powers Act or the Constitution. Clancy should probably look these things up. If only to refute them in one of his typical straw-man arguments. The only hint of restraint comes when one character suggests that the NATO treaty does not allow the US to enter the war on behalf of Russia, the alliance's newest member. Ryan dismisses this idea by saying that the NATO treaty means what he says it means. I'm not sure that is the NATO charter and I would guess Clancy could not point it out to me either.2. Clancy needs a thesaurus: I became increasingly annoyed that the only word Clancy seems to know to describe someone who belongs to a different agency of the government was \\"a puke\\". It was almost as annoying as his overly repetitive use of the word \\"whore.\\" Those few times he used the word prostitute came as something of a relief.3. Racial slurs aplenty: It is perhaps inevitable that any novel that depicts a war with China will include the word \\"chink\\". The last third of the book seems to have this word on nearly every page. To break the monotony Clancy occasionally throws in \\"raghead\\" in an allusion to Iranians and his previous novel. Of course, no one bats an eye at \\"chink\\" and when the Secretary of Treasury uses it in a meeting with the President, Ryan's only counsel is to not use that term in front of the press because they would not understand and react negatively. Of course, toward the end of the book Clancy has a Chinese character use \\"monkey\\" to describe an African-American to underscore Chinese bigotry. Clancy never seems to be phased at this inconsistency.4. Poor understanding of history: Early in the book Clancy makes the statement that the US military never fought a war of conquest, rather it always fought wars of liberation. This would of course come as something of a surprise to America Indians who were only liberated of their lands and way of life.5. Jack Ryan is annoying: The Jack Ryan of the earlier books, and movies even, has given way to a Jack Ryan that is a passive-aggressive whiner. Here is the character arc for Jack Ryan in the last two Clancy novels - \\"Why me, why me - just because I am President I don't see why I have to actually talk to other US citizens or take their views into account. I'm stressed give me a smoke. The press [is demanding] - they ask tough questions rather than simply let me do/say whatever I want. I'm stressed give me a smoke. It [terrible]being President when you are an ordinary guy like me - steward bring me some more expensive wine before my wife takes a government helicopter to work as she does everyday. I'm stressed bring me a smoke. I am bound by the Constitution and laws - except when I get ...[upset] then all bets are off. Let's bomb somebody. I feel a sense of relief, bring me a smoke.\\"6. Horrible sex scenes: These were laughably bad, but not too frequent. Although I did get tired of the phrases \\"honey bunny\\" and \\"Japanese sausage.\\"7. Clich&eacute;d characters: Most of the supporting characters in this novel are little more than clich&eacute;s. The main women characters are all fantastic cooks in addition to being world class surgeons or deputy heads of the CIA and all of the Russians drink incessantly without apparent ill-effect. Apparently, Clancy has never heard of successful women who cannot cook, or successful men who can, let alone alcoholic Russians or Russians who do not drink at all. Of course developing actual characters would take away from Clancy's political diatribes or technology descriptions.Overall, \\"The Bear and The Dragon,\\" was a major disappointment. At first, I kept reading it to see if it got any better. By the time I realized that this novel stinks, I was so far in that a perverse sense of curiosity forced me to keep going until the end."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a Clancy fan, have read all of his books, and &quot;Without Remorse&quot; is perhaps my favorite book. But if the Jack Ryan series continues this way, I'm going to have to stop reading. There is entirely too much time spent on the technical detail, with very little character development.Now that Jack Ryan is president, he isn't an underdog, which was the basis of his appeal and heroism. And frankly, there is too much political opinion included with Ryan as president. If I wanted to read about political debate on issues such as gun control and abortion, I'd read the newspaper or watch &quot;Meet the Press&quot; or some other news program. I read for entertainment, and Clancy's Ryan series has been getting less entertaining in the past few installments.Unless you are a diehard Clancy fan, save your money for the paperback, or check this out at the library. And be prepared to be put to sleep by the technical details."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The sheer number of reviews should alert the potential reader that there is something seriously wrong with this book.In it, Jack Ryan changes from an expert in foreign affairs, to a bumbling xenophobic fool, who through his negligent refusal to so much as listen to advice on basic psychology or intercultural relationships, manages to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war.The first 800 pages of the book are a litany of the most disgusting racial vilification that I have ever read, diluted with a mixture of nauseating self-righteous hypocrisy and calls to arm primary school children.Mr Clancy manages to demonstrate a staggering ignorance of China, its people, culture, language, history, and even geography. The linguistic errors, at least, are somewhat understandable. He would have been too ashamed to ask a native speaker to proof-read the manuscript."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Somewhere in this book there is a plot of about 100 pages, surrounded by 900 pages of the worst writing I have ever seen. I don't expect much in the way of characterization or poetry in a Clancy book, but I do expect at least some effort to put together a grammatical sentence. This reads like a first draft, and not a very good one at that. The tortured use of compound and complex sentences was very distracting. I finally got through this book by skipping all the long lectures and going right to the action. And I am neither a prude nor a follower of the cult of political correctness. Nonetheless, the last two words of this novel were as offensive as anything I have ever read. What a major disappointment!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There is a four or five star thriller hiding within this opus, but unfortunately Mr. Clancy has once again occluded his considerable story telling ability with a fog of extraneous plot threads, gratuitous details, and unwelome sermonizing. Robert A. Heinlein, the science fiction dean emeritus, who Clancy has credited with inspiring his own writing technique, once said that there was no book ever written that couldn't be improved by cutting 10,000 words. In the case of Tom Clancy's later works, it should be more like 200,000.I sense that Tom Clancy is so enamored with his own success that he won't let an editor touch his work. This is a shame because he still possesses a genius for crafting an exciting and original thriller, but weighs it down with way too much needless and distracting baggage. Is a techno-thriller really the place to discuss President Clancy's (er, I mean Ryan's) views on abortion rights? For the vast majority readers, I think not. Likewise how many times in a single novel must he use the pejorative &quot;tree huggers&quot; (I counted three)? Didn't he beat up on environmental extremists enough already in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;? Also one reference to the Clinton sex scandal was more than enough for this reader, but apparently not to the author.Tom, you're certainly entitled to your opinions, but please put them in an op ed piece somewhere, not in a supposed vehicle of escapist entertainment. This not-so-hidden agenda on Clancy's part really detracted from my enjoyment of the clever and well plotted thriller that is buried in this book. A thriller not really coming to light until the last three hundred pages of this 1027 page novel. Too bad he didn't spend the effort on extending the thriller instead of the sermon.By the way, the juvenille locker room sexual innuendos get pretty tiresome too. A little of this may &quot;season&quot; the &quot;reality&quot; of the story, but here it's laid on so thick, especially at the White House and cabinet level, as to be totally unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read every novel Tom Clancy has written in his Jack Ryan / John Clark universe. Some of the earlier novels were well written works which I would highly recommend. They were thrillers set in a semi-realistic setting which had just enough realism in them to make them exciting reads. Along the way I become a fan of Jack Ryan. Unfortunately, the series has been in decline as Clancy's political views become more and more omnipresent in the novels. In this book it becomes impossible to read beyond the political editorials. Everyone to the left of Reagan is subject to the wrath of Clancy's pen. While such jabs were subtle in his earlier works (his only real political agenda was increased military) now he takes as stab at every moderate or liberal view ranging on subjects from abortion, environmentalism, taxation and welfare, just to name a few. In the process, he has turned his greatest hero, Jack Ryan into a sniveling whiner who is less capable of running the white house than my 4 year old son.Clancy's problem is that he has strayed too far from the subjects he writes about best, espionage and current military hardware. His is incompetent and fully unbelievable in his writing on Washington D.C. politics and international diplomacy. His descriptions of military hardware are no longer that of present or near future technologies but fall into the category of military fantasy. My \`favorite' was the single bomb which was capable of destroying dozens of Chinese tanks.To make matters worse, this novel is plodding, slow to develop and completely transparent in the direction it is heading. The same ground is covered repeatedly to no effect. The first 600 pages could easily have been edited down to 1/3 that size without loosing a single meaningful nuance. The final third of the story is predictable and obvious. There is no thriller aspect to this story at all. If you put down the book at the point when the Chinese army invades Russia (something we all saw coming after the first 25 pages of the novel) most readers will be able to very accurately guess how the book ends.Clancy has lost whatever skill he once had for writing novels. I have read my last Clancy novel. I would suggest that you skip this one too."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am normally a huge Clancy fan, but this book truly sucked the big one. The characters were all weak and over simple. They were either satan incarnate or a perfect little angel. I've come to expect little from Clancy's characters and it has never really bothered me, but this was attrocious. And the story line. My God it was totally unbelievable. So we go to war with China; I can accept that, but to then destroy what seemed like 700 Billion chinese troops, tanks, and planes while managing to only lose 30 Russians and an American airman or two! Come on! It was awful. My favorite part was where a US plane drops a bomb which turns into 5000 little guided rocket bombs which then proceed to wipe out half the Chinese tanks. PLEASE! It was so unbelievable. We only hit something like 30% of our targets in Desert Storm despite the media showing nice little bunker explosions. And in the balkans it was still just as bad, even worse. Are we to believe that we suddenly posess the ability to bomb w/ a 95% kill rate? Save yourself the trouble and don't by this book. If you already have then burn the book. It'll save you money on firewood and you'll get more out of it by burning it than reading it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was my first Clancy novel and I am glad I got it at the public library. As it was, I had to pay a library fine for the extra days to finish it. It is 1028 pages of slow predictability, laced with too many facilitating coincidences for me to sustain believability, and loaded with characters straight out of Hollywood--pure good guys and irredemable bad guys. I believe that only a 19yr old ring-in-the-nose patriot could stay high on this novel, and then, only if he read it while waiting in line at the recruiter's office.Despite Clancy's incessant asides, attacking one or another facet of American politics or our social mileau, his American characters are all apple-pie. And, interestingly, all the Russian officials in it are positively portrayed, now that Red Oktober's evil empire has disbanded and Russia has knelt before Clancy's altar. Clancy even condesends to to Russia's needs. This book sends America's best to school Speznatz in the ways of counter-terrorism and even gives its blessing to Russia's reconquest of Chechnia. But this book does not let one positive comment about China slip into its thousand pages. Example: of Chinese liquor, &quot;--too vile to contemplate,&quot; p302. Mau-tai is &quot;like drinking flavored lighter fluid,&quot; p310, while munching &quot;fried panda penis,&quot; p321. Compared to Clancy's portrayals, the Temple of Doom served up a burger and fries. Clancy allows his characters to freely use racially pejorative terms, and on one occasion allowed the author's voice to do the same. He beats the dying communist horse tautologically while failing to give credit to the exploding capitalist initiative surging in China. He correctly, but repetitively, suggests that China is tending toward National Socialism, but fails to understand the power of this political development in his portrayal of China and its leaders. His simplism for the sake of creating a bogyman is mirrored in his use of the word &quot;Klingons&quot; as a way of saying Chinese are inscrutably belligerent. They are not Klingons Mr. Clancy. They are Romulans. They have not yet sucked up to the Federation and intend to maintain a fierce sense of cultural independance. Simplifying China into Ming the Mercless is the worst sin of this book. Like all propaganda, it makes its readership underestimate the potential enemy. Speaking of Ming, a key character in this book is a secretary of that name holding a job as sensitive to China as that of President Ryan's cigarette-dispensing protector. But, while it would be inconceivable to read of Ryan's secretary betraying her country, Clancy would have us believe that subversion of those holding China's highest secrets is a piece-of-cake, and penetration of their most classified info. system is a hacker's evening.When the expected war begins on p780, the Chinese are as blunderingly overconfident as a bull in the stemware dept. Many contrived large strategic moves, and small tactical happenings lead inexoarably to China's defeat, but in a very unsatisfying way designed to showcase both America's advanced weaponry and China's supposed total ignorance of it. Can we believe a wartime enemy to be that unaware? That dumb? And that manipulable? Here, Clancy doesn't get it at all, in the way he has the Chinese people respond to Ryan's Naval shelling of the Chinese coast. He has no idea how that would galvanize the Chinese with memories of British gunboats shelling, at will, up and down Chinese waterways in the 19th century. They would not, as in this book, respond with anger toward their government.Other readers have faulted this book on military and technical grounds. My criticism is with its plodding predictability and banal social/historical treatment. I suggest Mr. Clancy read Gary Friedman's treatment of NRA: the novel, &quot;Gun Men.&quot; I put &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; in the same Chicago basement box."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is a relic of the past who is desperately trying to find a well-defined enemy. This novel is simply a rehash of his previous plots, follow a well-worn and time-tested recipe: pick enemy, pick some new top-secret weapons, diplomatic resolution fails, fight and kill enemy, America victorious. In Executive Orders, it was the UIR and IVIS. In Debt of Honor, it was Japan and the F-22 and Comanche weapons. In The Bear and the Dragon, it's China and Dark Star and Smart Pig. It's uninspired, limp, and boring.It's also offensive. Tom Clancy abandons all restraint in his racist portrayal of China, building on the &quot;China = bad&quot; animosity he started in Debt of Honor, assisted by a generous helping of racial epithets by the cast of heroes up to and including Jack Ryan (note that Ryan has never used a racial epithet against an Israeli, Arab, or Russian, but he certainly does in this novel). In particular, he portrays the Chinese as an ethnocentric, unfaithful, and lying people capable of &quot;incomprehensible barbarism.&quot; He constantly compares the Chinese government and its policies to Hitler. He does not even bother with distinguishing between government policy and the Chinese people. In Clancy's lexicon, Chinese people are &quot;slant-eyed bastards&quot; whose &quot;dicks aren't big enough to get in a pissing contest with us.&quot; Racism, even in fiction, is unacceptable.Don't read it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr. Clancy started with Captain Ramius, Jack Ryan, Admiral Greer, and many other \\"people\\" that readers of his work have enjoyed since 1984. With \\"The Bear And The Dragon\\" Mr. Clancy has not only proven he is the master of this genre, he has again achieved the level of \\"The Hunt For Red October\\". Even better, instead of a comparatively quick 387 page read, he has delivered a sweeping 1,028 page saga that includes some of the best writing he has ever done.This book should appeal to many more readers than just those of us who enjoy the \\"Techno Thriller\\" genre. This work has enough of the engineering details about the players in the gambit he has created, but they do not overwhelm the story. The technical narrative is more concise, will appeal to more readers, and does not drop to the level of a tedious multiple page description of an atomic weapon exploding, that an earlier novel subjected the reader to. This book is more refined, the elements better allocated, as to make this an extremely engaging read without the story being dominated by any one element.President Jack Ryan has become a player on Clancy's stage that is better developed than any previous appearance he has made. Mr. Clancy clearly decided to take character development up several notches as well as expanding it to a much larger cast. The First Lady, the Ryan children, and the Secret Service Agents are individuals, not just subject matter to be dispatched with an occasional line.President Ryan is a Chief Executive who is as unconventional as the circumstances that brought him to office. We are allowed inside his thought process and are not relegated to observer status. A visit he makes to \\"Satan's Playground\\" did not need to be in the story, but like the added depth the participants in the story received, Mr. Clancy adds a variety of asides, be they a visit, a conversation, or an impression visually noted.This book is a great novel. This work does not need to have any adjectives like \\"Techno\\" or any other modifiers added to place it in a familiar genre. The book is just one great piece of fiction, and even that word is limiting. I just read the non-fiction work \\"Godfather of The Kremlin\\", Mr. Clancy's work of fiction is anything but imagined when he touches on the same topics.President Reagen commented about the work \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" as, \\"a great yarn\\" if I remember correctly, I wish he could read this work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Overly long review in honor of overly long book:I never thought it would come to this. Tom Clancy has written some of the greatest books of all time. &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; are all time favorites. After &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, his books started to lose a little quality, but they were still an enjoyable read. And then this came out. Wow, what a boring book. It took me over a year to finish this one.Tom Clancy has built up the US Military so much that he is unable to create a powerful enough opponent to make any kind of suspense. We always defeat the enemy is less that 100 pages. Which would be fine, if it didn't take 900+ pages (or 2 Michael Crichton books) to build the plot.The next problem is the editing. There were many scenes and conversations in this book that happened twice. At one point it repeated a section that was building up to something that had already happened. How many time do I have to hear the same turtle joke?There are also conversations and subplots that serve no point and could be removed, allowing us to get to the &quot;grande&quot; finale in a few hundred less pages. There were also section where Clancy seemed to be demonstrating his technical knowledge and personal views. Save those for your Non-fiction books.The next problem is the editing. There were many scenes and conversations in this book that happened twice. At one point it repeated a section that was building up to something that had already happened. How many time do I have to hear the same turtle joke?But as with &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; all would be forgiven with a killer ending. To me, there are times and places to get the best seat in the house, but ground level at the destination of a nuclear missile, any sane man would pass. What Ryan did wasn't heroic, or serve any greater purpose, it was just stupidity. If he doesn't like the Presidency that much, why is he running for reelection? But that's OK, I'm sure he knew ahead of time, as I did, that the last defense missile always works. Come On. That isn't suspense!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wanted: Editor and proofreader to work with noted thriller author. Possession of a nice thesaurus a plus.Tom Clancy is noted for his deep, labyrinthine plots and for taking his sweet time in moving his plots along. At his best, Clancy crafts long page turners with lots of juicy techno-speak and tons of subplots, and he's usually been good at tying all the strings together in a tidy knot at the end. I've found his earlier works a bit wordy, but for the most part enjoyable and gripping. Clancy's best works are like good action movies: not at all deep, but finely crafted and entertaining.This bloated, shallow book, is not Clancy at his best. Yes, it's long. Yes, it has a half dozen miniplots simmering alongside the main thread. The problem is, none of the plots is all that interesting, and they move along at the pace of a snail on strong antihistamines. Plus, it's becoming quite clear Clancy's being paid by the word (or perhaps the pound). It's clear no editor was shown this mess. I found myself almost groaning out loud in parts as entire earlier passages or conversations were repeated almost word for word. This is a novel that would benefit greatly from having a monkey rip out half the pages at random. No matter where it chose to tear, the result would be tighter and it's hard to believe much continuity or plot would be lost.In addition to the unnecessary and tedious word-bloat, there are other annoyances. Mr. Clancy seems to have discovered the four-letter word section in his Oxford English Dictionary. Crude and hollow-sounding profanity laces just about every sentence from every character. The president and his cabinet discuss national security matters mainly by stringing together cusswords and racial epithets. The dialogue comes across as wooden and contrived, like a 10th grader's attempt to write how &quot;adults&quot; speak.The characters, like always, are as flat as Clancy's beloved Chesapeake Bay on a windless day. They all sound and act so much alike that it's difficult to determine who's speaking most of the time. Clancy tries to make up for his inability to craft interesting characters by making them all superhuman. There is harldy a &quot;good guy&quot; in the book who doesn't have 2 Ph.D's, a personal fortune made on Wall Street between gigs at the CIA or FBI, a medal of honor or two, a trophy wife who's a world-class doctor or professor, and a son who's an all-American football player at Florida State who also is a 4.0 honors student in nuclear physics. I've rarely felt so inferior as a human being as when reading this novel. It's fine to have overachievers in your story, but come on. The Bad Guys, on the other hand, are invariably cartoon villians with no humanity. Many are portrayed as perverts. Such amateurish characterization might work better if the plot was non-stop action, but thanks to Clancy's plodding, corpulent page count, we're forced to spend way too much time listening to these ciphers speak wooden dialogue to one another, explaining what we already know for the fourth time.Other parts of the book are simply so strange they're amusing. A US CIA officer in Beijing's seduction of a Chinese secretary takes up a good chunk of the first 200 pages. This smooth operator of a spy buys the Chinese woman several hundred dollars worth of intimate lingerie at Victoria's Secret and presents it to her on their first date, whereupon this shrinking violet immediately models it for him with enthusiasm. This &quot;love story&quot; seems to have been written by the same people that produce porn films. Meet girl, ask her to dinner, give her crotchless panties as gift between the soup and the meat course, hop into bed.On a nitpicky note, there are at least a half dozen typos in the text, words that are spelled correctly but out of context. Obviously the entire proofreading operation consisted of running a spell checker before sending the manuscript off to Printing. This adds considerably to the feeling that the book was written in one draft, unedited, and rushed into publication.The big climax is an invasion by a Chinese army group into Siberia, and in this, Clancy seems to be in his element again, giving us 200 pages of combat and action. But by now we've even read this multiple times before. Pick up Red Storm Rising and reread almost any passage and you'll find the same stuff. The ending is abrupt and feels unfinished. The only release of tension one feels finishing the last page is a kind of relief that the ordeal is over.Clancy is slowly turning into a parody of himself. In fact, if someone wanted to write a first-rate Clancy parody, this book would be a good thing to plagiarize and would need only slight modification. Hopefully this novel is an aberration - something rushed out because Clancy's Sherman tank needed new treads or something. Let's hope his publisher finds a strong-willed editor to work with him next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As an avid Clancy fan since _The Hunt for Red October_, I was almost hesitant about reading this book because I was afraid my expectations were too high after _Rainbow Six_. Fortunately, my fears were completely unjustified! Clancy just keeps getting better and better. I read all 1000+ pages in one day (and night). The entire book was so incredibly suspenseful that I just couldn't put it down. The technology featured in the story is absolutely fascinating. All of my favorite characters from previous books were included, and the newer characters were very well drawn, especially Lian Ming and Nomuri, the CIA spy who seduces Lian Ming into surrendering the contents of her computer...and other things, of course. The inside look at the functioning of the White House is like the TV show &quot;The West Wing&quot; would be if the President were a conservative independent, which is to say it's very entertaining but without the liberal bent. This is an absolute must-read for Clancy fans and a great first-time choice for those few who still don't see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The long wait for a new book featuring Jack Ryan is over. This book, long and filled with multiple subplots, is classic Tom Clancy. Of course, Clancy's books are not literature at its best, but they are thrilling reads with some food for thought about politics, the military, world relations, and various other topics.If you have read and enjoyed the previous books that feature Jack Ryan, you will be happy with this new installment. Favorite characters from previous books are back. Once again, Clancy's forays into many topics provide great inspiration for thinking about the presidency and politics, especially in an election year (even if you do not always agree with Clancy's personal politics).This is a fun read. While some of Clancy's early books are tighter and better reads, this one will satisfy hungry fans."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As an avid Clancy fan, I have to express great disappointment with his most recent release. Although the core of the story is quite entertaining, it proves impossible to ignore both his repetitive use of comments and attention catchers as well as the poor editing.As I read the book, I kept feeling distracted by deja-vu, knowing that Clancy had used a particular zinger 100 pages back. I understand that it is common to reiterate facts and review conversations, especially in the genre, but Clancy has historically been known for executing review in such a way that it feels new as you read it.I feel like he wrote half the book; took a hiatus, then wrote the second half while reusing a sheet of comments and notes he felt he had to include. There is an amnesia to the structure of the book that we should not expect to see in a work from an author of Clancy's skill and reputation; one that any competent editor would have both caught and corrected.The book is also a disappointment in its conclusion. I will not give away the story line, but suffice it to say that I got the feeling that Clancy got bored or hit his page count objective and decided to wrap the book up quickly. After taking his characteristic time to provide well-developed characters, plots and subplots he takes a Hollywood approach to the conclusion and wraps everything up with some unbelievably QUICK strokes of the pen. I found the conclusion more far fetched than the ending of Patriot Games.The book is definitely worth the read and would I would be less critical if I had not come to expect the highest of quality from Clancy. He misses on this one it that respect.Let's hope that it is not indicative of the titles to come. I would hate to see him start releasing the first draft slop that other successful authors such as Stephen King have adopted over the past years. With fame and success comes an obligation to deliver on your reputation, not get lazy because everyone will buy your book just because of your name."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been reading Clancy ever since his first book, as many have, but have never found any of his books actually annoying. This one was. I live in China, speak Chinese, and have become familiar with the culture and motivations of the country. Mr. Clancy has clearly done none of this. His attitude towards the Chinese, when not misguided, badly informed or based on some warped brand of racist guesswork, is frequently insulting. For the information of his readers, the following points should be considered, and then compared to Clancy's latest spoutings...Books such as this, particularly as popular as this one will undoubtedly prove to be, do nothing to improve East-West relations. A far better understanding of the Chinese is required, and the West needs to engage in careful and intelligent study of the history and culture of the country in order to gain a deeper insight. The Chinese are far more similar to Westerners than you might believe, and have a righful mistrust of the Americans. If the sentiments described in this book reflect those of the American public at large, then the Chinese are right to be concerned."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Simply stated - what an awful book! The initial sequence grabbed my attention and proceeded to smash my hopes to bits.A number of items really irritate me about Clancy's work and this book contained all of them, and then some. Here are some examples - does any American in any virtual Clancy battle EVER get killed, or at least injured? Will Jack Ryan EVER realize he's the president and deal with it? Do real people really talk like that? Why are the Russians and Chinese way more interesting than ANY of the Americans? Why do dozens of Spetsnaz officers take a bullet but Rainbow Sixers walk off into the sunset and the next novel?I cannot explain the number of times I was ready to put the sleeve back on the book, drop it on my shelf, forget about it forever, only to remind myself that I paid money for this thing and better finish it off. And when I was done reading it? Furious! This book was a reunion of fellow Clancy character alum's getting back together for, hopefully, the last time. Explain to me - why do you take compelling characters, like Ryan, Robbie Jackson, Clark, Chavez, et. al., drop them into a convoluted plot(?), mix them all up so they all talk marine-speak, strip every bit of dignity from them, and expect us to care if they live or die? I cared more for the poor Chinese soldiers and politburo members in this book than ANY of the characters I've grown to know during the last 10 years.And finally, as if all of the above weren't enough to drive me to drop Clancy once-and-for-all, I had this book figured out after about 100 pages!Tom, unless you can come up with another beauty like 'Without Remorse', I won't feel sorry leaving you at all."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy books used to mean international intrigue, interesting expositions on foreign policy and liberal amounts of high tech military hardware. In Clancy's latest work, Bear and the Dragon, the author uses the character of Jack Ryan as a mouthpiece for (seemingly) Clancy's own critical view on every aspect of US domestic politics. This novel, which is 1,100 pages, is overburdened with long stretches of wooden dialogue between Ryan and his Chief of Staff, Arnie van Damm where Ryan, the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington-type political neophyte, is given extended civics lessons designed to highlight the necessary evils of politics. This is done in a pseudo-Socratic dialogue which is numbingly boringThe upshot is, Ryan is becoming unbearably whiny and annoyingly preachy. Second, are we actually supposed to believe that he could continue to be so naive after 15 months in the Presidency. Third, and most importantly, these poorly written dialogues (between Ryan and van Damm and other pairs of characters, such as Mary Pat Foley and Ed Foley) do not advance the story even a tiny bit. I had a very difficult time forcing myself to continue reading this book. Please, Mr. Clancy, next time stick to the story and save the civics lesson for some other forum."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has produced another weighty tome (1028 pages) this time around, and I definately enjoyed the story.I do, however, have a few gripes about this book:1) Mr. Clancy spends rather a lot of time ramming his political views down his readers' throats--for example, we are told (at some length) that he's anti-abortion, pro-Taiwan, pro-military, anti-environmentalist, etc. There are also some barely-concealed barbs about the Lewinsky scandal. Personally, if I want a political commentary, I'll buy one--I don't want it foisted on me when I'm just reading a fun story.This political commentary is a fairly radical change from previous books--while you do get some ideas about Mr. Clancy's political views in other books, it's nowhere near as blatant as in this one.2) This book reads as if it was rushed to press. There are several disconcerting repetitions (i.e. using the same quote or example to illustrate the same point just a few pages apart). For example, we are told at least twice that the White House Military Office is referred to as &quot;Wham-O&quot; by the people who work there. There are also several typos (so-and-so &quot;faxed over&quot; a docunment, he didn't have it &quot;taxed over&quot;). All in all, it could have done with another fairly heavy-handed editing.3) The characters, especially the women, come across as very wooden. While Clancy's characters have never been all that amazing, they're really pretty bad in this book--you never get a true feeling for any of the players in the cast. For example, Mary Pat Foley (in this book Deputy Director-Operations of the CIA) ends nearly every sentence addressed to her husband, Ed Foley (the Director of the CIA), with the words &quot;honey-bunny.&quot; It ends up coming across as very stilted and rather annoying. The only character that I really identified with throughout the whole thing was Chester Nomuri, a CIA field agent.All in all, this book is definitely worth reading if you're a Clancy fan, but it's not one that I'd recommend to a friend that I wanted to introduce to his work. (I'd probably use Patriot Games or maybe The Hunt for Red October for that purpose.) If you're not a hard-core Clancy fan--as I am-I have first editions of all his fiction--you very well may want to wait for the paperback edition and save yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used to be a big Tom Clancy fan but this book has ruined him for me. I have read all of his books and loved Red Storm Rising, Red October, Cardinal, etc. but I cannot fathom how the same man who wrote those books wrote this over-the-top, [book].It is obvious Clancy knows absolutely nothing about China and did no research whatsoever. I can only hope he farmed this book out to several staff writers and then stamped his name onto it; that would be the only semi-redeeming reason. Furthermore, Clancy's attitude toward and misportrayal of the Chinese in this book makes me seriously doubt his \\"knowledge\\" of Russia and South America in previous books. His portayal of the Chinese is straight out of some 1950's McCarthy proganda film.As so many other reviewers have commented on the tired plot, offensive epithets, Ryan's diatribes and the tediousness of the book, I will only point out some of the inaccuracies and, like a previous reviewer wrote, \\"laughable\\" potrayals of the Chinese that show Clancy has know idea what he is talking about.Even though I read the book 18 months ago, these are some of the things still fresh in my mind:1. The Japanese-American CIA agent's cover job is as a computer salesman. His big \\"in\\" with the Chinese is that he has computers with programs that can actually make 'Chinese ideographs' appear on the screen! This is in the year 2000, remember.- The Chinese have always had computer programs that can type Chinese characters. At least they did when I first went to Taiwan in 1987 and the mainland in 1994. Maybe someone should tell Clancy that Microsoft makes Windows in Chinese.2. The Chinese politburo secretary (Ming) who is seduced by the Japanese-American CIA agent still wears bulky Mao suits.3. Another reviewer pointed out how ridiculous it was that the CIA agent seduces Ming, the Chinese secretary by taking her to a Western restaurant where, Clancy writes, she has the best food she's ever tasted (spaghetti alfredo, I think). Clancy points out this is because it is better than the \\"garbage\\" available at Chinese markets.- Utterly unbelievable4. Clancy also has his agent take Ming to 'Friendship' stores that are off-limits to Chinese. - this might have possibly been true in the late 70s or early 80s but NOT in 2000.5. Ming, a government secretary from Beijing swears at people is some sort of gibberish (\\"Pak Gai!\\"). I can only guess it might be Cantonese but it is definitely not Mandarin.6. The husband of the lady whose 'unauthorized' baby gets a needle stuck into its head is named \\"Quan.\\" Quan is an important character in the book. The problem is \\"Quan\\" is not a Chinese name. It might be Vietnamese.7. I can't even comment on the whole killing \\"unauthorized\\" babies thing. Especially when the soldiers do it in front of a CNN crew.Basically the list goes on and on....."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was totally blown away by Clancy's early work, culminating with Clear and Present Danger. After that, only Debt of Honour has managed to satisfy me. I think there's an inherent problem with the technothriller genre: Clancy was the first to do it and after all of his readers have learned an astounding number of facts and tactics about submarines, tanks, covert warfare, the spy trade etc. There really isn't that much to put in the next book except the same stuff plus the new inventions that were made since last, right? Okay, but the problem seems to be that new tech stuff isn't invented nearly as fast as we can read the books that describe them. And then there's the subject matter, the conflict. Clancy has covered every conceivable type of conflict, some several times and they keep getting thinner. Meanwhile, the books only get thicker, if anything. How come? Well, in this particulat volume we spend lots of time inside Ryan's head, and he's a regular guy all right, his thoughts are extremely shallow, if honest. The dialogue is equally droning and repetitive. Clancy also seems to think that, having exhausted the military tech stuff, his audience will be equally pleased to hear about catholic religion in China, presented in clancy's new droning style. It is all SO boring. I read through it, each night thinking &quot;OK, war's just about to breeak out, tonight's the night..&quot;. And finally, war did break out....on page 700 out of 1000. 200 pages of buildup would have been ample. the worst part for me, though, is not the tasteless product placement on behalf of compaq PCs, victoria's secret's, and Smucker's Marmelade, of all things, not the appearance number 10,000 of Clark and Ding who, as always, sweep aside all opposition all the while repeating themselves endlessly (&quot;Hang a big roger on that, Mr. C&quot;...). no, the worst part is that in this book, the US of A gets it their way from beginning to end. there's no mole inside the US administration (or the security detail, making Executive orders a worthwhile read), no assassination of top ranking CIA officials (a real horror in my favorite Clear and present Danger)...just the Americans using sateiltes, agents literally in the Chinese Politbureau's pants etc., getting everything served on a silver platter....not my idea of a thriller.In short: don't waste your time on this book and, if you must, don't waste your money. You can have mine for free.So sad to witness the continuiing downfall of a once good writer.."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Great storyline. Lousy gratuitous overuse of the F--- word and sexual innuendos galore. Doesn't add to the storyline. Didn't need them in Hunt for Red October and the other early novels...why is it needed now? It's almost as if Mr. Clancy outlines the plot and some of the story, but others did the writing, especially the profanity and the stupid sex angles. Either that, or he's under the mistaken notion that this is what sells. Unfortunate for such a great storyteller. Research on the current China reveals a vastly different picture than the one portrayed by the characters Chester Nomuri and Ming. No one dresses in little Mao jackets in Beijing anymore! It's as modern looking as any big city and probably much more fashionable than Los Angeles these days. Was disappointed that his research on China was so poor. Have also been noticing that this novel, combined with the China incident is creating a backlash against Chinese Americans, much like what happened to the Japanese Americans during WWII. Some of the current talk shows have callers demanding that all Chinese restaurants be boycotted. What?!!? Let's be careful folks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I bought this book hoping for another Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising, but Clancy is getting further and further from what he's good at while delving deeper and deeper into his weaknesses. Yes, he's always written painfully shallow characters; villains of pure evil and heroes of unadulterated virtue. He's always told us what characters were thinking in lame, pointless internal monologues. He's often villified entire countries, and often turned his characters into mouthpieces for his own right-of-Atilla politics.But used to be, this all amounted to a small fraction of the book; the rest relying on his undeniable strengths -- plot and action. This time, we are treated to 700 pages of tiresome egotistical yammering before getting to the final 300 pages of good Clancy stuff. Not a favorable ratio.Most tiresome of all is that Clancy can't seem to imagine a male character going five minutes without mentioning, discussing, or contemplating upon his own penis. Tom, man, this gets very tiresome, very quickly."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First, if you are an english teacher, DO NOT read this book. I'm afraid that you will mark most of it up with your red pen. While they seem to have run it through the spell checker, the grammar checker failed miserably! There are incorrect words on every other page.Second, I have read ALL of Clancy's books. If you read &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; you basically read this book. The USS... I mean PLA needs Oil, we team up with the Germa... I mean Russians to fight the Sovie... I mean Chinese and we use our brand new, secret, ultra high tech weapons to overcome incredible odds.So if I had a choice to read this or &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; again, I would take &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, it's a better read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was not written by Tom Clancy, it was compiled by Tom Clancy. All of the passages in this book comes from all of his previous Jack Ryan novels: there's a sub battle (aka Hunt for Red October), there's economic hardship associated with a country to cause a war (aka Red Storm Rising), there's a spy game (aka Cardinal of the Kremlin), there's a fear of nuclear attack (aka Sum of All Fears), and there are plenty of Rainbow references for you John Clark fans.The plot is completely predictable. If you want to skip to the action, begin reading at about page 750. Better yet, forget buying this book, read or re-read Red Storm Rising and subsitute China for the USSR."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a fan of the Ryan series of Clancy's books for years and eagerly anticipate each new release. Loved the majority of them, including the recent 'Debt of Honor' and 'Rainbow Six'. I don't know what the heck happened here, but B&amp;D falls so far short of the previous work that I can't believe it's Clancy's writing. I mean, do Mary Pat and Ed Foley really need to call each other 'honey bunny' 50 times throughout the book? Do I need to be continually reminded that Mao screwed 12 year olds? I think not. An RPG assassination and then nothing but boring diatribe on the Chinese and repetitive nonsense for the next 700 pages until the action begins. And then it's the usual 'Americans are invincible' Hollywood nonsense. No, I can't believe this is Clancy. I'm sure the next one will be better (right Tom?)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read the reviews before I bought. I should have believed them. Having eagerly awaited the next dose of the Jack Ryan saga, how excruciating to find that Clancy's opinionated view of the world just gets more self-indulgent. It is depressing to see a once capable and pacy writer degenerate into pushing his clumsy ideology on the reader. Fortunately I kept reading and now have caught up with the mind of the great one. America, and Americans, are clearly flawless human beings. Unless they are in public service. Because public servants can only be in public service because they can't hack it in business. All Americans have great relationships even under the highest level of stress in their work. Their wives are always beautiful even in late middle age - their careers are always energetic. American soldiers are peerless - both in their skills and personal qualities. Clearly those who last year ended up captured by Serbia because they couldn't read a map, or who left the action in Kosovo to the British because their lives were too precious to lose, do not exist in Clancy's world. Any dying is to be done by expendable Russians who appear to get the Clancy stamp of approval now they have embraced free-market capitalism. No American is sleazy - or self-serving - or inept - or poor in judgement. How sad when 5 years ago Clancy was offering characters of complexity, and American characters with serious flaws. One then adds to this a turgid and repetitive style and an obsession with coffee - is the author on a fat sponsorship deal and paid every time he mentions it ? The best service anyone could offer potential readers would be a quick summary of the first 600 pages so that readers could get cracking on the action. Because unlike in previous work, where plot and character development were worth reading even when the action level was low, in this case all that 600 pages does is depress the reader at how blinkered the Clancy view of the world has become. By the end I was cheering for the bad guys."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was a long book. A Very Long Book. An Unecessarily Long Book. Three hundred pages into the thing and the reader will still wonder what the basic plot is going to be. In fact, it turns out that much of the main plot is recycled from \\"Red Storm Rising.\\" A country on the brink of economic ruin misguidedly decides that war is the only way of righting a politically corrupt economy; the USA must come to the rescue. However, in Bear/Dragon Clancy is able to bring in most of the characters from his earlier Ryan novels, whether they have a place in the story or not. One gets the sense that this will be the last Ryan gig, and the reader is at times thankful. Have no fear, however. The good guys are almost pathetically good, and the bad guys are one-dimensionally evil.It is a real sign of Clancy's earlier writing prowess, as well as the earlier prowess and power of his editors, that throughout the novel the reader expects a more complicated scenario than the one Clancy eventually presents. Twists that might have been masterfully exploited never appeared (was Nomuri's agent feeding him false information, for example), and nothing in the basic plot will come as a surprise to anyone who has read more than one or two other Clancy works. Another odd dimension to the book was the almost bone-jarring repeated turns-of-phrase. Everyone's \\"been there and done that,\\" \\"seen the elephant,\\" or \\"knows what they're about.\\" Readers may wonder if Clancy has a chalkboard on his wall with a half-dozen macho-sounding stock phrases that he rotates through every 25 pages or so.In short, Clancy recycled one of his own plots, beefed it up with a great deal of interesting techno-babble, even more not-so-interesting political grandstanding, and turned out a 1100 page book that could as easily have been done in 300-500 pages..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I like long books, really. A complicated plot with a host of side characters is a great experience and something only a book can give. This book doesn't give that experience. Despite Tom Clancy's tendency to rehash plots over and over I had high hopes for this book with a premise more realistic than any he previously published. The Chinese and Russians have a long history of border skirmishes and plotting full-blown combat from that history would be simple, right? Clancy instead creates crisis and conflict with simple character flaws, like greed and arrogance and, of course, the tired \\"no one understand how anyone else thinks\\" story arc.The book is like a Kevin Costner movie in more than just length. Every few pages the story stops cold to preach a sermon, in two cases literally: The Chinese are child molesters! Abortion and Atheists are EVIL! These sermons pop-up again and again so often they are the main thing I remember from the book and do nothing to embellish or advance the plot.Some sub-plots and minor characters seem to be thrown in for no reason but to lengthen the book. There's an entire assassination sub-plot with a dozen characters, over a hundred pages or so and comes to nothing. The would-be assassin is quietly arrested nowhere near the target, the end. Other characters from previous books, such as Bart Mancuso from \\"Red October\\" seem to be thrown in just to show they're still alive. Even John Clark seems tacked on although he is pulled out for a pivotal role at the very end. The worst character treatment is Jack Ryan. Gone is the smart and occasional brooding Ryan, it now brooding Ryan 24/7, who spends almost all the book sneaking cigarettes from his secretary, whining how he hates being president or why can't the Chinese have Western sensibilities.There is some of old Clancy here though. When the real action finally gets started in the last third of the book, Clancy's gift for describing military action and maneuvers in detail comes out. I'm not interested in giving away too much here but the last third makes up (barely) for all the preaching, whining and useless sub-plots of the first two-thirds.I think part of the problem is move away from Jack Ryan as the central story-moving character. Having Ryan stuck in the Oval Office prevents that and Clancy could have introduced another character to fill the void but didn't. The resulting story is disjointed with a large cast each moving story along a little bit. My personal uninformed opinion is Tom Clancy needs a strong editor who can trim stories like this down to a healthy size and pace."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"1 starsIn three of his last four books, Clancy is getting an awful lot of mileage out two sources - plagiarizing his early [and best] novel Red Storm Rising, and the fertile manure pile of his person political philosophy. The former, in moderation combined with a bit of new material, makes for somewhat interesting reading, especially for those who have not read RSR, Executive Orders or Debt of Honor. The latter source makes for painfully boring, annoying prattle.The Bear and the Dragon is over 1,000 pages long, which is easily double or triple the length that it should be given the plot that Clancy has developed. The crux of the first 800 or so pages could easily fit within 100 pages. It probably became an impossible task to pare down the vast expanse of irrelevant text in the editing process (I'm guessing Clancy has voice recognition software and just dictates hour after hour of free-form verbiage), resulting in endless loads of filler text.Cons:First and foremost, Clancy thinks he is omnisciently clever in his personal moral and political beliefs and has decided to share..... actually, force those beliefs on his readers time after time after time. He does this through the soliloquies his characters spout page after page after page. By the time you get through the first 50 pages of this book, anytime you see a paragraph of more than four lines that starts with a character who \\"believed,\\" \\"thought,\\" \\"reflected,\\" \\"remembered,\\" \\"pondered,\\" \\"considered,\\" etc... you should immediately skip to the next short paragraph containing action verbs. Absolutely nothing of any consequence to the story occupies the hundreds of pages of soliloquies Clancy has spewed in this book. In Clancy's books, there are only two sorts of characters - the silly/radical/imbecilic/evil/foolish/dangerous antagonists and the protagonists. For protagonists, substitute the words: \\"Tom Clancy.\\" All of the pondering his characters do is either Clancy spouting off his own beliefs or him bitterly and melodramatically satirizing those with whom he disagrees. In the good old days, Clancy wrote exciting, interesting military thrillers that appealed to both the spec-and-tech fans and the action fans. Nowadays, his primary goal is demagoguery. Clancy's world is black and white - there is his opinion and then everything else is stupidly wrong.Certainly it is important for America to have well-trained, well-equipped armed forces - 95% of us Clancy readers are military buffs to some extent and we can all point to Chamberlain as an example of how pacifist appeasement and lack of adequate military preparation are foolish policies in a contentious world. However, I really don't need my military thrillers to shriek dogma at me about Thomas Clancy's views on religion in public or abortion. If I wanted that, I'd flip to one of the evangelical cable channels. We don't need to have dozens of explanations about the obvious, that pacifism and communism are bad things. I also don't need some pompous jerk claiming that smoking cigarettes and cigars is actually a good thing and anyone that disagrees is a wuss/momma's boy. Even for those who agree with some or all of Clancy's various beliefs, Clancy's proselytizing is excessive by a factor of ten, clumsy, sophomoric and boring. Since almost all of Clancy's characters are either himself or that stupid, evil antagonist, he's not actually developing any \\"character\\" for any of the characters in his books by these \\"musings.\\"Clancy is a blatant racist. If accused of racism in his book, he'd just say that he was trying to portray realistically what average military or ex-military personnel might say. Bull. There are dozens of references spewed throughout this novel to \\"Chinks,\\" \\"Joe Chinaman,\\" \\"Gooks\\" and \\"Ragheads,\\" so many that it is not just a colorful depiction of colorful characters. If he didn't mean to imply support for those racist terms, he would not have mentioned them in the first place.Next, given that the PRC is on the brink of bankruptcy, had always coveted Siberia and now there are huge discoveries of gold and oil deposits right on their doorstep, why is the invasion a surprise? Weren't any of them forewarned by the exact same thing happening with the USSR in Red Storm Rising? Oops, I guess that's not part of their fictional world. Why has the new Russian Federation so ridiculously ignored Russia's fiercest, traditional enemy to the south - that's not realistic at all.Another really annoying part of this book is the way that all of the American military and intelligence figures spew ridiculous quantities of slang, jargon and colloquialisms at all of the foreign characters. It would all be incomprehensible. Presidents and generals just don't repeatedly call their counterparts from foreign countries \\"buddy\\" or \\"pal.\\"Funny how the American losses for the conflict total only three F-14 flyers.How many times will Ryan whine he does not want to be President?Pros:The last 200 pages, once war actually breaks out, are pretty exciting. Very derivative of Red Storm Rising, but nonetheless interesting reading.Clancy does possess more knowledge of military equipment than practically any other writer in the genre.Finally, I disagree with some of the other reviewers' criticisms, which I don't think are fully justified. Clancy's use of slang about the Chinese is racist, but not his characterization of the Chinese as a whole. Clancy's China behaves very much how the real PRC behaves, not because of how the Chinese people think and act, but because of the politburo's totalitarian control of the country. Please folks, remember a few years back to the spy plane incident? China claimed the large, slow lumbering U.S. plane had deliberately knocked the Chinese fighter out of the sky - absurd. The trade imbalance situation is also fairly accurate. Remember the ridiculous outcry that the U.S. deliberately targeted the Chinese embassy in Sarajevo? The PRC has 30,000 state security personnel monitoring and censoring the Chinese access to and use of the internet - reasonable governments do not do that. Clancy is criticizing the PRC government, not the Chinese people."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As I was reading this book, I began to think about all the things that had happened to the U.S. in the 1 plus years of Jack Ryan's presidency: Congress was destroyed, there were two bio-terrorism attacks, a war with Iran/Irag, another with China, and a nuclear launch on D.C. That's when I realized that yes, this is a technothriller and all this stuff is over the top, but enough already!! Could you imagine any president leading his country though all of these crises and still being popular? Clearly, Clancy needs to find another storyline. It shouldn't be a problem, he reminds us continually that Ryan hates to be President.I've read every book in the Jack Ryan series and this was clearly the most tedious and tiresome. The first thing that annoyed me was the incessant focus on cursing and sex. There seemed to be an F-word on every page, and enough innuendo to envision Clancy as some mid-level pervert. Also, the ethnic references to the Chinese were a bit much; especially on every other page.The ironic part of this book was that Clancy kept calling the Chinese Politburo a bunch of barbarians for recklessly starting a war, but he has Ryan enter the U.S. into a war with China after allowing Russia into NATO, all the while without ever once consulting with Congress!! Clancy also chooses to portray Robby Jackson as a stereotype of African Americans rather than as a thoughtful, intelligent former Admiral who has ascended to the Vice Presidency.The Jack Ryan series is clearly at an end. Actually, it should've ended after Sum of All Fears, but hey, money talks. Let's hope that Clancy turns back towards his once considerable talents and finds a new avenue with which to entertain us."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read the whole series of books in this series ( Debt of Honour , Executive orders being the last two) . The Bear and the Dragon is is messy fragmented book with a rushed and somewhat improbable ending to top off the huge waste of time spent reading it.Clancy has managed to write a long book and yet fails to give his book a truly fleshed out individual to hang the book around . Ryan , Clark , Ding , Golokov are all here in cardboard cutout form - American technology works perfectly and Democracy truimphs - Clancy would have been better making this a book the one where the good guys get their (...) kicked -Jack Ryan has become a cartoon character and the level of altruism on the good guys side is so sickly sweet that you should get your fillings checked before reading it.Clancy appears to have gotten slapdash and lazy with much of his information/research/factoids being recycled from earlier books and in some cases twice in the Bear and the Dragon.I loved the earlier books - they were imaginative and well structured - this one is not a fitting sequel"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book needed an editor to say &quot;Great book, we just need to cut 400 or 500 pages of the first 800, beginning with the politics.&quot; I am guessing when an author sells as many books as Clancy has, he can tell editors to shut up and publish it. It's too bad, because there is a good book somewhere in there. I actually agree with many of his political statements, but I don't need them repeated 10x in a fictional work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I like the books of Tom Clancy a lot. Thus far I've read all his books and would rate them 5 stars.However, in Rainbow Six, the introduction took about 300 pages. Since there were plenty of pages left, this is no problem.In the bear and the dragon the introduction (the endless talking) takes 800 pages! It was hard to keep on reading.The real action takes place in the remaining pages and ends very quickly. In this part it was hard to stop reading. This is the Tom Clancy I like."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Too long by half. Wooden. Repetitive. Un-fun. Other reviewers have said it all before me.I've decided that Clancy must've made a New Year's Resolution to crank out some number of pages per day on this one. Or, maybe he had a bet going with Stephen King to see who could make the most money with the least effort. Whoever won that bet, I know I lost by reading The Bear And The Dragon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have considered myself an avid Clancy fan for almost two decades. But, it just keeps getting harder. I purcased this, the latest Ryan adventure, as I have all the rest, as soon as it was available. And again it was a great disapointment. This book drags on in an attempt to peak suspense, but please Tom, give us some excitment. Give us a Jack Ryan that is as savy a president as he was a CIA operative. Remeber the good old days ( circa Cardinal of the Kremlin ) when Ryan was cooly smirking at his KGB captors after just having aided the escape of a high ranking double agent? Is this the same guy who is now bumbling around the oval office and whining about everything? I give this book 2 stars because I still consider myself a fan, even though I think the last good book in this series was The Sum of All Fears. Finally, the only other reason I think this book rates more than one star, is the ending action sequence, done in the bold Clancy style I know and love(thank god for Mr.Clark).You still got it Tom, you just don't have to waste so much paper getting there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book is extremely lengthy, full of unnecessary sexual comments, and rubber-stretched passages. I found myself skipping entire pages. For me, beeing the biggest Clancy fan up to date it is really difficult to say that his work is bad, but every other book I have read was excellent-&quot;The Debt of Honor,&quot; &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; &quot;Without Remorse,&quot; to name a few, - but this book absolutely does not grab attention and what is even worse, annoys.Do not recommend."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was the worst Clancy book ever. I'd almost be willing to say this book was the worst one I'd ever read. The only reason I finished it was because it was a Clancy book and I kept thinking it would get better. It seems that the end of the Cold War has dried up material for Clancy because this one was reaching for some straws. Although the battle at the end wasn't bad but it didn't really have any suspense, you knew the US with its mighty technology would triumph over China. This one will make me pause before I buy the next Clancy book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Before &quot;The Bear and the Dragon,&quot; you could count on a great story from Tom Clancy. Book after book proved that. It has even been trivial to recognize a series like &quot;Net Force&quot; in which the only thing it has to do with Clancy is having paid to put his name on the cover. The writing just isn't up to par. Then comes &quot;The Bear and the Dragon.&quot; It is so filled with profanity and vulgarity that it is like driving down a road filled with potholes. The language is more than distracting for being unnecessary -- it's downright irritating. Dang, maybe he did have something to do with Net Force &lt;grimace&gt;. Then there is the hero, Jack Ryan -- the kind of man who, even with human foibles, is heroic and honorable and great fun to join as a silent partner in his adventures. In &quot;Dragon&quot; our friend Jack is reduced to a whining adolescent. Either Clancy himself has had a bad personal experience for which he's taking it out on us, his readers, or he recently lost what we now know to be one heck of a good editor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the most boring Clancy book I've ever read, and I've read all of them! Fully half the book is taken up getting to the point of the story, with constant references to how difficult (and boring) POTUS' life is, constant references to how important secrecy (not to mention Clancy's pet phrase &quot;need to know&quot;) to all the players is, uncalled-for and cryptic FBI references to characters' nicknames (SWORDSMAN, SURGEON, who are these people??!!). I'm sorry, Clancy's early novels were very interesting and readable, but his recent work has become verbose and uninteresting. Why does Clancy find the need to explain every little detail of every minute situation (which most Americans can imagine anyway?)? I can't recommend buying this book, it's a waste of valuable reading time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The last quarter of this book is the most entertaining. The war between China and Russia is exciting and devastating, probably the most memorable sequence Clancy has ever committed to paper. There is still the problem of the first three-quarters, though. Anybody seen Police Academy? How about any of the sequels? This feels like that. Clancy's earlier books have been entertaining, even memorable (but not serious literature, don't even think so), but this is \\"Red Storm Rising 2\\". The first three-quarters features a couple of decent subplots but more often bad ones. The investigation subplot with the FBI agent and Russian cop was one of the entertaining and interesting ones, but hearing Ryan gripe for page after page about how tough it was to run the country and how the Asian economy was going down the tubes and on and on, etc. was boring and repetitive, to say the least. The subplot with CIA man Nomuri creating a sexual liason with a Chinese secretary was just an excuse for attracting the male testosterone crowd with some lewd, perversive writing. Even though Ryan is a great man, formerly a marine and a patriot, I still have trouble believing he could be elected to the presidency as an Independent. I don't have anything against Independents, I am one. But this country is too much split down party lines. And I would have bet Ryan was a Republican. After all, in Executive Orders he said he was pro-life, and a reporter remarked his appointments to the Supreme Court were very conservative, none on Fowlers' and Durlings' list (I had them figured for Democrats), Republicans like the military getting more money (He was an ex-marine), he had a bunch of guns in his house in Patriot Games, plus he was rich. I think that Ryan is now a mouthpiece for Clancy's right-leaning politics, even though he says he is an Independent."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"okay, i can see a theme at work in the words of my fellow reviewers.1st, a bizarre synopsis in 'china attacks mother russia'2nd, lots of pontificating through characters we all know well3rd, an incomplete factual understanding of technology and logistics4th, a plot that couldn't take place in the Real Worldand i have to say, i'm as loyal a TC reader and so found it interesting to see how all the characters are doing. but fundamentally, the Ryan Universe has been pushed way past it's lifespan. sure, 20 years ago, when Ryan was just a lowly CIA stiff, books were only a few hundred pages (red october, patriot games, cardinal) and also much better, and most of the people weren't even names yet (nomuri, winston, gregory, chavez, etc), Clancy could make up anything he wanted and you could believe it because it wasn't contradicted by the simplest of worldly observations. but now, after 3 presidents in the Real World and 4 presidents in the false, many of the original points of continuity between them have dissolved.which brings us to the latest novel. as the Ryan Universe becomes more and more discontinuous with the Real one, it becomes increasingly more complicated to make a story out of the one that people in the other can relate to.and so, we've got a minor and unprepared group of defenders (two armored divisions and one air force division) solidly defeating in epic battle superiorly armed and numerous (six armies) aggressors (see Btl of Marathon). We've (America) got no ICBMs to deter a nuclear strike by somebody else. we've got, miraculously, Russia in NATO. we've got Aegis shooting down ICMBs. and we've got the plot we've seen before: commie country's economy stricken (how we can't imagine, but we'll come up with something) and the ONLY THING they (or, more accurately, the diabolical members of their politburo) can do is go to war to get some oil.Conclusion: read Red Storm, because even though the Cold War is over, it's a much better book with basically the same story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I suppose my main issues with the book is to use James Bond as an example. I see the Bond movies to see how the secret agent handles problems. I am not interested in seeing how James Bond would do if he were promoted to M or PM. I don't care about his politics, nor do I care to read about them. I want to read about Jack Ryan the spy, not President Ryan complaining about domestic policy.The book needed editing - there were many cases of the same off hand remark being made by different people in different locations three pages apart - the JFK assasination comment was one.The love scenes were horrible. Offensive on many levels, and particularly for the writing.No harm no foul, on the missile strike on Washington, DC?Clancy has problems ending his books. Sending a jet into Congress, eating Japanese sausage(!), some sort of conclusion would be nice.Having Clancy write black and white sermons was a very scary exercise, and would be best practiced in college.And for goodness sake, get off the Clinton comments. They have no place in your timeline. Besides, I think you have no business moralizing on that issue."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a big fan of many of his earlier books, but this one touches on a lot of areas I know something about -- and it's clear he doesn't. There are many examples large and small. For example, TC seems to think that any two countries with equal and fair trade laws will have balanced trade. Or, he seems to think that China can run a big trade surplus and use the money to somehow import weapons etc without that reducing its trade surplus. There are many more small ones that in the end detract much more from the book (a top aid being known for his computer skills per se, as distinct from his financial acumen), as well as long lectures on politics that are tedious and childish even if you happen to agree with the underlying sentiment. None of this would matter too much except that (1) the story is super boring -- if you skip all the ignorant diatribe etc. there are only a couple of hundred pages of action, maybe and (2) it makes me wonder in what other areas he is guessing and where he actually knows something (like the military stuff, I assume)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I wrote a review of this book last week that was not published. I suspect that my review was screened-out due to my use of a word that Mr. Clancy uses repeatedly in his latest novel &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot;. Amazon's screening is admirable in this regard. If only Mr. Clancy's or his editor(s) had used some measure of this screening in publishing this very poorly constructed story.As many reviewers have described, this novel consists of 750 pages of mind-numbingly repetitive and simple-minded set-up and 250 pages of uninspired action. The ratio in his excellent books &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, and even &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is reversed. Mr. Clancy should stick with the horse that got him this far. And once again, he ends the novel with none of the attention to detail that he became famous for, but with the brevity and thoughtlessness of a freshman reaching the minimum word limit on a creative writing term paper.In a bizarre vein, Clancy continues to try to expand his use of &quot;love&quot; scenes in this book. His description of intimate encounters parallels his description of the detonation of a thermonuclear device or the operation of a submarines trailed antenna array. Hire a ghost writer for this stuff!On a less humorous note, the level of vulgarity has risen dramatically in this book. Jack Ryan (POTUS, for you acronym wienies), the leader of the free world and hero to all right thinking Americans, can't utter a sentence without including some vulgar reference (either sexual, racial, cultural, ... whatever). Neither can his Vice President. Nor his Chief of Staff. Nor any other character in this book. I understand that talk gets salty amongst military types, ... or amongst most any type. But why rachet the level of vulgarity to such a level that it becomes the feature of most conversations, rather than a literary condiment?Stay away from this book unless you are the most die-hard Clancy fan. I used to fall into that category, but he's lost me for good now. His work has degraded to mere slop, particularly with the last two efforts (this one and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;).Dave Carter Indianapolis, IN"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After a long wait, the great day arrived and I got to bring home the newest Clancy thriller. What a disappointing waste of time. Great characters are brought back from the earlier books and given nothing to do. Subplots are started and then forgotten about. Dialogue is worse than that found in amatuer submissions to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Mary Pat Foley would never waltz around calling her husband &quot;hunny, bunny&quot; at work. Clancy apparently is running some king of contest with a prize for the reader who can accurately tell him how many times he uses the words, p--s, d--k, f--k, s--t, et al. He also goes on endlessly about the Japanese/Anerican spook's love sausage. If Tom Clancy really did write this book, he has lost what made him a great writer of thrillers. If he didn't write it, he ought to sue whoever did."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"the writing and editing could use lots of work. Constant repetition of certain 'cute' phrases is tedious. I was especially annoyed by the overuse of Secret Service codenames. Blatant typos should have been caught by good editing.

I do not need to know Clancy's political opinions about abortion, the military, feminists, or China."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's fiction has always combined crackling, fast-paced action with a chilling degree of realism; even when the overall plot seems too over-the-top for words, the details ring so true that you can't help but believe that the world could work that way. The good news for Clancy fans is that The Bear and the Dragon delivers action in Siberia-sized chunks. President Jack Ryan, Vice President (!) Robby Jackson, Rainbow superspooks John Clark and Ding Chavez, and the rest of the crew have to deal once again with Chinese Minister-Without-Portfolio Zhang Han San and his neverending quest for Siberian riches. The bullets, bazookas and ballistic missiles fly fast and furious.Unfortunately, the details just don't cut it this time. Some might be nitpicks (Ryan's salary would be $400,000 rather than $250,000) but some are serious (the Navy has been working on using Aegis missiles for ballistic defence for years now). The biggest problem, though, is that the entire plot hinges on Russia being the good guys, with a competent (if woefully underequipped) military and a willingness to ask the West for help. Between the chaos in Chechnya and the loss of the Russian submarine Kursk (one week before the release of The Bear and the Dragon), that's awfully hard to swallow.Oh, well. It's still a fun read, even with the flaws. But Clancy needs to let President Ryan retire."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I needed something to read on a flight across the continent from L.A to N.Y. At the airport bookstore in L.A., I was recommended Tom Clancy. Since I have the Chinese background (I came to the US about 20 years ago from China), I picked up the Bear and Dragon. Turned out a big mistake!The plot is simple and the narration is long and boring, often wandering off from its main theme with too many off-subject comments, which in most cases are unnecessary and shallow in nature. The book needs to be cut at least in half to make it more focused. And the language... I don't understand how the foul languages would in any way help the story. Worst of all are the characters. They are completely stereotypes in their worst kinds. The Americans smart heros, the Russians are inferior and kissing up to Americans, and the Chinese, they are either nave and brainwashed or stiff and stupid, and they are evils. As for the people in the White House, they are more like high school kids so awkward in their posts cracking jokes of bad tastes as if in their locker rooms..I don't know much about Russians, so I have no comments. As far as the Chinese characters are concerned, they are nothing Chinese other than their names. Ming talks and behaves more like a street girl on Sunset Blvd than a secretary to a powerful Chinese minister. And people addressing one another \\"Comrade\\" in the 90s? Anyone doing that in China would be laughed off the surface of the earth! When I came to the part where the Vatican ambassador and the Chinese Baptist were shot dead in the hospital by the Chinese police, I finally realized that the author's brain was totally f--ucked up! I couldn't help but laughing out loud, which drew some curious looks to my direction on the airplane. From then on, I kept on reading out of nothing to, not to see how the story develops, but to see how naive and stupidly crazier this author can go...Apparently, this author has never been to China, and knows nothing about the Chinese people and its society if he is writing about China in the 90s other than his presumptuous simple-minded belief: Communism is bad and capitalism is good. Therefore, the people in China, the only surviving Communist nation on earth, must be bad, be evil and be our enemies. And of course, we Americans, being the citizens of the most powerful capitalist nation on earth, have to be good, and smart.Based on his own stereotype of the Chinese and the communists, the Chinese girls are naive without a brain, easily seduced by some gifts of lingerie from a foreigner (in this case, a Japanese, which the author fails to understand how much they are hated by the Chinese in reality), and eagerly spreading their legs while casually talking about other man (her boss, the minister) she went to bed with...This is just hilarious! How come I have never come across a Chinese gill like that in my life?And the Foreign Minster at the trade negotiation...wowowo... Can't imagine a guy in that position could be that stiff and stupid with nothing to say other than repeating \\"you Americans can't dictate to us...\\" How did he even get to that position... other than in Clancy's simple-minded fiction...I guess the stupidity of the character only reflects that of the author himself.And then came the scene of the CNN reporter reporting on police refusing the widow of the Chinese Baptist returning to her home, police cremated her husband body and scattered the ash without consulting the wife, police beating up the group of prayers right in front of CNN camera... I kept wondering to myself, which China he is writing about? Is it the China on the map in the Far East? Or something completely out of the author's shallow imagination, but stamped with the name of China by the author. I have been traveling to China numerous times each year on business... this is definitely not the China I know of. I guess the author must be still living in the cold war age chewing on the propagandas against China from Mao's era...I haven't finished the book yet, and at this moment have no desire to do so, since I am already done with the trip. I am not sure if I would come back to finish it some day. But one thing I am sure is, anything by Tom Clancy will definitely be crossed off from my purchase list for reading in the future.By the way, the book did make me laugh quite a few times on my trip, not because it offers anything humorous, but because of the stupidity under the pretentious disguise of self-claimed knowledge of the subject matter by the author. And I am afraid that is the best I can say about this book and its author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This novel did not match up to the high standards I had come to expect from Clancy over the years with almost every other one of his novels to this point (all of which I read). Too wordy for the plot line...and then the end was too rushed in my opinion.In addition, Clancy has apparently bought into the dogma that high tech trumps numbers and strategy in all cases. The old saying \\"Quantity has a quality all its own\\" can still come into play when contemplating land warfare in Asia against Red China. I am afraid a fight like that contemplated here would not be so easily won.Aside from that...too many repetitive phrases, too many stereotypes and too much verbosity in the storyline."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy sure is getting dirty in his old age. A lot more focus on sex than I remember from any of his other books. I couldn't even bring myself to finish reading it since every page was filled with the f-bomb or some description of sex. I'm not sure if I even want to bother with Red Rabbit."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a reader who has purchased everyone of Clancy's books within days of hitting the shelves and finishing them days later, I must say that this is his worst. I still have yet to finish this one (page 700)and I am almost dreading going back to it. Call me crazy but I feel an &quot;obligation&quot; at this point to finish. His work has steadily declined. The inconsequential story lines seem to take forever to gel and I am getting tired of Jack's moral dilemnas and fustrations with being in the White House. This could be the end of Clancy as one of my must read authors."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The quality of the Jack Ryan books has reached a new level of crapdom. I don't feel like reiterating the consensus opinions about this one but I feel like throwing all of my Tom Clancy books away now. He has let the quality of his writing hit new lows.This book has forced me to come forward and hopefully help those of you who are thinking of buying this one. I would have given you mine but I left it in the hotel room so the maid staff can enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Tom Clancy's books, but the Bear and the Dragon is just bad. 3 reasons made me not finish this book.1) Repeated harsh ethnic slurs against the chinese. How many times can you read &quot;chink&quot; &quot;slant&quot; or &quot;barbarians&quot; before one gets really offended. Makes me think that Clancy really doesn't like the Chinese. Never heard him talk about the Russians like that in his other books when they were the enemy.2) Clancy has made Ryan into a whining cry-baby. All he ever does is complain about government and the fact that people don't call him by his first name.3) Just plain boring.Sorry to say that this book not up to par with Clancy's other novels. I really enjoyed them all up to Rainbow Six, which I found to be only OK."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The down hill slide Tom Clancy has begun continues. The Bear and Dragon, is arguably his worst work. It holds the potential to be great but fizzles in the end. Clancy has a problem writing for Jack Ryan character. The Plot continues where Executive orders stopped. But, Jack is constantly whinning and moaning that he is president. He ran for re-election didn't he? So it doesn't follow that J.R. seems so victimized. I have begun to think there actually was supposed to be a book in between this one and Exec. Orders. All Tom Clancy fans be warned. This book is a waste. Tom has sold out Jack Ryan for some cheap cash."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Since The Bear and the Dragon was the first fiction audio cd I have listened to, I was worried that I wouldn't like an abridged story. It sounds like it was the better choice for this particular Clancy work though. From what other reviewers are saying, the hardcover was filled with repetitive minutaeu not really necessary to the storyline. I can't speak for the quality of the full hardcover novel, but as an abridged audio cd I thought The Bear and the Dragon was good, maybe even my second favorite Clancy story behind The Cardinal of the Kremlin."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I eagerly ordered the latest Clancy title with the expectation that I would be as entertained as with all of his previous books. Rainbow Six was gripping and I simply could not put the book down. This latest novel is dreadful and I was on page 528 when I realised I was utterly board with the turgid pace and style of prose. It picked up towards the end but finished in a cop-out manner. It would appear that this was written to simply meet a commitment with a publisher"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Oh, this was a waste of my money. I normally find Clancy's books to be, at the very least, DECENT, but this one was downright HORRID. It could not have been more trite! Of course, the US folks are ALL bright and brilliant Harvard grads, there's no such thing as a dumb American, (the closest being that Cliffy guy), according to this book. And all Chinese are stupid Commie morons. It's all so contrived... I mean, &quot;Japanese sausage?!&quot; ROFLMAO!! There's definitely a theme going on there... every American's got a surgeon for a wife, is decorated, or something. And the ethnic slurs, oh my goodness. While, I don't doubt that, if we were really involved in a war, slurs would be the norm, I think he carries it off VERY badly in this book, and so, it's just plain bad taste. And poor Jack Ryan. RESIGN, if you hate your job so much!To Mr. Clancy - better luck with your next book. At this rate, you'll need it :("},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am 200 pages into the book. The development is slow. Reminds me of L Ron Hubbards Battle Field Earth, a 350 page book expanded into 1000 pages. I have bought all oof Clancy's books in hard copy, this may be the last if I finish this one. So far, very disapointing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am female and an avid Clancy reader. He is one of the authors that I buy the hardback. It usually takes me 3-4 days to read his books, however, I am now on week #4!The story is okay, I didn't mind the politics, I didn't even mind the preaching. What I did find appalling is the over use of the &quot;F&quot; word and every other nasty thought or joke phrase concerning sex or the male/female anatomy.I believe that Jack Ryan would start to smoke on the sly. As much as he hates his job, he probably needs the smokes. But, the Jack Ryan that I have read about in all of the other books would NEVER have talked like he did in Dragon. I should have known when I got to page 16 and saw what Jack said that this was really going to be a bad book.In the past couple of months I have wondered why we had not seen a new Clancy novel, I wish we had not seen this one yet. It desparately needed more work. However, if you are like me and enjoy Clancy, Jack Ryan and the gang -- you will buy this. Don't say you weren't warned!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What was embarrassing was that the author reveals so much about his mind in this book--and it isn't pretty. When even a minister is supposed to think gutter-language thoughts at one point, it was clear that no one at the publishing house edited this book. Plus he tells us what seems like 10 times (maybe really only three times, but by then it seems like 10) the same rumors about Mao Tse-Tung's personal life.There is a reasonably interesting plot here. If you could remove every 4-letter word and bedroom scene to get to the heart of the story, the book would shrink by about one-half and might not be so bad. In its current form, anyone who doesn't use 4-letter words in every fourth sentence of every conversation is going to feel overwhelmed after a while. I certainly did, and I found myself just skimming over the dialogue after a while, watching for what might actually be important to the story.Perhaps this is a good argument for electronic books that you could manipulate and read in the form you want. If I could have in advance, I'd have put this in a Word document and done a host of &quot;delete alls&quot; on every 4-letter word I could think of. Then there might have been a mildly decent (albeit mildly racist) book left over. Even then, of course I'd have had to put up with his defense of Jack Ryan's smoking habit and other oddities...So I agree with most of the other reviews. What a big disappointment this book was, even if it had the usual exciting plot elements. I don't plan to buy any more of Mr. Clancy's books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read this book twice. Why? Some may ask since I'm giving it only three stars is that I hold Tom Clancy in my mind as an great author of thrillers. But I was simply disgusted with this book. The book is about the continous, long story of Jack Ryan and company. No surprise. My major complaints are the following:1) The book is too lengthy than it has to be. This book could have been easily better without 300 of it's pages. We are constantly tormented with the complaints of Jack himself and the story develops slow as for it's plot. Don't get me wrong, there is action as always but it simply progresses too slowly.2) The recurring themes of Tom Clancy's books seem to always portray a United States threatened by an or several evil and vile villains or as in this book a &quot;villain country&quot;. Frankly, I'm getting tired of the &quot;war is imminent and USA wins again&quot; whereas his Powerplays, Net Force, and Op Center series have some diversity in each one. Too bad he doesn't write them anymore.3) Tom Clancy has an ignorance of foriegn cultures or depicts them in way so they can be scoffed at. So much for the Russians, I'm sure they wish to be just like Americans or his understanding of Chinese. Me being one myself, I found his understanding basic.4) Lastly, the use of Jack over and over with other characters has become dull and boring. With every book we see Jack as a honest &quot;America deserves a better President&quot; Catholic. The characters have been so overused that it's a possible to predict their decisions. In simple words for Mr. Clancy, GET RID OF JACK RYAN. I'm so tired of reading about him and his family, his job, etc.I suggest if your looking for a good book, don't bother, but as for the fans of Tom Clancy wait for the paperback edition."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This latest Jack Ryan novel was an absolute page turner. Clancy did an excellent job of tackling the problem of negotiations between two groups of people with fundamentally different perspectives.Keeping this back from a 5 star rating is that his last few Ryan novels have been formulaic. Some foreign power tries to mess with America. Halfway through the book Ryan is surprised that someone would try to hurt his country and he sets in motion the plan that keeps the book in your hands until the end.It would be nice to see Clancy return to what made Red October so great. Then, the US won on superior ingenuity than on superior military will. Maybe that's just a reflection of the new world order where the US is seemingly unmatched in the arena of warfare.Overall a fantastic book and must read for all who consider themselves Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan fans."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy used to pen a good yarn, though his characters were always undeniably shallow. Loved his tech focus, the thoroughness of his research, and his ability to weave them together.However, Bear &amp; Dragon continues his trend toward political pontification. I'm more interested in how the US acquires and acts upon intelligence gained in Asia than I am in Clancy's views on abortion and the environment. (I can always tune into Fox TV news for a dose of conservative dogma).Clancy has also fallen down on his research: his descriptions of life in China range from outdated to innaccurate to painfully uninformed. As a former resident of Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, I can say there was plenty of room for better research. And he could definitely spare his readers the racial slurs. It's obvious that Clancy, and all his characters, hate Asians. If he can't overcome that bigotry, he could keep it to himself. It would make for a far better read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Phew. I finally finished this massive 1026 page hardcover novel. Ignoring the page count for a moment, this is a very large book with lots of things going on. Tom Clancy is following multiple plot-lines and eventually weaving them all together in the attempt to build not just a story, but the broad overview of his world. Over the course of the past 8 novels, Tom Clancy has built a world that is similar to our own, but different events have changed the political reality inside the United States. When The Hunt for Red October was published, Jack Ryan was new to the CIA as an analyst. As the series has moved on, Ryan has moved up the CIA hierarchy and was eventually the Deputy Director of the CIA and took the place of his mentor, James Greer. Terrorists have exploded a nuclear bomb at the Super Bowl in Denver (The Sum of All Fears), a war was instigated that caused a terrorist to crash a plane into the capitol killing the President, most of Congress and all of the Supreme Court (Debt of Honor). At the time that happened, Jack Ryan was just sworn into being the Vice President (he was going to accept the post for the year until election time and then retire from government service all together), so he was now the President. After winning one more war in the Middle East, Jack Ryan actually ran for President and won. This is where The Bear and the Dragon begins. Ryan is now President in his own right and is a year into his term.That was a long introduction to a long novel, but it is important to know because this shapes the actions and thoughts of the characters in Clancy's world. China was behind two major operations: the recent war with Japan (Debt of Honor) and the war with the new Islamic nation that consisted of Iraq and Iran (Executive Orders). CIA believed that China was behind all this, but did not have the proof. So, by this point the top ranked government officials are very skeptical of China and the Chinese. Some reviewers have cried racism, and while the Chinese are painted in a VERY unfavorable light and racist remarks are used by the government officials, we are dealing with a very different world than the one that we live in. China instigated major wars and chemical warfare against the United States. We must take the previous books into account when reading this one.The Bear and the Dragon deals with several plots. The United States has a spy in China and he is working to get access to high level Politburo information. This involves the recruitment of an agent within China, a secretary to a Politburo member. Another plotline involves the discovery a massive oilfield in Russia (larger than the Middle East), as well as a huge gold mine in Russia. This naturally gets China interested in moving north into Siberia. The novel begins with an attempt on the life of Golovko, the top advisor to the President of Russia (I can't remember his exact title, but he used to run the KGB and has appeared in past novels). We see John Clark, Domingo Chavez, and other repeat characters from previous books.As I said, the book is long, and in several parts it drags a bit. For a novel this large and with a plot this convoluted and detailed, it is an interesting read. Not quite up to the level of Clancy's best, it also isn't as bad as some reviewers might have you believe. There is some parts of the book that aren't as interesting and the characters are more or less one dimensional now (Clancy spent 8 books developing some of these characters, I think we're okay if he doesn't change them in book 9). Some parts feel rushed (the ending) and some parts smack of Clancy himself being too much in the novel, but honestly, this is a Tom Clancy novel and we aren't reading this with the expectation that it be William Faulkner. Clancy does best with the military parts of the book, and to be perfectly honest: this was an enjoyable book to read and is a worthy member of the Jack Ryan Universe."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I can't believe that Tom Clancy wrote this book. Whoever wrote it doesn't seem to know or love Clancy's marvelous characters. (Also, as an aside, Smokey Bear does not work for the Secretary of the Interior. He is in the Forest Service, which is part of the USDA.)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not going to start with the racial incorrectness of this \\"work\\"; let's just say that all the \\"good guys\\" seem like they belong in either a mental institution or prison, or better yet, a few feet beneath the dirt.See, Clancy used to be known for his relatively realistic dipiction of a modern battlefield, so I was expecting quite a bit of juicy technical details that only true ethusthiasts can appreciate. Alas, that is not the case. So here are some very disturbing examples:during the entire war, PLAN (Chinese Navy) sits in port. Now the book is published in 2000, and last time I checked, PLAN and PLANAF had considerable strike power at that time. Just the sheer number of SSKs along should cause PAC COM some discretionPLA employs organic low level air defenses, and using GPS/UAV to knock out MOBILE AAA platforms seems a bit too far fetchedRussian T-55s killing Chinese T-80s? I think there are more than a few captured T-55s in Israel to counter that assertionPLAAF getting whipped, even though it's the largest airforce in the world. Now I don't know about you, but PLAAF pilots do get considerable flying hours, and they have their share of 3rd and 4th generation fighters. Enough to, say, mount an effecting air denial campaignThere is something called DF-21Mod2, which was the conventional ballistic missile with terminal guidance designed specifically to destroy carriers. Now of course there is no official source confirming this weapon, it has appeared in some open source materials and some rumors suggest that the 7th fleet pulled back in '96 because of DF-21Mod2's deploying across the strait. I suppose PAC COM have that stuff to think about too, right?The list goes on, and on, and on.And one more thing, Jack Ryan complains, a lot, and a few hundred pages into the book, I just hoped that Jack would put himself out of his misery, and my major annoyance, by killing himself.If you are relatively informed in modern weapons, especially Chinese ones, and if you're not the most incorrigible ultra conservative still living in the Cold War mentality, don't read this book. It'll just anger you."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"\\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" had the potential to tell an exciting story. Unfortunately, it exhibited one too many flaws that made it very, very difficult for a casual reader like myself to enjoy this book.This book was by no means a &iexcl;page-turner&iexcl; as is advertised. Throughout the novel, I found myself thumbing ahead pages of trade talks, economic policies, weaponry discussions and, in general, dull conversations on uninteresting topics. Much to my dismay, the author devotes the bulk of the first 900 pages on such matters. When I finally caught glimpses of the more interesting subjects, such as formal exchanges between world leaders and military action, they were short, unsatisfying and unrealistic. At the end, having invested so many hours into this title, I felt that &iexcl;The Bear and The Dragon&iexcl; left an unusually bad taste in my mouth. As a reader, I partly fault myself for not knowing what to expect, as online customer reviews are always only a few mouse clicks away. Having said that, the blame largely rests with the author &iexcl;V who is known for his masterful storytelling &iexcl;V for delivering a title that fails miserably in maintaining the reader&iexcl;s interest.It was also frightening to witness the rampant usage of racial slurs against a foreign country and its people. It was tiresome and humorous that such off-the-wall remarks were made by none other than the POTUS' closest aides. If Mr. Clancy cannot develop a formidable enemy without resorting to relatively cheap tactics such as blatant bashing or racial discrimination, then the author himself and his protagonists do not deserve much respect or sympathy, since they all come across as xenophobes.Mr. Clancy has utterly embarrassed himself with his knowledge of the Chinese culture - or the pure lack of it. \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" never ceased to amuse me (as a person of Chinese origin) from the get-go in showing how horribly misinformed or ignorant the author was. In today&iexcl;s age, Chinese do not greet each other as \\"comrades\\" anymore. The profane \\"Pok Gai\\" exclamation is only used in the Cantonese dialect and not in the official Mandarin language. And for that matter, the official language of the PRC is Mandarin and not Pu Tong Hua. Nitpicking on such errors or inconsistencies is not what a casual reader like myself like to do, but it is difficult to overlook them all. Furthermore, it is safe to say that such errors could have been remedied with some basic research and common sense. I can only hope that Mr. Clancy was not as misinformed or ignorant when he wrote his earlier titles.In conclusion, it is extremely difficult to recommend &iexcl;The Bear and The Dragon&iexcl;. Plagued by filler chapters, inaccuracies and prejudice against a foreign culture and people, this book would prove boring to many and offensive to some. I suggest passing this title unless for the sake of book collecting."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Okay...where to start? Beware...before reading this review, spoilers abound, so if you are wanting to read this book, turn back now. This is also really long, and not meant for the patient type.All right. Let's get started. As this book's title would suggest, (unless you are a complete idiot), this book centers around Russia and China. To fully understand what is going on here, I suggest you first read Clancy's The Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honor, and Executive Orders, although if you just read Executive Orders you should be fine because all of them are really long books.Meanwhile, we once find Jack Ryan back in the White House (after an assumed election victory) and he's feeling pretty good. He's experienced two wars, lead the country through one of them, and he's one of the most popular presidents in history. (Again, to understand this, read Orders). He's seen as the best man simply because his adminstration is known worldwide for cutting way back on red tape, and just dealing with things the simple way.Anyway, the book really begins when Jack Ryan's friend and former adversary, and also chief of the Russian Intelligence service, Sergey Golovko, lucks out when an identical car to his is suddenly destroyed by an unknown assailant with an RPG. (Rocket Propelled Grenade). Although the man who's dead (a Russian Master Pimp called \\"Rasputin\\" by Ryan) had plenty of enemies, Sergey fears he was the target, as the car the man was riding in was literally identical to his, with armor and everything. An investigation by the Moscow and St. Petersburg \\"militias\\" (police forces) tracks down the criminals in SP, only to find them dead, handcuffed together and anchored down in a river. The plot thickens when it is learned that they are RIF'd (Reduced in Force, which basically means laid off) Spetznaz special forces soldiers, and their boss, another Spetz, is found and tracked by the police.Meanwhile, (this really all happens before you find out what's above) a massive gold and oil discovery, with the oil find larger than the Persian Gulf, is made in Siberia. The company Atlantic Richfield makes a deal with Ryan and the US to provide the infastructure, and it appears that the suffering Russian economy will finally be getting better once the money starts flowing. Its also good news for America, since we no longer have to depend on the unstable Arab nations for oil (it never says this, but that is what Clancy is implying.)But everything is not happy-go-lucky after all. In China, the Minster without portfolio Zhang Han San, despite encountering setbacks before (he's been a bad smooth operator behind the scense in Honor and Orders) takes the discovery in Siberia, which he calls the \\"Northern Resource Area\\", as good news for China as well. But he does not plan to play fair, and is already in the process of making things to China's advantage both politically and militarily in the world. (I will not say how, yet, that just spoils too much).But Zhang is about to encounter a few setbacks in his grand plan. The CIA is in the process of initiating operation \\"Genghis\\", which places the talented Chester Nomuri (an important Debt of Honor character) inside China, seducing a Chinese secretary into unwittingly planting really advanced spyware on the Chinese Politburo's computer system, which he sold them as part of working for his company, the Nippon Electric Corporation. With this action, the CIA now has a very high source in China, and its not a man.As Zhang continues with his plans in China, a new event starts to speed things up. The Papal Nuncio to China and the Reverand Yu Fa Ann interfere with a Chinese population control policy (basically they perform a really late term abortion on unauthorized pregnancies) and are shot and killed by Chinese policemen. All across Christian America, people are outraged, as both Catholic and Protestant officials are dead. This is a big punch in the stomach for abortion, in Clancy's way of doing things, and he does make a good point.But the consequences for the Chinese Politburo could be better. Slowly, but surely, people in both America and Europe (since the Papal Nuncio was Italian) start boycotting Chinese made goods, and American and European companies left and right stop doing business with China. This is bad news for them, but a good oppurtunity for his plan in Zhang's eyes, as the panicked and soon-to-be bankrupt and generally desperatre Politburo will be much more supportive of his plan to \\"save China's economy\\". How does Zhang plan to do this? Simple. By seizing Siberia.But, his plan soons start to come tumbling down like a badly built house of cards, all thanks to Operation Genghis, now renamed Sorge. (That's pronounced Sor-gee). Every meeting from here on out is translated and delivered to Ryan every morning with his daily intelligence brief. As Zhang's mad plan unfolds, Ryan must make a decision. Can he take America into another war? The answer will be revealed if you read...Things slowly unfold from here, as the book is 1000 pages long. But to find out what happens, read it, you'll enjoy it.Prasies:Clancy criticizes slow moving politics and short-term solutions, which probably most would agree need to be gotten rid of, in several ways, ranging from Ryan's interactions with his brilliant Chief of Staff, Arnold Van Dam, to just events in particular. Anti-abortionists, Anti-communists, and generally conservatives in particular will also love this. Finally, after the first political half of the book comes Clancy's specialty, fictional battles, hence the name of a chapter, \\"Hyperwar\\". I will have to say, this man's knowledge of both U.S. military technology and tactics, as well as the arsenals of foreign armies is truly phenomenal, and coming from a man who before his first book, the Hunt for Red October, was an insurance broker.Criticisms:But, the buck stops there. Born again Liberals will probably want to read a chapter or two, and then throw the book in the trash. Left-of-center people and moderates will be offended, at least slightly, as Clancy, especially in the middle of the book, really needs to get off his soap box and tell the story. Other than that, people may consider this book also both sexist and racist, although the racist issue is counteracted by the fact that Clancy is talking about the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. Some of the words used in referring to the Politburo are \\"Idiots\\", \\"Klingons\\", \\"Slant-eyed mother f***ers and other things.But, the sexist issue is a little less specific, and sometimes just refers to women in general. The Chinese secretary that Nomuri seduces either is just afflicted by the environment she's in, (as she is the plaything of a Politburo minister) or Clancy has just puroposely made this character a total slut for some wrong reason or another. She constantly talks about Nomuri's \\"Japanese sausage\\" and she, along with a few other women, have no sexual inhibitions. Just like in real life.In the end, this is an okay book, hence my rating, but it would have been a lot better if there wasn't the political jargon or the racist or sexist tendencies. Perhaps in the end, Clancy is trying to criticize these evils, but if he is, he's not very clear about that. At all.Well, I'm Done."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has deservedly earned a reputation as the King of the Military Intrigue Genre. What made all of those stories so well liked was - as it is in almost all stories - that these stories were character-driven in spite of all the hardware and battles. You long remember the Cardinal, or of the Kremlin or John Clark or even the young Jack.My personal opinion is that Clancy's writing started a slow descent when he began stretching what was and not possible in the political realm. The rise of Ryan to VP, then Commander in Chief was just too...hokey. From there we have more and more implausible scenarios. These last few books seem to be ghost-written, or published without benefit of critical editing. They commit the worst literary sin possible - they bore. I found myself thumbing ahead, first paragraphs, then pages and finally whole chapters.Is it possible that Clancy cannot break away from Jack Ryan much as Dorothy Sayer was stuck with Lord Peter Whimsey, Anne Rich with Lestat or Elizabeth George with her crew of five? This particular writing is appropriately turgid with absolutely zero originality. Tom, take a vacation and get those juices flowing again. Find a new plot, a new character, anything to return to the good old days."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"One does not need even an elementary knowledge of Chinese politics - just plain common sense, or maybe a regular news habit - to know that there is no such thing as a &quot;Minister without Portfolio&quot; in the Chinese Politburo! This is a British concept. It is all fine and well for an author to use his imagination when writing science fiction or Tolkienesque fantasy; it is a disaster when people like Clancy aim to make their stories realistic sounding while relying only on their own imagination. Clancy knows zilch about China to spin a yarn worth the telling.What makes some authors (like Crichton) stand out is that they have a sure grasp of the facts, and then use what expert knowledge they have to write a story that either reflects a really possible scenario in the real world or sometimes even predicts it. To use one example, a fine author once used his specialised knowledge about the coming technological breakthroughs in naval air power to write a story - in the early 1930's - about the Japanese attacking the American naval base in Hawaii. This book was written by an Englishman, I believe, at least ten years before the Day of Infamy. It was little known at the time.......but not so in Japan, where the book was used in the naval officer cadet college as a text.Some of Clancy's older stories - like &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; - rise to this level. This one doesn't cut it, although he is in fine form describing the technical minutiae of weapons systems, etc - as usual.I also suggest that from now on Clancy write three or four of his stories at a time, and bind them all together as one, although this means the publisher must overcome the considerable technical difficulty of printing a novel that runs to four or five or even six thousand pages. Why this? Some of Clancy's books read like this kind of tome anyway, as most readers know by now. They drone on and on and on......and by the time you're half way through you forgot what happened at the start. By the time you're done with the book you feel less entertained than uplifted by a sense of achievement and relief - something to brag about."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This could have been a great book, but unfortunately it isn't. I got very confused several times when I had to go back and figure out what he said because of the use of the wrong word. I think I found at least 15-25 instances of the wrong word being used, example week for weak. Come on didn't anyone read it before it went to the printer!!I hope the next one is better or its on to Dale Brown or Stephen Coonts."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Don't get me wrong, I did read the latest book from cover to cover, and could not put it down. I did get tired of Jack Ryan's extra conservative political views. I guess it should be expected since he is Catholic and he is President now. I miss the old days when he could be a neutral player and a great good guy, but when he complains about evolution, abortion, and gay rights, I get kind of tired of it. I hope that the next book tones it down. There were pages that I skimmed right through, because they were boring details that did not add to the plot or excitement. I love TC books, but this was not anywhere near as good as W. Honor or Rainbow. I hope that the trend reverses itself and that I look forward to rereading his newer books as much as I do his older ones."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews here. I am a big Clancy fan but it has become apparent in his last few books that he has begun to take himself a little too seriously. I have had this book for at least three weeks and I am still having a hard time getting past the first 300 pages. The techno-geek stuff that was so much fun in the past is almost totally absent. Now all we hear about is politics. And if you don't think Clancy is rambling on and on about his own political beliefs, well.....His books just aren't much fun anymore, I'm sorry to say. I think I'll go back to a nice fast-paced Patterson or Koontz novel &lt;sigh&gt;."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's beauty is his knowledge of technology. His descriptions of military hardware and its uses are the reason i read his books.He's become enamored with the spy business, much as W.E.B. Griffin did in his Semper Fi series. I really never did believe that the Marine Corps founded the CIA. If I want spies, I'll read Ludlum.Rainbow Six was bad, this book is punishment. Don't buy it and maybe Clancy will go back to what he knows. 800 pages of set-up for the war that everybody knows is coming."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a die-hard fan... look forward to each and every book, and Clancy doesn't seem to write fast enough for me. Even as other people would chop 1/3 of the text out and complain that they're too long.. I like most of them as-is. Except this one. I agree with some of the other reviews which say that all of a sudden, there's too much profanity. Also, I felt like I was reading more political propaganda than a real novel. Clancy needs to get off his soapbox... could the book BE anymore against a woman's right to chose whether or not to have an abortion? That's only one of the issues I got bored hearing about. Mostly, the plot was good, the execution poor. I cheered when Jack Ryan became president, and he's become such a whiner. One of the other truly great characters - Clark - is being played down. Its too bad. There are so many other books by Clancy more worth the time. Normally I can't put the book down and devour it in 3 or 4 days... this one took me 2 weeks. I hope the next one is better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I know a person shouldn't read Clancy expecting sparkling dialogue but COME ON! Man, there were way too many excruciating scenes where I could barely keep reading the page due to the rolling of the eyes those scenes brought on. Jack Ryan has always been pretty hard to take. (As just one example off the top of my head, does anyone else remember the verbal clangers with the Prince of Wales in 'Patriot Games'? Ewww. It stopped me short in my rereading of that book a couple of years ago.) But as he rose in the government ranks he has had less and less to actually _do_ so we seem to get to hear more and more of his Boy-Scout-with-Tourettes ramblings. Plus we all get subjected to the itchy feeling that Tom Clancy is using his francise to push his own political beliefs (hey, I know its his book to write as he pleases but it still feels kind of cheap). Still the man can draw a plot and that kept me slogging to the (ironically, for a 1026 page tome) too-quick ending. Mr. Clancy, if you know your strength is in techno-plot and you are going to publish a 1000+ page book I wish the pacing would be such that the interesting stuff that shows off your strength occupies more than 10 or 15 percent of the novel! Of course what do I know, I am not a hugely successful novelist. Overall I found the book disappointing but if you are a Clancy fan it still has the elements... but the better elements seem to be waning."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After Rainbow Six, I promised myself that I would wait for the paperback of his next book. Well I didn't but I should have. The book is crying out for an editor. Is Clancy too big these days and editors are afraid of him? Repetition, repetition repetition. We hear Ryan complaining about the same thing on numerous occasions. We hear about him sneaking around like a schoolboy getting a cigarette numerous times. We have at least five Star Trek references. We hear about Mao's sexual habits more than once. We hear about Chinese food from two different characters in almost the exact same words. Two characters have the same name in the book. Every character in the book thinks environmentalists are tree-huggers. The obvious blatant racism against the Chinese is distasteful Ryan has turned into a virtual dictator. Where is the senate? Does the government exist anymore? Wars are ridiculously easy to win (If you are American) Ryan used to be a likable almost human character. The books used to be soundly grounded in reality. They now have a surreal atmosphere. What's next? I can almost see Aliens (Klingons) attacking the earth and Ryan jumping into an F16 to fight them. It's really getting to that stage. Clancy should get one of his ghost writers from his other 'series' Op-center to write the next book for him (yes it is getting that bad) The next time, I'm not going to wait for the paperback, it's a visit to the library for me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has finally run out of things to write. As a (past) Clancy lover, I believe I have every right to stand by that comment. His new book is nothing more than a platform for Clancy to mouth off his half-way thought through political ideas, most of which are unconstitutional. A big military power needing oil? Didn't we see that before? Character development? He completely relies on the development from past books. I can't IMAGINE what someone who has never read Clancy before thought of this. Editing? I wish I had written them down, but the amount of times he repeated lines, anecdotes, and so-called \\"military jargon\\" was absurd.I have never wasted so much time. The only reason I even finished the book was to keep with my philosophy that no book is so bad that it can't be finished. This book has made me wonder."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's bad enough that Tom Clancy feel like he has to bring back every living character from his previous books and tell their story again but in this book he also dishes out his feelings on Bill Clinton and Abortion.If he could just have a few characters retire or maybe get killed in action he could cut out about 200 pages.Also it's so obvious that he is taking swipes at Clinton that it gets annoying. I'm not a Clinton fan either but enough is enough. Levae the morality out of it.Cardinal of the Kremlin is still the worst Clancy book but this one is down there with it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a long-time fan of Tom Clancy, I find myself incredibly disappointed with his latest offering, The Bear and the Dragon. Weighing in at just over 1,000 pages, the book is filled with page after page of \\"thoughts\\" as opposed to good, old-fashioned dialog-\\"thoughts\\" so replete with poorly written, misogynistic, right-winged conservative diatribes that it renders the book all but unreadable.I can't help but thinking that 1) Clancy has completely lost touch with the reality in which the rest of us live, and 2) the man is simply using his novels as a pulpit from which he can preach his views and beliefs. I encourage everyone to save their money and look elsewhere for a good thriller."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's obvious that Tom Clancy now has the clout to overrule his editor on any changes, because this book has some serious, serious flaws, ones that could easily be fixed with a mouse and a delete key. I skipped past pages and pages that had nothing to do with the plot (like the pregnant FBI agent - yawn).This book had a lot more to do with Tom Clancy telling you about his feelings toward Jews, homosexuals, the media, the Washington establishment, beer, computers, services other than the Navy, law enforcement, you name it. Cut out the dialogue and you'd have the Republican platform.I'd suggest checking this book out from the library and reading pages 1-~150 and then skipping to about pg. 800."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a big fan of Tom Clancy since he first started writing, but I was greatly disappointed with this effort, the eighth installment in the roller coaster life of Clancy's favorite lead character, Jack Ryan.The plot sets ex spook Jack Ryan, now the President after having successfully run for reelection, after a disaster in a previous story left him the senior ranking official in the US Government, embroiled in yet another attempt to save the United States from a diabolical scheme concocted by one of her major enemy nations.To be blunt, I was given the impression that Jack Ryan's current job title, President of the United States, while not having any major adverse effect on Mr. Ryan's ego, has rather gone to the head of the author, and adversely effected the overall quality of the delivery of this story.First, continuing a trend that has to some extent been a hallmark and perhaps a selling point of Clancy's work, the book overall is a platform for Clancy to sell his own personal political views. However, this time around, it seems that this political diatribe has taken front seat to the plot itself, and makes for some very tedious reading for most of the book.Secondly, Mr. Clancy has become sloppy in his research, which is unfortunate, as the quality of his research has been a major selling point of much of his previous work. Particularly, his handling of Asia and Asian characters in the story is almost painful to anyone who has even the slightest second hand knowledge of modern culture and society in China or Japan. He has a habit of making sweeping authoritative statements about these two cultures which are embarrassingly inaccurate or outright wrong. Granted, as a resident of Japan I am biased in this regard, yet I feel any reader who has even been on vacation once in Asia will feel a bit uncomfortable with some of Clancy's blind mistakes. Granted, his previous work about an actual modern shooting war between Japan and the US was a major departure into the realm of fantasy, so perhaps we should not expect too much from Clancy regarding Asia.In closing, I wish to point out that other recent works of Clancy's have not had these problems of accuracy or readability, particularly those works which dealt with characters other than the venerable Mr. Ryan. Perhaps it's time for Mr. Ryan to retire? At least, I really hope he doesn't run for a second term in office......"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been reading Clancy books for years. While many of his more recent books have been disappointing, this one is by far the worst yet. The Bear and the Dragon is the first Clancy book that I found hard to finish. My comments:First - give the political rhetoric a break - PLEASE. I don't mind opinions, but not page after page of unnecessary preaching on the topic. There were points when I forgot whether I was reading a book or some ultra-conservative propaganda. Of course, that may be why some people actually like this book...Second - Ryan is not God. Ryan is not God. Ryan is not God. Just like in his previous 1000+ page books, Clancy builds up this almost impossible situation, and then the main characters make a marvelous and heroic come back. In Clancy's world, the good guys never make mistakes, never die, and are the most moral people in the world. Get real. I liked the Ryan character in Red October and Cardinal, but he's now gone past the point of being tired. I really hope that in his next novel, Clancy dumps this character, since I just don't think he can take him any further.Third - There was way too much superfluous background information that didn't do anything to the story. I felt like this book was more background information than plot. I think you could have made this a decent 500-page book. But at over 1000, it was boring. There were only a couple 'tense' parts, but even then, you knew the outcome before it started.Fourth - Clancy really seems to have left the plane of reality here. For some authors, this isn't a big deal, but for Clancy, he's always tried to make the plot seem somewhat feasible. Not here. I don't know how many times I thought \`yeah right' while reading this book.Finally (there is lots more I could say, but this is enough for now) - the thing I've come to dislike most about this book (and some of Clancy's other works) is they're predictable. You know the good guys are always going to prevail. They never die or get harmed, no matter how impossible the task. It's always the other guy that dies. It's kind of like Star Trek - the main characters always live to fight another day, but if an unknown crewman is part of an away mission, you know they're toast. The same is true here. Not one of the \`good' main characters died. I was hoping that the ICBM would succeed since it would have made for an interesting ending, rather than the tired and predictable one that you knew was coming.In summary, don't bother with this book unless you have lots of free time on your hand and/or you fervently support the current president in the white house. For anyone else, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation as I am (or was) a great Clancy fan, having bought ALL of his previous books. What a let down! Clancy is trying to be something that he obviously isn't. He tries to over-build his characters (one whole page of a character's thought processes is not uncommon - of course, liberally laced with vulgarities. he should leave the pseudo-literature work to the experts). I am appalled at his blatant stereotyping of China (fried panda penises? People in Mao suits roaming the streets? pleassseee...have you, Mr Clancy, visited China lately?). His writing borders on bigotry and perhaps crosses the line into racism. Ahh...the quintessential American right-wing cheer-leader, advocating hegemony; unabashedly ethnocentric. George W. would have been proud."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read the book, I've read the reviews on Amazon.com. All I can say is at least I borrowed the book instead of paying for it. Firstly, this is an exceptionally boring read. Clancy's incestuous attitude to things American is sickening - the level economic playing field he preaches was especially nauseating. His chauvinist style when writing about women is dated to say the least. His bigotted style when writing about all non-Caucasians would see him accepted into the KKK without too much trouble. His characters have not matured, rather have become caricatures, at best, of the American Catholic right. Clancy probably would've really enjoyed Jo McCarthy.Time to retire Tom. This last one is cornball rubbish."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is a only a shadow of the quality and storytelling ability that we have previously come to expect from Clancy.Contrary to many of Clancy's other works, this book demonstrates little or no understanding of China and even begs the question of whether the author has ever visited or indeed spoken to anyone who has visited China within the last 10 years.Even after factoring the necessity for atmosphere and a certain realism in dialogue, this book is clearly bigoted and racist in its treatment, description and characterization of the Chinese in addition to being factually flawed.I have enjoyed at least six of Clancy's previous books, however the Author seemed to be merely going through the motions to make some money here."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Sadly, Tom Clancy has discovered that his word processor makes it possible to keep cranking out words that don't tell a good story. Maybe if he had to re-type all that stuff he would be more selective. There may be a good 300-page book hiding in there but I kept losing track of characters, plot lines and any semblence of sustained suspense. In fact, along about mid way I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the people. Tom, get youself a really good editor and pay attention. Your writer's hubris has caused you to become a charicature of yourself. I give it one star because it took a lot of work -- mostly wasted -- to write a book so long for such small purpose. Maybe that's worth something."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was looking forward to this book just like the rest of the reviewers. Unfortunately I was diappointed as well, it took me about six months to finish this book, when I could normally finish a Tom Clancy book in about a week. You just had the feeling the Mr. Clancy was not having fun with this, and that he was just writing another Jack Ryan book just to keep his fans happy. The last good Jack Ryan book was Debt of Honor. I also had the feeling that he was on a soap box, with pages exposing his political views. This is not meant to be critical, I am just about as conservative as Mr. Clancy,but it seemed to detract from the book. I think he did this because he never did write a book he was planning to write,&quot;Reality Check&quot; several years ago. I can only hope that his next book he enjoys more, I have heard that he is planning on writing another Jack Ryan novel, but it is supposed to be different. After that lets hope he puts the Ryan series to rest, unless there will be more books with him after he leaves the White House. But I think it will be best if he invents new characters, and it will be better if we as his readers allow him to write something other that a Ryan book, it is not really not fair for us to constrain in that way."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is an example of a good first draft. TC needs to find a good editor and streamline the story. B&amp;G is at least 200 pages too long. The dialog is trite and adolescent...not worthy of the adults in the story. If TC wants to advance his political agenda, he should involve himself in politics. But to make his characters his voice is boring after awhile, and ultimately useless, because I skip over those parts. The Jack Ryan of Red October would slap Jack Ryan of B&amp;G for whining so much.It would serve a better purpose to write 200-300 pages of an encyclopedia of characters and events. I didn't have the luxury of re-reading the last five TC books to prepare for B&amp;G, so I missed out on some of the references. At the very least, use a few pages of the current novel to tell us where and how we first met these characters.The last 200 pages -- the battle -- are standard, enjoyable, Clancy. If you can survive the first 800 pages, then you have earned your treat."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Seems like every Clancy novel is getting more elaborate and therefore longer. While I found that the characterizations aren't that deep in The Bear &amp; The Dragon, Clancy spends a lot of time on the main plot, which is concerning China's desire to rule the world and how they might go about accomplishing it. Also, Clancy spends a lot of time on subplots and overall the story is well executed. I didn't like the excessive use of foul language which is absolutely unnecessary and it spoiled the book to some degree. Anyway, reading this Clancy is an experience. Another new thriller that features a possible China world domination scenario, but is faster paced than Clancy, and it is a very informative book, although it's plenty of entertaining, is the loaded action thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yes, it is long; written from an extremely conservative point of view and politically incorrect. In other words, just like all Clancy novels. If you are looking for a book that provides equal time to different points of view you should not be reading Clancy. The good guys win and the bad guys get blown away. I found the book to be very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"DEAR MR CLANCY,I HAVE READ ALL YOUR BOOKS, AND I AM A GREAT FAN OF YOURS. SO, I WAS VERY DISAPPINTED WITH THE BEAR BOOK. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN, AND SPENDING THE MONEY FOR THE BOOK WAS A JOY FOR ME TO DO, BUT A HARDSHIP AS WELL. I LOVE BOOKS, AND WANT TO PURCHASE MY FAVORITE AUTHORS, BUT MAYBE I SHOULD GET ANY BOOK YOU WRITE HEREAFTER, FROM THE LIBRARY."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been disappointed with some of the more recent offerings that Clancy has come up with, but the Bear and the Dragon was NOT a disappointment. I was immersed in the book from the moment I started reading. Unlike his most recent writings, the book didn't lag very much in the middle. Introducing us to CIA agent Nomuri brought back that element of spy intrigue that was missing from many of Clancy's books as of late. The book was long. But, all the reading was worth it for the smash bang ending that leaves you with your mouth hanging open and your eyes glued to every word. I just finished reading this book, and I wish there were another 500 pages to read. When you feel like that, that's a very good sign that the book you read was an excellent and well written book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This has to be the lowest for Clancy. Having read all of his novels, some are fun and some are rather boring but this is dumb. It is also shallow and insulting to men, women, professionals, Chinese, Japanese, Russians and just about everyone else. The dialogue sounds like something ten or eleven year old boys would write. Foley referring to his wife, the CIA Director, &quot;Not to busy for you baby...&quot;. &quot;Okay, honey-bunney&quot;.How about this-&quot;Women were all the same. Treat them in the right way, and they turn to wax in your hand, to be kneaded and shaped to your will.&quot;Clancy always has some clunkers but The Bear and the Dragon is gagging material."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read most of Clancy's Jack Ryan series back when I was a teenager and I liked them a lot. Clancy was a mediocre writer at best but I loved the clever plots and character developments. I was eager to read this book but it was a complete train wreak. Clancy used this book mostly to express his personal right wing political views, the plot was slow and so unrealistic that it's in the realm of fantasy. Of course there were the blatant stereotypes and racist slurs throughout the entire book that I will not repeat here. If you want to read a real military novel, read it from someone who had actually served in the military, not from Clancy who got a deferment in Vietnam and never wore a uniform in his life. After I finished the book I gave away my old Clancy collection to the library save for this one, which I promptly threw in the garbage (ok the recycling bin)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Why is it that seemingly every english speaking person on earth has a copy of this novel sitting on their bookshelf?Possibly the most bland, formulaic, unrealistic novel i have ever read. It constantly feels as though it is about to end, before you realise you still have 500 pages to go. It drags on and on.Tom Clancy writes like every other novelist in this genre, if indeed he does write the majority of his own books.This is trashy fiction in the extreme masquerading as something of a higher quality. There is no thinking involved. The 'what if' scenario of a Chinese invaision of Russia is about as far as this mediocre mass stretches the imagination, which is slightly less than your average 'Mr Men' installment.The number of hours i spent reading this book would have been better spent writing a book of equal volume about all varieties of paint ever conceived.Nausiatingly dull. The same as every other book he has ever written."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In my original review of this I said, and I quote, \\"This was his best book since Red October/Without Remorse. Mr.Clancy's books usually have to be viewed from the stand point that it COULD happen. This one does not have that element in it; it has the element that this could REALLY happen; it would not be all that difficult for it to happen. Simply put, the chain of events that lead to the plot are much more likely than those that were the plot of Hunt for Red October. The reader does not have to suspend disbelief to the same degree as most of his other works. The hardest thing in this book to do in fact, is to distinguish actual history from Jack Ryan's history. Mr. Clancy blends them that well. The ending of it is climactic, the most climactic ending in his books since Sum of All Fears or Red Storm Rising. The final paragraph seemed a little trite, but the book had me hooked, pinned, rivetted, and welded to it. He will be hard-pressed to top or equal it.\\"I was that impressed by the story, but after reading it and re-reading it over the last few years, I noticed a few quality errors and came to realize that this book was more manufactured than truly written. For example, whenever anyone refered to the one SDI expert they said he retired a \\"half colonel\\", including that character himself. Now, that phrase should be understandable to the reader, but, to my knowledge, Mr. Clancy invented the term as a slang term for a lieutenant-colonel. The terms I have heard for it are \\"light colonel\\" and \\"Louie Bird\\" or \\"light bird\\" (as opposed to \\"full bird\\"). Even if Mr. Clancy did not invent it, I doubt that every single person would have used \\"half colonel\\". Some would have used one of the others or even lieutenant colonel. Perhaps he invented the term so the reader would recognize the slang? Another example is the number and type of supposedly fairly diverse people who said \\"been there, done that\\". There were a few other examples that, upon reflection, seem to be stock phrases used by the author. This, also upon reflection, tends to make the protagonists all different versions of the same thing, to one degree or another. Basically, it helps make them flat, stock characters and not dynamic main ones.The story was and is still enjoyable,(to me) and while the antagonists may be stereotyped, as other, more Asiatically versed reviewers have stated, the blinding ambition of one man, coupled with the desire of his fellows to maintain their primacy, completed by the cultural barriers of the opposing groups, and crowned by the moral issue the author used as a catalyst make this story a worthy novel. It may not be worthy of five stars, but it was still \\"rivetting,\\" if I may slightly misquote my original review. Worth reading, if not as well crafted as the story deserved."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"(...) From page one I couldn't put this thick novel of suspense down. Clancy is a magnificent story teller. I love the recurring characters in all his books. It's like a military soap opera with dangerous politics and interesting subplots that wouldn't let me put it down and get any sleep. There is one scene--a woman having an unathorized birth in China--in the middle of the book that is undoubtedly the most suspenseful scene in a book that I've ever read. (... Tom Clancy) still is one of the most talented writers in America today. Keep writing.If you are mildly interested in buying this book, do. Take it from me, you won't regret it. I didn't. I can't wait until Clancy's next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon is, as usual, a highly plausible look into thefuture. Assuming, of course, the Russians actually discover oil and gold in Siberia. However, the story is secondary to me. I am much more interested in what this book has to says about the current state of Chinese society. Mr. Clancy has always had the supremacy of the American or way of life as a major theme in all of his books, and this one is most certainly no different. Who cares if he is a little more overt in expressing his political views...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of the TC novels, and although I do not feel this is is best work, I was still a good thriller. So many have bashed the politics of Jack Ryan and Tom Clancy, but when you make your main character president, he HAS to have some political affiliation and Jack not surprizingly has his creators'. All of Clancy's previous works have offered a deep insight into Jack Ryan's personality and beliefs, and the portrayal here is no different-- he has always been a passionate person who holds his ideals up on high. Now, he is not fighting to save his familiy or commandos left behind; he is fighting for what he BELIEVES is right for his country. You may not agree, but I doubt we all agree about the actions of any president-- fictional or not.Yea, Jack complains about his job many times, maybe too many. Yea, there was more profanity than I can recall in his previous work. And, yea, there were some phrases and analogies used more than once. Maybe it is time for Jack to retire and become an ambassador somewhere to become a more minor character.Still, that doesn't spoil what was a good story with the usual intricate plotting and realism that is classic Clancy!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like most Clancy fans, I anxiously awaited his new book. Needless to say, it was pretty disappointing. The juvenile language between the Foley characters was sickening and it was difficult to try and connect any of the bazillion subplots. I got through nearly 400 pages but I think I'm going to put this one down for awhile. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle that he was no John Kennedy. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is no &quot;Executive Orders.&quot; Hopefully, the next Ryan book will be better!."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's newest book is going to be a long read; if you take the plunge be prepared.THE GOOD: The latest Jack Ryan thriller is an exciting read, Clancy delivers the usual techno-espionage, world war, and threat of nuclear annihilation along with the complexity of plot and character that we have all come to expect. Plus it is always nice to read another adventure with Jack Ryan outsmarting the Communists- even if they aren't Russian anymore.THE BAD: I can remember reading his books when they were much closer to reality- before the world leaders had personalized names and agendas that differed from the news headlines of the day. It seems each new book Clancy writes takes us another step away from the real world. This is something that bothered me about _Bear and Dragon_: you know that it will Never happen. In this sense _Clear and Present Danger_ is more relevant to modern America than another Jack Ryan story. Thinking that his stories 'just might' happen was always the biggest draw for Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I give this book 4 stars because I would still rather read 1000 pages from Tom Clancy than any number of pages from most other novelists. That having been said, I think there were two factors that made this book a little disappointing: a) The sudden ending. I agree with those reviewers who felt the book lurched to a sudden halt. There were already 1028 pages, why not another 30 or 50 to flesh out the last segment? b) The lack of real tension. Aside from a couple of very good segments, there was little tension in the book. We all knew what was going to happen, how it was going to happen, and that the bad guys couldn't stop it. Surprises, the hallmark of the classic Clancy books, were few and far between.I don't know if Mr. Clancy reads these reviews, but if he does I would like to offer a couple of suggestions (I paid for the book, I have the right to offer advice): a) Put some real stress on the U.S. military. Bring up the nightmare scenario of more crises than there are resources to meet them (say, simultaneous eruptions in the Middle East and Korea). Make it so victory must be achieved through real blood, sweat, and tears rather than unbeatable technology. And it wouldn't hurt to kill off an established character or three. b) Alternatively, and I know this is drastic, drop the Ryan timeline. I know that would be painful (I'd miss him too) but there's only so much farther you can go here anyway. I always thought Red Storm Rising was your best book anyway. It might be time to find a new story (maybe not even related to the U.S.) and go in that direction. That might make it easier to recapture the excitement of your best work. Just don't be like Larry Bond and use the same old terrorist plot over and over again.Anyway, I still recommend picking this book up, it's not that bad a read. It's just not what we've come to expect from the master."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Typical Clancy fair is buried in this book, hi-tech weapon systems, clever spys and counter-spys, tension filled chases. Unfortunately it is surrounded by lots, and I mean a LOT of crap. In particular we get treated to Clancy prosetlyzing on abortion, race relations, human rights, and even the difficulties of being President. There is a GREAT 350 page book in here somewhere, surrounded by another 700 pages of useless verbosity. Why did I slog through it? Because I was on an airplane that was going to be in the air 10 hrs and sleeping was out of the question. If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend or check it out from the library. Someone needs to give Clancy's editor a better shot at cutting out the parts of the book that don't contribute to the story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Granted that it's always easy to promote a book when your publishing company invest ton of money on a sure winner (like any Clancy book) you can expect &quot;raving&quot; reviews from the media and some type of readers.But, nay, this is not literature: is a gigantic salad of common places, a mixture of techno blurb and doubtful scenarios, of very obvious data, and a plot thar was written by a word processor filled with not more than 1000 words.It's really amazing that this post cold war, pre new century nouvelle (I do not care that it sports more than 1K pages) finds its place in the world, and that it will make money for Clancy,.DO yourself a favour and please switch to a real book"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Poor Tom Clancy. He not only receives the largest advance ever paid for a novel, he has to drag it out for over a thousand pages in order to get a hundred pages of action.His first books - Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, Red Storm Rising - had not only well-defined characters but also ran with a good story line. Clancy has reduced himself to formulaic dramatics, hackneyed phrases, and (often) disjointed dialogue to punctuate a meandering plot that bogs down in minutiae. Too bad.The final section of the book is loaded with his usual military hardware references, technical jargon - all that 'good ole boy' military stuff, which is fine. But once you get past the opening gratuitous lingerie/softcore porn sequence in Beijing (which unfortunately resurfaces at the end), there are so many convolutions of subplot (many of which are never resolved) and dropped characters (whatever DID happen to Zhang?) it's impossible to view this as a finished book.Rah, Rah, wave the flag all you want, Clancy, but at least clean up your (nonexistant) ending! '...And they all went to the seashore....' really doesn't make it. Japanese sausage indeed!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Very much a Clancy thriller, but not the techno-thrillers like his earlier works. While the first 700 pages are a bit of a drag at times, the final 300 pages move at a nice clip. Too bad the conclusion is a bit similiar to another of his earlier books. (His other recycled idea involves the press being in the right place at the right time, setting the stage for world opinion.) Maybe if the first part was limited to 300 pages and the last to 700 pages, this might have been another great Clancy story.Though satisfied with the overall story and writing, the Jack Ryan character is becoming rather unlikeable, unless you're a die-hard right wing, old school GOP, card carrying, gun totting grumpy old man.By far, Clancy's worst effort in an especially great story line."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Was disappointed in the audio book, is that the plot/sub plots that Tom Clancy has perfected in previous books is lacking to say the least. How can I believe that the US &amp; Russia would totally disarm their nuculear missile capabilities and leave China as the only nation with missiles? The Jack Ryan character is weak &amp; hardly the main character of the book.The NEC salesman (Japanese Sausage) and Ming seem to be the main characters of the 1st 2 tapes. Clancy tries to recover by interjecting his famous technical jargon, but it falls way short of previous novels (I think all the gizmos have been invented and used in previous novels). Darkstar, so what! If the US is the superpower of the world, we are projected as short on bombs, missiles, and a so-called anti missile defense system. If this novel is supposed to stir concern over our military capabilities, then maybe he is right on the money.It's time for Clancy to start a new set of characters, since these are getting lame &amp; boring since he started this trilogy with Debt Of Honor.I am glad I only had to listen to 6 hours on audio tape, I don't know if I could read 1,000+ pages if it was going to be 250 pages devoted to the &quot;Japanese sauasge&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I preordered this book in February, and could not wait to get my hands on it. When I finally did, I was somewhat disappointed. The dialogue is not the same as in his other books. The characters are weak. The plot is great, but the treatment of countries and people is not. Overall a good read, but a disappointment for a true Clancy fan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and The Dragon is truly a great tale of espionage and warfare. However, for many reasons it pales in comparison to Clancy's truly classic works, such as: Sum of All Fears, Clear and Present Danger and Debt of Honor. First this book is almost 400 pages too long. The true military conflict does not occur until the 600s. To compound the problem, after all those pages of build up the conflict abruptly ends and you are actually left wondering if the book is missing pages after number 1,028. Also, the content of this book is full of sexually explicit language, sexual inuendo (some implicitly referring to a President Clinton who would not exist in the Jack Ryan presidency/legend Clancy has created), perverse &quot;facts&quot; that are oddly coupled with pro-life mandates and sentiments. The strange sexual &quot;facts&quot; become even stranger as they are repeated, ad nauseum, by several different characters in different settings and situations throughout the book. If one can look past these shortcomings (and get through the novel in less than a month), one will find a clever and interesting story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"All of his books are too long and this one is waaaaaaay to long. In the past, I didn't care because I would just scan through much of his rambling because the bottom line was the books were enjoyable. But this one is boring. Once the action finally starts, around page 750, the passages are wordy and without any real imagination. Does Clancy get paid by the word?Lastly, we all know he is a conservative Republican but the inclusion of his political views so many times was uncalled for.The writer of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;A Clear and Present Danger&quot; is taking himself way to seriously has apparently killed the Golden Goose."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It is very disappointing to write a poor review on a Clancy novel. One of my favorite authors. The good is that you get to renew all the characters of the previous books that have not been killed off and you enjoy. The story line is disappointing in that it is almost a rehash of the last books with different villians. The most disappointing is even though the book is 1000 pages none of the characters has enough of a central theme to identify with unless they are old friends from previous readings. There were pages upon pages of preaching on all kinds of issues somewhat akind to Ann Rand (Atlas Shrugged). Hope he can find the forumula if there is a next book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is not only the originator of the &quot;techno-thriller&quot; genre, he is also a master of writing multiple theatres of simultaneous action. He reached his peak at this in the novel Debt of Honor which ended with Jack Ryan not only becoming President but the rest of the government almost completely wiped out. In Executive Orders, Clancy continues the story of Ryan as President and facing an international conspiracy designed to further cripple the United States. In The Bear and the Dragon, Ryan has been elected to the office Of POTUS in his own right but there is another global conspiracy that he has to deal with. This time, however, the United States joins forces with the &quot;new&quot; Russia against China and her hard line, shortsighted leaders. The last two books in the Jack Ryan saga, however, are markedly different from his previous thrillers in that an extensive amount of print is devoted to Clancy's (as Jack Ryan) personal political philosophy. The story lines themselves are quite intriguing and well thought out, as usual. I found, however, that if the political editorializing were left out, the manuscripts would be shorter by at least 200 pages. For me, that interfered with the pace of the story and ended up leaving the page turning action to the very end of the book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy enthusiasts may be disappointed with this tome. It is not that the story is less well-told - Clancy has lost none of his talent in that respect - it is more a matter of there being less to tell. Admittedly, since the collapse of the Evil Empire, writers of techno-thrillers have been hard up to find reliable, competent villains, but there is still lots of evil around, and up to now Clancy has been able to articulate it in an interesting and believable fashion. Upon putting the book down, I expect most readers will agree that he should have let the Chinese H-bomb explode!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a fan of Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, and Executive Orders, I've always loved the detail given to his plots and characters. So when I bought the book, I figured its size was due to another intricate plot.Instead, what I got was a bulked up story filled with retreads of statements made in the older books and repetitive quotes from the characters(How many times do I have to be reminded that widows of the condemned are charged for the executioner's bullet?!?), and blatantly racist remarks. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I love TC's books. I found myself skimming a lot of the detail in this one. I enjoy long books. The main characters and the plot are fleshed out more than their abbreviated counterparts, but this book dwelled more on the minute detail. I love Clancy's characters from Mancuso down to Meng, but I didn't get to know them as well as I would have liked in this novel. I am a bit of a technical person so the references to AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems (one word Tom) made the story more realistic for me. Still Tom Clancy is better than no Tom Clancy. The parts of the book that were fantastic made up for the parts that weren't."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As an avid Clancy reader, I buy his books the day they come off the presses and have enjoyed them all to varying degrees (I thought Clear and Present Danger and Red Storm Rising were the best!). However, the subtle racism in this book, the foul language of the characters (I don't think any character went 2 pages without swearing), teamed with an exceedingly far-fetched plot made this the first Clancy book that I simply skimmed the last 200 pages to get to the end. I may be naive, but somehow I am uncomfortable with the President of the United States, even if he is not a career politician, calling the Chinese &quot;our yellow friends&quot; and continually comparing them to Nazi Germany without also offering the logic that defends the comparison. I realize that Tom has run out of scenarios in which to create mass conflict, but his strength has always been in his suspension of disbelief, or allowing the reader to believe that the events may actually take place. This one starts out under those pretenses but never seems to take you to the end. Overall, this book falls far short of that mark."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm an avid Clancy fan, but this time I just don't get it. Perhaps 1000 pages of brain-numbing dialogue, cursing and coarse sex was just too much. Clancy launches numerous themes in this book that just don't work. Nor do they peak to grabbing resolution. We have trade wars, espionage, murder mysteries, political intrigue, counterterrorism and war. . . all of which fall flat. Why? Because any one of these should take an entire book. So, endless pages of &quot;staging&quot; end with little satisfaction. Worse, many of his climaxes just don't work. Do we really think Marine One could land on a cruiser without the helo saying, &quot;hey, this is Marine One requesting assistance to land?&quot; Oh, but in the book no one knows the president is aboard the ship. Or, in just one page 100 Chinese tanks conveniently parked side by side get destroyed by a few bombs. Wow, in a small number of pages, the whole PLA is wiped out. Unrealistic. And, as others have said, how much presidential complaining and senseless opining can we take? This book is not worth $30, and it's not worth the time to read it. Tom, perhaps it's time to retire."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Usually I cannot put down a Tom Clancy book but this one I can read 30 or 40 pages and then go on to something else I have to do. It is very very wordy. The text repeats itself in several of the chapters. I found myself flipping through the book trying to follow the plot to the end, I have not finished reading this book, I may never do so with the joy I had with other Clancy novels. I agree with other reviewers when they stated one gets tired of Jack Ryan griping about being president. I like the character but this is to much, not realistic. The book so far has been a disappointment. I should have purchased the audio tape, then I would have gotten the story without all the endless words of dialogue."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was disappointed with Clancy for his lack of research. In the first few chapters he mentions people being paid with euros for a job and the Vice President giving a speech at Long Beach Naval Shipyard. The euro was introduced in January 1999, the LB Naval Shipyard was closed in September 1997 and was mostly leveled by the time the euro was introduced."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Perhaps not 100% accurate in his description of the Chinese, still some stuff was pretty close. I only enjoyed disagreeing with the parts i found innacurate while reading the book. Overall I found it very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a hard core Tom Clancy fan I found loads of the stuff that attracted me to Clancy in the first place...technically accurate mititary and governmental intrigue. In testing his skills at adding a little sex to his novels failed. Even I can come up with better name for it than a &quot;sausage.&quot;The smartest thing Tom did, especially with 1,000 pages, was to keep the sexual encounters brief. He doesn't need the sex to be good, that what puts him above writers who have to rely on it to sell their books.Speaking as an avid reader of 1 to 2 books a week, I was not in the least bit turned off by the length. He had my attention all the way through and I'm all for longer books from Clancy and others.Well worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's right wing-nut politics are over exposed in this one. Of the 1,000+ pages, there are 500 pages of a good (not great) story, 300 pages of unnecessary detail (the minutia is overwhelming), and 200 pages of Clancy's overactive ego. This is not near a good as the early Clancy books (Red October or Red Storm). The ending was predictable, anti-climactic and incomplete. Clancy again demonstrates how misogynistic and racist he is. His revisionism of history is particularly annoying. He doesn't seem to remember his &quot;heroes'&quot; failings: Nixon (Watergate and Viet Nam, &quot;we could've won&quot;); Reagan (Iran/Contra, Ollie North ignoring the law); and Bush (Gulf War with the not-so-smart or effective weapons against an incompetent foe.) I recommend The Partner, by Grisham."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, Russia possessing oil and gold, an attempted assassination of their intelligence leader, a Chinese plot to invade Siberia . . . hang on, didn't Eric L. Harry do this one in PROTECT AND DEFEND, as another reviewer quite rightly said? The answer may be yes, but in spite of this gripe, this Clancy monster is well worth a read. There's one thing you all know about Tom Clancy. You either love him or hate him. The regular characters - President Jack Ryan, John Clark(in his RAINBOW SIX guise!), Ed and Mary Pat Foley, Sergey Golovko and the evil genius Chinese leader Zhang Han San, who featured in EXEC ORDERS in a subplot that seemed to go nowhere . . . well now it's finally continued. Right. The multiple plots involve US-Japanese CIA agent Chester Nomuri buying lingerie(no blatant advertising as Clancy did for a whole chapter on where it came from, what it was made of, etc, etc(yawn)) for Zhang's secretary Lian Ming to seduce her - in order to get military secrets? Come on!Even Colin Forbes's cheesy portrayals of Britain's SIS are more plausible than this! Next, trade relations break down between the US and China after the shooting of Vatican archbishops promoting Christianity in China to give the country a new purpose - live on satellite TV(another advert for a news channel in THIS chapter!). China is in crisis. When the oil and gold reserves are learned of, the big shooting war begins. This section alone is enough to warrant this book 4 stars as badly prepared Russian forces and assisted by the US, and the latest in military technology. And the climax, well, that was a winner, but not giving too much away, it would have been more fun if things had worked out differently . . . Not to worry. If you can get over the elephantine narrative, the ultra-right-wing opinions forced down the reader's throat - although Clancy is quite Consitutional, he is entitled to express his views, albeit himself or through the dialogue of a fictional character - the sometimes unintentionally funny satire in the White House scenes with Ryan and Arnie Van Damm(President's advisor) discussing the day's issues(and polar bear rugs and health nazis!), you have a thoroughly entertaining novel. The last 250 pages or so is well worth getting to! Though, of Clancy's recent novels, RAINBOW SIX is preferable. Read all the reviews here and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Being an avid Tom Clancy fan, I will always read his books. He is the greatest plot weaver ever! I am addicted to the action and suspense, when there is some. However, as the years go by, his novels have increased in length, but not in excitement. I am sad to say I could put this book down anytime and did on many occasions. It took me more than three weeks to complete it. I read Rainbow Six in less than a week, and I thought at times it was wordy. I love his characters Jack Ryan, Clark and Domingo and the Rainbow Six Team, the CIA members, even Golovkov etc. However, it seemed they were just a side story in this book weaved into a history lesson of weapons and battle strategies. I don't ever remember skimming over so many endless details, descriptions, and redundancies. Paragraphs and paragraphs of useless (to the story) information about equipment and peoples' lives. I don't have to know everything there is to know about every single piece of equipment or character in the book! I think he should stick to one name per person too. Do I need to know their given names, code names, Russian names, nicknames, pet names...? Or at the very least, don't interchange them throughout the book, it is confusing trying to remember who everyone was.I think even with Ryan in the white house there could be hope for his character, with classic Clancy imagination, and who knows in maybe even less than 1,000 pages. I was excited when he mentioned Rainbow Six, but they were never utilized to their potential. To say the least, I was dissapointed. I think the plot had potential, but got lost somewhere along the way. I usually feel like joining the CIA when I finish one of his books. This time, I just wanted to finish.I should say, TC is still my favorite author. I just think if he wants to write books about historical fiction, then so be it. Don't confuse us into thinking that the books are his suspense novels with our favorite characters.If you are a TC fan then this book is a must read, just so you can keep up with your favorite characters' lives, because I think he manages to mention every character he has ever written about. If you are not an avid Tom Clancy fan, don't start with this one, start with his early works and learn how good he really can be."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is (was) on a list of a select group of authors whose books I purchase as soon as they are released. I eagerly await such publications. To say that I was disappointed with the B&amp;D is an understatement. This is a poorly written book! Too much Tom, too little Jack."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The novel, The Bear and The Dragon, by Tom Clancy is an extremely enjoyable story. It is written in much the same way as his other novels. Clancy uses several different and seemingly unrelated subplots in order to draw his story to a conclusion. One section of a chapter could be devoted to a CIA agent in Beijing, China, and the next section could jump to the investigation of an assassination in Moscow, Russia. As the story progresses, the different sections are strung together by several different methods. Clancy's novel is also extremely factual. The vast majority of his settings are real places and his events are compared to non-fiction events from past history, so as to give the reader something to compare the event to. Another positive aspect of this fiction is the great detail in which Clancy describes the characters in the book. Not only does the reader have a superb idea of the characters' physical traits, but each characters thoughts and mannerisms are examined until the reader gets the sense that he knows each character as a real person, not just an imaginary figure. One aspect of the book that could turn readers away, however, is the great detail in which the violence and gore are described. Clancy goes further than explaining the facts of the killings by elaborating on severed parts of the body and detailing the faces of dead men in a way that an actual image of the men is transposed into the reader's mind. Another negative point of the book is the usage of ethnic slurs, offensive to both minorities and Caucasians. Clancy uses the term &quot; slanty eyes&quot; more than once to refer to Oriental people and in the same sense referes to white people as &quot;round eyes.&quot; The final aspect of the novel that could be offensive is Clancy's repeated references to sexual organ and participation in sexual activity. One entire subplot of the story is dedicated to a CIA agent who uses sex and seduction to pull top secret information out of a secretary. Several statements made by characters in the story also refer to the reproductive organs. I found the novel, The Bear and The Dragon, to be immensely enjoyable. Clancy shows a dedication to making the book and its characters as realisitc as possible, and as a side effect, the language, thoughts, and actions of the characters are not sugarcoated. This book could be equally enjoyed by both men and women. If you like a novel that pays extensive attention to detail and is extremely true to the real world and real-life actions of people, then The Bear and The Dragon, by Tom Clancy, is the perfect book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After a diversion into various paperback series, Tom Clancy returns to his Jack Ryan saga. This story continues the growing conflict between forces within the PRC and the US. The storyline is well crafted and slowly pulls the reader into the Ryan world. The later half of the book captures the reader becoming a &quot;can't put it down&quot; book. The only drawback is the ending. The end had a &quot;magic bullet&quot; feel and tainted an otherwise well crafted book. Mr. Clancy writes a good story and really adds to the Ryan world with Bear and Dragon. However, as the story develops, some of the plot is predictable, showing that Mr. Clancy may have fallen into a formula/rut for his Ryan storyline. Nevertheless, for all Clancy fans this is a great story and for new readers, it shows why Mr. Clancy is such a successful story-teller."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first 700 pages were mostly boring - developing each character way too much. All kinds of subplots that have little or nothing to do with the main book. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands following surgery I would have put the book down long ago. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I will be the first one to admit that I am a huge Clancy fan, I buy all of his books the day they come out. While doing a great job of manipulating the readers emotions over the happenings in Communist China, the book does seem overly long, with a rushed ending. I would have liked to see some of the loose ends wrapped up better. There were a lot of typos in this book. With as much money as Putnam is going to make off of this book at $28.95 per copy, pay an editor (or run spell check for God's sake) before printing hundreds of thousands of them. The scenes with the Rainbow troopers were covered too lightly, and the bedroom scenes were covered too heavily. I can't complain about Clancy's political posturing, because I happen to share most of his views on politics. I really enjoyed this book, but it is not as good as his previous efforts."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Looks like others have said it all already, but I wanted to add my thumbs down. Boring, repetitive, absurd plot. In the real world, the Chinese are looking for innovative new ways to defeat the United States -- but you won't see any of that here. Clancy's Chinese are DUMB and PREDICTABLE. All too many of Clancy's own infantile political opinions shine through in this book (and who needs that). Worst of all, it's a 1000 page book, and the war doesn't even start until page 800. Get an editor, Tom! In short, I was glad someone gave this to me as a gift, because I'd be very angry if I'd paid money for it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a very long time fan of Clancys, but I have to say that I am having a really hard time finishing the book. Stuck at 300 pages despite spending my usual two week winter vacation in a cabin in Northern NH for the sole purpose of reading and relaxing. In the past, Clancy has been a staple on the reading list on my annual literary trek to the woods. Even with nothing else to do besides keeping the wood stove going and hauling water from the lake, I just keep picking up books by other authors, in and out of the genre.The most satisfying of these has been China Card by Tom Blood. I think this is his first novel and it is a breakthrough work that puts Clancy to shame in terms of intricate plot and the weaving together of several elements including -- political intrigue, espionage, sex and realistic guy to guy relationships in tough situations.Try that book. It may spoil your future Clancy reading, but, for my part it has not diminished my other favorite authors including Larry McMurtry (I am finishing Boones Lick -- an really good, quick read). That also, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What can I say. I love Tom Clancy's novels. I particularly like the way he keeps introducing his old characters, from the Navy puke who was on the Red October (and is now CINCPAC), to, of course Jack Ryan, who is now POTUS. Tom, as always, gets a bit wordy and off the track when I prefer to read about the action. But, as always, he is ahead of his time in writing about politics, the international situation, and our military technology. Well, perhaps he goes a bit overboard on how good and flawless we are (I'm a retired Army Colonel), but I want to believe it and I enjoy reading about it. And he continues to keep me on the edge of my reading chair. Thanks, Tom, for keeping my interest, and keep writing about Jack Ryan and his team."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I own every book in Jack Ryan series, and have read each book at lease twice. I bought this book the moment it came out, but actually had to struggle to finish it. That's a first.The story is global in its scale as expected, with a ton of different sub-plots that makes you ask &quot;what's the point of this?&quot;, yet come together nicely at the end, the subplots merging together in an explosive climax. This is all expected of Tom Clancy novels. I expect to read through a few hundred pages of plot development, and I'm used to it, but this book really pushed the limit. Too many times I was asking &quot;can something substantial PLEASE happen???&quot;Wanting to find out about the on-going plot of the Jack Ryan world, in continuation of the previous novels, kept me going. But a book should not make the reader &quot;work&quot; to stay interested. In the end, the conclusion DID live up to previous novels, but again, it just took too much work to get there...Beginning with Executive Orders, the books take an almost &quot;first person&quot; perspective of the Jack Ryan character. Readers are exposed to the very thought process of Jack Ryan, as opposed to implied character development through seeing the actions of the character in previous novels. Nothing wrong there, except the same info is repeated over and over again. I'm not sure if was ok for the readers who are new to Tom Clancy, but having read previous work, the information got old read quick. I'm absolutely sick of exchanges between Jack and Arnie that goes like - JR :&quot;I hate this job. I didn't ask for it.&quot; AVD:&quot;You didn't have to take the job, remember? You could have run away, but you didn't. So suck it up!&quot;It seems many readers were offended by the coarse language, explicit sexuality, apparent racism in picking on Asians as enemies, and blatant political preachings. The amount of cursing and sex has increased in TC's novels and I thought it went beyond what was necessary in this book... I hope this isn't a trend. In regards to perceived racism, I had no problem with it. TC likes to keep the potential threats in the book mirror the ongoing world events. With the demise of USSR, the potential threat has shifted to hostile Middle East and the Pacific rim. I think TC adapted well to the ongoing changes. And since the books portray US at war with this nations, its only natural for the characters to speak unfavorably about them. As for blatant political views, it is a natual result of character development and this book's &quot;first person view&quot;. I don't understand people who have a problem with that. Jack Ryan is an extension of Tom Clancy's views. If Tom Clancy was NOT writing about things he believes in with passion, what's the point of reading that book? How can a book written not to offend anybody be worth reading?Anyway, in conclusion, its a Tom Clancy novel. It has a great ending. But be prepared to work through it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"My favorite Clancy novel is &quot;Clear and Present Danger.&quot; His new book &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; doesn't come close. In fact I didn't like the excessive foul language throughout the book. The story is still interesting, but it goes on forever. If Clancy would have used more contemporary locations for this thriller and not the traditional surroundings, it would have been a much better book. I'm sure this book is going to make a good movie, if they cut out the bad language. Based on a friend's recommendation I just read through another brand new thriller in this genre and I highly recommend it as it is fast paced, loaded with action, excellent plot, info and research and plausible scenarios, which is the explosive megathriller &quot;THE CONSULTANT&quot; by Alec Donzi."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Was this book worth 2 1/2 months of my time. No way! If I had no other books to read or nothing else to do, then this book was pretty good. But it does not compare to previous Clancy novels nor does it stand on its own as a high quality novel. Where is the action? Where is the suspense? Looking back, what exactly happened the first six hundred pages since there was no action or suspense. I guess it was filled with events leading up to the climactic battle between China and Russia, an event we all knew was going to happen based on the title.This novel had no suspense. We all knew what was going to happen in the end. Also, having the same characters in every novel gets kind of old. Clancy needs to create a new line of refreshing characters because he often assumes we remember these characters from previous novels and the characters are turning into cardboard cutouts that are just there to further the action.Not a good effort from Clancy. I used to like his books because they were long enough to be worth the money I pay for them. I hope he does better next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Overall I thought this was a pretty good book. It's by far Mr Clancy's longest book(over 1,000 pages). If you can get through the first 500 pages, everything starts to come together and make sense. I've read all of Clancy's novels and have enjoyed the Adventures of Jack Ryan....but I think it's time to retire the Jack Ryan character. I think he's taken Ryan about as far as he can and it's time to turn to something else. Clancy makes alot of references to WWII so maybe he should try some WWII or Civil War novels?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Get an editor for the 1,000 plus pages of text containing repetitions of entire paragraphs, spelling errors and misuse of words. Get more thorough research on all countries that are central to the action.This book had the opportunity to educate Americans about the people and culture of the PRC, and increase international understanding of our differences and similarities. Instead, Clancy has shown us cliche mainland Chinese - and hasn't even gotten their names right! (Chinese keep the names they are born with all their lives, and they are said &quot;last name&quot; first.)Back to the drafting board, Tom!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Should be renamed the sloth and the draggin. I have never seen such redundancy in a novel. It could have been handled in 400 pages;it certainly did'nt need 1050. And dirty language! 100 pages could have been eliminated by cutting out the cuss words. What a disappointment compared with &quot;Red October&quot;!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Okay, all of you...put the Clancy books down and step away from the cash register. I mean if he won't bother to write them, why should we be buying them? It's Oprah's Book Club for Men - &quot;Must...buy...new...Tom...Clancy...book&quot; Move on, you can sure tell he has. This is another dim-witted over-politicized, shallow thriller about our dear old Jack Ryan. The thing is, I feel really bad that Jack has to put up with being put in these situations again and again to sell books. I'll suspend disbelief, but Jack Ryan as President? Please. The early books were truly great, very gripping and fun to read, but God help me if I buy another one. Fool me once, shame on you...fool me 14 times... 5 to 1 the next book is ghost written."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I think drivel is putting it mildly though. This is one of the worst books i've ever read, especially at 1100 pages. Ever hear of an editor Tom? So the story goes like this: BIG SPOILERS. President Ryan, who we're constantly reminded is a man of the people, decides to implement the Trade Reform Act against China. Excuse me, but isn't this the same law that caused a war with Japan in Debt of Honor? I thought Jack Ryan had a doctorate in History, but apparently he can't even remember what happened 5 years earlier. Well guess what, the law causes another war, only this time with China, who has nuclear weapons. Great job there Jacky boy. But mind you, the war doesn't even start until page 900, and then it's your standard Ra Ra America Rules war, where the pathetic Russians who we're helping don't know a rifle stock from a hole in the ground.I won't go onto the actual ending, but rest assured that you know exactly what's going to happen around page 300, but then you have to wait through 800 more pages of kindergarten politics (i can't count how many times someone said \\"it's not fair\\"), racial epithets, pregnant secret service agents who are puking on the job (great protection there Jack), and Vice President Robby Jackson saying \\"ya dig\\" in cabinet meetings. what a joke.i actually started just reading the dialogue from the scenes with americans, and yet i still knew exactly what was going to happen, and nothing was confusing (indicating i didn't miss a thing). So Tom, quit feeling like you have to actually USE every piece of research you get, hack it down to about 500 pages, and actually put some suspense in your \\"suspense thriller\\". oh yeah, and quit making your main character so flippin stupid. i'm done."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is hitting rock bottom with this book. It's not only long (all of them are) but totally unnecessarily so. The plot moves forward at snail-pace. The repetitions soon get very boring, the blatant racism towards the chinese extremely annoying, and the fact that the rest of the story is obvious to the reader when there is about a thousand pages left of the book is just daft!The worst part, though, is probably the neanderthal level of the dialogue among the &quot;heroes&quot; of this story. If this reflects in any way the intellectual level of the US president and his advisers - well, then I am scared! In sum, the book stinks. Stay away."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan and when I did see his latest book &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; I couldn't wait to buy and read it. Looking back at it, this is my worst buy ever. I live myself in Asia (as a European) and really, Tom Clancy should have stayed out of Asia, because his views of Asia are biased, racist and simply WRONG. Besides this, the book is just never really starting of and very dreadful. I expected much better from Tom Clancy.."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The last Tom Clancy book I will ever buy. After 100 pages I've ground to a halt. I can't take it any more.Tom, do yourself a favour: hire an editor. Hire 10 editors. Better yet, get yourself copies of JK Rowling's 'Harry Potter' books. Written for children, but light-years ahead of anything you can do."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A pathetic, narcissistic excuse of a story line with cardboard characters. The storyline is entirely unbelievable...all good ideas are from one side, all sagacious leaders are from one side, all heroes are from one side, all mistakes are from the other side... I suppose the claptrap about the weapons may interest some but anyone looking for a realistic description of international intrigue by evenly matched players is wasting his time here..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Thought it was a bit much to read a novel of over 1000 pages, but I was surprised a bit at the fluidity of the plot. The climax is in grand Clancy fashion, a cataclysmic armageddon where the good guys come out on top and the bad guys wind up dead, or in a fate worse than death - public humiliation (which I guess to many politicians is indeed worse than death).Now - some criticisms that prevented me from giving him 5 stars: Clancy seems to use the characters' code names (like &quot;swordsman&quot; for Jack Ryan, &quot;surgeon&quot; for his wife, etc.) for whole entire chapters that I think detracts from the readability of the novel. It was to the point where I had to make a list with the characters' names and their corresponding code names so I would know who was doing what and to whom. It was rather tedious on that point.Another point which I had once thought unworthy of Mr. Clancy is his very thinly veiled racism toward Asians in general and Chinese in particular. While in his other novel, &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; the Japanese were largely portrayed in a fairly neutral light, (except of course, the chief bad guys) his other novel &quot;Without Remorse&quot; referred to the Vietnamese as &quot;barbarians,&quot; &quot;arrogant, cruel, and stupid.&quot; While that should have hinted at Clancy's racist tinge, he saves his most vituperous descriptions of Asians for this novel - describing the Chinese as &quot;Klingons&quot; and generally giving the reader the impression that the Chinese are something other than human, with other than human motives driving them. In this aspect, I am rather disappointed in Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Heyho USA thats what I think after reading this book, One of Clancy's worst books (SSN is worse) and thinking I loved Rainbox six.While the politics part isn't that bad, the military part sure is, I think Eric L Harry's Protect&amp;Defend is far supperior on the same topic (China invading Russia for the recource deposits).Its just insulting to read how supperior US forces are towards everything else, lacks all sence of realism here.(can't remeber a single US casualty)No after reading this one I hesitate to buy any new Clancy book!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This novel was about twice as long as it needed to be to tell the story. Someone needs to introduce TC to a good editor, because there was no excuse for the length of this book. It really bogged down the pace and made the novel a chore to read. There was a time when you could count on TC for good tight writing, but those days appear to be over. He hasn't been the same since EXECUTIVE ORDERS. His earlier works are still his best. After this fiasco, it will be a long time before I pick up another Clancy novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"IF YOU LOVE TOM CLANCY'S BOOKS AS MUCH AS I DO THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON WILL BE A MASSIVE DISSAPOINTMENT. SHOULD YOU STILL DECIDE TO TRY IT AND AFTER 10 HOURS OF READING YOU STILL CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING OF INTEREST...THEN DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STOP READING THIS WORTHLESS BOOK. I WISH I HAD TAKEN MY OWN ADVICE. IT IS SO BAD THAT I WILL NEVER BUY A CLANCY WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING THE COSTOMER REVIEWS."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"For starters Clancy needs a new editor. His current one is sloppy enough to allow entire sections to be repeated continously, such as Ryan questioning over how he got to be president. A more cynical person might suspect he was being paid by the word, or he suspects his audience are tired business executives who need to be reminded what is going on as their brains have disitegated due to chronic jet-lag.The characters are one-dimensional and Clancy shows the weakness of his convictions by making every hero anti-abortion and the bad guys pro-abortion (and to make sure you get it, he equates child killing, which is carried out in the book, with terminating a 3 week old fetus).This is clearly shown by a lack of courage over the whole issue. As one of the characters is expecting a baby, instead of making her question her beliefs, by giving her a down sydrome kid, the baby is of course alright as she's one of the heros.Originally I was going to finish the book before writing this review, but I gave up at page 600, as the plot started to get so bad I have better things to do with my time.So to summarize, the world would be a better place if Clancy never writes another book, so we can remember the excellence of 'The Hunt for Red October&quot; and forget all the drivel he's written since the Patriot Games."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all Tom Clancy books and undoubtedly this is the worst. His books after Clear and Present Danger are deteriorating in quality. I have completed only 200 pages and could not go further.

The plot is predictible, Jack Ryan thoughts are predictible, the use of technology is not even as good as it used to be in the former Ryan series. What a disapointment, Mr Clancy is resting on his laurels trying to pass out his political agenda. Instead of writting mediocre books why doesnot he run for office.

Here's two sample sentences from the same page (19pb):&quot;Sh*t, he thought.&quot; [Actually, this is it's own paragraph.]&quot;[...] then came into the Oval Office to tell the President what his (Ryan's) decision and/or position was on an issue, so that he (Van Damm) could then [...]&quot;If you think this is great writing, then this is the book for you because there's lots more just like that. Personally I suspect writing such as this wouldn't make it past an 8th-grade English teacher, but that's just me.And then, as others have mentioned there is the blatant racism and (American) elitism. This is the first Clancy novel I've read since Sum Of All Fears and I was shocked at the change that has seemed to come over this man in the intervening years. I'm an American, and proud to be one, but much of the dialogue in this book makes me embarrassed. It's the kind of thing that makes people around the world hate us and I can see why. Hey, I'm something of a liberal, but I've always enjoyed Clancy's novels, despite their conservative bias, until this one. At least half of this book is just Clancy spewing his over-the-top political dogma at us. And the &quot;love scenes&quot; are just plain awful -- no one would talk like that. I wish he'd stick to the technical stuff he is great at, and I wish they had a 300-page, $4, &quot;bad writing omitted&quot; edition."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"... if Red Storm Rising had had about 500 more pages of setup, and 200 fewer pages of action.As a longtime Clancy fan, I did enjoy parts of this book. Clancy continues to excel when delivering descriptions of new weapons technology, and I also enjoy seeing how he applies what he's learned in the process of preparing his nonfiction series to his descriptions of military tactics and means.Unfortunately, with each new fiction work I feel the attention to plot and storyline has faltered... I think this book would've benefited from a more aggressive editing effort. After 700 - 800 pages of &quot;setting the stage,&quot; the actual crisis is resolved somewhat more quickly than I wished, a failing I also find in his last two works.That said, I would recommend the book to Clancy fans. There's enough here to enjoy. For those who haven't read Clancy's earlier works, I strongly recommend doing so rather than starting here... while you'll have to rearrange your brain back into &quot;Cold War&quot; mode, the fiction experience will probably be much more rewarding for you."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like all Clancy fans, I eagerly await the release dates of his new novels. The first day they become available, I own a copy. For the most part, Clancys' novels( particularly the first eight of them) have been compelling page-turners that cause his readers to find and create as much spare time as possible to be the first person on their block to finish the book.So why did it take me nearly one year to finish the \\"bore and the draggin'\\"? Perhaps it was the sudden bouts of severe drowsiness that overtook me after just a few pages of inane and repetative character development. Maybe it was all of those periods of deja vu while reading the same filler material over and over agian. Perhaps it was my constantly stopping to wonder if Clancy really wrote this book at all.This book is so noticably different, and is lacking in so many ways from other Clancy novels that it is a legitimate question as to who really wrote it. If it was Clancy, he must have been severly distracted over his reported divorce. (who wouldn't be?) He also seemed very angry and tempermental, as witnessed by his previously cool-headed characters outbursts and the far, far too frequent usage of profanity . It is way out of Clancy character and totally unnecessary to use the \\"F\\" word on just about every other page. Certainly way out of character for Jack Ryan.The battle scenes where exciting at times, with flashes of the old Clancy brilliance, but more often than not they were highly predictable and somewhat repetative. The ending was an absolute rushed [waste] of the readers time and was a disgrace to the previous fine efforts of Clancy.I will not go out and blindly buy a Clancy book again. It will take some effort on his part to earn my trust and money again.So if you have a year to kill, try sailing around the world...And take a good book with you, but not this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and am disappointed to find each new novel has slipped a notch below the previous one. He is concentrating less and less on the techno-thriller aspects (his forte) and more and more on inane dialogue (his Achilles heel). I just finished reading it (about a year later!) My wife was patiently waiting for me so she could start it. The ending was truly exciting, one of his best. But did he really have to make us plow through 750 pages of dreary start-up to get to the punch? If not for the ending, this might have been my last Clancy read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a fan of Clancy's Jack Ryan and found this book to be very readable, BUT.... I found this book to be a lot like Disney's movie Pocahontas - colorful and full of interest, but nothing really happens until the end. This book could have easily been about 400 pages shorter, without hurting it. I was forcing myself to read through the long character thoughts/opinions about everything from what the best ammo is for a tank to communism. It almost seemed as though Clancy were trying to show off his extensive knowledge of warcraft, spycraft, politics, etc. I think Clancy hits the mark because he concentrates on the characters and their thoughts and relationships, but for a Clancy novel this one was slow paced and overly pontificating. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to Clancy fans (it is much better than his disappointment of Rainbow Six). My other disappointment about this book is that it is sooooo predictable. There are few red herrings and as characters are introduced, they seem to quickly fall into stereotypes and their function and the eventual outcome of their actions can usually be figured out about 600 pages beforehand. Nonetheless, I would still recommend this book to fans."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I love Clancy books but this one is 200 pages too long. That translates into severe predictability. There are no suprises anywhere in the book. The technical aspects are lacking also."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy, and this is the one i liked most. The setting is not a common one in Clancy's books and this creates an interesting atmosphere. This is one of my favourite books by Clancy, followed by The Hunt For Red October and the Cardinal of the Kremlin. After having followed Jack Ryan throughout the series, it is a culminating book that shows the culmination of Jack Ryan's Carrier. I must say that the Character of Jack Ryan is one of the Characters i like best in all the books i have read, both Clancy's and others. In this book, Jack Ryan shows his maturity and sense of direction adn i wish that everybody was like him in real life!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A fun, fast read that is well suited for Clancy's ongoing Ryan saga. Sure, the plots and characters are incredible and somewhat overblown, but what do you expect from fiction? True fans will be as pleased with this one as always. It is a gripping read and a mind-blowing ride. HYPERWAR is incredible and could be a storyline unto itself. Read this - you will not be disappointed"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is one of Clancy's less exciting novels. He extends the Patrick Ryan set of characters, and they are good to spend time with again. The plot is less complicated than some of his earlier works. That's definitely a plus.He sets the story line within a strong moral framework, that I felt worked very well. Overall though, a bit too long, a bit too self-conscious. But still worth the read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When Tom Clancy ended Debt of Honor (1994) with Jack Ryan as President of the United States, this reader thought that Clancy would have to move on to another character. After all, what more could Ryan do? He had progressed from a history professor at Annapolis to junior analyst at the CIA to National Security Advisor to Vice-President, and now held the top office in the land. Well, Clancy did have another adventure for Ryan. In Executive Orders (1996) Clancy found a plot for continuing the Ryan saga, with Jack reconstituting the government, successfully countering a ploy by a corrupt politician to take the presidency away from him, and foiling a Chinese-backed attempt by Iran to destroy the United States through germ warfare. (The Chinese were also silent partners in Japan's plot in Debt of Honor.) In The Bear and The Dragon, Clancy has once again found a plot for President Ryan. This time the Chinese Politburo moves directly to gain control of eastern Siberia, its resources and its space for the burgeoning Chinese population. Russia has found gold deposits larger than those of South Africa and petroleum deposits larger than in the Persian Gulf. With these resources, a well-managed Russia will have the capital, in hard currency, to modernize its economy and solve its internal problems. Chinese leaders do not want a sound Russia on its borders, and do want the capital to consolidate their own positions and solidify their military strength so they may rebuff foreign influence-especially economic. Jack and the United States survive and conquer, of course, but the tale is told with Clancy's inimitable, suspense-filled style. A reader's observation on Clancy's style is that while he still uses long discourses, and lots of technical description, the discourses are less detailed technology and more personal reflection. He seems to have matured into more concern for individual motivation and political philosophy. Clancy has Ryan acting in a politically conservative fashion, making decisions based on logic and consideration of popular welfare more than political position. Wouldn't we all like to see that in Washington? The problem is agreeing on the definition and the methods of achieving popular welfare."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ryan's a bit of a wuss as President, however, his staff makes all the really big decisions as any good staff does. John Clark is still &quot; Da Man&quot;. Along with Ding, they have a some what limited role, but thats ok I got a little Rainbowed out with &quot;Six&quot;. What really kept me turning the pages was Tom Clancy's introduction to humor to this book. He has always had a few good lines in previous books but this one is full of little (if not crude) one liners that kept me laughing out loud in a empty room. In short, one of his three best books yet."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's new novel, 'The Bear and the Dragon' is proof once more of the author's amazing story-telling abilities. This time out President Jack Ryan, (newly-elected,) has his hands full with Russia, China, and his own staff. In Russia Ryan's friend and head of the Russian Security Service, Golovko, is targeted by unknown assassins. The good news for the Ivans is that huge gold and oil deposits are located in their backyard- Siberia. This unexpected wealth draws the interest, (and jealousy,) of their neighbors the Chinese. When ecomonic factors in the US and around the world threaten China's prosperity the Politburo makes a horrifying desicion: War with Russia and her new ally, the USA. Though this book ranks with the many other great Clancy novels it is, perhaps, a little too long. At well over a thousand pages the story does seem a little stretched sometimes. Also, Ryan seems to do more whinning in this book than ever before- Something you'd never expect from the hero of 'Red October' and 'Sum of All Fears.' These points aside 'The Bear and the Dragon' is a thrilling ride with a trademark Clancy climax that will leave you breathless!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clearly better than Rainbow Six.

None the less, still better than most books of this type."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"But, you'll surely start asking why some of the characters act as they do. Perhaps I don't understand the chinese 'psych', but I really, really was wondering about some of the characters actions in the book.I recommend purchasing this book, as I really did enjoy many aspects of the book. However, often times during the read, I was asking myself if I really beleived some of the actions that were happening."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I just finished The Bear and the Dragon and decided to read some reviews. I must say that I am surprised by some of the reactions this book has received. The bottom line is: this is America and we do have freedom of speech it's protected by law. So Mr. Clancy can express his viewpoint and you have the right to disagree. I happen to agree with most of his viewpoints and I applaud him for having the stones to say it. I don't think any writer, which I happen to be, can stop from put his own beliefs in his writing. One of the first things you learn as a writer is to 1.)Write what you know and 2.)Write what you believe. This is what Mr. Clancy has been doing for years. A little less overtly, yes, but maybe he to is sick of what is happening to the greatest nation in the world. We have politically corrected ourselves to a point where we will end up being the biggest third world country in the world. Is it so wrong for a President to have morals instead of being a fence sitter? And by the way more people then you know use that language everyday of the week. I am not saying this book was a perfect 10. I for one would have liked jack to be a little less of a whiner but it does show you he is only human after all. The other piece of the book that has taken heat is the character development, I think it was a real step forward for Mr. Clancy to do some fleshing out of his main and ancillary characters. I will still buy his books when they roll off the press."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...from a guy who has met his last several girlfriends in chat rooms?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I would really give this 3.5 stars, but there aren't any half-stars...The book is a bit formulaic, following a very similar pattern to other recent Clancy books. Otherwise, a solid read, except the occasional entirely unrelated to the story political statements (some of his politics is tied up in the plotline, which is fine, but the stuff unrelated is just annoying).if you're a Clancy fan, you'll enjoy this, if you're not already a fan, this is not the one to start with."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I like Clancy's Books, but &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot; was very disappointing. I understand that Clancy was attempting to create a back story in the first 700 pages, but enough is enough. In spite of this, it was the repeat plot from &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (One of my favorite books) that really disappointed me. The plot can be explained in 4 simple stages: 1) Nation in economic trouble 2) United States inadvertently contributes to the trouble 3) Political Elites of said nation devise a Hollywood type scheme to take resources from another nation 4) Clancy's typical set of main Characters contribute to an overwhelming NATO victory.Summary: A fair read, if you can just through the first 700 pages."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have enjoyed the movies with Jack Ryan as the all-American hero who saves the day. So I was thrilled to finally have an opportunity to settle down with a book starring the driven hero. I gather from other reviews I have just read that this is not Clancy's best work. I hope not.First, Clancy's grasp of human nature is at best naive. To believe that all good minds go for money is simply wrong. Einstein certainly did not, nor have most of the scientists who have enabled our technological lifestyle.Second, Clancy places too much ultra conservative blather in the mouths of otherwise sympathetic actors. The intelligent and capable protagonist (Ryan) is abused for Clancy's dogmatic support of everything from Jerry Falwell to pro-life radicalism. It just does not ring true to a character like Ryan to have such unnuanced views on complex issues. To say nothing of the at best tangential relevance of having such discussions in an action novel. I was, to put it mildly, distracted by these ridiculous diversions.The action IS compelling, and the premise is in my view more realistic than, say, the idea of a war in 2000 between the US and Japan (I gather from this book that such a war happened in previous novels). The book could probably be half as long and better, however."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy used to be a highly entertaining author who provided fast-paced action coupled with a deep understanding of the military and intelligence communities. His first several books became instant classics. I was a devoted fan and snapped up his novels as soon as they were published. His last two efforts, however, seem to be short on just that - effort. &quot;Rainbow Six,&quot; while written well, was terribly predictable. His plot line seemed to be an excuse for the action rather than the foundation of the story. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; continues the downward spiral. The dialogue between characters is terrible. Another reviewer mentioned this complaint too. If you eliminate the long narratives/explanations between the lines of conversation, the dialogue sounds like it is between a couple of junior high students. Clancy has dramatically improved his talent for utilizing cliches and having his characters repeatedly state the obvious. The book seems like it needed one more draft until completion. While his plot moves along, I felt that it could have moved more quickly. Eliminating about 200-300 pages from the first half of the book would have helped. The high point of the book is the description of combat, a talent for which Clancy is unparalleled. The battles were fast-paced and exciting. They quite literally kept me on the edge of my seat. It is hard to justify 900 pages of (almost) boredom to get to the good parts. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've never read a more shameless attempt at using fiction to spread political views. I imagine Clancy sitting in his big leather chair before a roaring fire, giddy with boyish excitement, thinking he's used his popular Jack Ryan character to execute a successful covert propaganda operation on his loyal readers."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a writer, Tom Clancy reminds me of an aging athlete whose musculature is still powerful but hidden under expanding layers of fat. The Bear and the Dragon, which is 1136 pages long, could have been a first-rate novel had somebody edited it down to somewhere under 600. As it is, the last 350 pages - which is around where the action starts - is vintage Clancy and pure dynamite. However, Clancy's literary talents are pretty meager when the only action going on is between people, and that's the problem with most of the first 800 pages. Clancy made his name with a style of writing that can be described without exaggeration as a kind of modern warrior's poetry, depicting the interaction between men, computers and weapons that is the essence of techo-warfare. He also knows spycraft, and the best of his fiction is focussed on soldiers and spies going about their business, which Clancy portrays as both deadly and heroic. The Bear and the Dragon benefits from all this - Clancy hasn't lost any of his talent. Where he's gone wrong though is in diverting that talent into to the realm of politics, where it tends to founder. We see much the same cast of characters here who have run through all of his fiction, and his main character - Jack Ryan - is again at the center. Ryan, of course, appeared in Clancy's first novel years ago as a relatively junior intelligence analyst and, through a series of improbable developments in later books, rose steadily higher in government until finally reaching the Presidency, a position from which he presides over the action in The Bear and the Dragon. Unfortunately, Clancy now has the platform he needs to indulge all his worst ambitions as a novelist, since, in addition to an excessive focus on Ryan's virtuous private life, we get seemingly endless interior monologues, and dialogues with other characters, in which Clancy vents his own opinions about various political issues and about the evils of politics in general. The fact that I probably share many of these views myself doesn't make it in the least bit more tolerable to see fiction misused in this way. I'm such a die-hard Clancy fan that I may be over-reacting to his flaws, and I still can't be too harsh in judging this novel, since the good parts are so fantastic. However, I really wish that Clancy's editors would have the courage do to him and his fans a favor: stand up to him, and save a lot of paper in the process."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is Clancy's best work since &quot;Debt of Honor.&quot; Starts off with a bang as a key aide to the Russian President is almost assassinated. While that is being investigated, a huge oil and gold strike is made in Siberia. That has China licking its lips. Now, former adversaries the U.S. and Russia must join forces to prevent Chinese domination of Siberia.Excellent work on the characters, who are almost old friends to hard-core Clancy readers by now. Loved the portrayal of Jack Ryan in the presidency. For the most powerful man in the world, he seems to have little independence. Ryan is a slave to public perception, scheduling, security. Many of the things he deals with on a day-to-day basis bore him. Ryan is the ultimate hands-on guy working a job that lets him be anything but. He really hates this job, but is too dedicated to duty to up and quit.As far as plot goes, Clancy keeps your interest throughout. After an unfortunate incident in China with a couple religious folks, it's hard to put this book down. Good presentation of the Chinese leadership. These men had a very narrow view of the world and how things are supposed to work. That just exacerbates the brewing international crisis. Clancy caps it off with a very exciting ending. One thing I would have liked to have seen more of is stuff going wrong at critical points of the conflict, which has been a Clancy trademark since &quot;The Hunt For Red October.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Patriot Tom Clancy once again delivers on a grand scale in my opinion. An armed conflict between Russia and China that had me wondering about the outcome of all the sub-plots til the end of the book. You have to work at reading a Clancy novel, but, I feel it's worth the sweat. The three-star rating is just in comparison with his other novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels, and while I did enjoy this book, I think it was probably not his best. I feel that the Jack Ryan character has become a sort of &quot;cardboard-cutout,&quot; kind of 2 dimensional, flat hero figure. I think that the Ryan character has not really developed in the past few books written about him. However, despite that, the book is action-packed, and is as much fun to read as his other books. Clancy excells at depicting both close-quarters and battlefield combat, and his realism has never been better. It is great that he can also bring the Rainbow group into the novels, so it is not just all Jack Ryan. While I would have given his other novels 5 stars, I must give this one 4, which is not bad at all..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"even though it was a very long read,with lots of buildup I still found it a good book. The plot building to war was a very good one that would be possible, the positions taken by the countrys were beleiveable, and the ultimate conclussion was quite probable. It was lengthy and the true action was in the last 300 pages, but the Jack Ryan &quot;John Wayne&quot; style was visable and made for a good read of fiction."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If your a fan of the Jack Ryan books you will like this one. I would guess this is the last of the series. I hope Tom Clancy contiues to write about Mr. Clark &amp; Co. Alot of people dissed this book but I thought it was a great story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a huge Tom Clancy fan. I have loved all the Jack Ryan books, and I always thought that despite being a bit obsessed with the technicalities of war, Clancy could really write characters as well. But this book was so awful I couldn't even finish it. It was xenophobic, obsessed with vulgar sexual references, repetitive, and badly written. Did Clancy's editor take a vacation for this one?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was the first Tom Clancy book I've read that I really didn't like. The real action in the story doesn't begin until you're a full *750* pages in. 750 pages before anything interesting happens. Amazing. And I thought Stephen King was poorly edited!Even worse, then after you get to the 250 pages of interesting action, the book abruptly and stupidly just ends. After 750 pages of setup, it would've been nice to have seen some closure on all of the many storylines Clancy had going. And I was waiting the whole book for Jack Ryan to meet some of these arrogant Chinese ministers face to face, but it never happened. Very disappointing.Obviously, Clancy needs an editor. Too many characters, too many needless subplots, too much filler. An incomplete and unsatisfying ending.And for the first time, I really, really got tired of Clancy's style of dialogue where every character has to mention the other character's name in just about every sentence. Real people just don't talk like that."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have always been a fan of Tom Clancy's novels. From his earliest ones, even to his newest behemoths. In The Bear and the Dragon Clancy write a satisfying story of global proportions. Taking facts and presumptions from present day reality, he tells of the Bear (obviously Russia), and the Dragon (China)What's interesting is his depiction of the reasons behind Russia's and China's will to dominate. I wont give away any important information here, but you will be in suspense and you will have an enjoyable read.What many people think, and I would agree for the most part, is one of the best things in this book is the addition of John Clarke in a Jack Ryan novel once again. Clarkes addition really makes things start to happen.All in all, a very good read, but sometimes, as always, Clancy overpowers some scenes with way too much and sometimes unecessary information, but if you can get past that and the huge size (1,028 pages) I say go for it, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I agree with other recent reviews of this novel: It's over-written, poorly characterized, thinly researched, and credulity-straining. Clancy's strengths as a writer have in the past involved his ability to generate a suspenseful plot, and his devotion to describing military doctrine and technology with lovingly obsessive detail. Unfortunately, this novel showcases Clancy's many weaknesses: He's not compelling in writing characters or dialog; his familiarity with foreign cultures (especially China) is limited; he has no talent for writing romance or sex; and he fundamentally lacks the soul of a poet. The most important revelation in this novel appears to be that Ryan is a pro-life president, of the my-religious-beliefs-are-universal-truths-and-you're-a-moron-if-you-don't-agree variety. Disappointing, boring, and unnuanced: Clancy/Ryan is no George Will, nor even a Bill Bennet or a Tony Scalia. Clancy either needs to do a lot more homework in his writing, or else he needs to return to his roots in writing about militaria."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy needs to stop believing his own press. His apparant arrogance at his success has translated into his need for books that rival War and Peace in length but fall completely short on interest. Bottom line: he needs an editor who will not be afraid to cut his holy words."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I liked \\"Red Storm Rising\\" because it was an accurate story of how World War III, fought between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in 1986, would have unfolded. I awaited this book eagerly, thinking that I would be reading a realistic scenario of a war between China and Russia. Saying I was disappointed would be an understatement. Not only did Clancy take around 700-800 pages just to start the war, but he filled them with such obscene, racist,ignorant propaganda that I was tempted to use the book for toilet paper (it was a library book so I didn't). He rambles on (through Jack Ryan - the president, God help those who commit the crime of disagreeing with the Yankee kaiser about democracy and human rights) about how evil abortion is (when it is a sound method of birth-control in an overpopulated world), and how the \\"klingons\\", sorry, the Chinese, are evil just because they have different views on human rights, birth control and international relations. Okay, I agree that Mao Zedong was a mass murderer (and a child molester), but America has killed more people than China over the past 60 years, as well as America's natice population. When he finally got to the Chinese invasion of Siberia, Clancy spoke of how Russia was made a NATO member (yeah right)and lovingly describes how American technology rips the guts out of China's best units, with Russian forces taking heavy losses (of course) but America loses only one or two fighters, due to huge opposition, not skill on China's part (naturally - Americans are superior to everyone else).If you are someone who enjoys reading about America demolishing anyone who disagrees with them, you will love this. Otherwise, stay away from this. If you are sick of smug, self-congratulatory dribble from Yankee supremists, I recommend that you read \\"World War 2006\\" by Simon Pearson. This book describes how an arrogant America is caught off guard when the Islamic world unites under one leader who sets about planning Israel's destruction and putting America in its place. It is realistic, written from a neutral viewpoint (Pearson is British) and does NOT underestimate how Islamic cunning and knowledge can defeat American technology and ignorance."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was extremely disappointed that Mr. Clancy had to resort to sweeping out the gutter to replace the English language. Maybe a English 101 class would help. This is the first time I did not want to have my son read a Mr. Clancy book. If he is being paid by the word, then I understand. That would clear up the constant repeating of the same sentence again and again and again. At least Mr. Clancy did not come up with a fourth or fifth name for Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr. Clancy has apparently forgotten that having characters one can relate to is all important in any fiction writing. In *The Bear and the Dragon* the characters are one-dimensional and raise little empathy with the reader. I really didn't care if anyone lived or died. It was immaterial to me since I had no investment in them. Now, I know technology and suspense are the chief ingredients in a Tom Clancy novel, and that is why I bought the predecessors to this one, but in all the others, I cared about the characters. In the *The Bear and the Dragon* Mr. Clancy seems to have simply dashed this one off. Perhaps he is too involved in too many other projects to really put anything into real writing anymore - even the techno-thriller kind. All-in-all, a bust."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have waited for this book since &quot;Executive Orders&quot; (even though &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; did refer to Ryan it wasn't altogether about him as &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is). And the book is definitely worth the wait. The only thing Clancy readers tend to forget is how long it takes for his stories to get set up. So the first 200 or so pages go pretty slowly as you know that the action to come will leave you breathless.I only found two things not completely satisfying. The first being how often Ryan gripes about being the President. He's now been there long enough to have come to terms with the job, one he chose to continue with. Face it and deal with it.The other was the ending. It had all the action you could want, you hold your breath a number of times and wonder what you might see if you look out the window. It is also emotionally powerful. You live each and every emotional moment through Clancy's masterful but not overly flowery description of thoughts and feelings. But in many ways, it leaves you right there holding your breath. It's like being on an extremely exciting rollercoaster that instead of finally winding down until it stops keeps going and going.And now I find myself back at square one looking at another two years of waiting. Not just to get into a new adventure but to find out how this was finally completely resolved. If your one of the lucky who still haven't read all of the books in the Ryan saga, go back to &quot;The Hunt for the Red October&quot; and read all the books in order so you can get a full understanding of who Jack Ryan is and how he got to where he is today. You won't be disappointed. If you are like me who already read the full story then my deepest sympathy. We have another very long wait."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The novel should be used as a textbook in elementray school. It is not only plotless, some of its assumptions are just, well Assumptions. I wonder why PLA would engage US in a situation like that. Why PLA wouldn't go all out when Taiwan declared its independence? Another good try on predicting future conflicts between major powers (Which US always wins, off course). But the lack of knowledge and understanding of Asian culture make this novel suited only for the not-informed Americans. But again why would they care when they think they are always right."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've read almost all of Clancy's books. Most of them were page turners which I couldn't put down. Not so with this one. Instead of techno-thriller suspense I got a reactionary, bigoted diatribe on why white upper-class Christian americans are great and everyone else (Asians in this book) are evil. It almost seems like Clancy went out of his way to offend people. Apparently he's looking forward to writing for an audience composed entirely of hard-line conservatives, beacause he's trying hard to alienate everyone else.Save your money and definately don't buy it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In 'The Bear and The Dragon&quot;, Tom Clancy wasted too much time spouting the right-wing conservative American political line, in what was supposed to be a political-military international suspense tale. After he inserted rants against Roe vs.Wade, and then against &quot;tree-huggers&quot; in this 1000+-page book, Putnam's Publishing should have realized that this once-entertaining author was out of control, and had nothing of his own left to say."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this was a pretty good book... some of the other reviews were, well... a bit harsh to say the least. I liked it though i thought it was quite exciting and kept me interested just about the whole time. Although at times it seemed a bit biased but nothing that bad, and i was very happy to find the boys from rainbow making an appearance. Well thats about it for me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yes, this book develops too slowly, but when it finally begins to show its true colors, it gets pretty ugly. I stopped reading this book on page 183. That's when President Ryan spews forth all of Clancy's anti-abortion rhetoric to the less than convincing arguments of his chief of staff.This is Clancy's last war for this reader. I'll leave him 845 pages from the next treaty and long before he sends the world to war once again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr. Clancy has published yet another example of why he is the king of the technothriller. Filled with military minutae, it delivers an enjoyable, if not smooth, read. At 1028 pages, it may me overlong, but Clancy is able to use that length to put you in the heads of those who make the decisions and those who pull the trigger.I've heard people complain that Clancy shouldn't keep bringing back the same characters, but I appreciate the continued presence of characters like Robby Jackson, Dan Murray, and the Foleys. Even the recurrence of Gennady Bondarenko is fitting. Clancy has created his own universe, and keeping the same characters adds continuity.As far as this being a racist book, some people need to lighten up. Was Debt of Honor a racist book when the military characters referred to the Japanese as Japs? Or was Red Storm Rising a racist book when it referred to Russians as Russkies, or Reds, or Ivan?In short, it was a solid effort by Clancy. He needs to step out of the box some more, as he did with Rainbow Six and Without Remorse, but the book delivered an enjoyable read, bad parts aside. I gave up looking for the perfect book long ago, but I still appreciate a good read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a long-time Tom Clancy reader, and have yet to read one of his books that I didn't enjoy. That's why I was so surprised when, after finishing his latest tonight and coming to write a review, i found all this negative feedback about Mr. Clancy's most recent endeavor.I found this book to be very enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. I could barely put it down for the last 500 pages. While I thought the story ended rather abruptly, I was thoroughly satisfied that the time spent reading this book was time well-spent."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read every single Tom Clancy book: Without Remorse and Red Storm Rising are in my favourite 10 books ever. However The Bear and The Dragon is most probably the last time I will ever bother picking up a Tom Clancy work.The slow decline in his writing from the average Debt of Honour through to the awful Rainbow Six now to this terrible book shows a real lack of inspiration.It reads like a bad adaptation of a feature film script that you would buy on a supermarket shelf. The weak plot is substantially *enhanced* by pathetic dialogue. I found myself picking through keywords while skimming over the entirely verbose passages.This book has too many references to product placement, venues and locations that have nothing whatsoever to do with the plot, and only serve to what, get Clancy a free lunch?He has obviously outsourced much of his writing to ghost writers and given them basic plot outlines - &quot;write about the upcoming tension between China and the USA, and lets bring up Siberia's resources AGAIN, because nobody realises that's going to be the next big thing; and also mention how I can't stand Democrats and how if I were running the world, I would...&quot;This book gets two stars PURELY because it was marketed well. Other than that it is absolutely terrible. Tom Clancy needs to get a new publisher and write a good, tight story about something interesting and suspenseful which has at least believable dialogue...I would highly recommned to all readers of this review, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wish I could give it less than one star. I took this book to Hawaii and tried to read it on the plane. Then I tried to read it on the beach. 150 pages into it and it was still going nowhere. I left it at the condo for the next poor unsuspecting sap to pick up and try to read. Clancy has gone seriously downhill since Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been an avid Tom Clancy fan since &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; I have read all of his single-author books and many of the earlier books for which he is a co-author, but I had to really work to read this book. I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I miss is his clean concise writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other. This book also delves into sexual encounters quite early.I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but this book is a very bad read. You may call the dialog in this book reality, but I can do without it in my pleasure reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancy's novels, and this one ranks right up there with his best. Although it is over 1000 pages, I never noticed. It is a very fast and exciting read and I highly recommend it to conservative, Clancy readers. Since Clancy deals with a lot of social and political issues - keep an open mind if you're not politically conservative. The only thing that would have made this a better novel is if Clancy had not rushed the ending. It seemed that he was trying to finish the book as quickly as possible and I think the book would have been better if it was not rushed, maybe around 1200 pages. Great read, though. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I enjoyed the book even with the all editing oversights. I must agree with the general sentiment most avid fans feel: &quot;Why is he ending his book so abruptly?&quot;. There is no follow through or wrap-up. I do not even get a sense of a teaser for the next installment. I still give it 4 stars, but it might be time to find another author if this is going to be indicative of his future works."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I got this book on Monday and finished reading it at 2AM this morning. Once I opened it, I couldn't put it down. For once, Clancy did not spend pages and pages covering technical data until the eyes glazed over. My eyes glazed over, but from fatigue since I couldn't stop reading it. This is a story that once you get into it, you won't want to stop until it is over. I do not know it the hardware described in it is either available or in development, but if it is available, war just won't pay in the future for anyone."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Until reading this book, I loved just about everything written by Mr Clancy, although I've mostly read his older books. He has always been known for complex, realistic plots and impressive descriptions of military hardware and modern warfare.He forgot to include any of that in this book, however. While the premise (a war between China and Russia) is very interesting, \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" doesn't deliver.The first problem is that it takes an extremely long time to get going. The actual attack doesn't start until 900 pages into the book, and there's really no justification for that much buildup. It doesn't really help that much of those 900 pages consist of Clancy giving his opinion about just about everything from communism, to abortion, to tax rates. While he does make a couple of good points (mind you, just a couple), for the most part it's irrelevant and awfully short-sighted: Mr Clancy spends an awful lot of time telling us just how stupid and barbaric the Chinese (leaders) are, while shamelessly glorifying the American Way (read, \\"Republican Way\\") at every turn. It's almost disturbing to see how much the writer is convinced of the moral superiority of his convictions.The part of the 900 pages that aren't filled with political tirade fare a bit better, but there's still a lot of filler and repetition in them, including a murder investigation that ultimately adds next to nothing to the real story. Which is a shame, because there really is a fairly decent story (once you get over the fact that in this book, the bad guys are incredibly stupid) hidden somewhere in all these pages.Anyway, I kept reading this \\"bear\\" of a book, hoping that it would get better once the action started. It really didn't. The Chines attack, and overrun the Russian defenses, but after that they're so utterly and totally slaughtered by the USA that it's hard to take seriously: American and Russian jets kill Chinese planes by the dozens while suffering marginal casualties themselves, hundreds of tanks are taken out in mere minutes, and the Chinese field commander conveniently and inexplicably gets himself shot by a sniper. Right.\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is 900 pages of communist/China-bashing, flag-waving neo-conservative ranting, followed by 200 pages of more flag-waving and China-bashing thinly disguised as a number of battle sequences. It's not completely without its moments (hence the 2 stars) but it's definitely not recommended"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Unbelievably I continued to read and finish this piece of garbage. Besides the incredible shallowness of the characters and the increase in profanity (I don't think Nixon swore this much) I continue to be deeply disturbed by the overt racism Jingo TC shows toward Asians (Chinese and Japanese in particular). Besides using &quot;Chinks&quot; and &quot;slant eyes&quot; as descriptive terms he tries to cover up by making nice talk toward African Americans...sorry can't buy the rich white Baptist Minister trading pulpits with Rev. Jackson in Mississippi...things haven't changed that much in the south...don't know where Tom does research but it isn't below the Mason Dixon. His making the Russians our good buddies now only reinforces the fact that caucasians of any flavor can be trusted and other races are demonic little yellow people.TC needs to grow up and get a new career...this one isn't working."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and The Dragon should be reclassified into the science fiction section. I am a fan of scifi and this book was as speculative and more contrived than most space opera. The &quot;What-ifs&quot; that Clancy uses to drive the plot no longer have any bearing on the world as we know it; it's now a Ryan-verse or a Clancy-verse. This book provides some of the old Clancy, but not nearly enough to justify its length or didactic tone. His first books were wonderful, and even Executive Orders kept me reading non-stop. This one just seems tired and contrived.Aside from it's relation to the &quot;real world,&quot; this book reads like bad propaganda. The Chinese are bad, the Russians are clueless and America is the Great Savior of the World. Yeah. I feel safe and secure to live in country with superb military might that can wipe out entire enemy divisions without taking any knocks of its own. I'm not sure I completely believe that --but if we are as wonderful as Mr. Clancy makes us out to be, he had better prepare for another Demoncratic term in the White House because he just shot up one of Mr. Bush's main campaign planks. ooopsOn another note completely, the dialogue and language in this book were awful! I sincerely hope that top government officials and heads of state don't talk to each other in such terms. I understand that the Ryan Government are just regular joes -- but hopefully the best and brightest America has to offer has a better and more extensive vocabulary than the F-word to express dismay, concern, outrage, whatever. And, the use of the C-word is so offensive that I almost stopped reading. He needs to get over the thrill of using profanity, and get back to writing.I hope the next Ryan book returns to the basics, and maybe finds some new characters to concentrate on. Having Jack swearing at world events from the Oval Office just isn't that exciting. Maybe it's time for the Ryan-verse to come to a close. But that would be too bad."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"One would think that after 760 reviews that there would be little left to say about any book. That being said I will still add a few words after reading this thousand plus page opus.First of all, I am not a rabid Clancy fan. Yes, I did read some of his earlier works and found them to be thought provoking and exciting from a technical point of view.The Bear and the Dragon is not a technothriller in the usual sense of the word. It is a slow sometimes thought provoking read detailing the failure of conventional diplomacy. That being said, let me emphasise, the book rumbles along for about 800 pages before the real action for lovers of military fiction begins.In its premise we have multiple subplots that connect to bring about global disaster. There is an attempted assassination of a high ranking Russian official. The killing of a papal nuncio and a baptist minister during the midst of Chinese/American Trade Talks brings about a virtual collapse of the Chinese economy and a grand scale retaliation by the Chinese Politburo. The plot involves the invasion of Siberia by the Chinese army in hopes of revitalizing their economy.Into this mix comes the idea the Russia and the United States are now allies due to the fall of the Communist system. In fact, Russia is now a member of NATO for purposes of halting the Chinese aggression.Clany blends all of the above into a plot that is compelling at times but at others is a little hard to take seriously. At its best the action is a little far fetched and awkward. At its worst the plot is sheer folly. Clancy does in fact seem to know his hardware but his understanding of individual characterization and human emotion is far from genius. The characters at times are indistinguishable and seem little more than talking heads for Clancy's conservative preaching. The developing relationship between a spy and his agent feels as though it was ghost written by a teenager with over active hormones.All that said, The Bear and the Dragon is not a bad book but one which could have been much better had more attention been paid to the problems of diplomacy and cultural differences. These are the issues that needed to be addressed more than the outbreak of a &quot;video game&quot; type war that was easily resolved in the last 100 pages or so.Clancy has a great knack for dehumanizing war with technological advances. This is unfortunate in that it seems to make the characters little more than chess pieces on a board. No one really dies in Clancy's world but the bad guys. The result of this is that war becomes a fantastic game rather than the horror it really is.If I had been a true Clancy fan I might have been disappointed by this effort. In general the novel was fair but it could have been so much more."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There's this one old guy who works at the gas station that I go to every morning for coffee before work. Every morning he's leaning against the counter; holding a lit cigarette with one hand, and stabbing away at the keyboard on his cash register with the other. And every morning, for about six months, he would just grunt at me when I asked him how his day was going. After about the second day of asking I didn't really care anymore, I just kept asking because I was kind of hoping for a real answer, and because my daily badgering seemed to annoy him a bit.A couple of weeks ago I'm standing in line, and I notice the old guy glancing over at a patch of ice that has formed in front of the gas station door. He seems transfixed by it, and every time someone traverses the patch, and makes it safely inside, he takes a nervous drag on his cigarette and trys to turn his attention back to the register, and the longer then usual line that's waiting for his monosyllabic banter. &quot;Slippery Ice&quot; I say, when it was my turn to pay. He looks at me as if I was exposing a dark family secret. &quot;You have salt?&quot; I ask, not waiting for him to respond to my first comment. He reflexively glances over towards the door, and there lies a half-empty yellow and white rolled up bag sitting next to the newspaper rack. &quot;I'll give you a hand with that,&quot; I say as I walk towards the door. I grab the bag, and scatter its remains like chickenfeed around the front. I give him a quick hand wave, and head for my truck. &quot;Thanks Chief&quot; he says, and as I look back, it appears to me that he's smiling at me through the dirt and salt encrusted windows. Well from that day forward I became &quot;Chief&quot;, and now every morning it takes me forever to get out of there cause he wants to talk my ear off. The points I am trying to make by telling this story are:1) Be careful what you wish for2) Too much of anything can be a good thingBoth of these maxims could be applied to Tom Clancy's new book. How could anyone get enough of Jack Ryan? Well perhaps when Jack is turned into a boring, foul-mouthed, right wing whiner. By the time I got half way through the book, I truly regretted the fact that Jack himself was not amongst those present at the 747 crash that wiped out Congress. Buy hey, it's not his fault. The reason Harrison Ford worked better then Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan was that Jack was an everyman, a father, an outsider who worked within, but usually against the system , and he never showed signs of becoming the rather disagreeable individual he has apparently turned into. Ford brought an earnestness to the roll, and I think many of us truly believed he would have been just as happy to stay a simple CIA analyst, and live in his 2 million dollar house (see Patriot Games) with his opthalmologist wife and two children. No wonder Harrison Ford has decided not to reprise the roll.There is also way too much of everything in this book; too many pages, too many characters, too many repeated phrases and themes. He must have said that he hated being president 100 times. I am surmising that Clancy is involved in too many projects at once, he probably does not have the same burning desire to prove himself, as he did as a new author, and success has made him think that he is right about everything; including all the social and political issues he feels he can now have Jack lecture us about.That being said, it is his character, he is the one who has sold millions of books, and with his money he has, he could probably buy, and outfit a small right-wing junta. I for one will no longer feel the need to contribute to his cause.For those 6 of you out there who have never read a Clancy book, don't start with this one. Go back to his first couple of books, and hit this one at the end. This one's like Grandma coming to visit, and never leaving. You still love her, but you wish she'd never made the decision to stay."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Once again Mr. Clancy has crammed a good 400-500 page book into 1,000 pages. While I devoured The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Cardinal...etc, I have found his last 3 works major disappointments. I actually cried when the US sub sunk in Red Storm Rising. Now, I would be happy is someone would ask Mr. Clancy to sit down and be quiet and let Mr. Ryan or one of his minions DO something other than pontificate on ultra conservative, right wing, table pounding non-issues."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The line between Jack Ryan and Tom Clancy is becoming thinner and Ryan is the one who suffers. This is not a techno-thriller of the type Clancy invented. It is more like a tour of the Cosmos with the guide's observations about how things would be better if he and Jack were in charge.The Bear and the Dragon opens with 200 pages of set-up that a lean and mean Tom Clancy would have handled in a few muscular paragraphs. Aside from establishing that there is a lot of corruption and incompetence in Russia and that Chinese counterintelligence and technical security personnel are pushovers for the CIA, we have nothing to show for our first few hours of reading.The remainder of the book moves a little better, but I needed a lot less product placement by the producers of Jamaican coffee (so expensive that even POTUS and Tom Clancy dilute it with lesser varietals). As usual, you pick up some technical insights-- a ballistic missle travels faster than the shock wave from high explosives-- but Clancy needs to introduce us to some heroes so young and hungry that they dream of Folgers to wash down the snakes they eat."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read most everything that Clancy has written and am a big fan of his earlier works: Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Cardinal of the Kremlin, etc.Unfortunately, the last few editions of the Ryan/Clark saga have started to lose their edge.Clark/Klerk is still a great character that makes for great reading and plot development. Ryan is still a regular (albeit smart) guy in extraordinary circumstances. The most obvious changes I have seen are (1) a steady decline in the technical details and (2) far less realistic dialogue between characters.I imagine that these are two of the most difficult things to do successfully when writing, but I think that both Clancy and his editor were just focused on getting another book out the door than making sure it was a good one.Now, for some perspective, my eyes *never* glaze over at page after page of analysis of water flow across a turbine (October) or the intricate process of building a (fictional) nuclear weapon (Sum of All Fears). These are the details that make the Clancy books fascinating for me. And well written dialouge is something that makes my heart skip (Hurly Burly, Glengarry Glenross, Usual Suspects). Additionally, I am disappointed by the increasingly frequent usage of vulgarity in Clancy's books (especially Rainbow Six) as it does not seem necessary and certainly reduces the number of people to whom I would reccomend the book. I'm sure that seems a contradiction given that the examples of good dialogue listed are all notoriously vulgar movies, but the impact of vulgarity in the books has a much harsher impact and also seems more out of place.Overall, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the read, but I was hoping for higher quality work."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have enjoyed Tom Clancy as an author since I read Red Storm Rising as a teenager, and have enjoyed all of his subsequent books. Yet this book does not seem to be on par with what I would expect from Mr. Clancy. It has Clancy's attention to detail and techinical knowlegde that I have come to enjoy from him, but the similarities end there.First theres the glorification of American democracy over Chineese communism. Now I'm and American and I love the way we do things here, but I'm not so biased to say that we have the most perfect system of government and that everything about the communist plan is evil and corrupt. Communism was an attemt to form a goverment with the best interest of the country as a whole, and is just as subject to corruption, error, and ego that any other plan of goverment would be. There is even some passages in the book that go beyond governments and protrayes Chineese people in general under a bad light becase they don't think American.Second, there was a complete lack of respect for the Chineese military and intelligence orginizations. Clancy made China seem to both have the military might and thought process of Sadaam during the Gulf War. I would have to guess that China might just be a little more advanced. After all, it's not just the Americans who have spies and neat military toys.Third, there was an unbelievealbe amount of good luck or lack of realism on the protagonist's side. Spy gets a great source, spy never gets caught, no friendly fire, lax guarding of nuclear weapons, new toys in our military, complete lack of intellegence and new weapondry in China, lack of Chinas citizens supporing their own country, genious deciding to work on a missle tracking system, only one missle getting off, and shooting down the missles on the last shots,.... I could go on.In short I suggest that readers enjoy Mr. Clancy's others book and set this one aside to be forgotten. The entire story is so one sided both in terms of political objectives and personalities that it becomes very tedious to read. If not for my history of reading Clancy books I would of stopped reading well before halfway due to the constant Chineese bashing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although I made my way through The Bear and the Dragon out of an absurd sense of loyalty to and fondness for the character of Jack Ryan, and for what I knew would ultimately be an exciting world-on-the-edge-of-disaster tale, I cursed Clancy far too regularly throughout the book. How did it happen that all his characters have come to share the same endlessly repeated attitudes? Could every man in the military worth his salt truly despise the &quot;tree-huggers&quot; and think of women with patriarchal disdain? Even if that were true, must we endure countless repetitions of internal dialogues, irrelevant to the plot, relating to a rehash of Clancy's values that have contaminated all his worthy characters and succeeded in erasing their individuality? Stop the pontificating! Shame on you, Tom Clancy, for turning a wonderful character like Ryan into a flat, faceless drone indistinguishable from all the other single-minded drones in this book. Where in the world was your editor???"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A couple chapters into this book it becomes apparent Clancy is coasting on his name and reputation. This book is WAY overwritten. At over 1000 pages, it's a test of endurance to keep turning the pages. Clancy lays down page after page of irrelevant macho jargon when really he should be developing something resembling a plot. It's a mystery to me how anyone could stay interested in this book long enough to finish it. Hey Tom, cut the next one down to 550 pages and maybe I'll consider reading it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I put it down after struggling through 600 pages of talk, talk, talk. A big disappointment after waiting for the next Jack Ryan story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What a shame, what a pitty!As a huge fan of all Tom Clancy wrote (fictional), I longed to get my hands on his latest work (I had to wait quit some time for it in the Netherlands). Well, I have it now, and what a disappointment it is!To be brief: Mr. Clancy is getting old and grumpy and uses his writing to express his rather boring, old fashioned and conservative political ideas. This must even be a bore for any US reader, but for an international reader it's like reading a 1100 page column in a local small town USA newspaper.Oh, by the way, this book actually features a story somewhere between the lines. And yes, all our favourite characters are in it. It's a shame they are used as background figures."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read most of Tom Clancy's earlier works, I was sorely disappointed by this effort. In fact, I felt cheated. Where in the past Tom Clancy has written books with a good plot and exciting action, this book spends a great amount of time on Clancy's sexist, xenophobic and otherwise unecessary political views. This large tome (1000+ pages) could have been toned down to a few hundred if these distracting comments had been omitted. I would not recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read every Tom Clancy book since the beginning. Everyone knows his strengths and weaknesses, so there aren't many surprises. I do expect to be entertained by his books, but I wasn't this time. I simply can't stomach the endless racist remarks; Executive Orders got by with only a few references to &quot;ragheads&quot; to refer to people of the Islamic faith. Here, however, there are constant and ongoing racist and cultural slurs against Chinese people (I won't dignify them by repeating them). Also, Jack Ryan has become incredibly tiresome. He has turned into a self-righteous, ultra-right-wing character who loathes anyone who disagrees with him and spends all his time whining about how he doesn't want to be President. It's time for Clancy to move on from this series and get back to writing entertaining thrillers with interesting characters."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's works where always known for having all the little things go the right way for his hero's, but in this book he takesit too the extreme. He spends too much time and effort into demonizing the PRC, harkens back to the Fu Manchu racist stereotypes of old. And the war at the end (as every other reviewer states it takes how many pages to get to that?) comes off as far too easy. Predictable, I yearn for Clancy's days of old Red Storm Rising and such..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It would be hard for me to improve on the several hundred other reviews of this book, so I'll just hit the lowlights:1) The book is waaaaay too long for what little &quot;content&quot; there is. Clancy definitely needs an editor.2) Clancy has gotten waaaaay too preachy, using every inconsequential shred of dialog (and there are many) as an excuse to inform the reader of his view of &quot;how things should be done.&quot;3) The story is too contrived. He really has to try hard to make this one believable and fails miserably.4) Clancy's prose (if you can call it that) is ridiculous and, in many parts, dwells way too much on parts of the male anatomy.'tis a far cry from Hunt for Red October. You'd really have to try hard to write a worse book than this."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The basic rule of the thriller apart from good characterization is the tautness of plot, that is that every paragraph, every page should advance the story. Sadly Tom Clancy seems to have forgotten this and treats us to a 700 page preamble that had me wondering if I should sign up to save the rain forests. The paper used in the last third of the story was worthwhile and that's about the best I can say for it. Even so I often wonder how such works receive such tremendous critical acclaim - it is no different here in Britain or the rest of Europe. For anyone interested in how you write and produce a work far superior to this and in half the pages I urge you to read English techno-thriller writer John Templeton Smith's 'White Lie' - JTS is one of the most underrated of writers, but then we Brits haven't got a clue about marketing. In the meanwhile, may I respectfully suggest that you wait for Harrison Ford in the movie (I'm a big fan of the popcorn!)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is an extraordinary storyteller, but The Bear and the Dragon doesn't cut it. 700 pages of buildup to one battle that fails to create any suspense. The few scenes with the Navy, are short and unexciting. The Air Force is tremendously outnumbered, but the air battles lack any real suspense. The tank battles are so one sided that I wonder why Clancy didn't simply say, &quot;All the Chinese tanks get killed.&quot; and be done with it. That is the way you want a real battle to go, I'm sure, but this is entertainment, not real life. The Chinese politicians are so dense that never once do they make a correct decision. And like most of his last few books every character he's ever written is back. It feels like a high school reunion. People you didn't really care that much about in the first place are back, and now you have to spend a couple hours with them."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's latest effort is disappointing to say the least. Jack Ryan, a character who has formerly shown the ability to act and think rationally has turned into a whining fool with absolutely no tact. The story was transparent from the beginning and the bad guys aka the Chinese, were portrayed as incredibly stupid, naive and arrogant. Now I know the west has a perception of asians as sneaky and often racist towards foreigners, but we have never been accused of being absolute idiots. I have been an avid Clancy reader since the Red October, and I have never been disappointed before. But this time around, he definitely let me down. In the past few novels, while the USA has come out on top, which is expected, at least the bad guys managed to get in a shot or two to keep things interesting. In this current effort the Chinese act as complete morons and the reasoning behind it is stereotypical and very thin at best. Bottom line: Tom Clancy took one of his best characters and turned him into a right-wing religious freak with no tolerance or respect for any non-anglo culture."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Really disappointing, although I've been a fan of Clancy since the 80's. Maybe that's why he gets the 2nd star. One of the things I really loved about Clancy's stories was the attention to detail and accuracy. It made the stories believable and realistic. You could tell that he really researched everything. Now I get the feeling that he's getting lazy, and just spouts what he feels like without checking facts. He and his publishers can afford to do it right, even the best writers need a disciplined editor, and readers deserve that respect. After the disappointment of \\"Special Forces,\\" I'm done with him as soon as I finish this story (yes, it is that good).The plot devices in this one are more far-fetched than ever, with no attempt at explanations to make them plausible (Chinese politburo secretary visits secret CIA boyfriend every night and surfs internet with top-secret computer, but nobody asks questions?; Russia simultaneously discovers biggest-ever gold and oil reserves in northeast Siberia just as China runs out of cash, but nobody puts 2 & 2 together except the readers?)More strident than ever is Clancy's usual political whining and contempt of people he doesn't like ... \\"diplo-jerks,\\" \\"pshrinks,\\" \\"ivory-tower theoreticians\\" (who foolishly think preventing war is more important than the life of a spy). Pages and pages of Baptist preachers spouting about how the Chinese know God is powerful and are afraid because they will burn in hell. He says over and over that Chinese-Americans don't serve their government, can't be trusted for loyalty. Come on, how many white American spies are there? How many Israeli-Americans are spies? Not many, but sure a bigger percentage than Chinese. I don't know how many comments on the side about sex in the Oval Office and the \\"mess in Yugoslavia.\\" Ok, so Clancy didn't like Clinton, I don't read a fiction novel so that I can be reminded 15 times of that.Proofreading is sloppier than ever-- \\"Leonardo di Vinci,\\" \\"cui bonuo,\\" \\"Paulo\\" as an Italian name (actually Paolo), just to name a few. Sure it's [picky], but it's the most obvious sign of poor attention to detail.Clancy's success has gone to his head, and he's lost respect for his readers. He cares more about his own opinion than creating a good story or putting out good factual information. That's two strikes in a row; I'll read his good oldies again, but no more new stuff. Too many other good books are out there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was there the first day this book was avaliable, bought it 10 minutes after the bookstore opened, and 600 pages into it on my vacation..... I wish I was at the dentist, or something less painful than reading something that is NOT up to his typical quality of writing. This book plot has some good ideas, but with VERY POOR editing and an obnoxios obsession to try and make Jack Ryan a &quot;President of The People&quot; the book fizzles and dies. The racist and obnoxious actions in the White House around Ryan turns you off to the book instantly and the slow pace at which the plot unfolds really makes it difficult to get to what Clancy does best. Talk about Tanks, Guns, Blood, Guts, and Glory. Unfortuately when you get to it, It doesn't compare to previous works like Red Storm Rising, which after reading 10 times is STILL a page turner for me. This book drags and dies, although I finished it I would be hard pressed, even as a die hard Clancy fan to recommend this book to anyone. I think it's time to move on to a new set of characters or to something similar to what he did in the Red Storm Rising. PLEASE TOM! HELP US!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has made his fame and fortune writing of the techno thriller exploits of Jack Ryan. His first books in the series, beginning with THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, delivered thrills as promised. But with THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, Clancy has gone to the well once (possibly more considering EXECUTIVE ORDERS) too often. If Clancy were a novice author, it is not likely an editor would publish such a bloated and going-nowhere novel. The problem is not that Clancy has lost the ability to write. Rather, as he has churned out one bestseller after another, he has increasingly become the worst of all literary plagiarists; he has copied from himself. What is clear from merely holding such a massive novel (1,100 pages plus)is that if one comes to THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON from say, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, there is the sneaking suspicion that Clancy will place the titular hero Jack Ryan in a secondary capacity, have him mouth platitutes about his feelings about his new and unwanted job, and have Ryan react to rather than interact with the novel's complicating elements. In addition, Clancy here continues to fill out his novels with excessive details about bombs, missiles, and technical wizardry that do not materially add to the thrust of the action. As I was following the numerous and ill-connected subplots, I grew to realize that by page 900, Clancy had committed the worst sin a novelist could commit: the sinking feeling that Nothing Much Is Happening. An egregious example occurs when a male CIA operative subverts a female Chinese stenographer in Beijing into betraying her country solely on his amatory capacity to seduce. She is the flat character that occasionally pops up in any novel, and in her cringing and servile attitude toward her seducer, I myself felt like turning her in to her Communist party bosses. By the time the real business of the book happens, the obligatory chapters where missiles fly, guns explode, and nameless soldiers die, the end of the book was thankfully near. In this case, the conclusion involving a reworking of Tiannamen Square was so implausible that I could now see why Ryan wins as often as he does--his enemies are unintelligent buffoons. And if the Bad Guys of the book command the reader's attention even with their wayward ways, then you are quite sure that the hero needs to be rebuilt into someone who is more decisive than passive. It is time for Jack Ryan, in future Clancy novels, to appear in more chapters and to grapple more directly with upcoming bears and dragons."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is first Clancy book that I could not only put down but also the only one I didn't care whether I picked it up again or not. The story moved so slowly and some parts had so little to do with the plot I got bored reading. I could only recommend this book to someone having trouble sleeping at night. I will have a difficult time convincing myself to buy his next book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"And off we go again - the US combining with Russia to save the World from the Yellow Peril - though decidely less racist than the recent Patrick Robinson novels.Jack Ryan and his usual band of wooden characters (can a country really be governed by such a small number of people?) take on China aided by Russia and their 51st vassal state- the UK.Due to financial problems over its bad image, China goes to war with Russia to take over the East Siberian oil and gold fields, and tries to fulminate confusion by assassinating key figures, who are ultimately saved by US staff working in Russia, a la Sydney Poitier in The Jackal! To confirm that they are bad guys, Clancy also has them kill a Christian priest stopping a peri-natal termination of an illegal second child. Of course you have to assume that the US way of unlimited children is correct, and that the Chinese policy of one child only is evil. The US is permitted to interfere in other sovereign states affairs, but woe betide anyone who questions the American Way of Life.The monotonous repetitions of US/ Christian moral standards and virtues, (or are they Clancy's?) becomes tiring, and trying to force those values on the rest of the world is stone age colonialism at its best or just pure arrogance. The Ugly American personified.You knew from the start the Bart Mancuso will eventually give orders to sink other subs, and John Clarke will go off hand-to-hand, whilst declaming the virtues of the 3rd SOG, and Ryan's little family of the FBI/ CIA/ Dept. of Defence/ State and the Treasury will all talk nicely to each other, share all the relevant information, help the Russians, kill the bad guys and fly the flag high whilst bearing homage to mom, God, apple pie and the Constitution.It is rather like watching the Thunderbirds - an old TV puppet show, were you could see the strings controlling the heroic Tracy family as they spoke and moved. Reading a Clancy novel now feels like the hearing the same one-dimensional lines, and watching the same two dimensional movements - as the characters are strung across the pages by an apprentice puppet-master.One had the feeling that Tom Clancy himself was getting bored with the book, as the early detail of the first 300 pages, with some genuine character development of Nomuri and his Chinese lover, fell away to the usual weapon specs and tactics, with the ending being predicatable and sparsely written. Like Dale Brown, Larry Bond, Patrick Robinson and the other military writers, the US weapons alway work, everyone wearing a uniform is a hero, and anything opposing them is either copied or useless.One wonders if these writers ever get closer to China than visiting their local Chinese restaurant, reading &quot;Wild Swans&quot; or perusing an old copy of a Lonely Planet Travel Guide. CNN triumphs again as the media champion, living proof of the limited attention span of the average American citizen.A few references to the Echelon eavesdropping system are not expanded, ignoring the constant violation of privacy, while the FBIs own Carnivore system is not mentioned, and other names are just dropped as the pages turn over, while the books spends a lot of time on describing the war as a video game, with a mixture of conscience and congratulations as the enemy are mown down on screen just as in an arcade battle.No-one seems to want to write about Islamic terror groups anymore, African freedom fighters, Irish armies or neo-Nazis thugs, not wishing to upset those fanatics or risk an encounter with an old Toyota car with a Semtex back-seat, or exposing the behaviour of Mafia or Yakuza gangs, so China is by default now always the enemy. China may not be perfect, but look at the US 40 years ago, Russia 20 years ago, or the UK during the Victorian era, were they not great places to be?Tom Clancy has come a long way since the &quot;Hunt For Red October&quot;, but now he seems to be running out of ideas. Maybe Jack Ryan and the gang should retire, and a it is time for a new cast to appear.He and his fellow myopic military authors should also read and understand that there are many countries out there, with their own cultures and values, their own ways of doing things, and that they are just as important as his precious American Way of Life."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read most of what clancy has written and in this case, feel he has out done himself in delaying the action in order to provide himself with a forum for his conservative views.Of the 1024 odd pages, the action didn't start until I had fought my way through at least 720 pages of really boring dialogue dealing with issues such as Jack Ryan's views on Roe V Wade. To me ,everything has a place and clancy's views on that subject do not belong in an adventure novel, fiction at that. Whether I agree with clancy's views or not I bought the book for pleasure not to listen to his political opinions. Once the action started , I don't feel he was writing at the level of &quot;A RED STORM RISING&quot; OR &quot;RED OCTOBER&quot;. Those stories had you right in the action racing to the next page.it didn't happen here."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I give up. Clancy's parody of himself in \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is more than I can take. I've loved all the (real) Tom Clancy novels up to this point. I was so completely impressed by \\"Executive Orders\\" that I started thinking of Clancy's work as literature instead of him being just another fiction novelist. Boy, did I miss the mark on that one. This novel is so poorly put together I am at a loss for words.The Jack Ryan character that I have always respected comes across like a whiny little fussbudget. Here's an idea for Mr. Ryan: if you don't like the political games, don't run for president. Instead, this story picks up with Ryan having won the presidential election, and complaining all the way because he hates the \\"politics\\" of it all. The character is OUT of character so often that as a long time Clancy reader I was getting confused with his actions and reactions to events.In previous novels, Clancy had a flair and a style all his own, and when he would incorporate the military lingo it always sounded fresh. Now, it comes across forced and almost unreadable. Referring to someone as a \\"Two-Star General (promotable)\\" - what the heck does that mean? Do people actually speak to this general and refer to the fact that he's (promotable)? Same way with referring to Ryan as POTUS (President of the United States, get it?). I can see military strategists using that acronym on occasion, but Clancy uses the phrase as if it were as normal as saying \\"him\\" or \\"Ryan\\". The usage of the jargon sounds very forced here, and makes me feel as if Clancy is doing a parody of himself.There is another sequence involving an agent who seduces a woman to gain info. I don't know about you, but if I never read another sex sequence from Clancy it will be too soon. The agent also buys this girl lingere and perfume from Victoria's Secret, and makes an aside comment to himself \\"wait'll you see the drawers I just got you, honey\\". DRAWERS? Come on, DRAWERS? Tom Clancy had been the last person on Earth I would want to write any sort of seductive passages in a novel and this clinches it.I didn't even get far enough to revisit our old cardboard friends Clark and Chavez, but I'm sure they show up at some point or another. Of course you have Ed and Mary Pat Foley, that intrepid husband and wife team of spies, who have zero personality other than Ed calling his wife \\"honeybunny\\" repeatedly..... What a bad novel this is. Tom Clancy was so brilliant up to \\"Executive Orders\\". Now he is just a windbag. Sad."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I had read all Clancy's books, and I am so naive to think that he always did a detail research before he writes.I had no problem with the plot, I throw this book away without finishing it because I know that Mr. Clancy have not visit china or meet and talk with any chinese for the last 15 years. It's a pity that I had to give this book ONE Star to show this review."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read Executive Orders just prior to reading Bear and Dragon, and was quite disappointed in the absence of a driving plot that characterized the last Ryan novel. In many more pages, there was less plot advancement but a lot more philosophy and &quot;4-letter words&quot;. All the sexual references, a topic which in Clancy's prior works have been dealt with very tastefully, were uncomfortably vulgar. Surely he doesn't feel he needs to include the sexual stuff to sell his books... At times I wondered if the book were actually written by Clancy, it is so different in style. Also, how could he make reference to a black reporter as a &quot;monkey&quot; (albeit through the eyes of the arch enemy Japanese) while at other times championing the virtues of other black characters in the book? I felt very ripped off at the end, when a lot of major plot was flashed before my eyes in an obvious prelude to a future book. Cut out the middle 600 pages, and expand the last 50 pages to the size that the plot deserves, and I would be more encouraged to buy his next book. My advice- skip this one, hoping that the next Ryan novel summarizes prior events as well as Executive Orders did."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's first and maybe best &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; was 382 pages, the story was tight and exciting, &quot;Bear &amp; Dragon&quot; is 1028 pages, about 3x necessary to tell the story, tell us Tom does Putnam pay by the pound?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Oh dear, I so much wanted to like this book. Like many of the reviewers, I've been a TC fan ever since &quot;Red October&quot;. Unfortunately, this book falls far short of his best work, starting with the amount of filler. I enjoy a long meaty novel, but I had to force myself to get through this. The story dragged for several hundred pages in the middle and then resolved itself ridiculously quickly in about 20 pages.If you read TC, you know to expect an emphasis on tight action sequences, good suspense and military jargon, instead of on dialogue or serious character development (although there are some exceptions). But there is no excuse for the trite, unbelievable language and one-dimensional characters. In addition, I found myself wincing whenever I ran across the numerous typos or the repetitions in description. Come on, didn't they think the readers would notice this stuff?Many people have complained about the political/social views of the Jack Ryan character and how they mirror Tom Clancy's. If that's the way he wants to write the book, so be it. It is not necessary for me to be 100% in agreement with a character to enjoy a good story. However, I am disappointed that the Jack Ryan character turned in such a weak, ineffective, whiny performance in this book. I was looking forward to seeing him in action again after a virtual hiatus in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, but it wasn't worth the wait.I have given this book two stars because of a few redeeming enjoyable moments. But those were overweighed by the length, the trite characterizations (especially of the Chinese, who were very poorly drawn) and the heavy-handed moralizing. Again, this is not an issue of agreement. Whether or not I agree with Mr. Clancy's social policies is unimportant -- I just wish he had given us a real reason to stay interested in these characters."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I struggled through the first 180 or so pages of this very very excrucitaing book. I did not mind the endless repetitions, the unworthy whines of POTUS(!), very loose, very offensive, very vulgur way the whole darn globe was talking..did not even mind the racial coloring of the book...But then along came Jack Ryan alias POTUS alias SWORDSMAN complaining about ABORTION....That was the moment I tossed the book away. I mean what the hell has that got to do with Chinese attacking Russia ? And who wants a president that whines his days off.. I could not believe it was the same Jack Ryan. May be movie makers should consider Anthony Hpokins (a la Remains Of the Day) instead of Harry this time- if some one is incredibly stupid to make a mpvie based upon this pile of junk that is. If you havn't read this book yet - SAVE YOURSELF THE AGONY ! All the bad reviews about this book are right. I wish i had read them BEFORE i wasted my money on this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was entirely too long. As someone else said 400 not 1K pages. In addition, the only suspense in the book was waiting for something truly interesting to happen. This book was Euclidian--it went from point A to point B in a straight line. There were no plot twists. It seems the only inner conflict for jack Ryan is the hemmed in feeling he has in being President. After this book and the last one (Rainbow Six), I will wait until the reserve list in my local library drops to zero before I pick up the next Clancy novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As with all TC's books, the moment I saw it on a book shelf in Singapore, I just grab it, paid for it and rush home to consume it....and also to hell with any dates or appointments for the next couple of days or so. However I was very disappointed with this one. I have been a fan of TC since Red Storm Rising back when I was 11 years old. In fact without exposure to his books, I would not have been where I am right now. His books started my interest in reading. Trying to read his books makes me learn more English during a time when I was losing interest in learning. After his book I graduated to other non-fiction works by many other superb writers. As a indirect result of his magnificent 2nd book (Red Storm), I become a better, more productive person in my country.The book reads like an ethnic Chinese bashing book and I wonder if TC has ever been to China or even Asia. No doubt some things in the book are probably true but a lot of the facts just don't stand up correct. I mean, Singapore taking up slack in textile manufacturing? Huh? That seems like the economy here 10 years ago... And now after reading books like \\"Fall from Glory\\" by Mr. Gregory L. Vistica I begin to wonder how good are his facts are now.The Bear and the Dragon is definitely below par compare to his other books. And I just want to finish it off quick so I can start with Lee Kuan Yew's Third World to First."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;Not his best work&quot; is being generous. I've been a Tom Clancy fan since I first read &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; while deployed along the Inner-German Border at the height of the Cold War. But this is easily the worst Clancy I've ever read. The editing is horrendous, if there was editing at all. The sexual innuendo is laughable at best, and totally unnecessary. The plot lines drag along with no apparent direction or cohesion. To top it off, it appears that Clancy's main goal was to include every character that had ever appeared in a Ryan novel - except Marko Ramius, I think. And the abrupt ending just left me cold. Bottom line - it's not worth the effort to read. I struggled through it, hoping to see the Clancy of old. He's not there. Don't waste your time. Better to pick up a Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler - at least there's some excitement."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Sorry, but Tom has been mailing these in for awhile now, and this one is just beyond belief. At least 300 pages too long, packed with errors and inconsistencies, and worst of all, the Jack Ryan that I used to enjoy has been transformed into a foul-mouthed shrew, obsessed with sex.Please, can /anyone/ imagine an American president saying to the British prime minister 'Thanks pal!'.And the 75 references to 'Japanese sausage'? Ending the book with that???Not to mention the endless and shrill political diatribes in which we get to learn yet again that Clancy despises tree huggers, abortion, liberals and queers.This was a sad, sad effort. Or rather, lack of effort."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is supposed to be someone who prides himself on his realism and insider knowledge. Here's what I see in this clunker:1) Why is that every American officer is so brilliant, qualified and distinguished? In the stressful conditions of wartime, couldn't someone possibly make a bad decision? Just once? Instead, we get a steady dose of go-getting American officers dictating their will upon a prostrate enemy and coming up with brilliant plans that never fail. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the American military has made a few bad decisions over the years. Now about Vietnam for starters?2) Why is every that American weapon works absolutely perfectly every time? We get it Tom, we're smarter than everyone else, but just once can something go wrong? Could a tank break down or something? History shows us that not everything America has produced has exactly been a war winning wonder weapon. Logic would dictate that in a future war, this might be the case as well.3) This book gives us the usual claptrap Tom usually serves up to his readers: a large, evil, numerically superior enemy meets defeat at the hands of the gutty, irrepressible, ingenious, never say die Americans. It's like the Magnificent Seven or an A-Team episode on a larger scale.4) Why this love affair with Russia? Clancy hammers the Chinese as mindless savages, but gives the Russians a pass for an equally impressive laundry list of human rights violations.5) Who was there no mention of the breakaway Russian republics? The book mentions that American troops in Europe travel through Poland and across Russia. I'm no politcal science expert, but wouldn't the Americans also have to travel through the Ukraine and would the Ukrainians let them through?Bottom line, this book was a terrible disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"For the first time, a Tom Clancy novel is dragging me as a reader. And, getting dragged over 1000-plus pages of mediocre story telling is really chafing. The spelling mistakes are annoying and all these knowing looks between Jack Ryan and his crowd is cloying. The good guys are too good and almost cartoonishly overdrawn; the bad guys are too bad and paper thin. The Bear and the Dragon doesn't measure up in terms of pace, suspense or character development with my Clancy favorites: Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, and Clear and Present Danger. Do I detect that Tom is tired of this line of novels? After reading The Bear and The Dragon, I'm thinking I will not be rushing out, as I did last week for this one, for the next Clancy novel. I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY CLOSE TO REALITY. IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO GET TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN THE NOVEL, BUT THE TIME IS WELL SPENT. CLANCY BRINGS TO LIGHT A LOT OF ISSUES THE WORLD SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH ABOUT TWO ECONOMICALLY STRUGLING NATIONS AND THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE WESTERN NATIONS OF THE WORLD."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Again, the king of the techno-thrillers, hits another homerun with the bases loaded. The book starts wtih a bang but as usual picks up speed until the end of the book. Clancy really shows his technical as well as literary skills in all portions of the book, especially in the battle scenes. The author also, in a side note, seems to handle &quot;sexual espionage&quot; as astutely as he does in describing military hardware. This book is another must read to all of us who are hooked on this genre. I cannot even imagine where the next installment of &quot;Jack Ryan-president-knight-spook&quot; will take us, but I cannot wait to come along for the ride. Thanks again to the author, the ending of the book, and everything in between, was as usual, so good, as to be almost painful to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a Clancy fan ever since my father took me to see &Ograve;Red October&Oacute; when I was in Jr. High. Since then Ive read every book and my appreciation has only grown. While I was greatly let down by &Ograve;Without Remorse&Oacute; and &Ograve;Rainbow Six&Oacute; (even though Clark is my favorite character), Bear and Dragon illustrates all the best in Clancys cache of literary talents. The plot, focusing on President Ryans second term as commander and chief, involves Russias new found Siberian oil fields, Chinas last grasp at imperialism, espionage, counter espionage, the press and one hell of a great conventional battle reminiscent of &Ograve;Red Storm Rising&Oacute;.The plot is one of his largest and most involved yet, causing some readers to cringe in fear upon learning of the massive page count, but upon completion of this book youll feel very contented and eager for more. The story is plotted out like a chess game, and once the reader starts to see everything falling into place, we marvel at that satisfaction the climax gives us."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy for years, and a big fan of Jack Ryan. It's great to see them both back. I found Bear &amp; Dragon to be one of his finest. I thought it was well written, with more humor and not overwhelmed with &quot;techno-babble&quot; as some of his things can be. Fantastic work Mr. Clancy. Keep them coming... :-)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is another winner by Tom Clancy. The plot is convoluted, with several different stories going on at once, and each one captures you. Clancy moves back and forth from one to the other, and interconnects them skillfully. Amazon's editorial review pretty well covers it.Clancy is the master storyteller. He has no peer when it comes to action stories and contemporary situations. He has done his research. His characters live and breathe, and his situations are plausible and well-drawn. This is a big book--over 1,000 pages--but it will hold your interest to the end.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"WithExecutive Orders, one wondered if Tom Clancy's future novels might continue to devolve into misguided political and economic preaching, but with \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" Clancy is back on track with plenty of action and realism.When Clancy discusses espionage and military tactics and hardware, he speaks from knowledge and makes it interesting. Tom Clancy doesn't write great (literary) novels, but this one, like most of his, is great escape reading. It is probably more exciting for those of us who have readThe Sum of All Fears. I won't say why, but if you read \\"The Sum\\" before \\"Bear & Dragon,\\" you will be glad you did.Nomuri and Ming are a charming pair I hope to read more about.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I haven't read the book yet; I just bought it at a book signing Clancy was doing here in DC.

Cardinal of the Kremlin is my all-time favorite, which may explain why I really enjoyed this book. Sure the book has it's faults, all of which seem to be painfully explained in other revues. I personally enjoyed the &quot;entertainment&quot; value and didn't take it as serious as everyone else. If you like Tom Clancy you will like this book, if you loved the Cardinal of the Kremlin, you will love this book...enjoy"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Seems a lot of people don't think this one is that good, but I liked it a lot. Unlike long Stephen King novels, which drag on for me, with Clancy novels, they can be as long as he wants them to be. In my opinion, he needs the space to set the story for something as elaborate as World War III.This one had a lot more sexual references than previous Clancy novels I've read, and sometimes I wondered if we really need to know the ancient leaders of China get their stone-age stones off, but there can be no denying that spies in history have used seduction to gain access to secrets. I kept imagining the seduced Chinese woman as the \\"Honey\\" character that follows Duke around in the \\"Doonesbury\\" comic strip, but if they ever make a movie out of it, I'm sure someone much more beautiful would be cast.One thing I like about this series of books is that it attempts to show the everyday lives of people who wield the most power in the world. We see these people in the news all the time, but what are their daily routines like? While fiction, it's probably still as close as we are going going to get to seeing how these people live.Without revealing too much, a small problem I had was the relative ease with which our government succeeds in it's part of the big conflict. I realize we recently cut through Afganistan fairly easily, but even in this case, there is still a lot of mopping up to do. With the World War portrayed in this book, the foes go way up in class, and while it's nice to root for the good guys (us), it all seems to me it was a little too neat and quick.However, in my eyes, keep these books coming."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy keeps them coming, book after book. From military expertise to government politics, to thirld world terrorism, this book has it all.

The Bear and the Dragon offers a political plot that is hardly convincing and a military story that cannot be believed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a Clancy fan ever since his first book. I eagerly awaited The Bear and Dragon because I had really gotten into these characters. I had to stop reading less than half way through the book. The language was consistently foul and just that, foul language. The story was extremely interesting and I did try to stay with it; the language intruded so much I finally quit because it was overriding the story. I have no objection to strong language when it helps the story; this does not. Language in the military and in government office circles is not as depicted by Clancy. I will not be buying another of his books (and I own all the others)."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Can't say that I have finished the book yet but it certainly on par with PG or SoAF. Perhaps not yet as captivting as HfRO, but that has always been a tough act to follow. Ryan is always entertaining and should be a write in candidate in November."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I bought this book at lunch time yesterday, anxious to see what Clancy has been up to since the release of Rainbow Six. Naturally I don't know what he has been up to, but it hasn't been paying attention to deatil. Pardon me for nitpicking, but I feel that I must.In the first chapter, Clancy refers to a character as a National Intelligence Officer. In beltwayspeak, this person would be referred to as a NIO (rhymes with Geo). A NIO is an intelligence officer that gathers collected intelligence data and prepares, then delivers daily intelligence summaries for The President. He goes on to describe this NIO as being at CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, preparing a briefing, then DRIVING (during the DC rush hour!) to the White House and going to his office. On the next page, this NIO is revealed to be the National Security Advisor. Again, this may be overly picky, but please! The National Security Advisor to the President of The United States doesn't drive to CIA HQ, then drive to the White House. Further, the National Security Advisor doesn't normally present the daily intelligence summaryFor someone as clued in as Clancy was always purported to be, this seems quite shoddy. One wonders if all of his good ideas went out the window when Larry Bond went off to write on his own.I'll have more when I am finished"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let's be clear. This is not Debt of Honor or Executive Orders (probably the best one-two punch I've ever read). That being said, it's an easy, decent read. On the Clancy scale, if you like the Op-Center stuff, you'll like this. If you find Op-Center too much like a mind-numbing, cookie cutter read, don't get this. I fall in the latter category. :-)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A good and pleasant read. 600 pages but reads fast. Those who are uncomfortable with morality or moral distinctions will be uncomfortable with this book. I myself am not and found the book excellent."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Two books back in &quot;Role Of Honor&quot;, doomed Prez Roger Durling threw Jack a curve: &quot;Be my new veep-the old one made an a-hole outa himself.&quot; Jack said; &quot;Aw come on, Mr. President&quot;, but he gave in anyway. In this book, Jack tosses his best friend the same sort of spitball and both beneficiaries should have told their benefactors where to stuff this &quot;great honor&quot;. If you read &quot;Role&quot; and its successor &quot;Executive Decisions&quot;, you will know that Robby found getting kicked upstairs to Admiral a very dubious honor indeed-the man was a Navy flyboy and loved it. A vice president I don't remember the name of once commented that each of his predecessors had historically left office a better golfer than when he was sworn in. That's the fate of Top Gun Jackson, whose Secret Service codename is now TOMCAT. Name him after his jet fighter-thanks a heap, Mr. President! Jack himself remains a truly off-balance Leader Of the Free World in this book, so one saving grace of this effort is that a lot more of it is focused on the front line troops like John Clark and Ding Chavez (co-stars of sidestream tale &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;), Russian luminaries Sergey Golovko and Gen. Gennady Bondarenko, and our old friend Chet Nomuri from &quot;Role Of Honor&quot;. Also, &quot;offscreen&quot; character Rev. Hosiah Jackson (we only knew him through son Robby's anecdotes about his childhood) gets a speaking role here through his congregation's outreach aid to a Chinese Baptist preacher. Clancy does sort of recycle one of his old plot premises here-that of &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Clancy's second novel written at a time when he might yet not have had plans for a Ryan series. In that book, the pre-perestroika Soviet Union suffers an oil field disaster that collapses their economy and this moves them to mount an invasion of Western Europe. In this book, a diplomatic atrocity on the part of China, coupled with a refusal by nationalists in Beijing to admit wrong, results in an embargo on trade, which destabilizes their economy. At the same time, Russia becomes the beneficiary of a mineral bonanza in Siberia. The reaction of Beijing to that-&quot;hmmmm&quot;. You know, I'm reading a lot of attempts in other reviews to paint Clancy's work as right-wing manifesto masquerading as entertainment, more specifically the demonization of an enemy nation. The ancient bromide &quot;They don't think the way we do&quot; has been used as a way to avoid understanding the other folks as people for millennia, but in this book BOTH sides use it--and actually they're both right to a very real extent. Clancy takes another opportunity here to trot out his old aphorism about war being a humongous armed robbery, but that's only one theory. Military historian Gwynne Dyer defines it as one nation imposing its will upon another by use of force--that's another. But when you get right down to it, war is also the collision of cultures who don't think alike. And I can't help but see many of the objections here as being an aftereffect of the 1960s/ '70s Peace Movement which I was part of myself back then. After we had accurately spotted the irony that the noisy love-it-or-leave-it bunch seemed to be more nationalists than they were patriots, we fell into the hubris that we could social-engineer that flaw out of the entire human species in a few semesters. A lot of us outgrew that brand of undergrad arrogance but I'm afraid those of us who did can't speak for everyone. Especially when the issue is entertainment, which is first and foremost what Tom Clancy does for his bread and butter. There isn't a damn thing created by anyone that doesn't offend someone. I don't read Tom Clancy for his poli-sci expertise-I've never been particularly impressed with that. Clancy's value to me is as a storyteller. Period. There are products sold here that I wouldn't want if they paid me to take them. So that stuff doesn't wind up on my &quot;wish list&quot; or in my &quot;shopping cart&quot;. I vote with my mouse-it's that simple. Come on, gang--every dime we spend here is for FUN."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy displays his international crisis and probabal causes for war yarn spinning abilities in full force with his latest novel. This book was execellent, and classic Clancy. Wheter you are die hard Clancy fan, or a first timer, this book is for you. It's believeble and keeps you on the edge of your seat always waiting to see what was on the next page. Tom Clancy's book, The Bear and the Dragon is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Power: It's the ultimate aphrodisiac, Henry Kissinger once quipped. Mao Tse Tung agreed, joking that it explained why Mr. Kissinger was able to attract such nubile women.Some time in the early 21st century, the US faces a crisis and chalenge to its position as leader of the community of nations as the modern Chinese and old Russian communists unite to remake the world order in the image of Marx, Lenin, and other communist leaders.This is far better than recent Tom Clancy material. It is a complex and multithreaded spy novel that's worth of at least 2 (possibly 3) Hollywood feature films.Unlike many spy novels, this one is firmly rooted in modern geo-political realities, and in the contermporary methods of espionage.Perhaps the only character who is 'miscast' in this novel is POTUS Jack Ryan. Clearly he is the opposite of Bill Clinton: a patriot who loves his country, and who sees the Chinese communists as competitors for world leadershipo--not a source of ready cash for re-election; and sees their political &amp; economic system as a threat to American prosperity--not something to be fueled by giving away nuclear secrets.President Jack Ryan is not the mushy liberal of TV's &quot;The West Wing&quot;, who loves Washington DC and thinks that more government programs will solve all of the nation's problems. He's a reluctant realist, who understands that the government is as much a problem as a solution to most problems, and that the job of the president is not to be the nation's feel-good guy; it's to uphold the Constitution, protect and defend the borders, and make sure that (as the CEO) his subordinates understand that they must serve the interests of the nation, not themselves.Will George W. Bush rise to meet the challenges that maight be posed during his term in office? Time will tell; one hopes for the best but fears for the worst.The action is well paced, the characters are engaging. The bok is a great read. In between the main plots, Clancy's characters put in observations, comments and asides that enhance, rather than detract, form the novel.Examples: classified CIA documents on Mao's perverse sex life; the petty intrusions of the press on presidential power; the poor quality of Russian pistol silencers [and pistols too for that matter]; lurid details of cutting men's throat with a knife (&quot;they flop around and make noise when you do that&quot;); the sameness of police work in Moscow &amp; New York (contrasted with glaring cultural differnces). I suspect that this is a book conservatives and James Bond fans will love, but which liberals and NRA opponents will hate. Perhaps Mr, Clancy, after releasing several flat novels wherein he attempted to please everyone has decided to go back to the audiences that made him a major selling author: Republicans and other conservatives."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a long time Clancy reader and a former fan. The story line was excellent. But first, the reader must get by all the profanity, bigoted, racist, and chauvanistic remarks and action.The right wing &quot;whining&quot; by Jack Ryan became very tiresome very early. Give me a break. Yes, the whole world knows the extreme Republican Right Wing knows what is right for EVERYONE. And the rest of the public is too stupid to know what is best for all concerned.Clancy has great story ideas. I hope he can catch a clue and go back to writing great books and forget his extremist right wing tendencies."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is a great book. Classic Clancy-detailed, opoinionated, rascist, misogynistic, self serving, thinly disguised right wing propoganda. But it's still a great read. There is no denying that Clancy has puts his personal, political, and sociological beleifs into his books. So what-he still spins a good yarn."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Read a lot of Clancy and regardless of whether I enjoy them or not or thought they were somewhat slow, I could always count on his ability to get factual details, particularly with technical details correct. This book has significant errors that one does not expect from Tom Clancy. Seems that he has gotten lazy with his success and writes no better than the typical military-fiction types are writing today. Disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"O.K. so it wasn't his best work ever. But it is still TC and he's the best. There were some things I could have done without (Ryan's whining about being President, Japanese sausage). But still it's classic Clancy and worth buying. In fact, I had a hard time studying for some finals because I was busy reading Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First of all, this book was about 500 pages too long. Dont get me wrong, im all for long books, especially if they are good and interesting, unfortunatly this was not that good. It was certainly streaky, with parts of it flowing along quite well, unfortunatly it was mostly a slow, boring book. Secondly, the battles are terrible in comparison to Red Storm Rising. I suffered through 700 pages of missery only to find maybe 40-60 pages of action. In the end I felt like I was locked in a dungen being teased horribly by the incomplete and unsatisying ending. This book is better than Rainbow 6, which is the only good thing I could say about it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read a number of reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if the people writing them read the same book that I did. Is this the best Clancy novel that I have read? No. However, it is a good read and continues the story. I agree with some other reviewers that we know that Jack is not into being the President and that is overstated in the book. Does Tom Clancy give us a believable plot in The Bear and the Dragon? Yes. Does he give us the bad guys that we love to see taken out? Yes. He also give us the delightful little sub-plots that make it work for me. You don't have to like the politics of Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy), but if your like me, you don't think there is much wrong with Jack's ideas! If you are looking for Cardinal in the Kremlin, this one may not be for you, but if you are looking to a logical extension of the Jack Ryan saga and a book that keeps you in it, this one fits the bill."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is a good story teller desperately in need of a competent editor! What would be a terrific page turner at 500 pages just seems too long and dragged out at over 1,000 pages. We don't need all the technical details, Mr. Clancy. Please just move your story along!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was a very frustrating read - the book is poorly written and has numerous problems, but somewhere in this mess is a good story, and Clancy does occasionally show flashes of his previous brilliance. The book is too long, ends too abruptly and really needs a good editor.Among the problems is that Jack Ryan has become a whiner. The Jack Ryan from &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; is no more. The new Jack Ryan can not go more than a few minutes without complaining about being president, even though he ran for the office and was elected to it. Ryan has surrounded himself with yes-men and -women. Only his Chief of Staff will provide any sort of counterargument, which is usually only token and couched in terms of practical politics. Ryan also seems to be inclined to use emotional arguments or his own personal beliefs as a basis for decision making - something which is at odds with his persona in the earlier books. One example: when the Really Bad Thing is about to happen near the end of the book, Ryan and company react in an emotional manner not unlike the hated President Fowler does in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;.Clancy is not shy about sharing his political views with the reader. Of course he has always done this, and the reader is free to agree or disagree. My objection is that these political interruptions have become so numerous and shrill that they impede the flow of the plot without providing any benefit.Many lines of thought or expressions are repeated verbatim in different places in the book. How many times do we need to read the same story about Chairman Mao's sex life? How many times does someone refer to the Chinese leadership as Klingons? There are many small errors of fact in the book - though not nearly so many as in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. These should have been caught in the editing process - if Clancy can get the date wrong for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, how reliable is the rest of the material?I rate &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; as slightly better than &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; but a long way below the earlier Jack Ryan novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has been reading too much of his own press. He still can write a good story but now he has to add his irrelevant opinion wherever possible. &quot;Tree huggers&quot; and clinton references abound. This book is much too long and should have been about half the size."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a big fan of Clancy, Clear and Present Danger is awesome, but with The Bear and The Dragon Clancy appears to have stopped trying. Compared to his previous novels this plot is predictable and lacking in his usual cunning twists. I found myself waiting for something unexpected to happen but it never did. I know Tom is a patriot but I don't think one American soldier died in the entire book! He repeated himself far too often. Yes Jack I know you hate this job, it's the fifth time you have told me. I understand! At one point Clancy says that even scratching an American warship is tantamount to war. That's funny. Someone blew a hole in one the other day without retribution. I think there is a bit too much of how Clancy would like America to be as opposed to how it, and the world, really is. Still, if you like Clancy it's worth a read. I just hope this is only a smudge on an otherwise fantastic career."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If I had to characterize this book, I would say, &quot;strange&quot;. I've read every Clancy novel, most of them several times. I've enjoyed all of them, and considered any of his work (as opposed to the Op-Center series) a must-buy. Now, I'm not so sure. I have two problems with this book: First, way too long. It could have been done in about 700 words, easily. Over 1000 was a bit much. Second, I have a hard time justifying all the profanity in this book. He has used it before, but never to this extent, and most of it is absolutely pointless. I'm not a prude by a long shot, I hear all this and more during an average work day. But in a novel like this, and in this context, there is no need for the level that I read. There was also sexual content, something else that is new, and something that given the &quot;tone&quot; of his other Ryan works, was pointless. Gratuitous sex scenes is the thought that comes to my mind. More or less, I think if he had an editor with enough brains and brass, he would have pulled this one out. As it is, I won't be so inclined to rush out and buy the next one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been reading Tom Clancy since Naval Institute Press published The Hunt for Red October. It is sad to see his writing getting progressively worse. He still does action sequences as well as anyone, and he still puts care into plotlines leading up to these sequences. He also tends to insert irrelevant political tracts, sections of character-building which essentially repeat the same passage from fifty pages previous, and long drawn out bits of plot development which are not really necessary nor particularly interesting. What he needs is a good editor, but his publisher is unwilling or unable to do edit his books effectively. The result is that as his books get larger we get more of what he is bad at rather than what he is good at. After Rainbow Six I was giving him one last chance, and he failed. We are better off re-reading Patriot Games or Cardinal of the Kremlin, written at Clancy's peak."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After Debt of Honor, his last great book, Clancy has gotten into this flag waving, chest thumping, zealously patriotic theme. I feel like I'm reading a recruiting poster. Tom, wherever you are stop it! Make your characters real again!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As far as Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan Saga goes, THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is a step back--and a step forward.The step back is way back to Clancy's second novel, RED STORM RISING, where an intercontinental conflict begins over possession of oil. In this case, the oil (along with a saturated riverbed of pure gold) belong to Russia, and the enemy who wants it is Minister Zhang (whom we first met in DEBT OF HONOR), who goads his fellow members in China's politburo to invade Siberia to answer the nation's money shortage. Clancy has taken RED STORM's basic plot and reworked it for this saga, and the results are generally successful, although somewhat repetitive if readers have already seen RED STORM.Interestingly, although Ryan is clearly the main protagonist, he is also the least involved in the actual action. He does little, if any, of the traditional Clancy heroics; apart from describing the general policy of his government he is, in effect, a bystander. Clancy's other &quot;heroes,&quot; John Clark and Ding Chavez of RAINBOW SIX, also play essentially minor roles.The job of heroics go, instead, to a myriad of characters from previous novels who really get a chance to shine. General Bodarenko, from THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN, finds himself defending Siberia from the Chinese invasion. Chuck Nomuri, the CIA operative from DEBT OF HONOR, seduces the secretary of a Politburo member to gain access to their inner thoughts. Mark Gant (the technogeek from DEBT OF HONOR) and Cliff Rutledge (the liberal diplomat from EXECUTIVE ORDERS) confront the Chinese--and themselves--in a trade dispute that pushes the Politburo over the edge.The &quot;spreading out&quot; of heroics is one of the reasons Clancy's works are difficult for Hollywood to adapt; the &quot;stars&quot; don't do much and the &quot;bit players&quot; carry the day. This structure is a refreshing change from the genre works where the &quot;stars&quot; do everything essential to the novel.Clancy has also better managed the technoprops that are a staple of his novels; he has better emphasis on training and tactics than on hardware and gimmickry.Clancy's book has weaknesses, of course. While he has toned down the political ranting of EXECUTIVE ORDERS, it is still here, and still comes across as preachy as The National Review with too much coffee. And the villains here are still very much too one-dimensional; the Chinese ministers are as badly realized as the Russians of RED STORM. Clancy's bad guys have always been arrogant and egotistical to the point of caricature, and these are no exception. He has never been able to top Cortez of CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER for a three-dimensional villain.Clancy, as a writer, has moved forward in his story structure and characterizations (of his heroes and supporting characters at least); unfortunately he has moved backwards in his plots, which is problematic in this new age of geopolitics. In a world where regional conflict (the world of RAINBOW SIX) is the norm, and in the absence of true superpowers to rival the US, the odds are pretty good that President Ryan's current adventure will be his last."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"To Whom this may concern,This novel is very lengthy with 1137 pages and for the majority of the book, most of the novel is sophomoric dialogue and includes racial slurs such as \\"Joe Chink\\" used by figures in the White House including the main character; President Ryan. For the first 600 pages, the story is very droll, with very unimportant details being stated and overall, the main plot does not progress very quickly. This novel is very verbose with emphasis on great detail and complex strategies. Tom Clancy's political affiliation can definitely be determined with this novel as being far right almost to the point of fascism. Clancy I admit has a great talent for making a story, but his scenarios that the book presents very unrealistic situations and Clancy uses the military like a child plays with his toys. Clancy also uses elements of racism in the novel particularly against the Chinese, and also the reader can ascertain the fact that this novel displays what Tom Clancy wants in the national political agenda. The novel displayed however a great deal of knowledge for military equipment, tactics, and strategies for which Clancy deserves full credit. Other novels by Tom Clancy I have enjoyed due to the fact that they were believable and were also very relevant to our era. This novel was very random in speculating that China would invade Russia and actually deploy an ICBM at the U.S. The main character President Ryan, in my opinion reminds me of a whiny incompetent bureaucrat because he ran for president and he complains that he is the President. If Ryan didn't like politics then he shouldn't have ran! His administration is surrounded by his friends and people whom he is very closely acquainted and also very effective (how convenient!). His display of wealth in excess of $80,000,000 and his relationship with the common man is too good to be true. His exuberant wealth display's Tom Clancy's pompous attitude toward the common American and this novel merely reflects Tom Clancy's personal convictions. If you have plenty of time to waste and enjoy military scenarios, you might enjoy this novel but otherwise it is not the best I have read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is a fine author, even an important one. His early books helped inspire a generation of Americans to military service after Vietnam, adding momentum to the tide that defeated the old Soviet Empire. That said, Tom Clancy has probably been coasting on his considerable laurels for some time now.THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is yet another installment in the long, downhill slide of Mr. Clancy's body of work. The action scenes are fine, the plot twists are, for the most part, interesting, but the author's overbearing opinions are wearing thin and his geopolitics, military tactics, operational art, and logistical understanding could use serious updating - not to mention that the use of gratuitous obscenities has appeared to reach an all-time high (low) and seems out of place much of the time.Sadly, after having developed the Jack Ryan character, Mr. Clancy is obviously loath to leave him behind and create a new potential future. As a result, we are stuck with Mr. Ryan's world. It is a world where terrorists detonated a faulty atomic bomb during the Superbowl, a Japanese Kamikaze piloted a 747 into Capitol Hill during a joint session of Congress, killing most of the Members of Congress and the President (and showing the author's contempt for politicians), and where the United Islamic Republic (Iran and Iraq) tried to rule the world and failed. As a result, we are so far down an alternate path of history that the Jack Ryan series has transcended the realm of the interesting \\"what if?\\" to mere fantasy.One must invest a huge amount of time to consume this monster book. What caused me to finally read it was that the many readers of my own book, CHINA ATTACKS, pestered me into reading Clancy's thriller (which came out months after the release of my own more modest effort at chronicling a future Chinese assault on a neighbor). In this regard, I consider this Clancy effort somewhat harmful (whereas his early efforts were helpful in improving the average person's understanding of the world). Clancy does do a commendable job in alerting us to the danger of aggression by the PRC. He fails in painting an accurate portrait of how the Chinese will seek to exploit our weaknesses while maximizing their strengths in any future conflict involving America. In THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, as in most other Clancy works, once America sets her mind to the task, the enemy falls like a house of cards - sadly, in real life, the enemy gets a vote on the outcome too.Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2010, a California State Assemblyman, he served as a Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Defense from 1986 to 1988, retired from the Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel, and is the co-author of \\"China Attacks.\\""},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...This book is a massive disappointment, it is extremely predictable almost an insult to the reader. The plot could have been condensed in 60 pages and doing it in 800 really makes it a sleeping pilThe xenophobic tendencies which have always been disturbingly present in Clancy books have climaxed in this one (sorry guys the US is not the center of the world and no the rest of the world is not filled with barbarians)In short DO NOT BUY THIS ..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Speaking as a Tom Clancy fan, I was left disappointed by this book. His past strengths do continue, namely the battle scenes and the characters developed from previous novels, but overall things bog down and at times seem to be running in reverse.Several pages may be devoted to what amounts to someone staring at the ceiling thinking about something. Yes, internal struggles can be interesting but not over and over and over.....reading this book sometimes is like sitting with a group of drunk philosophy majors late at night in the dorm.Several devices that were interesting in prior stories (including obsession with cigarettes and booze) seem tired and overdone. The Chinese have become caricatures and stereotypes, boringly predictable. And what about this obsession with the male genitalia? If I talked half as much about \\"Richard\\" as Clancy does, I'd never be allowed in a locker room again.Finally, the coincidences are so numerous as to make the story unbelievable. Gosh, Clark just happens to be in the right spot at the right time to save the day. Gosh, the computer programmer just happened to be around at the right time to save the day. Gosh, Golovko, etc etc etc. This novel has too much of about everything, except for self-control on Clancy's part."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read all of Clancy's previous books, and I've liked them all. Due to some of the reviews I've read, I wisely checked this one out from the library. I did finish this book, and I was relatively satisfied with it. If you have read every other Clancy book, read this one. If you haven't, don't bother until you have!When my father and I discuss pop literature, we always like to discuss different authors &quot;formulas&quot;. To contrast Clancy, Dick Francis's formula describes a world (horse racing instead of Global techno-politics) from many different views, rarely using the same hero. The Bear and the Dragon simply is the next novel in the &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; formula. Clancy likes to talk about all different angles on his subject, but always uses Jack Ryan, back as the reluctant hero (can you be the reluctant hero forever?)All you fans out there intimidated by the negative review remember that this is the same formula you liked from book one.I loved Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and every book after those two. Sure, The Bear and the Dragon isn't his best effort. You are going to want to skip to about page 200 or so because certain subplots are dull. But toward the end I couldn't put it down, which is what I look for in thriller novels.Personally, I would like Clancy to drop Ryan as the hero. However, if he puts out another Ryan book, I'm going to read it, and hope for the best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy never served in uniform but continues to write books about those who did. While one can do this in fiction with a certain amount of research, it seems as if success has gone to his head. Special Operations soldiers are not as he portrays them. I heard Clancy speak at Ft. Campbell, KY addressing members of Task Force 160 (the Nightstalkers) and 5th Special Forces Group and he was condescending to the very men he writes his fiction about. If you want real spec ops fiction, read the Brit Andy McNabb's SAS books; Bob Mayer's Special Forces stories; heck, even Dick Marcinko is more realistic than this. No slam on the author personally, but let's differentiate between fact and fiction and what one knows and has lived."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book will not be enjoyable to liberals, pin head elites and most women. It tells a story from a middle class man's point of view, and since that is where I am, I enjoyed it. Certainly not a great read, too many characters with foreign names which are difficult to remember and a little long winded. I suggest writing the Russian and Chinese characters down until you get a feel for the main characters. The real action starts in the middle of the book and that is around the 500 mark in pages. Yes, this is a long read, and not for everyone, but again, I enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read the first three chapters, and I can't stop.

I think every one should read this intresting book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you haven't gotten around to this book yet, take my advice and don't bother. This is my last book by Mr. Clancy. He's apparently run out of ideas with Jack Ryan and company. Since the Russians are our buds now it's the evil Chinaman that we both hate! What outrageous use of Yellow Peril race baiting that Clancy employs in this book. It's probably Causus Belli for the Chinese against us already. I'm sure if somebody in China had written something as scurrilous as this about Americans we'd all be up in arms. Oh and please tell Clancy to stop trying to write about sex, it's really a turn-ff. If I wanted to read well-written stories about sex, I'll get the Penthouse Forum letters."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I originally bought this book to get a clearer perspective on Sino-USA relationships. Boy, how wrong I was to think I would get anything out of this book. After a thousand pages of an overly simplistic plot, and several dozen irrelevant subplots, every page is a chore to turn.The only clear message delivered by the end of the book was Clancy's contempt for everything Chinese. Several characters comment on the low quality of the food in China. It's laughable how a Japanese-American agent takes a Chinese girl to a European restaurant and she exclaims that this was the best food she had ever eaten in her entire life. Thankyou for showing me the superiority of white people's food. Jesus Christ. All Chinese are racist. A black man walks down the street in Beijing, and I can't remember how he put it, but he said something like all the Chinese looked at him like an alien or a monkey or something. Isn't it great to be in a place where blacks are treated as equals--like the USA?... Is this character here being Clancy's mouthpiece?The entire plot hinges on a high level Chinese government minister who gets his secretary to transcribe every single discussion he had with the other ministers. Surprise surprise, the secretary has been wooed by great Euro food (kicked Chinese food...), so why not give all these transcripts to the American agent? THe Americans are thus able to read the Chinese government's mind. Makes no sense at all.This book has no worth at all. It is inaccurate politically, militarily, and culturally. The plot is a joke, and to put it simply, it's just republican bitching (mainly about China, incl the usuals-e.g. abortion etc)the whole way through. Unless you just like to collect Clancy books for the sake of completion, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"There was a time when Tom Clancy wrote enjoyable, if not particularly deep, novels. The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising provided an engrossing read and interesting \\"what-if\\" scenarios. But as time went on, Tom Clancy's novels descended into bloated, jingoistic rantings. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where he \\"jumped the shark\\" (I'd pin him at the ludicrous Rainbow Six) but one thing is clear: he's certainly not the writer he used to be.The Bear and the Dragon stands as one of the most offensive and outright racist books I've ever read, and I've read Mein Kampf. As you might ascertain from the title, the book concerns a conflict between Russia and the People's Republic of China, and naturally the intervention of Tom Clancy's America. Unfortunately for the reader, and anyone remotely familiar with Chinese culture, it soon becomes painfully obvious that Clancy did absolutely no research on China at all. Apparently Clancy thinks Chinese officials address each other with \\"comrade\\", dress in Mao suits, and act in such a stereotypically villainous manner I half-expected Fu Manchu to make an appearance. To make matters worse, a major plot point is based on his misunderstanding of China's \\"one child\\" policy. The hateful portrayal of the Chinese seems to stem not from any bona fide \\"research,\\" but from the simple fact that they're not white, not Christian, and not American. As it stands, the horrendously inaccurate portrayal of the Chinese is enough to make me not recommend the book to anyone, but it is merely one in a string of literary offences this novel commits.Then there's our hero, Jack Ryan. He's gone from an everyman who got caught up in extraordinary situations, to a superman who is capable of anything and is gifted with amazing powers of intuition, a perfect wife who is the best doctor around, and perfectly behaved little children. Yet despite all this, Ryan does nothing but whine, and whine constantly, about how much he hates being president. When he's not doing that, he engages in tedious internal rants that present his right-wing views as something that should be obvious to even the most ignorant of people, which became quite tiring and offensive after hearing them for the twelfth time or so. Jack Ryan and the rest of the \\"good guys\\" even go so far as to accuse the Chinese of racism, when they themselves are spewing every anti-Asian slur there is. What's worse is that Clancy himself seems to be utterly unaware of this blatant hypocrisy. The good guys are all white, Christian, and all right-of-center in their political orientation, and Clancy lets you know it at least once every chapter. He even engages in tiresome religious diatribes , giving us a lengthy rant from a preacher about the evil, godless Chinese. If it wasn't obvious before, the whole \\"let's make Jack Ryan president\\" plot was nothing more than an excuse by Clancy to remake America in his vision, and what a terrible vision it is.Clancy's writing style has also suffered terribly...and it's not as if it was that exceptional to begin with. He likes to repeat snippets of information, and even repeats dialogue between characters. How many times do we need to hear that Mao liked \\"13 year old virgins?\\" He many times do we need to hear that Ryan's little girl \\"gives the best kisses?\\" How many times do we have to hear Ed and Mary Pat Foley call each other \\"honey-bunny?\\" This is the kind of thing that should have been caught by an editor early on, but apparently the editor was either asleep or too afraid to suggest any changes. Another highly irritating habit of Clancy's is giving his characters multiple monikers, from their names to their positions (SecDef, SecTres) to their Secret Service codenames (SWORDFISH, SANDBOX, etc.) which is gratingly annoying as it is confusing. It's hard to read things like \\"...POTUS said to FLOTUS\\" and not roll your eyes at Clancy's hilarious use of jargon in an attempt to seem \\"in the know.\\" And don't even get me started on the pointless sex scenes Clancy decides to insert. Yes, a Tom Clancy sex scene. Yes, that loud scream you just heard was you.It used to be that one thing you could count in a Clancy story was an accurate depiction of military hardware and strategies, so much so that you really did wonder if he had been debriefed by the White House. Not so here, where most of the \\"research\\" is on utterly dull subjects like trade negotiations and White House procedure. The final battle between the Americans and Chinese is most laughable, as the Americans suffer hardly any losses despite facing the largest standing army in the world. The \\"climax\\" serves to provide absolutely no tension or excitement, as the outcome was never in any doubt in the first place. Part of it has to do with one of Tom Clancy's trademarks: the use of blatantly obvious foreshadowing. A group of characters spend a great deal of time discussing how to outfit an Aegis cruiser to shoot down ballistic missiles, which is so tangental to the rest of the plot that it is a dead giveaway to how the story is going to end.In the end, The Bear and the Dragon is a bloated, racist mess. Fans of Clancy's earlier works are bound to be disappointed, and those with any knowledge of China will certainly be offended. Steer clear of this wreck."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was the first book where Tom Clancy's decline became extremely magnified. I read it again recently after a few years on the shelf, and it definitely did not age like a fine wine.There are so many things to complain about. The Bear and The Dragon is an exercise in megalomania. Clearly the publisher didn't have the guts to send this book through the shredder where it belonged. Jack Ryan is completely unlikable throughout the entire story. The \\"I'm such anti-politician, woe is me\\" attitude grows tiresome after the 500th time. I don't know why Clancy felt the need to have all the characters start cursing like they were starring in Deadwood. God forbid there is a conversation in the Oval Office that doesn't involve the F word, or 50 racial slurs being dropped.The book is just way too fat also. Reading Chester romance the Minister's secretary made me want to go take a shower afterwards. Clancy was working out some weird personal foibles during that escapade. Many of the parts focusing on the murder investigation in Russia, or the army training in Germany couldn't have been more boring. A real editor would have pointed out that about 500 of the book's 1000 pages were wildly unnecessary. The combat scenes were about as realistic as Star Wars. I'm surprised The Avengers didn't join in the fight to take out the evil Hun hordes at the end.I had hoped that this book was just an aberration for Clancy, but longtime fans will recognize the writing style of The Bear and The Dragon became the norm for Clancy post-2000. Now everything Tom (or his ghost writers)produce is overly verbose, predictable, and somewhat racist. He should have just quit with Rainbow 6."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Pick a 1 or 2 review and it covers this book. I have read several of Clancy's books and this one was terrible. Conservative PC none stop and at 1000+ pages a drudge to read. I mean why do you need to put a 10 page Baptist sermon in the book? I grew up a Baptist and they do go on too longbut these two were simply padding to Clancy's belief that it's his way or you are bad. The hero is always superman with some help from wonder women and come in White, black, and Asian types. The bad guys are murdering sexual perverts with no redeeming characteristics. A nice simply world where the hero doesn't know where food comes from. Adds may pages of anti-abortion rhetoric and the opinion that American schools need ruler welding nuns to get a good education. I wasted $4.00"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've always been a big fan of Tom Clancy's novels and having read the rest of the Jack Ryan series I bought this one a few years back. While 1,100 pages is a lot I can't say that the length made me blink, I've read some of his other novels that were nearly as long and enjoyed them very much. However, reading the Bear and the Dragon was like pulling teeth and after a couple of hundred pages I couldn't take it anymore and put it aside, thinking that perhaps with the Cold War finished, Clancy had lost it. Last winter however, I received one of Clancy's more recent books Locked On that centers on Jack Jr. and found it very enjoyable. So enjoyable in fact that I bought Dead or Alive and Teeth of the Tiger, both of which I thought were pretty good. After that I wondered if I had perhaps not given a fair shake to the Bear and the Dragon and decided to pick it up and give it another try. This time I made it about 150 pages in before admitting that it was in fact as bad, if not worse than I had remembered. In fact for a novel it commit the gravest of sins in that not only is it long (which is okay if the action drives the store) but reads with all the excitement of economics text book. I would not recommend this book to anyone and wish I could give it less than one star."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel and boy was I disappointed. I had enjoyed the ol' \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" movie and the \\"Red Storm Rising\\" computer game on the good ol' Commodore 64 but I never did get around to reading any of his books because I've always had a hunch that he was be a terrible writer. I mean, anyone so hyped up has got to be bad, right? Well, this guy just goes on and on and on explaining stuff!! I can't believe I was reading an \\"action thriller\\"...more like some Republican's predictable rant on nefarious ChiComs taking over the world, real Yellow Peril stuff passing as something timely and plausible. Then again, what should I have expected from such an uninspired title like \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\"...I'm surprised Clancy didn't simply name it \\"Good Guys and Bad Guys!\\"I mean, the first rule of writing fiction is to show, not tell, but Clancy just loves blabbing on about technical details and other background information, throwing in adolescent philosophizing in the process: all this stuff should have been imaginatively worked into the narrative instead of just being dumped on the reader!I can't believe he's so popular, that people really like reading this stuff! Never mind that Clancy's worldview is just so wrong-headed -- not just simplistic but absolutely wrong (why would Russia ever align with the US???) -- but he doesn't have any storytelling abilities whatsoever: even if you enjoy old '80s nonsense like the movie \\"Red Dawn\\" you'll be bored to tears by all the trite and never-ending expository writing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a long-time Clancy fan, but haven't read his later books. I recently retired and have been reading more, so I decided to read some of the newer books. This one was a disappointment, and I almost quit reading in the middle. I never knew much about Clancy's politics before, except he seemed to have a fondness for a strong military, and liked military, police, etc. I knew there were good and bad people in those positions, and didn't mind reading about the fictional good ones. I never really thought much further about his politics.But with his later books, it seems like he's found out about me, and now wants to make sure I understand every nuance of his politics. He's not happy to just write about it, he wants to shove it down our throats in the most simple terms he can, where everything is black and white, no gray areas to confuse us with. Oh, and not just one time for each thought, but repeatedly. Environmentalists, liberals, peace lovers, non-smokers, etc are all lumped into one common group - the enemy. I can handle his characters beliefs; after all, I came for the story, but that seems to have been relegated to the back burner. It's there, but it doesn't seem to have as much thought put into it as the political opinions.I guess he's just turned into a grumpy old man. Maybe his writing is suffering because he keeps checking to make sure no kids are playing on his grass."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been reading all of the Jack Ryan Tom Clancy novels and have just finished this one. I kept thinking that the story would \\"pick up\\" at some point like his earlier novels but it never does. The book is a repetitive drag almost in its entirety. There are a few points that popped out at me during the laborious slog through the hundreds of pages:The characters in this book are all either good or bad, there are very few grey areas. The Americans are generally all very good, simple, hardworking and exceptional people. The foreigners are generally selfish, dumb, or devious in some way. Men are men and women are women. The men are racist and all like man-things, and the women enjoy cooking and raising children. It is drilled into every few pages about how simple and blue collar the Ryan family is, and how Jack hates being President and how ridiculous the pomp and circumstance of the office is. I found this to be a juxtaposition with how powerful and wealthy America is portrayed being.The book is basically a commercial for cigarettes, and smoking is brought up during almost every exchange between characters. Chet smokes in the restaurant, Jack smokes in the Oval Office, everyone smokes at the trade negotiations. It starts to get very predictable as to when someone is going to light up. Real men (see above) smoke and don't like being told not to.There are very long stretches of text that dont seem to have anything to do with the story, that one can skip over without missing anything. If an abridged version came out without these areas included it would have made the book a bit better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The true chronological high point of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels came with pulse pounding drama of \\"Executive Orders\\". It would have been pretty hard to top that book and, despite having page count nearly as high as \\"Executive Orders\\", \\"The Bear and Dragon\\" does not come anywhere close to its quality.The Ryan series started to fade a little with \\"Rainbow Six\\" which, while introducing (or reintroducing) us to characters who were to make up an elite counter-terrorism unit, faltered in using a similar \`global biohazard threat' storyline such as \\"Executive Orders\\", but not doing it as well.\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", without the Cold War as a viable threat anymore, and unable to use another biohazard attack plot device, is at a loss of where to go with its storyline. There is a conflict between Russia and China. Alas, it just isn't very interesting. Nor are the characters brought in to forward the plot. The plot twists get more ludicrous as the story goes on and it basically leaves a long-time reader highly dissatisfied.Clancy completists will want to read this, and they should. However, they need to gear their expectations accordingly because they are not going to find the same quality of earlier tales."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"An avid Clancy fan, I pre-ordered this book, waited patiently. The result, disappointment. This book does not seem like it was even written by Clancy. The prose is different from his other books. The plot is disjointed. Maybe Clancy is too busy. I hope the next one is better. Otherwise, the next one may be the last I read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read all of Clancy's novels (Many several times over), I was sorely let down with The Bear and The Dragon. The crudeness displayed by my favorite author really knocked me out of the box. His previous efforts have always lent themselves to trying to explain the thought processes of \\"The enemy\\" (Soviets, Druggies, Eco-terrorists, the IRA, or radical Arab elements, etc.) and what America, in the guise of Jack Ryan or John Clark, should do to counter them. But other than stating outright that the Chinese just plain think different than we do, he simply denegrates the novel by resorting to name calling. \\"Joe Chink\\" and \\"Japanese Sausage\\"....please! This is the first of his novels that I would not recommend on any level. It appears to have been ghost written by a name-calling, racist and not the strategic thinking techno-novelist that I've long admired."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, so there are a lot of typos in the book (and many of my pages were printed crooked - what's with that?), the ending was not as detailed as it should have been, and that famous Clancy multi-threaded story line never quite developed as well as it has in the past. Still, it was great fun reading a book that had enough parallels to current events to occasionally cause me to confuse the two, if only for a minute. Besides, it was much easier to keep track of the Russian names than it was in Red Storm Rising (grin).While I can agree with many of the comments presented by earlier reviewers, 1's and 2's should be reserved for truly horrible books, which this is not. The Bear and the Dragon is obviously not Clancy's best effort from a detailed literary standpoint, but it still probably ranks as one of my three favorite Clancy reads because of its timeliness. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is known for his generous understanding of technology and unique ability to apply it to cool dramatic stories where Jack Ryan nearly always saves the world.Clancy is not known for his romance writing. During the romantic interludes between a Japanese/American CIA agent and a Chinese assistant to the People's Politboro, I found myself going eeeYhuuuuuu more times than not. Multiple references to Japanese sausage was nauseating and basically summed up the entire novel when reference to the sausage was the last line in the book. Clancy can do much better and should leave the romance to others. This is by far his worst novel to date. What happened?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of the Clancy novels, usually buying the latest one within a couple of weeks of its release. This one leaves a lot to be desired.I think the reason that I like Clancy's novels is the plausible plot lines, current for their times, mixed with the detailed explanation of military technology and procedures. In this one, the technology is still there, but the plots leave a lot to be desired. I'm also used to all of the plots being resolved in the last 150 pages, but I can't stress enough how disappointed I was in the ending of this one.If a novel is good, I'll usually find an excuse to keep reading it. This one was engaging enough to keep reading, but when I got to the end, I found myself wondering why I had bothered staying up late. I will keep reading Clancy novels, but if I get another stinker of an ending like this one, I will consider taking a pass on any future novels.Maybe it's getting too difficult to keep the suspension of reality now that Ryan is president, and we had to rebuild the government from scratch a couple of books ago."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you didn't know Tom Clancy's personal politics going into this book you will know them afterwards. I tend to lean to the right, but the numerous references to Clinton/Lewinsky go too much even for me, especially considering there was never a Bill Clinton in Clancy's alternate universe.This book was needlessly long. Without the constant melancholy reflections by President Jack Ryan about how his life had changed and what a prison the White House is this would have been a couple hundred pages shorter. Another hundred pages could have been trimmed from the predictable military engagement described in ultra-technical detail at the end of the book. We believe you know alot about military hardware, Tom (after all, someone gave you that nifty captain's baseball cap in your picture), now give us a break..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is by far my favorite writer, but this book lacks something. I have been trying to finish it since November. To me, the story line is too far-fetched, and we have talked about going to war for over 700 pages before we actually do it. I don't know yet how it ends, and I may never know at the rate it is going. It is a disappointment for me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you have read the last eight Clancy novels, prepare for a disappointment. In contrast to his other work, this one is full of stereotypes and predictable throughout. It does have some suspense, so you keep reading and waiting for the major plot to begin. There is none. I just felt bad afterwards - it's a waste of time. This book reads as if written by a ghostwriter, not Clancy himself."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.If you want a good read, go for Red Storm Rising. Even if you've read it before, you will still find it WAY more interesting than this onslaught of Clany's verbal diarrhea."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Everyone knows that Clancy doesn't have an editor or else the book would be half the length. That aside, The Bear and The Dragon is very predictable in the resolution of the many plots and all solved rather easily. Also, Clancy makes the war a little to easy for the winning side (I think 2 people died fighting a war with a major country). Overall, not Clancy's best work. If you have nothing better to do, then its worth a read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a huge fan of Tom Clancy since high school. Red October was the first 'non-required' novel I read. I have come to appreciate the detail he works into his plots, but this was rediculous. The first 500 pages were not only slow, but boring. I got tired of hearing how Jack Ryan hated being President, how much Nomuri enjoyed having sex, and how much money everybody could be making if they did not work for the Government. Slow, redundant, painful. Keep this one in the bathroom and work through it over the next year."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read and enjoyed all of Mr. Clancy's novels, that is, until the abomination that was &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;.

I think that these may be the only aspects of Jack's inner self that have not been covered.And by the way, does anybody over the age on ten say &quot;'puter?&quot; Having been in a &quot;High-Tech&quot; company for the last ten years, maybe I'm jaded, but I've never heard anybody say &quot;'puter&quot; -- besides my 6 year old nephew that is...Anyway, I almost swore off Tom Clancy after &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; which is arguably the worst book I've ever read. I gave him one more chance with the Bear and the Dragon. To Tom's credit, he toned down his anti-&quot;liberal&quot; rhetoric where he only demeaned himself in his sometimes naive attacks. He also improved the plot -- while similar to some of his recent books, I still found it an engaging plot. However, as every other reviewer has noted: WAY TOO LONG.I gave the Bear etc. a second star for the action sequences. Tom Clancy is still one of the best when he stays focused on action."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"About 200 pages of real &quot;book&quot; in about a thousand. Paragraphs nearly a page in length with more than one subject. Just plain bad grammar. A sorry atempt at expressing a philosophy - on everything from religion to mushy politics. And those 4 letter words! Sick and more than enough. My first and last Clancy book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used to be a big Tom Clancy fan. I devoured all his books up to The Sum Of All Fears. I read The Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising twice.Then I started to find the characters too simple, shallow, static and predictable book after book. But the plot of The Bear And The Dragon was appealing, so I decided to give Mr Clancy another chance.Well, my opinion hasn't changed. The characters ARE simple, predictable, and shallow--to the point of being boring and even annoying in the case of Jack Ryan.How many times do we have to read that he hates being president, that he is just a simple, humble, non-political man of the people, no smarter than his fellow countrymen, who just tries his best to live up to the responsibilities bestowed upon him by the American people? How many times do we have to read that he was put in the oval office by a tragic accident, and that the only reason why he sought re-election was to serve his country unselfishly? Is there anything more to Jack Ryan?Imagine a simple, strong, perfectly balanced, tough but sensitive and compassionate, all-american family man, who was a star football player in college and would like nothing more than stay at home to play with the kids and watch a game on TV, but who--like Jack Ryan--feels compelled to dedicate his life to protecting his country and freedom against barbarians. Tom Clancy's good guys all seem to come out of this mold, with only a few variations from one character to the other. These guys have no dark side, no vice, no lustful temptations. Jack Ryan's worst--and, apparently, only--weakness is that he enjoys a cigarette once in a while, when the burden of the Presidency becomes too heavy for the simple man he is (by the way, does he inhale?). The only exceptions are Chet and Ming. These are the only two characters I find truly human and attaching.On top of that, and although we're told about a thousand times that Jack Ryan is different from the Washington crowd and non-political, this is probably the most political of Tom Clancy's books. I sometimes wonder whether The Bear And The Dragon is part political essay, and whether Tom Clancy is testing the waters and preparing the ground for a political career. I've been buying Tom Clancy's books to be entertained, not to read his opinions about abortion, gun control, the political and constitutional process, or economics--whatever they may be. Tom Clancy may be a successful author, but I wouldn't trust him with economic policy just yet.To crown it all, some of Mr Clancy's &quot;good guys&quot; are clearly and vulgarly racist--towards Chinese people in this particular book. They're not expressing mere cultural differences and misunderstandings, or even circumstancial antagonism, but plain racism. The fact that the good camp includes a latino, a japanese-american, and a black guy doesn't make doesn't make the anti-chinese racism easier to swallow.In conclusion, Mr Clancy should go back to the recipe he used for Red October, Red Storm Rising, and The Cardinal Of The Kremlin--all highly entertaining, well plotted, and UNPRETENTIOUS techno-military thrillers. I'm tired of reading &quot;The World According To Tom Clancy&quot;.Jean"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I give this book two stars only because it is slightly better than the completely ridiculous Rainbow Six. Now Clancy has Jack Ryan as the military dictator of the U.S.; he is able to make alliances and join a war with nary a mention of Congress. Given Clancy's obvious love of the Rush Limbaugh view of America, this may not be surprising, but it doesn't make for a very good book. There are some good, if farfetched, descriptions of battle, although it is hard to believe the Chinese would be quite as stupid as Clancy would like us to think. As much as Clancy wants us to think of Ryan as a right-thinking hero, he seems not to realize what a fascistic character he has created, one whose own stupidity and unilateral actions lead to a nuclear threat to Washington, D.C. The hope that the Clancy of Red October will ever return seems utterly forlorn."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the worst Clancy book I have read. I have read them all. The only thing I can say is that the same person who wrote Cardinal in The Kremlin or Hunt for the Red October could not have writte this nonsense. A waste of good paper. Do not waste your money on this book. It is clearly written by the same ghost writers who do the OpCenter tripe. This is the most obvious, boring, dragged out plot of any novel I have read in a long time (and I read a lot). Save yourself the time and money and pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is TC worst book to date. His characters are not developed and as usual he repeats the same thing over and over which does not develop the story. The worst part is that he paints Ryan and the USA as all good guys with the best toys. Not to give away the ending but to only lose 1 Tomcat while defeating all of China is the most preposterous thing imagined. I also got sick and tired of reading how Ryan hated to be president.To add insult to injury (not to mention price of book), TC felt obligated to make references to Bill Clinton's presidential woes. TC also felt, as seen in his recent books, a need to get on his personal pulpit, to expound his beliefs, whether religious, abortion, or otherwise. I wish he had just developed the story with the kind of vigor he used in expousing his personal beliefs. Definitely a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I remember the first Clancy book I ever read, Red Storm Rising. Now that was a book! Action from the first chapter. I'ver read every Clancy novel since, a first day buyer for every one. I've now slogged through all 1028 pages of Bear/Dragon. Like Patriot Games, it drags in the middle, but the middle is longer. Unlike Patriot Games, its &quot;big bang&quot; beginning is really tedpid. Lots of stupid Chinese leaders, lots of smart American leaders, nifty wind up (the pay off starts on page 773.) Not as good as Rainbow Six, not as as bad as Without Remourse, certainly not as bad as &quot;Into the Storm.&quot; Tom! Give us more action and less sex! We love you babe!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like many of you out there, I am a true Clancy Fan. And, have waited for this book for a LONG while. Once again, Clancy has taken his true writing art of the action, suspense novel and given his readers a good ride. Fans, will not be dissappointed, but, to be honest, the book left me with something missing.Maybe, my level of expection was too high. Maybe I have read and re-read many of the other Clancy novels too many times. But, to me, while this book was very good, it was not his best. By far, his best works to date were Debt of Honor and Executive Orders, to the true fan, reading those more than two thousand pages back to back is a very enjoyable experience.DON'T READ ON IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE THIS BOOK.In his current novel, the best parts are 1&gt; making Robby his VP, imagine, friends become president and vice-president and him deciding to stay in D.C. when the missiles are flying.So, to the new Clancy reader, I would start with his other books first - see above"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a long time Jack Ryan fan, I must say it is truly time to end the series!! The last few books pale greatly in comparison to his previous adventures. It seems now Clancy is just filling space (all 1100 pages) rather then telling a compelling story. The plot was simplistic and predictable from the first 100 pages. The story goes one tangents which are pointless and serve to annoy the reader. The language was offensive, excessive and thoroughly unncessary. One would surely hope that within a discussion between the POTUS and his cabinent, they could refrain from the racist language prevalent throughout the book. MOST IMPORTANTLY-Clancy has deviated from his successful strategy of writing a compelling novel with interesting characters and plot twists. What is left is Jack Ryan as a caricature of the perfect American, in the perfect family. Throughout the book, Clancy has this annoying repetitive story line of how difficult it is to be such a perfect man in such a terrible job as president. For good measure, Clancy reveals his own ultra-conservative political leanings through Ryan's diatribes against abortion, ethnic tolerance and other social issues. Ryan, the heroic CIA operative, is reduced to a Pat Robertson-like president, whining and complaining about the difficulties of morality in the modern era. Please Mr. Clancy, you would do all your readers a great service if you stuck to action stories and avoid the social treatise. Lastly, Mr. Clancy reveals his simplistic view of international relations and diplomacy. Under no scenario, even the most structural realist view, would NATO ever expand to include Russia. NATO as every political novice knows, exists for only two purposes, 1) to keep Germany in check and 2) to keep Russia out. There is no way that European nation-states would ever vote Russia in. In addition, he made very little attempt to try and explain why defending Russia in the first place was in the U.S.'s national interest. Just because it is morally correct, or because there are friendly is not sufficient. To all the undecided readers, save your money and buy something else."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and The Dragon combines five novels -- one about a murder mystery in Moscow, one about espionage in Bejing, one about Chinese-American trade diplomacy, another about economic development in Siberia, and a final one about major power conflicts. Of the five, only the last bears any resemblance to a Tom Clancy novel of the calibre of The Hunt for Red October, but that final novel in the book still manages to fall short of the former standard of this author. The book is incredibly bloated, boring (until the last 256 pages), annoyingly repetitive, predictable, and full of gratuitous sexual and racist references.If you feel you must read this book, begin on page 773. You won't miss anything you need to know before then, if you do. That's the point at which the Clancy-like novel begins with the usual gee-whiz technology and action. That last novel is fair-to-middling for a Clancy effort.As to the bloat in this book, Clancy did not need to write the other four novels to write his usual one (the last one in this book). He simply padded the book to make this more like War and Peace. Well, it's not War and Peace. Clancy doesn't begin to show the skill to work in that direction. The story is simply so improbable on its face that it's hard to imagine anyone finding it interesting. He likes to develop everything around a theme of the evil Chinese leaders. He demonizes Chinese leaders in the PRC more than most people darken Hitler today. As to repetition, you will get references to the sex habits of fictional and former Chinese leaders many dozens of times more than you will care to read them. The word, puke, must appear more than 200 times in this book, as an example. As for bloat, there must be 150 uninteresting pages in this book about Ryan sneaking a cigarette when his wife isn't around and not liking being president. As for predictability, every single person and technology you read about in the book shows up in the later action in one of the two ways you would most have expected.I was very disappointed. I found it hard to imagine that I stuck it out to the end. I suspect that most people will not.If you do decide to read this book and decide you dislike it, like me, ask yourself why you did not pay attention to the hundreds of warnings from people who have read the book. That may help you to understand why you act impulsively against your own best interest.If you do read the book and like it, I suggest you consider why others may not have. That may help you understand more about your taste in books. Then, you will be better able to distinguish the books that you will like in the future that most other people do not.Resist this book!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Been a TC fan since '84 when I stumbled on HFRO. This book is definitely not up to his usual standards.Sure, I read it in 4 days and managed to get myself immersed in it. But it was about as satisfying as a warm beer on a hot day. (before you drank it, it sounded pretty good - afterwards, you had to ask yourself it was worth it.)Also, I'll just call attention the comments regarding editing snafus and excess storylines. (TC once said on Larry King that he likes to turn in a tight product to his editor. It doesn't look like it here.)Anyway, I will read his next one. Let's hope he can make up for B&amp;D."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a Libertarian, who generally votes Republican, I think that this book is virtually unreadable. It has nothing to do with politics--this is just a badly written book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I can't believe that other reviewers are rating this highly. It really falls down with respect to his other books.Weaknesses:* Other books (particularly Cardinal of the Kremlin) have elaborate spy-counterspy operations. In this one, an overtly foreign agent walks in and finds crown jewels completely unguarded. Unbelievable. Also, does China really let foreign news vans drive around unmonitored?* Russia is given a free pass on Chechnya and the Mafia, even as China's lack of respect for human rights is savaged, in order to justify the plot.* Several characters repeat the same aphorisms and quotations to the point where it's distracting. None of the quotations are attributed, an odd lapse for a detail man like Clancy.To me it looks like Clancy's suffering from the grandiosity that many writers of ongoing series fall into. I thought his switch to John Clark in Without Remorse and Rainbow Six was a cure for that, but apparently not."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A step backwards from the previuos two efforts in the Jack Ryan/John Clark saga.Much too long with a less then worthy finish. The story is somewhat compelling but the author does not mcuh excitment for the reader."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is greatly based on political issues surrounding two mayor lands: Russia, with a struggle to come up as the new democratic republic after their sudden political revolution. China, the other, seeking to return to his old glory and might.This realistic fition novel comes telling the plot in three perspectives: America's, Russia's and China's. At the end, you come to question to yourself what could the masses would be able to do when they come to know the truth of their country, and what would we be capable of.Understanding the whole plot using these three perspectives comes pretty clear, except for some side stories between the leader of these countries. Sometimes, if you're not careful enough, you may need to use paper and pencil to come through all the names and places in the story.I can highly recommend this work for its ability to make you think and remember. The plot its so compeling and interesting you would not like to leave it for a moment. If you dont have the patience or the memory to remember all the minor details, you will come up to actually grow bored. This book is only for harcore readers. I'm hardcore, and I love it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Numerous plot lines come together too easily, others go completely negelected. Racism and sexism abound. Clancy show complete ignorance of prenatal care and testing, which makes me question his mastery of other, more complex, issues. What a waste of 1,000 pages. Too bad, I really wanted to like this story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Summary:I listened to this book on CD, which might explain why I don't have all of the details and didn't find the book too convincing.Jack Ryan, now President of the U.S., finds himself in the midst of a major crisis as a failed assassination on the head of the Soviet SVR (formerly the KGB) is closely followed by the announcements of the discovery of gold and oil in Russian controlled Siberia as well as an increase in troop movements on China's northern border.Ryan's associates, along with the help of a number of well located spies and CIA agents, including John Clark, accurately predict what China is doing, step-by-step, and are constantly ahead of them. Though the Russian army stationed in Siberia is out-manned and out-gunned, with the help of emergency troops, propaganda, and spy planes sent in by the U.S., they are able to essentially cut off and then destroy the army China has sent into Siberia to claim the newly found gold and oil.At the same time, Ryan's associates are also able to foil a plot on his own life and the story ends with the leadership of China being transformed from a despotic communism to democracy. Jack Ryan wins again.My Comments:As noted above, I listened to this book on CD. Apparently the paperback book has over 1,000 pages. I think most of my criticisms might be addressed by the fact that the version I listened to was abridged. So, you may want to read the book instead of listening to the CDs after you read what I have to say.The first problem with this novel is that it tries to present an epic-sized battle with massive troop movements in a 'world-war' type scenario, but doesn't really get into the thick of it. There are a few chapters from the perspective of the leaders of the different forces on the ground, but they are so sparse that you really don't get a feel for what is going on. There is also a lot of intrigue going on in the FBI, CIA, SVR, and the leaderships of all of the countries involved (Russia, the U.S., and China), but the coverage of all of this is very shallow - you don't really get a sense that the author has a clue what he's taling about. This may be because the CD version is abridged, but there just wasn't any real development of the war and everything that would go into.Another problem was that this novel, despite supposedly being another in the Jack Ryan series, spends all of about 30 minutes actually following Jack Ryan. I didn't feel like Ryan was the focus of the story at all. Perhaps, as noted numerous times now, this is taken care of in the actual novel, but I was definitely not impressed with the treatment of Ryan. As for the rest of the characters, the only one that really sees any development is the Japanese spy who develops a relationship with a secretary of one of the leaders of the Chinese government. I actually felt like I knew him better than the rest of the characters in the novel.Overall, this may be a good novel, but definitely not in this format. I think I'd like to read the novel to really compare the two, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this version."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has written better novels than this.The plot is quite good, but the execution in places is often unimaginative. At times it was like reading 400 pages of prolog.Unlike previous Clancy works, this work is rather...graphic in places.The battle sequences are well done and very enjoyable.All in all, I wish I had waited for the paperback because this one will not remain in my library."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While this was not the best book that I have ever read, it still is a good book. If you are a fan of Tom Clancy's previous books dealing with Jack Ryan, you are sure to like this one. It is a little slow in parts, but what Tom Clancy book isn't? I would recommend, and have to my friends."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"On the whole, i thought this was a rather good book. Clancy's reference to the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal helped to bring it more into the real world. Somthing i'd like to mention though; It is starting to be a little scary how the things Clancy write seem to come true... there have been discussion about Russia joining NATO, just as in The Bear and the Dragon. I can only hope that America comes out as well in the story of Operation Enduring Freedom as the country does in Clancy's novels. God Bless the USA and Bless our boys in uniform."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'd really like to know what was going through the head Tom Clancy when he wrote this book. I really enjoyed his other books like RAINBOW SIX and THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, but this, oh man I hate to admit this but something went horribly wrong! I think he lost his touch. First of all, what the hell is a Su-31? Answer: acrobatic trainer. Now why would he include an acrobatic trainer in this book? I think what Mr. Clancy was looking for was Su-39! And the whole thing with America coming the rescue of Russia, I got one word, BORING! It would have been a lot more interesting if Russia was able to defend against a Chinese attack by herself, like she did during WWII against the Germans. Overall, this book was waayyy too long, I had to skip about a hundred pages while reading this book. That and this guy made a lot of military mistakes, I mean he gives lectures on Russian military technology to the CIA, and ends up making tons of mistakes in this book! And when he actually got to the part when Red China invaded Mother Russia, it ends up being only about 1/6 of the book!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What a bore; his worst book ever. Clancy clearly rules his pusilanimous editors (much as does Stephen King). Book is basically ill-concieved tripe that is poorly edited. Should have been perhaps 400 pages. Aegis cruiser shooting down ICBM!!?? PLEASE! The excessive expresion of his right-wing politics does little to help the narrative (or lack thereof). An insurance salesman is now telling us how we should deal with foreign policy and it is *ugly*. Please go fishing on the beautiful Bay and relearn how to write something like THFRO."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In all honesty, this book sucked. If you are a Clancy fan and have read several of his other books you can wade through this and will find parts of it interesting. As we fans know, his style of seperate story lines lends itself to skipping pages and that comes in handy here. When he finally gets down to doing the war stuff he has spent 900 pages setting up, it gets good but by that point any sane person would have long since thrown the book away. If you haven&#65533;t read Clancy before, don&#65533;t start here.This book is an ungodly 1150 pages long! To paraphrase Mark Twain, Clancy obviously wrote a long book because he did not have time (or the will) to write a short one. This reads like he just picked up a tape recorder one day and started dictating then didn&#65533;t have time to edit his work. One would assume that at 3 times the length of a typical novel it would have 3 times the meat but this story could have been told in about 200 pages and it actually would have been more interesting. Another problem is the Clancy&#65533;s books have become self referential. He has tried to create ongoing characters. The problem is that as each book gets more and more outrageous the &#65533;world&#65533; he has created is getting truly bizarre. I&#65533;ve read them all and I still can&#65533;t keep track of what&#65533;s going on. In the Clancy world, the US has suffered terrorist nuclear and biological attacks, had a president and most of congress assassinated, fought (now) 3 wars &#65533; all in the past 3 years! What&#65533;s next? I don&#65533;t think I even want to know, no matter how cool the battle scenes are.Clancy&#65533;s best skill is his ability to describe military actions and technology. Admit it, us guys read this stuff for the blood and gore and the cool military technology. Unfortunately, there are more sex scenes in this book then there are new weapon systems. Reading a Clancy sex scene is about as interesting as it would be to read Nora Roberts describing a torpedo attack. I used to dish on my wife for reading all those Nora books but I have to admit that NR would not be stupid enough to try writing a techno thriller. I wish Clancy were that smart."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Hi there Clancy! The journey from Red October to this Dragon tale has been a rivetting and rewarding one.Your research for every book is superb.But I think you've reached a plateau now with this genre of books and subjects.And this was obvious in The Bear and the D.....Ryan is a caricature of his early avatars.And you made the Chinese out to be stupid wimps(personally I would like to think they are) but they are not.They are the most inscrutable and dangerous race on earth.You've tried very hard Clancy, but sorry, it is nowhere near Red October, your most breathtaking offering.Why not look at third world nations?.Nithya Ramnath"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"i actually had to force myself to finish reading this book...i am happy that i bought it used and not new, the cost for this tripe would have really mad me ticked...alot of the time i would hit a section and found myself skipping to the next dialogue section... he got too cutsy on pet names, got carried away on how he was going to discribe various religious and ethnic peoples, he even made comments on baptist and mormons being nondrinkers...my kids got tired of hearing gripe about the writing...a waste of cash flow...if you must read it, go to the library"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ok, the book was long and the plot was slow to develop. Clancy is a master of writing military techno thrillers, and he retains the title with this work. There is a good bit of this in the book, and it tends to make the reader wonder if our military really has these capabilities. The sex parts are what led me to give this book 3 stars. All that sausage crap is just lame as hell. President Jack Ryan getting drunk in the White House is a little far fetched. So is the part about him bumming Virginia Slims off his secretary. Judging from the past Ryan novels I just wouldn't have expected this type of behavior from Ryan. This book also shows what kinds of views Clancy holds. He is very conservative, pro-religion, anti-abortion, and he hates the treehuggers with a passion. Basically I'm pretty sure Clancy did not vote for Gore. I have no problems with this but then again I could care less what his views are. It also probably would have shortened the book by about a hundred pages. The people who have a problem with the racial slurs need to wake up. Face it our political leaders are not all politically correct. People use racial slurs and the politicians are no exception. This adds a certain amount of realism to the book. Clancy might have overdone it a little bit but does it really matter? The military sure as hell isn't politically correct and it would make the book less realistic if they were. Calling people chinks, gooks, or ragheads might not right, but that's the way it really is. If you have a problem with that sort of thing then this book is not for you. Actually the book would probably offend the hell out of you. The first five-hundred pages tended to be a little boring but then the reading gets better. I thought it was a worthwhile read, but don't count on it being made into a movie. I also wonder if Clancy can take the Ryan character any farther. I seem to doubt it. Not as the main character anyway."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I devour all of Clancy's books as soon as they come out. I agree that Rainbow Six was less than his best effort, but this one ranks up there with Debt of Honor as far as I am concerned (My favorite Tom Clancy book is Sum of All fears, and nothing has come close to that). The dialogue is somewhat contrived, but I have always fond that to be the case. What I like about this book is that it brings back the white-knuckle action and the sense of reality that makes me have to put the book down to realize that we aren't actually at war. I again found myself up until 3 in the morning racing through the last third of the book. This book is also full of the usual military techo-toys that keep us one step ahead of the unsuspecting foes."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I don't believe that Clancy even wrote this dog! The language could fade wallpaper, boring, boring, boring. Page 250 and the best I can say is I've had a wonderful eduation in the purchase of undergarments for Chinese women. If Tom did indeed pen this effort, looks to me like he's fresh outta ideas. A waste of money and time. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Not bad but not up to par with earlier work. Plot is conceivable but too detailed (read: boring middle 600 pages) and I guess we forgot about congress and other minor details when declaring war on another country.At best, it passes the time - BTW - some seedly crotch novel stuff, he should get help from Danielle Steele or something."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Generally speaking this is a great spy novel. As always in Tom Clancy novels, they start a little slow but always return a real page turner by the end. However, The Bear and the Dragon was a little slower than usual for most of Clancy's other novels. It is amazing the grasp he has on current technology and the way other cultures think and operate when it comes to American ideology. In this respect, Clancy does a fabulous job of letting the reader in on how the Chinese Politburo thinks as it regards the its place in the world and how it measures up to other super powers. It is equally interesting to see how world communities act together and depend on each other as far as gold, oil, money, technology, and religion are concerned. Clancy is well apt to make the reader think about all these things without shoving them down our collective throats.It is also equally fascinating how Clancy can make the most mundane and average events you normally wouldn't blink an eye at play such a major catalyst on how quickly the world can be thrown into chaos!In addition to the overall storyline of the former Soviet Union being stalked and invades by an overzealous China, there are numerous subplots: The death of a pimp in Red Square (was he really the target?), a former TRW programmer redesigning missile guidance systems, the death of a Baptist and catholic minister in China that spun out of control, the return of Rainbow Six, and more.A few new characters were introduced that you want to see developed in future novels as well as some subtle hints of future plot lines makes the reader salivate for the next one.The only drawbacks I had towards this novel which refrained me from giving it 5 stars was that the climax was straight out of James Bond, fun for the ride, but you had to suspend reality for a bit. Not that it is a let down, for I was enthralled and excited (which a novel should do), but perhaps in a more believable way. Also I noticed that Mr. Clancy is also getting more liberal in his 'adult' language as his novels continue. AS secular language always has its time and place, it just seemed a bit more peppered this time out."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a long-time Clancy fan, but THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON has been sitting on my bedside table for weeks unfinished. I can't bring myself to pick it up again. This is a far cry from Clancy's early novels which kept me up into the wee hours. I don't find any of characters realistic. The CIA team of Foley and Foley are particularly nauseating. Clancy uses this novel as a soapbox and his preaching became truly tiresome as the novel progressed. Maybe I will use it as a doorstop..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy takes us once again into the lives of President Jack Ryan and his related cast of characters. This time a minor event in China that gets caught on American video cameras during trade talks becomes the catalyst for a showdown between China and the United States and Russia. The novel does take a while to pull all of the pieces of the puzzle together, but it should help the reader appreciate how a series of events can come together to set off a major world crisis. Also it shows us the importance of diplomatic meetings between countries and the impact they carry.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find this book to be too preachy or outrageous in its language. While there is some cursing, I appreciate the fact that the book does not have two-dimensional characters that make sure everything they say is politically correct. Clancy's books are for a mature audience that can handle controversial subject matter and accept that the President and those around him are bound to have an opinion and it might not always be the one they want to hear. Jack Ryan has conservative views and when he is talking with his inner circle the reader should expect him to express an opinion.One criticism of the book is its length. In addition to reading The Bear and the Dragon I also listened to a friend's audiobook version and the abridged version cut out enough of the book to make it more fast paced and enjoyable to a first time Clancy reader. I appreciate the deep background that Clancy provides, but more editing should be done to only include essential dialogue.His books are always better when the good guys (Jack Ryan and the gang) have to overcome serious odds. This book does not present us which such a situation and as a result the overall enjoyment of the book suffers. The book could have been more interesting if Clancy would have parted with one of his beloved characters (Golovko) to further the plot. It would have been interesting to see how Russia would have handled that particular situation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was very surprised when I saw that the reviews for this book are mediocre. My opinion is that this is one of Clancy's best efforts, and even if you don't agree with that, I don't see how folks are saying it's one of his worst. I thought the storyline set the stage perfectly. Think it took too long? Well, did you LOOK at the book when you bought it? It's a miniature cinderblock! Of course, there's character and plot development galore, along with Clancy's usual detailed descriptions of military equipment and vehicles. And for folks who've found the politics of the characters (and through them, Clancy, to a degree) offensive, get over it. I don't think anyone is trying to argue that the events of the book would or will happen, but they COULD, given what we know about the leadership in communist goverments around the world. And the tantalizing thought that it COULD happen...well isn't that what great storytelling is all about?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I, too, have read and bought all of Tom Clancy's books and enjoyed them. However, this novel was full of unnecessary vulgarity. His previous novels kept me riveted and expectant; I usually finished a book within 1 to 2 days. It seemed to me that he was trying to bring in another audience, maybe younger readers who like this type of vulgarity in their movies. It took me over a week and a half to read the book because it simply did not keep me expectant or anxious to follow all of the subplots and characters. This novel was way below the standard of Tom Clancy who I had considered the best novelist of our time. The ending left me irritated. I felt cheated out of his usual style and angry with the last few lines of text. I will, however, be awaiting another release by him and give him another chance to return to the top of my list."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"READABLE but certainly not the best.my complaints are: the book is too long for no reason.also, too much jingoism!!! i love america too but give it a rest instead of every other page.too much love it or leave it stuff. though the plot was ok. not great but ok to read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Don't bother reading this book even if you like Clancy novels--which I do. This example of longwinded, repetitive, pandering prose needs to be edited to two-thirds its current size. There isn't a redeeming character in the entire novel which is full of gratuitous profanity."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...This book has all the same problems that Executive Orders had, but to a lesser degree. There are not as many irrelevant subplots that have no conclusion. His right wing posturing is toned down. ...This book is still long winded and repititious. It is not a \\"page turner\\". I read this book over the course of several months because I didn't find it compelling. But, the \\"good\\" thing is that Clancy repeats everything so much, that you can put the book down for months and then pick it up again and be immediately reminded of what happened earlier in the book. He even repeats exact phrases and quotes many, many times.The plot of this book is the same as the last three. International tensions builds, US is caught with its pants down due to the shrinking of the military, war breaks out, but in the end the US kicks ... with its superior technology.Clancy has done this story so many times, that he doesn't even bother to finish the war. He has great details of how the Chinese march in and make great advances on the Russians. Then he has some interesting dog fights. But, in the end, he gives no details on how the Russians fight back and win the war. It is just: the Chinese walk into a trap and the Russians win.Clancy does have his own views about abortion and beats the reader over the head with them. That is the only incidence of his right wing preaching in this book, and I don't have any issues with it. It is not as bad as Executive Orders, where he made anyone with liberal ideas into a slimy, vile character.What is amazing to me is how people will point out all the problems with this book and still give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I consider myself a huge fan of Tom Clancy. I've read all of his books and have consistently been amazed by the way he interweaves multiple plot lines and his spot on analysis of the way our government works. All of this held true until I recently picked up The Bear and the Dragon, which I had been meaning to read ever since it came out several years ago.The book holds true to Clancy's style. The reader is party to several individual stories leading up to the climax, the most prominent being the story of President Jack Ryan trying to deal with the vagaries of international relations, particularly an aggressive and dangerous China. It was this aspect of the book that disappointed me the most. The military and intelligence communities, which are normally the focal points of Clancy's books, play only supporting roles in The Bear and the Dragon. As Clancy ventures out from his area of expertise -- describing the inner workings of subs and Blackhawk helicopters, he seems to venture beyond reality. Perhaps I'm foolish for ever thinking that a world in which CIA analyst Jack Ryan becomes President hadn't already left reality, but Clancy seems more informed by stereotype and superficial knowledge of diplomacy and international affairs than the rest of his information-filled prose deserves.The problem as I read this book may in fact be me -- Ten years ago I knew little about international relations, now it is the field I work in. Maybe I've outgrown Clancy's genre. That said, it seems like the Ryan franchise has gone a bit too far, taking the exciting edge away. For much of this book, you can clearly see where it is going to end.These complaints noted, I'll still pick up Red Rabbit, Clancy's new book, in the coming months, but I hope that he sticks to what he does best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Stop complaining about the language. This is a military techno-thriller, not some childrens story. Expect the language, and if you have to, read around it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy always tells a good story and this one does, too. &quot;Red October,&quot; &quot;Red Storm Rising,&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (minus the lace-curtain Irish adoration of the British royal family, which, wisely, Hollywood edited out of the movie) were great action yarns. Since then, the books have grown too large, they've been unedited (a chronic problem in the book publishing business these days, particularly w/ mega-star authors like Clancy), and too focused on Ryan as world moralist, statesman, and mouthpiece for Clancy's own politics. BUT, this new one, despite all of the afore-mentioned defects in spades (especially the almost insufferable length), is a darn good story. It's Red Storm Rising all over again, except this time it's the Red Chinese and it's us and the Russians taking them on in Siberia. It's a vastly better book than the last two or three. But, come on, can't someone -- anyone! -- edit these books? Scribners' Max Perkins knew how to edit Hemingway and Faulkner. Can't someone tell Tom when he's redundant, extraneous, silly, or just plain dumb?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If this were Clancy's first novel, he would still be selling insurance. Lots of needless repetition (did we really need to hear the dimensions of the CIA director's office twice?) At over 1000 pages, with lots of discussions on Ryan's (Clancy's?) views on abortion, politicians, the military and the diplomats, it could have used an editor with a sharp red pencil.That said, Clancy does know how to write. The last 200 pages were vintage work and a pleasure to read. Too bad I had to wade through the first 800 to get there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a great fan of Tom Clancy's \\"Jack Ryan\\" books, and when I learned that a new one was about to be published, I could not have been more thrilled. However, after reading \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" I'm afraid to say that while in some ways the book fulfilled my (high) expectations, in other ways, it was quite disappointing.First, the good: As usual, Clancy paints a compelling picture of a world that seems stable, but is, in reality, just a few steps away from political destabilization. Once again he shows us how seemingly disconnected events have the potential of snowballing into world-threatening crises. In \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" Clancy asks the following questions: What would happen if the Chinese economy were at the breaking point? What then if a tremendous oil field and gold mine were discovered in Siberia, a seeming answer to Russia's own financial difficulties? And what would be the result if China were so backed into a corner by both their economic problems and a series of international public relations disasters that their government felt it had no choice but to invade Siberia to steal the newly found assets discovered there? The answer: an unstoppable slide into World War III, with America caught in the middle, trying to support her allies while maintaining world peace. It's an interesting story, and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.However, as much as I enjoyed the story itself, I was very disturbed by the way Clancy portrays Jack Ryan in this novel. In every other Clancy book I've read, Ryan is portrayed as a fair, open-minded man who serves his country and all of its people with courage and honor. But in this novel, while Ryan still does his best to lead America through her crises, he is inexplicably portrayed as being racist, misogynist, and homophobic. I was stunned by the number of racial slurs and \\"she's just a girl\\" comments uttered by our fictional Commander in Chief, as well as the not-too-subtle anti-pro-choice and anti-homosexual passages. The Ryan of old was a hero that could be admired by all, no matter one's political affiliation, lifestyle or beliefs... but this one is rather intolerant. I used to take pleasure in picturing Jack Ryan sitting in the real Oval Office... but I'm not so sure anymore. I don't know why Tom Clancy has so drastically changed the characterization of his most popular hero, but if this is the direction he plans on taking this franchise, I may not be a fan for much longer.The only other major criticism I have with \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is with how the novel ends - literally five pages after the story's breathtaking climax. Why is there no denouement? Clancy carefully builds his story for 900 pages, gives us a full 100 pages of prime excitement followed by a 10-page climax that will get your heart rate up as you read it, but then.... nothing! The book just ends, without much of a wrap-up. Reading the last page of the novel, I wondered to myself if perhaps my copy was missing a chapter or two. I'd only wished Clancy would have wrapped up the few loose ends in his story and had given us a chance to visit with Ryan's staff and family one last time.I do recommend \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" and I certainly am looking forward to another installment in the \\"Jack Ryan\\" series, but next time, I hope Clancy's characterization of Ryan returns him to more nonjudgmental ground. In his past few novels, Clancy has developed Ryan into a character loved by many people around the country. I'd truly hate to see this character veer off track and become intolerant, bigoted... and not particularly worth reading about."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The &quot;Ryan&quot; series is starting to suffer from too much &quot;historical&quot; baggage, and it shows in this book.Almost every character from the past Ryan books (except maybe Marko Ramius, unless I missed him) figures in this story, and the history of the Ryan timeline has diverged too far from reality for the story to be plausible.Pass on this one, or at least wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Okay, I agree with some of the other reviewers that there are alot of mistakes and typos and repetition. This is uncharacteristic of Clancy, I agree. Maybe his spell-checker was broken or maybe ... just maybe ... it was done on purpose ... think about that. What is surprising to me is that those people who didn't like this book either cited RED STORM as their favorite or suggested that there be a larger battle than the one portrayed. I would have to say that yes, the detail he usually displays in his battle sequences is what keeps me reading till 10 o'clock at night, my bedtime, but that we don't live in that world anymore. This world has smaller battles, like the line at McDonald's. So, basically, forget the cold-war style battles, he won't ever write those into one of his stories ever again. As for the 700-page &quot;build-up&quot; that people keep referring to, check out CNN's August 29, 2000 story about the religious leader arrested in the Chinese province of Fujian for holding mass in a PRIVATE HOME!! If you have ever wanted to relate a work of fiction to current events, I have never seen a better example! What I'm trying to say, in a round-about sort of way I grant you, is that despite opinions to the contrary, Clancy does write for the times we live in, it's just that you need to take the time and put forth the effort to find the correlation. All in all, I did like this book and I will recommend it to others!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although the book takes a while to get going, it is an entertaining read. The last 300 pages will keep you reading well into the night. Of all the technothriller novelists out there, Clancy is still the best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While the plot is good and we have quite a bit of Jack and his handling of the world, I was let down that there wasn't more of his home life which made EXECUTIVE ORDERS such a wonderful book. While I realize that Mr. Clancy's audience is mostly male, there are female readers who enjoy his stories and there would be more if he would include other things besides graphic descriptions of weapons and battles, which I admit I usually skim over. I also sprained my wrist trying to hold this book while I read it--it was extremely heavy. Maybe it could have been a tad shorter??"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Inside these 752 pages is an excellent 300 page story. I agree the book is compelling and is hard to put down but the rants, lectures, historical anecdotes and op-ed essays are more a fairly emphatic presentation of Clancy's view of what's important and how things ought to be (and why) than they are a foundation for understanding the justification for action and plot details.I liked it, but I liked his first five much, much better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Apparently I am the minority in the customer reviews, but I agree with the editorial review, finding this book highly entertaining and fairly plausible. The scenario that Tom Clancy presents is not an entirely unrealistic one, and the technology he gives the US Armed Forces is not in the distant future by any means. If anything is unrealistic about Clancy's scenarios it is their overwhelming optimism, but that, too, is enjoying to read. Clancy takes this latest Jack Ryan adventure one step above and beyond anything he has ever done before, and any longtime Clancy fan is likely to highly enjoy this novel, as I did."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read this book when it first came out, years ago. I had been a big fan of Clancy's work until I read Executive Orders, which was not nearly as good as his earlier work. However, the Bear and the Dragon was even worse, for several reasons...1) The plot was even more preposterous than Executive Orders.2) It was far too long & 80% of it was uninteresting.3) To pass the time, I started counting how many times Jack Ryan called the Chinese, umm, crab suckers.4) By the time the plot finally started cooking (around the 1000 page mark), the suspense was derailed by the random use of a weird obscenity.Anyway, it was clear that the Ryanverse had \\"jumped the shark\\" with this book and I have not read Clancy's books since."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"it's been a while since i've read it but i remember it was a slow start but once it gets into the meat of the book it's a definate page turner. mystery suspense and animosity toward China. what more could you ask for. once i got into it i couldnt put the book down. great read like i said it's a slow start but give it a chance"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It seems that Mr. Clancy must produce books that are over 1000 pages (or 5 pounds) or he donates the script to the &quot;Network&quot; series. It is too bad, but I have to wade through way too many pages to figure out the story line. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a twisting story line, but the whole book is resolved in less than 100 pages or so which leaves me wondering why I read the other 900 pages. I will still read Mr Clancy's book, but now I beleive I will wait for the paperbacks and save about 4.5 pounds."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy fell short on this one! I saw him during a recent TV interview and said he hated to write. Well, looks like he put minimal effort into this one. Bear &amp; Dragon was slighlty entertaining and just as boring! Could it be that Clancy is over the hill? I hope he regains his desire and talent because i normally look forward to his paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Good News: As always, Clancy's endings are more than worth the journey. Clancy's military details - whether accurate or not - allow a good suspension of disbelief for the layman. And all the characters we've known and loved for more than a decade are back as good as ever.The Bad News: The journey takes over 1,000 pages when it should have taken, perhaps, 700. Even with all that space, though, some of Clancy's characters have taken on even less than a cardboard aspect to them. I still can't remember the name of Jack's youngest child, for instance, and we go through 30% of the book before Cathy, Jack's wife, even makes an appearance. Clancy's bright star in the publishing world has also allowed him to slip even more of his far-right rhetoric into his stories (although anyone who likes Apple computers as much as he does can't be all bad).Be that as it may, while &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is not my favorite of Clancy's books it is still worth the time. I read it in preparation for &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; next month. Clancy has written himself into a corner with respect to Jack Ryan, and he's finally figured that out. While it is nice seeing our hero rise to the heights of the Presidency, Jack is no longer the &quot;thinking man's action hero&quot; that made him so popular in &quot;Red October&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games.&quot; Jack's biggest action scene dealt with riding out an attack while onboard a destroyer while it was docked in port.At the end of the day &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; very much continues the plotline and the style Clancy gave us in his later books. While good and solid, you still long for the days when it didn't take Clancy 700 pages to do a back story and when our favorite hero wasn't trapped behind a desk directing things from the back.I look forward to the series going &quot;back to the future&quot; with &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; next month."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"First off, Clancy is not losing his touch- he just needs an editor. This book continues the psuedo-alliance between Iran, India, Japan and China, only China is let standing. The plot develops at a snail's pace, but an interesting sidestory about a spy introduced in Debt of Honor will keep you enthralled. It's wonderful to see Clancy return to his roots in that respect. Still, the end is semi-predictable, but enjoyable. Side note: Much of the military technology and weaponry mentioned in this book are being used today in the war on terror."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was a average novel but was far too long. It could have easily been 400 or 500 pages shorter. I did enjoy parts of it but there was a great deal of repetition on military technical mumbo jumbo. The politics were good but very dumbed down and unrealistic. The novel's last few hundred pages were very good but in the middle I lost interest. What kept me reading was the thought... \\"How many 1100 page books by international best-selling authors are bad? This can't be one of them.\\"I can't believe he stretched the story so long. Before I started reading it I envisioned a saga comparable to the world wars. That was not the result. Use the average reader review of this novel compared to some of Clancy's other and I am sure you will see my point.I did find the Political and economic situation between the major powers completely unrealistic. For the most powerful nations of the world to go to war over a few billion dollars worth of oil and mineral resources was ridiculous. China has large untapped natural gas fields and Russia and its former states have huge mineral wealth and oil fields so I thought the plot was far fetched (even with hundreds of pages to try and build up the plot.)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"A slow and long winded book with a &quot;right-wing&quot; political agenda and a sequence of highly improbable events. I think I have just read my last Tom Clancy novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After having about half a dozen of his intricately woven global conspiracies unraveled by Jack Ryan in the last few years, you'd think this villain would have his sense of infallibility diminish at all. Nope. Instead he becomes even bolder, despite the fact that every one of the conspiracies he was involved in had exploded in his partners' faces. It just didn't occur to him that somehow once his other conspirators were brought down, he was the only one left. Just because he came off unscathed, he thought he was immune from detection. Because he was blinded by his sense of infallibility, he thought he was undetected all the way to the very second of the end."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"That's about how long it takes this book to get going. I found it very hard to retain any sort of interest in the book during this, frankly rather dull, period. In my opinion, Clancy would have done better to have chopped out this entire section of the book and summarised it into nearer four or five. Also, as another reviewer noted, swearing is slightly more prevalent in this book, although that dies down after about 200 pages. Perhaps the author had been reading Andy McNab books? On a similar topic, despite getting a quick mention, the British army seem to get left behind in the fighting somewhat - as indeed do the Russians - and it unfortunately becomes a tale of America saving the day. Perhaps Clancy is taking after directors of American-made war movies? Anyhow, although the American home audience would have enjoyed it, it would have been nice for foreigners to have got a look in. And - I would have thought that Tony Blair is on TV in America sometimes - so Clancy need not have made him talk like Neville Chamberlin. All that said, once the war is going in the last 300-400 pages, it does become a gripping read and evidence of what the author can accomplish when he puts his mind to it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I loved the early Jack Ryan novels. Fast paced, unpredictable, lots of technical war &quot;stuff&quot; so I had high hopes for this one. I thought that even its thickness was a benefit: foreshadowing even more of what I like about Clancy's novels, or so I thought.Having just finished wading through it, though, I can only conclude that Clancy mis-used his (well-earned) clout to resist his editor's cuts. Surely this book could have been 300 pages shorter with no noticeable loss? Instead it would have been more compelling and faster paced. The repetition alone was tiresome (how many times do we need to read that Mao liked 12yo virgins, please!), without the Ryan platitudes. They were there in previous books, and they helped round out his character, but this time round... yawn.There's some great twists and turns and its a good yarn overall. But don't rush to buy the hardcover, and don't be afraid to skim."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy used to write really good books but his last few have been on a downhill trend. I gave up on this at page 196!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Clancey's books starting with The Hunt for Red October. Unfortunately, this is not one of his better works. It is slow to develop, makes too many references to previous books, and asks the reader to believe a quite preposterous notion of the our Chinese friends. If I had to rank the Clancy books: 1) Hunt for Red October, 2) Patriot Games, 3) all of the rest, Last) Bear and the Dragon."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Long time TC fan here. I have to say his work has been slipping for some time. His latest book is not only boring, it is long and boring. TC needs let Jack Ryan and all of his friends die off and start a new setting w/ new characters... or go back to his old day job. Where will Jack be next if TC is allowed to continue, president of the world?Getting back to the story, it lacks the depth and intrigue of his earlier works like Red October, etc. The plot and characters are extremely transparent. I think at this point TC is putting out a poor story and living off his repuation from past works.I would not recommend this book to former or new TC readers. If you do want to read this book, save yourself some $$ and wait for people like me to dump our hardcover books off at the second hand book stores!-Lee (a former big time TC fan)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy is now like reading Clive Cussler, although Mr. Cussler doesn't try to pass himself off as writing anything other than adventure fantasy.Clancy has gone downhill since &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;--a truly wonderful and exciting read. Now, he writes these epic novels comprised of superficial plots, silly dialogue, 2 dimensional characters, a peppering of Clancy's own conservative political views, and way way way too many words.I have one word for Mr. Clancy: EDITOR. I read the first 10 percent of the book. Then I started to read the end of chapters and chapter sections. No one should be surprised that I missed nothing in the plot. Although I may have missed out on a few Tom Clancy political lectures as told by his alter ego President Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have the upmost respect for Mr. Clancy's literary genius. I probably would not be a pawn shop owner if it were not for &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;. However, I have been compelled (out of respect for Mr. Jerry Furland, the author of the novel &quot;Transfer&quot;) to offer my first ever negative critique of a Clancy novel. Mr. Clancy displayed a complete lack of scruples in stealing the story line from Transfer. It appears that Mr. Clancy's well has dried up and that he has lost his creative edge. Sad as this may be, I cannot condone, and will not stomach, the rape of Mr. Furland's novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As you've probably read below (or will read in a moment), this one is a huge disappointment. All the elements are here for another great Clancy book, but it appears that he wouldn't listen to his editor. Tons of repetition and wheel-spinning. I should have just listened to an abridged version. Recommend that you do that instead."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon is not worth reading. I found this out when I was about half way through the book but wanted to trudge on till the very end. Sure it has some good points, but is not nearly as good as all the others that I have read. I was disappointed, and agree with all the other negative reviews put forth here. I don't even know why I finished it, but I did, all 1028 pages worth."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Spell-checking his German would have helped. Getting some of the details right would have been helpful as well. The book is VERY good yarn (thus the three stars), but it's also annoying in it's nationalism (let's call it chauvinism) and stereotypes that border on rascism. Warning: Members of the political left and citizens of non-NATO states might feel offended."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read all of Clancy's fictional books I must say that while each becomes larger they are not becoming better. More pages but no more story. It seems as if Clancy has attempted to incorporate ever character from each of his prior books, even when they are not needed. Was The Rainbow Six Team needed here or was that a veiled attempt to sell more of the Rainbox Six book and games?Too many sub-plots that wither on the vine. Better development of fewer sub-plots would have improved this novel. I agree with another reviewer, The Bear and the Dragon lacked an effective editor, clearly the spell checker in Clancy's computer is defective.Unfortunately, Clancy has risen to the level where most will buy his books without reading the reviews -- something I will not do in the future."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Something happens to writers when their name becomes bigger than the title of the book (Stephen King is another.) Editors are afraid to edit them. This is a shame, because a good editor probably could have saved this disappointing book.I can forgive Tom Clancy a lot - \\"Patriot Game,\\" \\"Red October,\\" \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin,\\" those were terrific books. But as he became more famous and his name moved above the title on the cover, he began taking longer and longer to set the table and his personal politics became more and more the focus of the story. Once he finally gets going, he always delivers the goods, but it has taken longer and longer to get there with each succeeding novel.\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is just too much. He repeats himself endlessly. How many times do we have to be told the CIA director's office is unusually long and narrow? How many times does Jack Ryan have to grouse about hating his job, or wryly comment that he wouldn't look at other women because his wife is a surgeon and knows how to use sharp instruments? Is it realistic to think that EVERYONE who hears of an event would immediately proclaim that it's a \\"casus belli?\\" Sloppy writing? Bad editing? Both? It's hard to say when looking over this train wreck of a novel.That being said, I have to add that the worst Tom Clancy is still far better than the best Clive Cussler. There's some good action in here, and maybe even some valid points. But it's all so buried in political whining, repetition and outright mean-spiritedness that it's just not worth digging for.By the way, Clancy proves once again that he cannot write sex scenes. Just can't do it. It's embarrassing.All in all, a very disappointing book. And it needn't have been. All he needed was a good editor. But I repeat myself."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"China invades Russia. Russia joins NATO. NATO kicks China's [butt]. Clancy loves a strong military. Clancy hates career politicians. Clancy hates abortion. Clancy takes your money without delivering the quality of his first few books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I received this tome for Christmas, and read it over two very rainy days. Clancy hasn't lost his ability to design a compelling plot, however the book leaves much to be desired.Like many authors who write formulaic bestsellers, over time Clancy has gotten caught up in his own grandiosity and therefore won't let the publisher edit his books. This one REALLY needed a strong editor. At 1100 pages, it was too long, with too many subplots, too many long soliloquies of Clancy's John Birchish political philosophy, and too many repetitious banal catch phrases uttered by characters.Clancy has been headed down this road for some time--really since putting Jack Ryan in the White House--and I had vowed to stop buying his egotrips, and getting this one as a gift has only reinforced this stance.This piece is hugely disappointing for one who's read Clancy since The Hunt for Red October. Clancy either needs to get back to his roots, or give it up."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After Rainbow Six, I told myself I would never read another Tom Clancy novel...but I gave him one more chance. I think I wasted my money. The Bear and the Dragon is dreadful slow to develop, wooden characters with wooden thoughts and wooden dialogue, too many sub-plots, anachronistic (has Mr Clancy been to China recently --- his China is not today's China at all). What's happened to Jack Ryan? Where's our decisive man of action gone? The book is far too long for the story. It needs a good editor with a sharp pen."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy again disappoints his readers. Please - where is the editor? Cut out 40 % and the stuff might eventually become readable. The plot is highly predictable and very thin, the characters are at best two dimensional, with some racism added. Due to its length, this book ought to be a good cure against insomnia. There is too little action, the techno stuff is also quite weak. His politcial asides are hard to stomach. TC's views on social security: Who cares? Probably the age of the techno thriller is over. Anyway: If You want to read thrilling stuff, buy McNab, Bravo 2 0 or Immediate Action."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Dear Mr. Clancy,I have been a consisent reader of your books since you started and have without exception enjoyed your stories. Several years ago I picked up a Tom Clancy compendium that included some of your essays. Reading them, I realized what strong political ideas you believe and admired the fact that you were able to keep your novels apolitical, not favoring a party or major political issue. But your current novels reads like the politics I read in your compendium put into book form. Many of us do not agree with your politics but love your stories. By trying to integrate your politics with your stories, you are cornering some of your fans. With the publication of this book during the campaign season and the many references to Clinton and White House interns (which, by the way, seriously compromises the consistency of the &quot;Jack Ryan Universe&quot;) you cross the line into Republican propoganda. The over-riding pro-life message alienates a large portion of your readers. I thank you for the novels you have written but The Bear and the Dragon will be my last Tom Clancy book.Sincerely, Joel Bittle"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read every Book put out by Clancy since The Hunt for Red October. For the most part they were good books. Ant this one? Let's just say I have had this book for over 1 1/2 years and I have made it to page 495 (with some effort). There are soo many problems, where to begin? It's probably best to just list the problems I had with the novel.1. The language. Yes, many people swear to varying degrees. But the degree of swearing in this book, particularly by people in high government office was just too much. And the numerous use of the word \\"sausage\\" in referring to the penis was annoying.2. Tom Clancy's stance on abortion (among other things) is his business. It's quite clear he is to the right of Genghis Khan. It isn't necessary for him to use this book as a platform for sharing (actually ramming down our throats) his opinions on various issues (yeah fatherhood is a WONDERFUL thing. We get it!!!). It detracts from what was a bad novel to begin with.3. The racial slurs are quite disturbing. Also unnecessary.4. What REALLY annoyed me was the DDO (Mrs. Foley) using the moniker \\"honey-bunny\\" in reference to her husband. That got on my last nerve.5. I am really getting annoyed with Ryan complaining about being president. If he hates it that much, resign. He just whines too much. In short, Clancy just need to play down Ryan's discomfort with the job. He has turned Ryan into a whining child.6. America as the unbeatable superpower who is always morally right is also tired, stale and inaccurate. In this novel, the bigger problem is the portrayal of the Chinese. Although I have never been to China, I know enough to know Clancy's portrayal of that country and its people is highly flawed (yes Mao was a monster, that is true). One assumes that authors do extensive research before beginning their works. Clearly Clancy did not do so prior to writing this novel.7. It was kinda sad seeing Clancy resort to sex, more explicit than I have ever seen in one of his novels. He didn't need sex to sell his novels before. His strengths were tight plots and details, excruciating details (which were always a joy to read).8. A lot of reviewers have complained about the length of the novel. Well, I only got up to page 495, so I cannot address that directly, but I am sure there is truth to that criticism. Those 495 pages were the LONGEST 495 pages I have ever had to read. I have the impression from other critiques that the last 100 pages are a fast read, thought the battle(s) which takes places near the end of the book involving the USA are not portrayed with a glimmer of realism. I'll probably get to that part of the novel in 2005.Again, I did not finish the novel, and can only give thanks that I did not actually buy the book. If this is what I can expect from Clancy in the future, I will not bother wasting my time reading his books.I will close by saying that I wish I could have given it 0 stars.Oh, and the novel has been poorly edited."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon should have been the perfect combination. I am a huge Tom Clancy fan and I have a huge interest in Chinese politics and history. I am a Global History teacher who has made two trips to China and has participated in many conferences and workshops on the PRC.Perhaps if I did not know anything about contemporary China, I would have really enjoyed this book. It is a fun book to read, it is a fast read, and has a good story. However, this book and Clancy's descriptions of China show a clear lack of any understanding of China outside of watching O'Reilly factor and listening to some of the phone callers to right wing talk radio.Clancy has surprizingly incorporated every stereotype of modern day China. I was just very surprized at this. Clancy is an intelligent writer, who deals with very intelligent plots. But his views on China seem based on political sound bites and not on anything close to the way China really is.I remember during the spy plane crisis a caller was on Fox news saying how they were doing their part to support our servicemen by boycotting not just Chinese made goods, but also Chinese food! Fortunately the Fox news anchor pointed out that the people running a Chinese restaurant had escaped communism and were not part of the PRC. However, this is the type of stuff Clancy based much of his plot on. He characters even make similiar references to this.I am a conservative who is strongly anti-communist. But, having the little bit of knowledge that I do have of China ruined this book for me and has affected the way I view Clancy. I really like Tom Clancy books, I know a lot of people read his books, I know Clancy is an intelligent guy. However, this book really does a disservice. I know it is fiction, but still Clancy has a big readership and he should have done a better job on China.For Asian Fiction read James Clavell, not Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is my 6th Clancy book. I'm now at page 500 or so and just don't think I can finish it. It's like reading all his other books wrapped up into one. Nothing wrong with Clancy's ability to keep putting out quality material, but I think I've simply had enough. His writing style has become too predictable for me, and even though I don't know how the book will end literally, I do figuratively I think and, okay, maybe a bit literally too. After 500 pages I am so sick of the jumping around to different sub-plots. And trying to keep up with all the Russian and Chinese names and who's who, etc. Sheesh. In most of his other books I've read, by around page 300 it would start to really get interesting, but I don't find it here and I'm just past page 500. I think I would rather have teeth pulled than have to read one more paragraph of dialogue between Chavez and Clark. Those two are so feely-good with each other now that they're in-laws. If I read one more sentence where one of the characters in Russia is having yet another drink of Vodka (Clancy reminds you every other page that Russians like their Vodka and so do Americans who live over there) I will leave this planet. Okay, got that off my chest. I paid for the book, can't finish it....will donate to my local library. Just had to vent. But, if you're one that's never read Clancy before, then by all means dig in...I've simply read one too many."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Man did Clancy wreck the Chinese leaders. They are all stupid except Qian. It's totally unbelieveable. Clancy basicially makes everything work for the US and nothing for China. The missile intercept thing in the end is soooo fake and undramatic. Man if you make the enemy that dumb and give your side all the fancy toys that is 1000x better than the enemy, what do you expect? The whole book is predictable and it is way too long. Man, not one main/minor character on the good side died. Oh and Clancy did not do enough research on Chinese people. The ending with the thousands of students marching into the office is totally unrealstic. What was he smoking? There are so many soldiers in that area that there is no way those students would go there. The whole esponiage thing is also pretty sad. The US gets all the spies and all the information but the Chinese don't get any.... huh huh, at least in Debt of Honor and Executive Orders there was some spy and some people actually died..... Clancy also made the Chinese pretty generic, there were no real defining characteristics, he did little research. I mean, he just picked them and said ok, you're the bad guys. Oh this ties with how he made them all so stupid. I mean, even a high school student like me know about equilbrium price and international trade and stuff. Clancy made them all sound like 10 year olds with no knowledge... please! Oh and Clancy, please try not to make up stuff about computers. Anyone who knows anything about computers laughs at your silly attempts at making it sound really secure and bulletproof. Your grasp of quantum physics is.... 1 star at best. Oh and I'm sure the CIA doesn't use a 56K modem anymore, i think they have T3 at least or probably OC. Get on with the times man..... do better research because you can't expect your readers to just believe what you say!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As an avid Clancy fan, who's read all of his books and owns most of them in hard cover, I found this book to be a bit of a dissapointment that doesn't even approach Clancy's normal high standards. Its a definite &quot;must read&quot; for Clancy fans, but for everyone else I'd highly recommend skipping this one at least until reading most of Clancy's other books.The plot of the book, as the title implies, focuses on Russia and China, but mostly the latter. In a nutshell, a diplomatic incident plus some trade negotiations with the U.S. gone badly awry lead China to seek to take advantage of some new found economic luck by their neighbors to the north. There are a lot of parallels between US / Japanese relations leading up to WW2. along the way, there are assasination attempts and spycraft, but at a high level that sums up Clancy's latest effort.First, the book's bad points:1. Obviously Clancy now considers himself above editors - cause its obvious this book was not edited at all. There are at least 7 or 8 occasions where characters thoughts are repeated, verbatim, 2 or 3 times over the course of the book (for example, Ryan's belief that 'Daughters are god's punishment to fathers for being men' ... Ryan 'thinks' this about 4 different times during the book) and there are a fair amount of spelling/typo type errors that detract from the enjoyment of the book.2. The structure of this novel simply isn't as good as Clancy's best efforts - the plot is very straightforward and not at all unpredictable - but more importantly it really is not very intricate - One of Clancy's fortes is to start with seemingly disparate story lines and seemlessly relate them together in the scope of the larger story (the Sum of All Fears is an excellent example of this)- in this novel, however, none of that occurs - the reader can pretty much see, immediately, the signifigance of just about everything that occurs. In the end, Clancy spends (depending on your point of view) 600 to 800 pages of this 1000 page book building toward the climax - which leaves the climax too short and the buildup is just not executed in Clancy's usually superb fashion.3. The book almost seems unfinished - there are a lot of plot points that are left dangling when it really seemed like Clancy had intended to finish them.4. Clancy has been developing a penchant recently for repeating the same ideas conveyed in his previous novels. In Rainbow Six, he basically repeated the whole bio-warfare aspect of Executive Orders. In the Bear and the Dragon, at the end of the book he pretty much repeats what was a very large aspect of Debt of Honor.On the plus side, this is Clancy after all, and it is still a good read. The novel's premise is a good one, and in that sense its a good follow on to some of the plot threads Clancy started four books ago in Debt of Honor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have long been an admirer of TC as a plotter and writer, despite his occasional lapses. [But never an admirer of his &quot;as told to, but written but someone else&quot; Op-Center products.]With Bear-Dragon, TC has fully descended into Clavell's Disease - that syndrome which causes formerly creative and exciting writers to ACT like they're being paid by the word, which one should not do, even if one IS paid that way. Too many words (a fair-to-good 500-pager fluffed to 1 kilopage), too many subplots, too many characters, too many moral lessons.And the editing! Are TC's editors now afraid to point out to him that he's used the same phrase, metaphor, simile, or analogy several times before - a few hundred pages ago? It's distracting and it's unprofessional. Sure people will buy the book anyhow, because of TC's name, but those loyal readers are owed a better book - I suggest we are owed a better book with each outing. Bear-Dragon isn't it, Tom."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've always enjoyed Clancy novels, but the whole Jack Ryan-as-President thing is getting old. And how many times is Mr. Clark going to save the world? How many times do I need to hear that Jack Ryan hates being President (it was great the first hundred times, but I really don't need to be reminded every other page - I get the picture now move on!)There are also several anti-Clinton side-references in the book, making subtle condemnations of some of the more outrageous Clinton escipades. But in Clancy's world there never was a President Bill Clinton, so his obvious references really corrupt the plot. You know what the author is trying to say, but a fiction-novel is not the format for a manufactured political diatribe.Usually I'm amazed by the subtle way Clancy brings all the sub-plots together, but in this book everything feels contrived. It's painfully easy to figure out what's going to happen next, and one of the better sub-plots in the book just fizzles out in the end. The chilling tension that is the hallmark of a Clancy novel just isn't there.The characters felt contrived as well; cookie-cutter. Sometimes I felt like Clancy was preaching (at one point quite literally)through the mouths of his characters.Overall, The Bear and the Dragon was a great disappointment. Any serious Clancy reader knows about the &quot;Clancy Experience&quot; - the nail-biting tension, the total immersion in his world, that keeps you reading until beyond 3am. I've read through the night many times with a Clancy novel in hand.Sadly, The Bear and the Dragon didn't capture me at all. I found myself wanting to skip to the end just to be done with it, but I plodded through because I owe Clancy that. I hope the next one will be better because Tom Clancy is a great writer, and it pains me deeply not to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Now that Jack Ryan has been President for a while, it's hard for Clancy to produce really great stories where we admire Ryan for playing the valiant underdog. Nevertheless, Ryan's role in Clancy's latest book is thankfully more prominent than in Rainbow Six and the result is a great story. I found the plot more believable and engaging than eco-terrorists. In any event, Clancy is still better than anybody else out there."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've read a lot of Tom Clancy in my life but this is an absolute low.You would think with all the millions he's made he could at least afford an $1000 plane ticket to China. Even if he had just gone for one weekend he would have seen that his portrayal of China is complete rubbish. Not only is it inaccurate it's downright terrible. The only Mao suits you will find in China these days are on Mao's corpse and in fancy dress stores.Laughable was the seduction of the Chinese secretary, Having western food for the first time after all that \\"Chinese garbage\\". It makes me wonder how Clancy feels about this 5th column of slant-eyes (with U.S. nationality!) living in his own country peddling their 'garbage' to god-fearing honest wasps.I'm from Holland and I cant wait to see how Tom Clancy would portray my country in his next novel. Probably we would be called cheeseheads or something suitably insulting every two sentences. We would obviously all live in windmills and walk around in clogs. In fact we wouldn't even be able to walk because we would be continuosly sticking our fingers in holes in dikes to stop our country flooding. We would invade some country that has been our ally for more than half a century (eg. UK) for some ridiculous reason (Dutch businessmen want to monopolize world cheese production). Finally our totally incompetent airforce/navy (whatever) would be destroyed by a single US plane: Final result: Cheeseheads, 100000 casualties. USA, 0 casualties. US (incompetent)allies, 200 casualties (to keep it realistic). Of course this would happen in a book of not less than 3000 pages and include JR telling us that he really really really dosn't like being POTUS every 2 or 3 pages.Keep it up Clancy!! You're sliding, but rock bottom is still two or three books away."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Confrontation between a weakened, fragmented Russia and a newly aggressive and acquisitive China, with the United States forced to take a hand in the conflict, forms the basis for Clancy's latest work. As always, Clancy makes it easy for the reader to suspend disbelief; anyone familiar with today's headlines can readily imagine that the events depicted in The Bear and the Dragon could actually happen (more or less).The book benefits from some traditional Clancy strengths: strong writing, a familiar cast of engaging characters and an superb ability to explain the technology, tactics and art of war in a lucid and compelling way that forces the reader to keep turning the pages.Unfortunately, it also suffers from some recurrent problems (to my mind, at least) that have become familiar to Clancy readers, and make this a good book, rather than a great one: gushy, uncritical adoration of the military and intelligence establishments, the tendency to portray the &quot;good guys&quot;, all of whom are to the right of Albert Speer, as flawlessly noble, strong and wise, while depicting their antagonists as two-dimensional, fairly uninteresting characters who combine comic-book evil with enough doltishness to make their defeat inevitable.The biggest drawback to this book, though, is the same one we've seen in all of Clancy's recent work: his apparent inability to shut up. The Bear and the Dragon is at least 30 percent too long. Clancy's success as a writer gives him the ability to veto editorial suggestions that he blue-pencil a few hundred (or few thousand) words here and there, and Clancy fans quickly develop skill at the art of skimming.I've read all of Clancy's work, and, problems notwithstanding, I'll continue to read him. His strengths as a writer overshadow his weaknesses, and I still hold out hope that he'll return to the standards he set in Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Five minutes ago, I told my wife and sons that this book was a HUGE disappointment. Being a big fan of Clancy, I could not wait for this book to come out. Usually it takes me at most, 3 days to read one of his books, but I am STILL working my way through this one after 6 days. So when my wife asked me why, I told her that this was a 400 page book stretched out forEVER. The first thing it reminded me of was when Ludlum started taking himself too seriously and writing huge boring books.So I told my wife that I was going to go online and check out the Amazon review's to see if my comments were indicative of others who read the book. And sure enough, the second review I read by I think the name was Lane Shelton, could have been written by me as the comments were ALL the same as mine.How many times do we have to hear this character ruminate that he didn't want the job, and doesn't know how to do it, but for the sake of the country he will do it. SHUT UP already, we got the point in the last few books but banging us over the head again and again and again is just ridiculous. And Clancy seems to be spending the entire book pontificating his moral authority and political beliefs thru this white knight who can do no wrong. I could not believe how repetitive he was in this book and I am only at page 500. It seems that he says the same sentance at least 3 different times, and he seems to be doing that on more than one sentance. In addition, Clancy repeats his political views, for example on abortion, over and over as if he hadn't told us yet. Tom, how many times do we have to hear about the 'previous' presidents preoccupation with sex.And is it just me, or did he just start adding slurs and salty language in huge doses to somehow make his characters more colorful and down to earth.?Ouch, stop me before I make this a 1 rating instead of my generous 2. Like the other reviewer I sort of want to cut to the end already as my arms are getting tired from holding up this overweight, over wordy and over done book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Some oft-heard quotes on Tom Clancy: 1.Tom Clancy is right wing-Big Deal!The man's entitled to his opinions! 2.Tom Clancy is anti-asian(from Debt Of Honour onwards)-Once again Big Deal!A lot of Asians are anti-American.Racism has always been a 2-way street.Never mind the man's politics.There's 1 reason why I and legions of Clancy fans buy his books:He (used to) write ripping yarns! Which is basically the only criteria I use to judge his books.From The Hunt For Red October onwards I have been all too aware of his biggest short-coming:2-dimensional cardboard-cutouts as characters(will we ever see a good-guy character in a Clancy novel who DIDN'T graduate at the top of his class,distinguished himself in the Army/Navy/Airforce/Wall Street/Diplomatic Service/CIA who was then drawn to Government service out of his sheer love and patriotism for his country?) ...TC carved out his unique niche in a genre which his books practically defined:the techno-thriller.Why?The man spun exciting yarns that kept you riveted.Geo-political thrillers on a scale few authors attempt spiced with meticulously researched tech-stuff on Nuclear Submarines,intelligence gathering,military hardware etc.What is absolutely unforgivable about this book is that it is a bore.It's as simple as that.If you're going to people your book with good guys so perfect they're boring,villains so cartoonish you even stop anticipating their downfall,then you...better have a slam-banging,rip-roaring pulse-pounder of a plot to drive them. The menace so palpable THROUGHOUT the last good Clancy I read(The Sum Of All Fears) is evident in less than a hundred pages of this book(the scenes leading to the murder of the Papal Nuncio and the Chinese cleric). And that is pitifully little in a book that weighs in at more than a 1100 pages."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been with Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan since the beginning, but even I have to wonder if maybe it isn't time to turn out the lights and sweep up.After Clancy throws us a bone of an &quot;action&quot; sequence (lasting a few milliseconds, literally) in the opening pages, it grinds to an unbelievable halt for, I dunno, 750 pages before the &quot;Tom Clancy book&quot; begins -- except what we get is pretty much the climax of Executive Orders, with Chinese names pasted over the Islamic ones.Remember when Clancy used to surprise us? Everything here is telegraphed ages in advance. Remember when it was cute that all the good guys (military, law enforcement, political, whatever) were cut from the exact same wise-capable-honest-but-exasperated pattern? By now he's choked his world with an army of functionally identical good guys, especially in Ryan's cabinet. But don't worry, each of them has three different names you'll have to keep straight (his actual name, his job title, his Secret Service codename).Huge tracts of text could have been left profitably behind. Just because some military unit is going to appear on page X, we don't have to see them 40 times beginning on page X minus 500 chatting about their training regimen over coffee. Especially not if we met all the same people in previous books.The sharp increase in profanity and gutter thinking that other readers have pointed out doesn't offend me, but it does seem to show a writer who's too tired of his own creation to approach it with elegance anymore. He also leaves the air littered with story arcs that never make it back to earth. He'd probably say that he's being realistic--that in life, subplots and tangents don't always wrap themselves up neatly at the end. But I can get reality on the news, and I can get it for free.If this series continues, can we get Jack Ryan out of the Oval Office already? One of the fun things about the earlier books was his meteoric, merit-driven rise through the ranks of government service. I know that there's no higher he can go, but he's been in this job longer than any other we've seen him occupy. Cool things could happen to Jack Ryan as a goodwill ambassador to some exotic locale that goes to hell while he's there, or in a similar situation. Get some dirt under the man's fingernails again.I didn't realize just how strenuously I was going to trash Clancy until I started writing this. I've read some arrogant and unlikable things the author has said in real life, and that may be coloring my thinking. And to be honest, dutiful addict that I am, I'll probably lap up the next Jack Ryan story, if there is one. But I'll get it from the public library."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was interested in seeing where Mr. Clancy would take Jack Ryan after the last installment of his adventures. While they were always highly improbable, they did have the whiff of realism and were highly entertaining. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; fails on multiple levels, the most damning of which is it's stultifying pace and the bigoted opinions of the author. It is essentially a vanity piece where Mr. Clancy allows his ego to recreate a world where everything is as it should be... according to his sophomoric intellect. All the cabinet officers have been to Jesuit colleges, except for &quot;the Jew&quot;. All are adamantly antiabortion (he discourses at some length on this) and it is a testament to his laziness or lack of ability that all the characters keep using the same phrases and obscenities. The impression I got was that the novel generating software Mr. Clancy uses is not the latest upgrade.In comparison, while &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was a taut lean thriller that was enjoyable and informative, &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; was a bloated, lethargic and even offensive in its lack of regard for the readers intelligence and its author's indulgence of his own pathetic fantasies."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has gotten boring!!! Just pages upon pages upon pages... Improbable plot, unbelievable characters. He has previously given us Japan attacking the USA, right. Get real, make it at least possible. And Jack Ryan was once a great character but did he have to become president? what is next, Ryan as Pope or just God?The book is way way to long and after the first 100 pages fatigue sets in. Skip to the end. Or better yet, just ask someone who has read it to give you a two minute overview."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a hard-core Clancy fan, wih my favorite being&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;. However, this one truly left me with an unpleasant feeling, especially with its portrayal of Chinese culture and society. It uses some of the harshest descriptions that Clancy has ever used to describe an entire nationality, and is loaded with racial expletives and stereotypes... The portrayal of the Chinese as not valuing human life as much as other societies (not the just the government, but the culture) goes back to the days of Rudyard Kipling. His characterization of Confucian and Buddhist beliefs are downright insulting, and incorrect (Confucianism is not a religion). His portrayal of the Chinese stands in stark contrast to his newfound sympathy for Russia, even though recent real-life events (the Kursk, Chechnya) belie that situation. Clancy has a lot more talent than to resort to this. Also, his characterization of the current Chinese leadership is way of the mark---they don't really believe in Marxiam-Leninism, no more than Americans believe in McCartyism. Clancy should stick to the combat details, until he reads up on what is really going on in China."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was very disappointed. Definitely not up to the caliber of Red October or Cardinal -- or even Rainbow. The plot development is weak. Actually I think Clancy has become such a popular writer that his editors might be hesitant to make suggestions. Personally, I think Bear and Dragon could have benefited from losing 300 or so pages. And what about that Gogol character? He's really interesting and Clancy passes up a great chance to develop him. Also Clancy's knowledge of China is a somewhat dated. Politburo members dress in suits, and their secretaries would probably dress to the nines, too..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've always been a great fan of TC:s work, I hold Red Storm Rising as the best techno-thriller ever written. His follow up books have up to a point been very good. But after Sum of all fears you start getting fed up with reading about sinister plots, Jack &quot;I hate being President&quot; Ryan and finally the US Armed Forces. Don't catch me wrong! I bet that America has one of the best equiped and trained military in the world, but come on! Could we please have some kind of realism left. In this book all I could think of was, maybe this is some kind of propaganda or forum made by the Department of Defense. Some events in this book actually defies stupidity.First of all that America would rather have a war in Asia (not regarding effects of the US economy) than help China out. Then the time it took to send a US armoured division from Germany to Sibiria, with all its munutions and stores on ONE singel railway. Thats like 10000km for crying out load. And the politics involved, I mean like the president could decide to start a war to protect the archenemy of the US against its biggest tradepartner. It took like a half year of meetings in the congress to take a decision to bomb Serbia. But the pinnacle of the book is nevertheless at the end. I think you know what I mean; the downing of a ballistic missile with the use of 20 year old radar and missile technology. This was just too much. Could maybe Tom call Clinton and tell him that their is no need for a renewal of the SDI project, just place a few boats here and there!One new, and not very often witnessed in Clancy's books, angle was the kind of conservative rasism projected towards China. It's probably a very strange regim, but just because it's alien to US standards doesn't neccesarily mean that it's completely f-cked up! As closing words, I have to say I was kind of dissapointed by this book. It felt more like an indoctrination of the qualities of USA (military, technolgical and political) than an independent techno-thriller novel. But I guess that this book sells well in the US, where self-gloating is often a quality. This is a shame, because he's usually one of the best writers in the world. But I guess that everybody runs of of ideas sometimes..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since Red October. Teeth of the Tiger was really rotten and I hoped it was only an aberation. But, I have recently done a Jack Ryan orgy, i.e. rereading the entire series. All was great until I got to The Bear and the Dragon. I recall when I originally read it I was bothered by his dipection of the Chinese. Very racist. On rereading, with Teeth of the Tiger in mind I paid even more attention. I lived and worked in Japan and China in the mid 80's and Clancy's depiction of both of these aisian cultures is very contrived based on 1950's thinking. To depict Chinese as wearing Mao suits in a book published in 2000 is unbelievable.Jack Ryan is no longer a President I would vote for based on his sophmoric depiction of the Chinese and silly dialog with his international peers. Nor is Clancy a novelist that I will trust to base a novel on fact and not his personal opinions.Obviously, Clancy has quit doing research and is simply writing mortgage payment stories. I will never buy another Clancy novel. But he likely doesn't care, being wealthy from his previous. Don't waste your money or your time on future Clancy novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"At some point a few years ago, Clancy decided the world cared about his personal political and moral stances. The Bear and the Dragon continues and amplifies the trend of his previous two books in which Clancy was unable to refrain from infusing his protagonists with his own bitter and cynical opinions. Read a few pages on the mental musings of Ryan and it might as well be a transcript of a radio interview with Clancy. That's bad enough, but the same points are hammered at the readers AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. After reading any 50 page section of the book you'll be able to figure out how Clancy voted on on every ballot issue of his life.The plot? Yes, there is one, and it might have been a reasonable 200 to 300 page novel for a second-rate or beginning thriller genre author. The other 75% of this book is repetitious, and simultaneously irritating and boring. This is the type of book for which CliffsNotes were developed.First time Clancy readers, please don't let this book sour you on Clancy completely. His early books are still very good reads."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Well I'll try to keep this short since there are so many reviews on this.My biggest problem was the dialogue:1) Mary Pat Foley calls her husband &quot;honey bunny&quot; _every single time_ they talk to each other. Not just &quot;honey&quot;, not just &quot;hon&quot;, but &quot;honey bunny&quot;. Please. You'd think they were in high school.2) Phrases are used over and over again. I stopped counting the number of times where I thought &quot;Didn't I just read that?&quot; There was one where the same phrase was used twice on pages opposite each other (paperback).3) Ryan's cursing. It just doesn't sound natural for him to be so potty-mouthed.4) Ryan's whining about being the president. This is part of #2, but he said &quot;and how the hell did I get here?&quot; way way too much (i.e. more than once)One other thing (spoiler here):The CIA's source of information in China I thought was a pretty good subplot. But I was anticipating something going wrong there (i.e. getting caught, etc). Everything was so smooth it didn't feel right.OK that was longer than I thought it would be.. sorry :)"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Because this is going to be a very negative review, I should perhaps establish my bona fides at the outset. I am a long-time Tom Clancy fan who has bought every one of his main books in hard cover going back to RED OCTOBER. I also have no patience for political correctness. Yet, after finishing Bear and Dragon -- a task I had put off for over a year after buying the book -- I must join the apparently lengthy list of former fans who were turned off by this book. Here's why:1. Bloat: Clancy's editors must be terrified of his gun collection. This book sprawls across 1028 pages to tell a story that could be summarized in a couple of sentences. Repetition abounds--the claim that Mao was a pedophile is repeated at least half-a-dozen times.2. The embarassing sex scenes. Before his divorce, Clancy used to pride himself on the absence of sex from his books. In interviews, he laid great stress on his Catholicism and always claimed the moral highground. He still claims that highground, with snide comments on the sexual pecadillos of Bill Clinton and Mao. Yet, he gives us several turgid sex scenes with such sparkling prose as the phrase &quot;japanese sausage,&quot; which he uses to describe a male character's genitalia. A very high yuck factor.3. The lack of realism. Of course, the US and its unlikely ally prevail. And without a scratch. And, of course, our technology works like magic. Yet, we now know from BDA from Kosovo and Iraq, that the fancy technology does not work as well as Clancy claims. And does he really expect to us to believe that China would invade Russia to get a gold mine? Or that a Vatican nuncio would conduct an Operation Rescue-like raid on an abortion clinic? Or that a covert operation would arrive at a nuclear missle site just in time to watch a missle launch (although I admit it will make a good visual in the movie)? And the list goes on. I'm perfectly willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story, but this is beyond the pale.4. The rampant racism. Even with my limited sensitity to political correctness, I was bothered by the incessant use of racist and sexist language.In sum, yuck."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Okay, I normally get through a good book in a week, with one this long, maybe 2-3 weeks, but it's been 5 weeks since I started this book &amp; I'm only on page 191 (out of 1000+). This book reads more like a political statement than a novel (e.g., abortion, foreign affairs, the economy - &amp; remember I'm not even 200 pages in yet). A suspense thriller is not the right place to get up on a soapbox Mr. Clancy. Your views, and your need to express them so strongly in your book, is making you predictable, sir. And being able to surmise the trend &amp; tone (if not the events) of the rest of the story is the last thing I want from this type of book, especially with 800 pages left."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let me try to be objective here without any spoilers, which is no easy thing. Clancy's books I liked : Patriot Games, Hunt for the Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, Sum of All Fears, Without Remorse, and to some extent, Debt of Honour and Executive Orders. Had not the chance to read Red Storm Rising, yet.What I liked about his stories : 1. Originality 2. Realistic characters, with strengths and vulnerabilities and faults. 3. Very diverse lines to development until brought together neatly. 4. More-or-less accurate information technologyWhat is lacking in The Bear and the Dragon ? All of the above. Plus spelling errors and errors in grammar. 1. Originality - a kind way to put it is the premise has been done with Red Storm Rising - big country, big army, desperate for oil and resources. 2. Realistic characters - the only realistic guy is the undersecretary of state, the treacherous amoral twerp, others carry haloes around their heads or pitchforks with tails. 3. Diverse plots - the only bit of mystery of the assassination attempt, and even then, it was weak. Without giving away the story, my guess is that most people can guess the development and the ending even before they are halfway through the book. 4. Information Technology - how easily can the computer of a PA to a minister be tapped. Clancy was mixing 70s technology with the 90s (not 2000s) hardware. Good grief. That is about the most clumsy way to plant a bug and it succeeded.Clancy portraits the Chinese the way they were in the 70s - 80s, technologically and culturally. Wake up, their governments' IT hardware may not be up to par with Europe's or America's but they are certainly not in the stone-age.Another thing is the rest of the world would not idly stand by when China invades Russia. China has a lot of close links with the governments and economies of Europe and South East Asia and North Asia. Did they simply disappear ?Credibility aside, Clancy seems to be preaching Americanism. Good luck with the next book, now that the last superpower crumbles under the American might, Ryan would be preaching Americanism to the Klingons next."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"(Be aware, there are some spoilers along the way)Once upon a time Clancy was my number one writer. Well, maybe number 1.5 after Tolkien and Asimov. Still, I loved his stuff, the complex story line, the characters were my heroes and the level of exact details in the military/terror scenarios was astonishing. It all ended, and I am truly sad to say that, in this book.The Bear and the Dragon is a sort of a mish-mash between Clancy\`s previous novels (a Debt of Honor and Executive Order) mixed with a very low lever version of Red Storm Rising, which in my eyes, was his masterpiece.Jack Ryan, the beloved president, transforms from the ordinary though talented hero, which is what I liked about him, to a sort of whimpering president who keeps moaning about needing to do what is right and the fact that he hates the hellhole he was driven to (i.e. - the white house). Add to that the fact that his v.p., Jackson, a guy I loved reading about since Patriot Games, became a really annoying ex fighter pilot who can\`t get over the fact that he is not flying anymore (For gods sakes man! take off those wings off your suit!) Throw in the nauseating Folies (the bunny couple), The Chinese Politbereau members (who look like a copy of the Soviet members in Red Storm), The super annoying Ernie Van Damm who seems to say the exact same phrases for the third book in a row...Some details in the plot looks quite ridicules, especially for a master of details, such as Clancy. The Chinese espionage plot for example. I am quite sure that comrade Ming would not be as stupid in reality as in the book by allowing Numory to implant that agent in her computer. Or, the joint attack by Rainbow-Speznaz teams against the Chinese nuclear silos. 30 Russian casualties of course, non for the invincible immortal Rainbow team. Get over it...In short - bad plot, annoying characters, very stupid grand finale. The movie will probably be worse."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not sure why I chose to waste so much of my valuable time reading (or even finishing) this miserable book. Maybe I was hoping to capture some of the intensity and powerful drama that I remember from &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;.Some of the earlier reviewers suggested that anyone who doesn't like the book must be some kind of a PC pinko. Isn't it possible that even a Reagan-loving, commie-hating, 2nd amendment supporting, SDI proponent like myself might find hundreds of pages of ranting about abortion and how the Chinese are evil slant-eyed &quot;Klingons&quot; not only offensive but downright boring.It's hard for me to imagine that even an abortion clinic bomber who had been tortured by Chinese troops in Korea would find this novel entertaining. Let's face it: abortion and international intrigue just don't go together. I'm a stuanch supporter of tort reform but if Tom Clancy ever makes the issue into the basis for a 1000 page novel, I'm going to run for the hills.Isn't the Chinese government threatening enough? Do we really need to demonize the entire Chinese civilization. After all, the Chinese are falling all over themselves to implement capitalism. China may be a totalitarian state, but wouldn't the novel be just a bit more interesting if the Chinese government had some small measure of competence? Isn't it possible that the U.S. government is sometimes a less than perfectly oiled machine composed of dedicated patriots? After all, I thought the magic behind the U.S. has something to do with our government being less organized and less powerful than those in totaliarian states. Tom Clancy seems to think that we owe our success to the wisdom and benevolence of the people in our government.Even those who don't mind the ideological diatribes should realize that the novel needs some serious editing. Several times I though I had lost my place because I was reading the same text. Why couldn't we just skip the whole absurd fantasy about the Beijing police shooting a Vatican diplomat in front a CNN camera crew and go straight to the point where China decides to snatch the oil and gold. Oops, I hope I didn't spoil it for you (if calling the Chinese evil Klingons didn't give it away). Well, I won't tell you who wins...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Let me preface this review with the proviso that I'm a huge Clancy fan. Debt of Honor and Clear and Present Danger are books I could read once a year for the rest of my lfe, and still enjoy them every time. In Tom Clancy's new thriller, you need to know what everyone's motivation is, before they make any kind of a move. Mr. Clancy spends most of the 1000+ pages in his new book setting up a very short war. Now, I'm sure that's how things will go from now on, with the technological superiority the US showed in the Gulf, but seven hundred pages of motivation, background and surveillance of ex-KGB officers gets to be a bit much. I can understand wanting to know why the Chinese act as they do, and the Russians, and even President Ryan. I like the details of the Moscow Militia detective's life, and the story of the CIA officer's adventures in China. But I wish Mr. Clancy would give these small characters more to do, preferrably with a suppressed .22 or an MP-10. Some of the characters even seem just to have been added for continuity from the books that came before. This book to me seems the reverse of Sum of All Fears, in that, when I re-read that, I sometimes skip the last parts, because the tension isn't there. With this one, I wish he'd written for more than a quarter of the book about the war. That would have grabbed my attention. He's shown he can do a large conflict using intimate characters with Red Storm Rising. That might have been a better idea here."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"(OK, that's a line from &quot;The Critic&quot;, but you get the idea).I used to be a Clancy reader but my interested dwindled when he started the slide into Dean Koontz, Clive Cussler (does anyone else see Jack Ryan as a ripoff of Dirk Pitt?) turning-it-out-to-finance-the-lifestyle hackdom. I thought the premise of this sounded interesting, so I bought. When I finished it (and that was only because I believed it _had_ to get better) I walked over and threw it in the trash.Clany strings together 1200 pages of breathless techno-babble with what seems like quotations from the armament company brochures and military PR demos plus his racist diatribes, his politics whacking you over the head like a 2 X 4 and the President abandoning his NECAP post during a nuclear attack because he can't deal with the idea of ordering the inevitable counter-strike. In the real world, he would be impeached as a coward; here, he gets lauded.This book is crud. Maybe Clancy is still a good writer, but he's been Dilbertized and is now publishing work of marginal quality, likely because his editors won't argue with Write-It-In-Capitals-Please Tom Clancy. He's in love with his characters and thinks twenty pages of internal dialogue fascinates us as much as him. This book could be trimmed by AT LEAST 500 pages.Even the clash-of-arms descriptions, once entertaining what-if scenarios, have become ludicrous to the point of parody. One almost expects John Clark or Mary Diggs to pick up a Chinese M-98 tank and twirl it around like the old Superman comics.Examples:- A 2K software fix turns an Aegis missile cruiser into a ballistic missile interceptor;- One platoon of M-1s destroys a Chinese heavy tank brigade without taking a single loss;- One American fighter flight of four planes shoots down thirty-five Chinese planes without a single loss;- Less than twenty F-16s destroy _three hundred_ Chinese tanks in a single attack;. Yes, I know, Gulf War Turkey Shoot, blah blah blah. I have the Discovery Channel too. This isn't reality or even entertaining disbelief. It's also not the same war being described.Save your money, don't buy anymore of his books. Demand better and don't fork over any cash until you get it. Maybe his readership will decline and that will give his editors the cojones to stand up to the guy and tell him to start trying to write stuff with merit.I don't know what his fans get out of reading his books, but reality _definitely_isn't part of that equation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"My eyes are fooling me! First of all, I read for entertainment, not to write reviews. But what has me confused is the fact that when I checked the reviews of TC's new book before I bought it a couple of weeks ago, the average rating was 4 1/2 stars. Now it is down to 3 stars, and by the look of things it is headed even lower. I'm glad that I read the book without some of the comments written before mine. I, like almost everyone else, have read all of his previous books. I by no means think that this was his best work. I especially cringed at the language. Note to Mr. Clancy: There is NO need to use the &quot;f&quot; word in every sentence. I choose as my friends those who use more dignified language in their everyday speech, and I plan to use this same rule in choosing authors in the future. Clean it up!In contrast, as entertainment, the book was fast moving.....if you like the behind the scenes information. I did seem to notice that there was a gigantic political message here. I also noticed that unlike every other book of it's genre, there were no failings of the main &quot;heroes&quot;. It was too perfect. So, as far as realism, the book fell flat. The bottom line though, is that this book was entertaining. I don't get to read as much as I once did, and so if a story is gripping enough to hold my attention, I am pleased with the result. The ending left much to be desired, but was sooooo much better than the ending of &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, the last book I read, that I can't complain.Anyway, this is the first review I've ever written, and I hope it helps someone. Like another reviewer said, wait for the paperback! Overall though, worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I picked up The Bear and the Dragon with a great deal of anticipation. The arc of Clancy's books from Debt of Honor onward have been heading toward a confrontation between Russia and China, and this promised to be the conclusion of a great arc. Conflict between Russia and China is tomorrow's scenario of war. Other writers, most notably Eric Harry, have already explored this possibility and I was eager to see Clancy's take on it. The fact that the World Trade Center had just been attacked certainly contributed to my eagerness to read this book.The Bear and the Dragon begins with a fair amount of plotting and suspense, but the respective threads of the plot grow frayed long before hostilities commence. The book offers hundreds of needless pages of set-up, involving one of Clancy's trademark fluke events (a contrived killing of a diplomat). Generally, it's a bad call to force your readers to wait that long for a plot development that is foretold by the cover description.The actual writing of the war disappointed me for 4 reasons.1.) is that it feels routine. The war is basically reminiscent of the one at the end of Executive Orders. Little menace is generated by the Chinese. The resolution of the war is sudden and unconvincing. China's a bit tougher than that, and the war deserved more than the last quarter of the book. Which brings us to2.) the human element is genuinely lacking. Eric Harry has done some marvelous work in Arclight, Protect &amp; Defend, and Invasion to display the horror and chaos of war. Clancy's war always seems distant. Good guys do not express doubt, panic, shock or horror. The cowboys are mutually interchangeable, equally cocky, and very few of them ever die.3.) The bad guys are idiots. Zhang Han San always seemed the smartest guy in the room before, but Clancy turns him into an idiotic zealot in this book.4.) Clancy's willingness to make unapologetic use of the word &quot;chink&quot; is indefensible.I really liked reading Tom Clancy novels before this. The Hunt for Red October got me started on the entire genre, Red Storm Rising rocked, and Clear and Present Danger is one of the best plotted books I've ever read. I do like Debt of Honor and Executive Orders as well - both delivered the promised fireworks. That's why I had such hopes for this book, and why I found it disappointing."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is by far &amp; away the worst book Tom Clancy has written. I couldn't even finish reading it. After 300 pages, I gave up. I tried to get into the story but there's way too many sub-plots and political rants instilled by the author. He also should find a new editor, this book could have been more enthralling if you throw out 500 pages of it. I guess I should be thankful Clancy used POTUS instead of actually writing out the full title, &quot;President of the United States,&quot; otherwise this book might have been 1500 pages long."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"TBATD continues Clancy's downward spiral towards mediocrity. Starting with Rainbow 6, Clancy's novels have become nothing but platforms for his own political ramblings and ethnocentric (borderline racist) feelings. Where have the politically-hip, technically-detailed, and tightly-plotted yarns gone? Here are the major (but not only) problems in this book:1. Plot: Or rather, a lack of it. It's 1000+ pages of rising and falling action that lack any believable or even interesting connection. Simple-minded and too predictable.2. Characters: Ryan is too old, and maybe Clancy is too, because he needs a new, fresh character with a new, LESS RIGHT-WING, and less cynical attitude on life and international relations.3. Language &amp; Size: The grammar is unacceptable. Spelling errors abound and grammatical mistakes make sentences hard to understand. Long-winded paragraphs and Clancy's typical (although this time he goes overboard) technical descriptions turn a mediocre 500 pages story into a horrible 1000 page exercise in torture. Also, the audience does not need to hear the F-word or the word &quot;chink&quot; a thousand times, nor raunchy, immature references to &quot;Japanese sausage&quot;.4. Bias: Perhaps Clancy is a racist; his description of anything non-American is appalling! We all know his beliefs on cultures: Americans - moral, right and heoric, Rats - anything non-American; but his latest diatribe is just embarassing.5. Research: Gathering from the reviews I've read, I've only recently realized that maybe some of the technical (not to mention cultural) information is just plain wrong.Clancy needs a break from writing. He may have been the master of his genre, but now he's writing like one of his villians: a politically-crazed, cynical madman."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I just couldn't. Maybe Clancy has tired of writing exciting novels. I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon. A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane. The book pales in comparison to the real drama.Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels. In this one, his age shows badly. He's a character that has lost his shine. In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency. He doesn't really like his job. By the end, I wish he had just resigned. Clancy uses abortion in a very inflamatory way to paint the Chinese as horrible people. Clancy should have saved his opinions on this issue for a letter to the editor. Instead, he should have written a compelling story. Skip this one. If you're new to Clancy, read his earlier novels, like Red October. They're much, much better stories."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm another long-time Clancy nut - first hooked on HFRO, by Clancy's terrifically intricate plots and attention to detail, which allowed one to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, in his more recent works, he seems to have begun to run out of ideas, and in so doing, trades tight, gripping plots for bigger explosions at the end. His most enjoyable and plausible stories (see HFRO, Cardinal, or Patriot Games) are those that didn't alter the world, but merely took the reader for a tight, wonderful read. Jack Ryan used to be the best anti-hero I'd encountered in popular fiction - the common-sensical everyman, with flaws (like fear of flying) to boot. Making him president ruined the character, especially after Executive Orders (it was mildly entertaining to watch Everyman Ryan take on the presidential trappings ... for a couple of hundred pages). Likewise, Clancy used to give us great villians - complex and authentic (see the Soviets of Red Storm Rising or COTK, the Arab terrorists of SOAF, or the Irish terrorists of Patriot Games). Now they are cardboard characters, and too often portrayed in racist and insultingly simplistic terms - and thus utterly unbelievable.His female characters have likewise become defined as either good (read: nurturing, mother figures like Mrs. Ryan, Mrs. Clark, the pregnant Mrs. Foley or pregnant S.S. Agent Price), or bad (read: liberal, feminist NSA in SOAF, or scientist in Rainbow 6). These juvenile depictions of women make Clancy seem like the creepy 16 y.o. who couldn't get a date to the prom.I had hope that after the debacle of Rainbow 6 (environmentalists out to kill all of mankind ... please ...) that this story would return to plausible global politics/espionage/warfare scenarios, but Clancy now disappoints with silly portrayals of the Chinese. There were some interesting ideas in this plot, but it now seems that Clancy has to go to war in each new book (three wars respectively against Japan, Iran, and now China ...)I don't at all mind Clancy's politics (in fact, agree with many of his opinions), which he has increasingly thrust into the last few novels, but his endless ranting against &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, political correct-ness, feminists, Roe v. Wade, etc., makes him sound like the obnoxious drunk at the end of the bar who won't shut up. These opinions add nothing to his stories and seem more like he intends his novels now to be his soapbox. Likewise, the good guys all seem to use the same &quot;jock-speak&quot; and come across as wooden and very predictable.Maybe ending this series and starting fresh with new characters and a return to what he is the master at - detailed, intricate and creative &quot;what if&quot; plots - will bring Clancy back to form. Here's to hoping so."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Having read all of Clancy's &quot;Ryan&quot; novels, I have come to expect certains things from his storys: Much techno-babble, intrigue, impossible to pronounce Russian names, and Jack Ryan to the rescue. I also expect to enjoy the book. In &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, we get the techno babble to the Nth degree(do we need the workings of an encrypted phone explained every time it is mentioned?),the Russian names and Jack Ryan. We also get is a story of marginal entertainment value, a large dose of Clancy's personal political views on everything from Clinton to abortion,story lines that seem to meander along and sputter, and very little reading enjoyment. Of course the ending has been commented on many times, with its screeching halt &quot; I am tired of writing this story&quot; ending that stretches believability to the limit. Aint it amazing where the last remaining missile is targeted? Overall, very disappointing, and ranks poorly when compared to any of the other Ryan novels.&quot;Oh writer of Patriot Games, hath though foresaken us?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's books and like others have become disappointed with the quality of writing not to mention the disjointed story line. How his editors allowed this novel to be published is beyond my comprehension. It seemed the same phrases were used time and time again to the detriment of the book. Finally I think its high time Mr. Clancy retired Jack Ryan. I have never, ever, been a fan of Ryan, reading the books more for the other characters Mr. Clancy created. If I have to read one more time about Ryan's character I will gag. Personally, every time the book reverted to the White House where Ryan was wrestling with some dilemma I breezed through the segment hoping to read something more interesting then Mr. Clancy moralizing to us through Jack Ryan's character. Do us all a favor Mr. Clancy, if you are unable to write to your previous high standards, just stop and run for office since it appears you think you have all the answers."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's last few books have been increasingly difficult to wade through, and his latest confirms the downward spiral. I noted from one of the other reviewers that Clancy claims that he was in some ways inspired by Robert Heinlein; he apparently intends to follow Heinlein's career trajectory as well. Heinlein started out as a writer of entertaining science fiction, intricately plotted and well-populated by interesting characters. As the years wore on, he became progressively more enamored of his political views (which, like Clancy's, were jingoistic and reactionary)and therefore spent most of his time hectoring the reader with his political sentiments.Such is the case here. The &quot;scenes&quot; in Pres. Ryan's office are the worst kind of didactic, right-wing gasbaggery. Pres. Ryan spends all of his time moaning about being forced (against his will) to run the country. His President loves secrecy, hates the press, the Congress, and (if he were to admit it) those cattle whom he has been elected to serve. According to Clancy, the business of government should be handed over to the wealthy, because they are too rich to need to steal anything. Apparently Mr. Clancy has never met a wealthy man who was ambitious, and never read the newspapers when Michael Milken was going down.Clancy's racism is no longer veiled by even the slightest artifice. The descriptions of the Chinese characters are appallingly bigoted and simplistic. In the end, Clancy prefers the Russians not because they are no longer Communist, but simply because they are not yellow, and their eyes are round.If someone can slog from one end of the narrative to the other, an entertaining drinking game might be created by having one consume a shot whenever one encounters Clancy's favorite testosterone-laced cliches (been there and done that, etc.). This would necessarily be followed by a trip to Betty Ford.Clancy is no longer a writer, he is a &quot;brand.&quot; And this brand is ready for the 99 cent store."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon take Clancy's stock players into new positions of power. Clancy however has gone far beyond any of his previous works in his jarring sophomoric political and philosophical drivel. The story line is constantly slowed down by his political meanderings which have absolutely nothing to do with his story . The book could easily be half as long and twice as readable. Even if you try to discount these meanderings they are so jarring and inappropriate that you are quickly torn from the narrative and feel you have just listened to a bad political commercial. If Clancy was not already successful this book would not be published as it stands. Read it as your own risk."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have noticed a steady decline in the quality of Tom Clancy's work. His early books were some of the best I've ever read. However, as time progresses, it is clear his well of ideas is drying up. His books are beginning to look the same. The same basic story line read over and over again.Having said that, I think The Bear and the Dragon would have been an interesting read if it wasn't for the extreme racism prevalent throughout the novel. He insults almost every religious and ethnic group he can.I'd say its time for Tom Clancy to retire gracefully before he causes any more damage to his reputation."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Mr Clancy, this was a bitter disappointment. I had hoped that after the disaster that was \\"Rainbow Six\\" you would have made a little more effort this time around.* You have turned your main character, Jack Ryan, into a know-nothing Buchananite Libertarian that has nothing for disdain for the people that serve their country by working in government (except for soldiers and cops). Not to mention that he swears entirely too much.* You have shown an apalling lack of attention to detail regarding the geography of the DC area, which is a shame as you live so nearby. NOTE: A north-bound ship, heading for the Washington Navy Yard needn't pass under the John Phillip Sousa bridge... You meant the South Capitol Street bridge... which isn't a drawbridge.* Your plots are thinner and thinner.* Your addition of gratuitous sex scenes is an indicator of a lack of imagination or immaturity* Your combat scenes are ludicrous* Your overuse of Secret Service codenames was silly.* People (even us awful slackers in government) rarely refer to the President as POTUS, and even more rarely do they refer to the First Lady as FLOTUS.In closing, your work was overwrought, over-written, and just plain ol' poor. It is obvious that you didn't do much research for this novel, and that you REALLY do need to reunite with Larry Bond. [...]"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm a big fan of Clancy's fiction and non-fiction, but I can unreservedly say that this is his worst book. The storyline is an uninspired rehash of Debt of Honor and parts of Executive Orders; the dialogue is eighth-grade (with way too much completely gratuitous profanity and crudity); the sentence structure can best be described as torturous, with far too many overlong compound sentences. The characterizations are incredibly offensive to women and Chinese, among others. Don't get me wrong; I'm not PC by any stretch, but the continuous misogyny and racism here was hard to stomach.Did I mention repetition? There's too much rehashing of events from previous books, and a large number of places where Clancy liked a bon mot enough to reuse it several times (&quot;flower of 1975 technology&quot;, for example).The worst part for me: I know he can do better, as demonstrated in Every Man a Tiger. It's obvious that no one made an attempt to edit this book-- there are an astounding number of grammatical errors, and a good fiction editor could have tightened up the story immensely. I'll get his next book from the library."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy has totally hit the wall. 90% of this mammoth waste of paper concerns Ryan's (Clancy's) musings concerning his ultra right wing political views. The foul language, use of code names, continual racist comments is just trash. It is particularly interesting that Clancy previously at least featured women having an important role in the military. None of the so called expert reviewers seem to have noticed their total absence this time. Ryan's wife (keeping her barefoot and pregnant) is reduced to a &quot;jack what is going on&quot; moron. Andrea, previously a hero, is sent home at the time of crisis because she is pregnant. Ming is a used sex object. For the 3rd book in a row a very small American military intrusion (this time with the help of 3 Russian divisions) has totally destroyed a vastly superior foe, and again, none of the good guys get hurt. Gee, isnt war fun. And yet again the FBI is a great American institution without flaws. Get real, Tom.

He obviously didn't enjoy it, and didn't care if the reader did or not. Aside from the Phyllis Schafly anti-abortion screeds, the &quot;media are a pain&quot; asides, and the execrable dialogue, its just not a good story. BORING. Wait for the neighbors garage sale, and pick this up on the bargain table if you absolutely must read it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy's newest continues the Jack Ryan Saga into the twenty first century with a war between China and Russia. I looked forward to this a lot as a hardcore Clancy fan. For the most part, it was good- good action, well developed plots and characters, the technical scenes he is known for, etc. However, there are a few problems which I hope do not recur in future, as I have never seen them before. First, the book was full of typos. Second, Tom, you aren't a romance writer- the &quot;sausage&quot; schtick was funny in its banal stupidity. Finally, quit giving sermons through Ryan- you used to not do that in the early books. And don't make the Chinese out to be buffoons! Where is the intelligent adversary for the US that the USSR was in the early books? But hey- it had a lot of the Clancy flair to it- and it was very gripping. Also, the spy parts were perhaps the best he's ever done since Cardinal of the Kremlin. So read it- you'll enjoy it, although its not the five star caliber of his early books, Hunt for Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy returns with Pres. Ryan helping the Russians with an invading Chinese force in Siberia. This opus, 1028 pages, read very well and the action scenes were great. It's nice to see all the regulars back in action. The plot seems very plausible with the Chinese screwing the US out of trade dollars, etc. The scenes that were not battle oriented were great also. Without giving out any spoilers, the only problem I had was Ryan's location toward the end of the novel. It is a bit far fetched and unbelievable. Other wise a stunningly brilliant book. Highest recommendation. For reference, the only Clancy book I disliked was DEBT OF HONOR...all the rest were great!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was a great book. I have now read it twice, however i am disappointed to find the reports from other people who did not like this book, even people who have read the other books in this series, this book is as good if not better than the rest. Rainbow Six is by far my favorite, with all the detail that he builds into battle sequence and the caracter backround, from what the sniper sees as he looks through his scope to see the damage he has done to his target to where the Rainbow Six team thinks about its objective, etc.As for Frank Owen from Chicago, IL who wrote a earlier review, he says &quot;Additionally, I am disappointed by the increasingly frequent usage of vulgarity in Clancy's books (especially Rainbow Six) as it does not seem necessary and certainly reduces the number of people to whom I would reccomend the book.&quot;Hey Frank welcome to the real world where real people speak real words, not high educated harvard english.

I enjoyed reading it and would encourage others to read it. Sometimes it's even good for a book to be non-PC because then readers can see what the world is really like: not through the eyes of some lib."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you have not followed the Ryan saga from square one dont bother reading the book. You just wont understand. Definately not his best book, but it is still better than 99.9% of the other books in this genre. Great plot, amazing accuracy, and a little predictable but still hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book grabbed me and held me like only Red October and Red Storm Rising have in the past. The plot is intricate and yet very easy to follow closely.Some of the complaints I've read on this board leave me scratching my head. Calling the Chinese leaders Klingons isn't intended as a racist comment - it is intended to illustrate that the Chinese worldview and the American worldview are so dramatically different that it is very difficult for them to empathize with each other. As the book illustrates, this creates potentially volatile miscommunications.I also wonder about those that say Ryan has become a whiny wimp. Ryan has always - back to the beginning - been portrayed as an everyday man in situations he perceived as being way over his head. He comes through these with a combination of intelligence and plain old good luck. That formula has never changed.My one disagreement with Clancy is his notion that more and more technology will make winning wars this easy in the near future. With the current state of our military, I doubt this is the case. The book is, however, a work of fiction and the series really hasn't even remotely paralled the real world since that nuke went off in Denver. Therefore, his fantasy Nintendo type war doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.I would encourage anyone to read this book without reservation. The fact that I am so tired today from 3 straight nights of virutally no sleep is the perfect testimonial to how exciting this book is."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Power derives from the ability to define. Global Power is the ability to define and geive effect to one's vision of how the world should run.THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON works as a thinly veiled bit of &quot;advice&quot; for incomong president George W. Bush. He needs to clean up the cesspool of domestic corruption created by the Clinton/Gore administration, and he must be prepared to face a renewed external threat posed by the rise of Communist China and the renewed Russian communists.In THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, The Russian Communists are funded by a global organized crime network, anvd the Chinese were aided enormously by traitors in a prior administation who sold US nuclear and other secrets in exchange for personal favors. Could Tom Clancy be making a statement here about the Clinton Administration? Thhe nearly hysterical reaction of liberals to this book (they almost all hate it intensely) suggests that they certainly see fictinal President &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; as a noble pro-American president who is a complete opposite of their guys, Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Conservatives seem to see it too, since they love th novel and often comment that they hope George W. Bush is like &quot;Jack Ryan&quot;.While 'Jack Ryan' is a man who clearly understands power, he is not one to get drunk on it. His domestic agenda is broadly aimed at devolving power out of Washington, DC, and returning it to the states and the people. 'Jack Ryan' sees government as a necessary evil, which is best at defending the nation from enemied internal and external. The character of president Jack Ryan embodies what people admired in Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.This is far better than any recent Tom Clancy novels. It is a complex and multithreaded spy novel that's worth of at least a few feature films--assuming that anyone in Hollywood is interested in producing movies that don't denigrate American patriotism, or which are not pro-Marxist.Unlike most spy novels, this one is clearly based on modern geo-political realities, and contermporary methods of espionage. In other words, the events in this book are very plausible.Will George W. Bush rise to meet the international and domestic challenges that will almost certainly be presetned during his term in office? He has his work cut out for him as doubts about his leadership ability mount during the challenges to his election victory.In THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, the action is well paced, the characters are intriguing, and the plots move in parallel. It's a great read.While it is unlikely that George W. Bush will turn to Tom Clancy for advice on matters of foreign or military policy, one hopes that he is smart enough to surround himself with people who understand political as well strategic realities, and that the United States does not lose the ability to define the emerging World Order."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I found that this was one of Clancy's best. John Clark is up to his usual tricks of the trade and Ryan is up to his ears in politics and intrigue. Definitely a fun read!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In this book, the author deals with the threat and the actuality of war between the \\"new\\" Republic of Russia and the People's Republic of China.The subject is interesting and seems very real after we have experienced the 911 attacks on our Country.The book is very well written and specially very well researched. The author tries to present all the peoples, countries and events that will interact once the conflict starts.However, it is my opinion, that he overcharges the book with technical detail. I understand that today's war are mostly technical, but reading about the different types of bombs that used to exist and the new ones, as well as tanks that were and are, does tend to make the book slow and stops the flow of the story.All in all, it is a very interesting read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The fact is, this is a good story; on par or above Clancy's average works. The fact is though, anyone of liberal persuasion HATES this book because much of what Clancy says through Jack Ryan (who has basically become his sounding board) makes sense. It doesn't bash on women, gays, or minorities despite what they are yelling to the rooftops. It is mainly a good yarn about a very intelligent and very principled Pres. Jack Ryan who makes decisions with his brain, instead out of knee jerk emotion (or in the case of a certain sitting president, his ... )"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"When I was done with The Sum of All Fears,I was looking for a new one of Clancy's to read. I decided to read The Bear and the Dragon. I went online to read the reviews and people were just trashing this book. They were saying how racist he was towards the chinese and how long the book was. This started to make me think if I should read this or not. But I decided that I should go ahead. I thought that this was one of his greatest military novels since Red Storm Rising. I read a review where the person was saying how the chinese Su-27 were being shot down at will by are F-14 and F-15 and that the Su-27 sould have performed better than they did. The person must have been a complete idiot. He said that the Su-27 was a better fighter, that might be true because the 14 and 15 are old planes but we have new models of the planes. Plus the training of the american pilots are better. Some people just don't know what they are talking about. Yeah the book starts off slow but if you are a true clancy fan you would keep reading it. The real action that clancy is famous for dosen't really start until page 700. Once that happens it is not stop action from their. It just makes me mad how people hate him just because he was taliking bad about the asian population. Honestly who chares. I would recommend this to any one who wants and entertainig read and who would take the time to see clancy's brillance when it comes to military stratagey."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am stunned that so many reviewers have written that this novel is Tom Clancy's best book ever. As an avid reader and re-reader of Clancy's books, I found The Bear and the Dragon to be a poor effort compared to his earlier works.The technology descriptions don't disappoint, but the human interactions leave much to be desired. Most of the characters are not developed at all, especially Ryan's family, which appears to have increased by one. In addition, every time Ryan's oldest child is mentioned, it is in the context that she is now dating and the Secret Service's attendance at her dates provides Ryan with some comfort. Each family member is now a cliche, sent off to dwell at work, school, or day care so that Ryan can govern the country.Thankfully, Clancy has not forgotten how to keep the tension level high. The scenes of preparation leading to war, as well as the early days of the Chinese invasion, kept my attention.However, again Clancy fails the reader with his poor treatment of the cast of thousands. In fact, the only character development is simply to reiterate cliches about the military, women, Russians, the Chinese, Hispanics, the poor, the press, politicians, and [...]. It is kind of pathetic.I'm not sorry that I read the book, but I am hopeful that many of the problems could be resolved by careful and comprehensive editing as well as spending more time developing characters and then resolving and concluding the book. I will hope for a better effort next time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"5 of 7 people found the following review helpful: Five Novels Stitched Into One -- Only One Is Interesting October 8, 2000 The Bear and The Dragon combines five novels -- one about a murder mystery in Moscow, one about espionage in Bejing, one about Chinese-American trade diplomacy, another about economic development in Siberia, and a final one about major power conflicts. Of the five, only the last bears any resemblance to a Tom Clancy novel of the calibre of The Hunt for Red October, but that final novel in the book still manages to fall short of the former standard of this author. The book is incredibly bloated, boring (until the last 256 pages), annoyingly repetitive, predictable, and full of gratuitous sexual and racist references.If you feel you must read this book, begin on page 773. You won't miss anything you need to know before then, if you do. That's the point at which the Clancy-like novel begins with the usual gee-whiz technology and action. That last novel is fair-to-middling for a Clancy effort.As to the bloat in this book, Clancy did not need to write the other four novels to write his usual one (the last one in this book). He simply padded the book to make this more like War and Peace. Well, it's not War and Peace. Clancy doesn't begin to show the skill to work in that direction. The story is simply so improbable on its face that it's hard to imagine anyone finding it interesting. He likes to develop everything around a theme of the evil Chinese leaders. He demonizes Chinese leaders in the PRC more than most people darken Hitler today. As to repetition, you will get references to the sex habits of fictional and former Chinese leaders many dozens of times more than you will care to read them. The word, puke, must appear more than 200 times in this book, as an example. As for bloat, there must be 150 uninteresting pages in this book about Ryan sneaking a cigarette when his wife isn't around and not liking being president. As for predictability, every single person and technology you read about in the book shows up in the later action in one of the two ways you would most have expected.I was very disappointed. I found it hard to imagine that I stuck it out to the end. I suspect that most people will not.If you do decide to read this book and decide you dislike it, like me, ask yourself why you did not pay attention to the hundreds of warnings from people who have read the book. That may help you to understand why you act impulsively against your own best interest.If you do read the book and like it, I suggest you consider why others may not have. Then, you will be better able to use reviews in the future to distinguish the books that you will like in the future that most other people do not.Find a new author to read!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'd forgotten how irritating and disappointing TBATD was. On second reading after a long gap, I got bored at page 650 and started reading these Amazon reviews to see if anyone else had the same problems. They did. Three hours and several hundred reviews later, I got to wishing that I'd had the job of editor at the time. Or, that authors had the same chance and inclination that film directors often have - to do a Director's Cut or Redux version of their books. Almost all the faults noted here in these reviews are true. What is so sad is that most of those faults could be put right with decent editing of the first three quarters, some extra \\"footage\\" at the climax and a better crafted ending. I disagree with those that say you could lose most of the first 800 pages - there's the makings of a classic Clancy there. Take out the (endless and irritating) repetition, rework the dialogue so it sounds like it's coming from intelligent adults, lose the (embarrassing) sex, and cut down the really boring bits (too much Trade talks, Ryan too whiny, long-winded and stupid, get rid of most paragraphs with \\"he thought\\" in them - see endless repetition, above). Have Nomori insert the spy programme when he loads the Mandarin language software (duh), so removing the most unbelievable plot point. Lose the unpleasant \\"Chink\\" racism and update the world of China from 1965 to 2000. And excise the sermonizing.Done. From two stars to five, no problem. Still a 1,000 page tome but a great one instead of one that has apparently lost Clancy a worrying percentage of his biggest fans. On re-reading, it does smell of a ghost co-writer in places, when what it needed was a great editor and a little more work. I rather liked Red Rabbit though Teeth of the Tiger was ruined by a complete non-ending that seemed to drop off a cliff at the end of a paragraph. Let's hope for better things to come from past and (I hope) future genius of the geopolitical thriller."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Most Clancy fans reading this book would ask the question \\"What is happening with him ?\\" Some plots were good but most were so-so. The characters were shallow. Contents were too long and repetitive. Language used in dialogues was disgusting.It is fine to be creative, e.g. China invading Russia. But xenophobia is another matter. Every thing in the book about China/Chinese was negative. It seems as if Clancy was trying to portray Chinese as an evil people. The view points (e.g. trade conflict) were one-sided.Cultures and Countries are different. Disagreeing with the US doesn't necessarily mean the other party is wrong. We have to be careful of such \\"either black or white\\" mindset being spread through popular culture like novels.I used to find Clancy's accounts about Latin America and Russia very interesting. But now reading his description about China, I can't help doubting the vividness of Clancy books' contents related to non-US countries. The Beijing he talked about was back in early \`80s !"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have to admit that I have always had a hard time finishing Clancy's books, although I love reading them, but there's just so much detail and it goes on forever. This book covers a very interesting subject and that kept me going, because this time, the characters weren't that interesting. And it is a very long book. I'm sure it was a lot of work to write this novel and I respect that, but sometimes it seems as if an editor should have just ripped out this section and that paragraph. Anyway, if you have some time to spare then this book might a great way to enjoy a good read. In comparison I just read a brand new 400-page thriller by a new author which covers a similar topic of nuclear terrorism, and it's fast-paced and I read it in less than 2 days, which is the highly recommended new high-profile megathriller by Alec Donzi called &quot;The Consultant.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is o.k. if you just want to keep up with the continuing Ryan saga. I'm an active duty service member, though, and the problem is the sloppy basic research about weapons systems and the paper-thin caricatures based on real people. Clancy, with the help of Larry Bond and others, did incredibly detailed research that produced \\"Hunt For Red October\\" and \\"Red Storm Rising\\" that were pleasing for the professionals to read and interesting in terms of both story-line and technical detail for the civilian reader.This book doesn't live up to that early standard, continuing the downward spiral in terms of both technical and tactical accuracy that started with, at least, \\"Executive Orders.\\" A casual read of Popular Science or Popular Mechanics would reveal that the Darkstar UAV is designed to, and can, reach targets from Guam (or probably Alaska to cover Siberia). So, why deploy it (taking up cargo space) to the theater.A check of Janes would reveal that the AH-64 Apache is armed with a 30mm cannon, not the 20mm cited in the book. The Chinese ICBMs also receive the wrong designation that might have been a typo that wasn't caught.Sure, these seem like minor nit but this kind of error wasn't generally found in Clancy's earlier works. It makes me wonder how much of this he really writes himself anymore, vice letting the \\"research staff\\" do the writing, as is the case with the terrible OP CENTER series.It's also reflective of an arrogant attitude-\\"It's Clancy so it'll sell even if the accuracy isn't as good anymore.\\"BTW, I wonder if Clancy and the editors ever thought of including...a MAP of the area where the war is fought."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy wrote several of the greatest and most riveting novels I've read. The list includes \\"The Hunt for the Red October\\", \\"The Sum of All Fears\\", and \\"Red Storm Rising\\". Unfortunately, as the Cold War came to an end and took away the rivalries between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, so did Clancy's bearing. His recent novels floundered like a fish out of water or a former Red Army soldier out of uniform. Instead of trying to look around, understand the post-Cold War developments, and use the new world order as a backdrop of his stories, he kept clinging to the old political landscape and tried to expand on it. It simply does not work. United States is the only Superpower left and no other countries will challenge it the way Soviet Union did. Jack Ryan was portrayed more like John F. Kennedy dealing with the Cuban missile crisis than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton fighting global terrorism while trying to shore up Medicare.\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is simply not compelling and impossible to believe. While I still enjoy his attention to details and the way he put together sentences and paragraphs, the overall story itself makes completely no sense. How could one enjoy the book when one opens a newspaper to see a completely different picture?After three progressively worse novels - \\"The Debt of Homor\\", \\"Executive Orders\\", and \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" - he finally came up with two new novels in which he seemed to have reversed his course. I haven't read either of those - perhaps I am still trying to muster the courage to do so after the recent disappointments. I do hope that both novels offer the same fascinating stories that his earlier novels do."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although I've been a fan of Mr Clancy for years now, I have to say that for the most part this particular book is just terrible. I made it about half way before giving up hope and began skipping over whole sections of dialog just to avoid the pain of slogging through the repetitive and inane character constructions. POTUS and FLOTUS, arrrggghhh...I generally read Clancy's books in the hope of gaining some insight as to the current high level military/industrial/political mindset at work in this country (USA). If the writing in this book reflects any sort of present Washington reality - we are in TROUBLE! The supposed influence and power that he attributes to the religious crazies was especially ridiculous.Mr. Clancy, if you happen to read this, I'd like to humbly offer two suggestions: (1) Get an editor! This book could have easily been cut by 30% and (2) drop the religious rants - they're annoying and absurd.A blind man could see through the rampant hypocrisy that pervades our western religious institutions. To assert even fictionally (as you do) that they might embody and give voice to some sort of primal moral imperative is laughable at best, and insulting at worst.A final thought directed at the non-existent Jack Ryan - if I had to read one more line describing how much you hated being the President, I'd pray that assassination would become the main plank in your party's reelection platform."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book should come with a warning on the backside, saying \\"If you are educated enough to read this, you will probably hate this book\\". I did like \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", though. Like Frederick Forsyth he has characters who are shallow as cardboard figures, but he made up for it by telling a good story which was technically accurate. Not in this book. His xenophobic, offensive and UNBELIEVABLY erratic descriptions of China were enough for me to throw it in the garbage can after 100 pages. I am not a Chinese, but having visited China as a mere tourist, I can't help but feel offended by all his nonsense. To recognize Tom Clancy's \\"today's China\\", you would at best have to go 30 years back in time. If Clancy had bothered to visit China, or even just open a book about China with pictures in it, he would have noticed that people do not walk around in uniform any more, women are not prohibited from wearing makeup or keeping their hair long, and you DO get other food than \\"revolting, garbage\\" in the shops and restaurants. I also have big problems believing that the Chinese have made a policy of throwing their new-born daughters in the village well, or that if someone has baby number two, it will automatically get a syringe with formaldehyde in the back of the head at the hospital. He actually goes as far as speculating if this will eventually mean the end of the Chinese race ! This kind of dribble is what you might expect verbally from an illiterate Billybob sitting on his porch cussin' dem commie bastuds, but not from a best-selling author. Throughout the book the more inferior nations, like China, Russia and Japan, are described with icy contempt, where the only thought seeming to occupy the minds of the inhabitants is how much better everything is in America. I thought this kind of complex-laden, offensive, inflated \\"us vs. them\\" propaganda disappeared with Nazi Germany. It is authors like today's Tom Clancy who make foreigners hate Americans. God help us when he starts writing about the Muslims !"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I read with interest all of the reviews trashing Clancy's most recent effort. Come on people, it is a Clancy book. You are going to get lots of techno babble and endless descriptions of people, their motives, weapons, guns, etc. If you buy a John Grisham book, you expect a book on the law. With Clancy you know what you are gettting, and I for one thought it was excellent.While I did find this book relatively predictable, I think most of that comes from being an experienced Clancy reader. While we may not have known what was coming in his earlier books, experence allows us to better predict what is coming.I found the book a wonderful read. I recently took a trip with my family to Hawaii, and found the book to be a wonderful diversion to the mindless movies the airlines show. I was not wild about the language used, but it did add an edgyness to the book. Hearing Jack Ryan cuss within earshot of VP Jackson's minister father did not seem overly realistic, but other than that I thought it was outstanding. The addition of the CIA agent using Victoria's Secret merchandise to infiltrate the inner circle of the Chinese politboro was an interesting twist.This is typical Clancy, which for some of us is exactly what we want and expect. When does his next book come out?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy again proves he's one of the best... Intriguing, great action and excellent hooks throughout."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ok, ok, it's not exactly The Illiad, but that's why we read these books, right? The Bear and the Dragon is a great ride, and it offers a perspective change: Russia as the good guy. If you like Clancy, you will love this, and if you are looking for literature, go some place else."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon is an outstanding book that upholds the high standards of Clancy's Jack Ryan series. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the book does start out a bit mythodically, however if you've read any of Clancy's books before one knows the action is coming eventually and you just enjoy the ride and character development.I was a bit dissapointed with the ending however, one gets the feeling that at just over 1100 pages Clancy's publisher possibly told him the book needed to end, even authors such as Tom Clancy must have to deal with overbearing publishers sometimes. The ending just seemed a bit too predictable, not in that the Americans and Jack Ryan would win, as he always does pretty much, but how it happend. I predicted the ending a couple pages ahead of time. Perhaps with this one Clancy got a little too Hollywood for his own good, at least subconciously thinking of what would make a good climactic movie ending. IMO Rainbow Six's role should have been increased in this book.While Clancy is known for his research, especially in details of military hardware, the dialogue in this book from the Russian and Chinese army officers just sometimes doesn't seem like it rings true. Sometimes it seems like an American putting American dialogue and American reactions into people of another culture. In my opinion his previous books had better and in my opinion probably more accurate dialogue for the Russian military officers than this one does. The Chinese dialogue, especially during the battle scenes, gave me the feeling that Clancy really doesn't know how the Chinese soldiers would react or the dialogue they'd use. I think Clancy if he didn't do so should have sat down with an expert on Chinese culture and their military in order to concieve more accurate responses in the dialogue.However, all in all this is a wonderful book. It's a pity that after his next book we may see the retirement of Jack Ryan. But unlike his first book on Clark without Ryan, I think Clancy's done a wonderful job of introducing his fans to Clark and Rainbow Six, which also is included in this book, and they'll carry on the legacy of wonderful Tom Clancy characters."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have never before read a book that was so long yet so very engaging. The political backstabbing, the military action, all were totally amazing. This is the third Clancy I have read, and I basically stopped breathing during the last two chapters. Incredibly intense, and powerful."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've enjoyed clancy's books in the past, and I generally thought his grasp of geopolitics and history to be adequate discounting the usual american bias and superficialness for a non-academic writer. At least, he gave the appearance of doing some research into the subject matter on which he was writing. But after reading the bear and the dragon, I was nothing short of outraged by clancy's apparent lack of knowledge on the subject of modern chinese society. His descriptions were cliche and out of touch. I am particularly disturbed by the rampant use of racial slurs, the repetitive use of the same metaphors and allusions and clancy's using of the characters to further his personal preachy neo-con perspective. It showed me that clancy did not bother to do any recent or indepth research into china's governmental/social structure, customs or its people for this book, and just plagiarized some fourth tier hollywood script writer's one size fits all chinese characterization model from the 1960's. Furthermore, this book has me start doubting the research clancy did on any of his past books and his supposed authority on any subject matter. i will never buy another clancy book again."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After seeing the four negatives on this review, I wanted to redo the review.The books overall, is very good. I do believe now I underrated the book.Presently I am reading his new book Dead or Alive, and I believe he has changed his writing style from previous books and I think it started with this book, I am seeing many similarities between this book (The Bear and The Dragon) and Dead or Alive. I do not know if Grant Blackwood has helped him on previous books or not, but this books seemed to start the new transition.Most peoples reviews on Clancy seem to start to go downhill from here, and I think Clancy may have changed his style to fit his change in characters, the biggest one is Jack Ryan being President, this shift seemed to have shifted his style and I do believe it is because when he writes about Jack Ryan he is writing about himself, so when Jack Ryan is not the main character, he shifts the writing. Which is what I think people are picking up.The storyline is very good and is a bit of a change from America/Russia to America/China and he does the transition very well. It is about an aggressive China which wants to flex its muscle by invading Russia, by removing Russia as a competitor and by seizing a massive reserve of Gold and oil in Siberia, China believes it can become the regional superpower and challenge America.The battle scenes is very similar to The Sum of all Fears, when America invades Saudi Arabia to repel the Iran/Iraq invasion. America invades Russia in order to repel China. The story itself is similar to Debt of Honor, Clark and Chavez deal with the situation in a similar manner.Overall, a good read, I enjoyed the book very much and it is the first book of the writing change that is in the following books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Jack Ryan's resolve as president is tried again when he faces the thing he fears most. China's leaders have thier mind set on propagating the biggest heist in history and are willing to do anything to keep themselves in power, even the unthinkable. President Ryan knows their every thought and has the brightest minds helping him, but can he avoid nuclear war! Clancy is a master of military suspense and proves it yet again with this unbelievable yet believable tale of national greed. Superbly written with a stunning ending."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Not as technical or as in depth as his previous novels, this book still kept me entranced and I couldn't put it down. The action is fast-paced (mostly), but as is usual for a Clancy book, it takes a while to get going. However, the first pages that other reviewers found could be tossed really build up the story. Not everything can be canned into quick and short bites. Sometimes things take a while to develop. In this case, one seemingly small event keeps snowballing into bigger and more serious problems and I feel Clancy does this well.Jack Ryan is the President (or Prime Minister) that every country should have - a real person, and not a politician who has never worked a real day in his life. Bravo to Clancy for creating a leader that real people can identify with.Keep 'em coming Tom! Eventually, Jack is going to have to retire - who's the next big character?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was a hard slow read at first but about 20% into the read I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's novel has flaws of redundancy and excessive length, but it is an excellent thriller using the latest technology as a backdrop. Most remarkable, it expresses philosophies that ring true and are shared by many Americans -- that Liberals will find politically incorrect and try to censor. Consider that in reading the negative reviews, and read it for yourself instead of allowing their censorship to succeed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews for this book; I found it to be a serious page-turner. This is my first Clancy novel and I can't wait to read the other books in the &quot;Ryan&quot; series. I was totally involved in the political intrigue that takes up most of this admittedly looong book, and the action at the end when all hell breaks loose was hard to tear myself away from.It is true there is a fantastic amount of rough language, and yes, this book is long enough to give Michener fans pause. (For me the long length is a plus: I am stuck on the bus 90 mins. a day and devour books, so am always having to buy or borrow new ones). With those caveats I can readily recommend this book. I look forward to giving it a more careful read after I have backtracked and read the earlier books in the series."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of Tom Clancey's books and from the reviews here I thought this one might be a little disappointing and finally let me read one of his books at leisure, taking my time with it. Boy was I wrong!! Just like all his Jack Ryan books, once you start you can't stop.It was a long book but I like that. Some say it's too long, but I am disappointed in the Op Center series and the like because they are too short, so I liked its length.The sex wasn't that bad, and would only make the most prudish of people blush. Not a book for children though. Plus it was an important part of the story line and served to demonstrate the repression in all areas of society.Some seemed to feel it was just a racist book, but I felt it admirably demonstrated the complete difference in cultures and how such total misunderstanding of other cultures can lead to disaster. Anyone who doesn't feel it was an accurate portrayal should just look back to the \\"letter of two sorry's\\" after the aircraft incident with China as a real life example of just how different our cultures are.Finally, this book follows up on and fits in with the plots of his previous books perfectly and is a logical extension of them. It was great to catch up with so many characters from previous books and see them in new roles.Great Book!! (...) Worth the time if you have a large enough block of time cause you wont want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Some people who have reviewed this book need to lighten up. I enjoyed it inspite of the swearing and racial slurs. (Believe it or not people do talk like that).The book offers a lot of political and historical facts as allways. The first half of the book does build a little slowly but it gets very interesting in the latter half of the book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been with Clancy since the beginning, and I feel this book is being unduly criticized. While it is not as gripping as Red October was, what author can compete against him/her self and always win? When I compare this book against the others being published at the same time, it stands up well. Now having said that, here is what is good and bad about this story:The good:The book is long. To those of us who savor Clancy reads, this is a good thing.Jack Ryan is president. He doesn't want to be there, and he is painfully naive, but he is doing a good job.Clancy paints Russia as our ally. As it should be.Clancy illuminates many social problems in China, which Americans need to be more aware of.As always, Clancy describes a lot of technogoodies which help us win wars.The bad:This book, more than any of Clancy's others, seems to spin off into TC's pulpit a bit too often. The beliefs held dear by Jack Ryan and his buddies are obviously flowing from the author's personal values. That is fine and good, but he could go a little lighter with the lectures about how rich people did and do have to work for their money, etc.....Although I love the spin-off characters from Rainbow Six, it seemed like Tom was reaching to include them in this story. Not all stories can be all things to all people...This book was long.... it could have been 100 pages shorter.Overall, I still give this book a thumbs up. Clancy on his worst day is still pretty darned good. And this isn't his worst day..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"After reading some other reviews I wonder if we read the same book. Clancy was true to form with this book. The plot had me hooked from the beginning. Clancy did a good job of illustrating the dangers and frustrations of governing and the benefits of a well funded military. His choice of China as the &quot;enemy&quot; in this book is rooted in the truth (probably more than people want to admit). I won't say this book is my favorite ever, but the only one's better were also written by Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is one great adventure story.It's timely. It's controversial. It's politically incorrect. What more could we want?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Top class reading! Tom Clancy shows the struggle for a President of the U.S. in day to day life, while creating a story which will not bore even the most sceptic! With the return of Jack Ryan and family to the book series, and Rainbow helping out, the reader is kept captive.Personally, I feel that this is Clancy's 2nd best next to Red October... if you like what he has done before, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"...although it doesn't have pictures.Life is too short to waste your time with this book... or to write a review about it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was very entertaining. The action was fast paced and the bureaucratic verbal exchanges in the book were interesting and captivating. For hardcore Clancy readers Jack Ryan was one of the main characters in the book, and the book also included the legenday counterterror group Rainbow Six and its commander, John Clark. The war parts of the book were accurate and chilling as were the political parts. I found this book very hard to put down and I would recommend it to anyone new or old to Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I guess I read Tom Clancy books for pure entertainment. So many reviewers seem to be taking it as a text book for global politics. This is a work of fiction people.As for Jack Ryan turning into a wimp, I don't see it that way. Who would want to be in his position. Who wouldn't feel doubt about being able to be a worthy leader of the free world. I think that everything Jack Ryan does in this book just proves that he is an ordinary man, and that is what makes him a great hero.On the issue of profanity, if someone looks up and sees a nuclear missle headed straight for them and doesn't say f__k, or s__t they would be, to me, as unbelievable as James Bond.I'm going to make this next observation as simple as possible, If anyone out there believes that it is ok to stick a needle in the head of a new born child and kill it before it can breath, then I guess I can see how you would be offended by this book.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was the very end. I agree, there could have been at least 200 more pages just to put some finishing touches on the story lines. I couldn't get enough of this book and would take another 1000 pages if I could. Keep writing Mr. Clancy. Those of us who know the difference between fiction and text books will keep reading."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"With 700+ reviewers before me, I have nothing new to say. The book was an utter waste of time for me."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"......I couldn't wait to finish this thing. Oops, I didn't finish it; I skipped to the end (that was a mistake too, as it was horrendous) after reading 800 plus pages of unbearable nonsense. Simply could not take it any more!...Where to begin, oh where to begin. Ok, 1000 plus pages? Easily could have been 600: enough said. Next, I became so sick of President Ryan crying every 40 pages about how much he hates his job. What a bore! And \\"Japanese sausage\\"? Is Mr. Clancy trying to appeal to 11 year old boys?... The title of the chapters, at times, had nothing to do with the content of the chapter. There were typos all over the place. I could go on and on, but enough is enough. I just want to put this memory behind me and reflect on the other books Mr. Clancy has turned out in the past.Why two stars? Parts of the story were riviting.I hope that Mr. Clancy reads these reviews and takes them to heart. Let's move on to something new. Please no more President Ryan, former super-spy.Oh well, maybe next time. That's all."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yesterday, I finished \\"The Bear and The Dragon, \\" by Tom Clancy. I must say I was disappointed. Tom's Clancy's \\"Jack Ryan world\\" departs further from the world we live in with each passing book. Tom Clancy's first few books were masterpieces. But his last few novels have lost the original \\"Clancy spark.\\" Where the \\"Red October\\" was a technically accurate masterpiece, \\"The Bear and The Dragon,\\" takes extreme liberties with China's military capabilities. I know this only because I recently read a report on the subject by the Brookings Institute. Where \\"Red October\\" tells a detailed story in 450 pages, \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" is over 1000 pages long, and that's in hard cover! In \\"The Bear and The Dragon,\\" over three-fourths of the book are used to give background information and the setting. I would suggest that this could have been done more effectively (and certainly less boring) if the ratios were reversed, one-forth for the setting, and three-fourths for the conflict. \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" also lacks originality as its plot is almost identical to \\"Debt of Honor.\\" It has the same elements except that Japan is replaced with China. I sincerely wish that Tom Clancy would replace Jack Ryan with a new character and start the series over in today's world. He should go back to the 500-700 page spy novels and leave behind the outlandishly premised war books of 1000 pages or more. Its very difficult to write a book of such length and keep the reader glued the book all the way through. However I'm not sure if any of these suggestions will ever come to pass. By this time Tom Clancy has such a loyal following of readers, he could write a how-to manual about doing computer programming in Arabic and millions would undoubtedly line up to buy it."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Like so many of his recent works, this starts with a great story premise and his unparalled attention to detail is there as always, but falls flat in the climax. Wars are not so perfectly conducted with no errors by the home team. The heroes, much as I'd like to know and be friends with them personally, lack the flaws of human nature that we all have to one degree or another. Rather than a crashing crescendo of a climax that builds to the final bar of music, this simply rolls down with the 'good guys' winning everything; an unlikely scenario for the large 'limited engagement' this is. I'll continue to read Clancy's Jack Ryan &amp; Paul Hood series because I like their character and ethic, but hope Clancy does something to make the endings more realistic."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I thought this was a really good book. I finished it within 5 days I was so engrossed in it. It is a little boring at parts but thats a norm in Clancy books because of all the detail and length in his books. The climax at the end was great and inpredictable. Debt of Honor or Without Remorse are better but Clany is getting old and running out of ideas. I would put this book around #6 or so out of the 10 or so Clany novels. Better: Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, Without Remorse, Sum of all Fears, Clear and Present Danger. Worse: Cardinal of the Cremlin, Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Where to begin? At first I thought that the reading would be fast paced and exciting. What did I get? SLOW, over dramatic, tedious and sometimes distracting illustrations of the setting. I am a big Clancy fan and this book disappointed me.First, the many spelling errors and grammatical mix-ups where annoying. Did he have any editors, proofreaders and the ever-important spellchecker? Where was the effort in writing this book? Or was it easy money?The simplistic plot and over dramatic descriptions led me to &quot;skim&quot; over many pages. I did not want to waste my time reading the many pages of &quot;calamity&quot; written into this book. Where there should have been more drama was in the ending not in the middle of the book. The ending was comparable to one of those movies forced under budget by having an abrupt, simple, and unexciting closure.I hope that Mr. Clancy will take the time to rectify his mistakes in the next piece."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you have read any of Clancy's other books, you know he cannot do characters (or dialogue, and he has trouble with plot). Jack Ryan, Mrs. Dr. Ryan, the Secret Service, the National Security Advisor, Robby the Vice President, et al., are all thin, narrow, and often troubled people (Ryan hates his job, Dr. Ryan apparently has no rounds at the hospital, the Secret Service agent has morningsickness, etc.).So, does one expect better than that which has gone before? One would think that in 1,000 pages Clancy might be learning, but he is not. Too bad. Looks like I'm not learning, either, because I read all 1,000 pages, so who's the fool?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While I generally enjoyed the book, it WAS overly long. The numerous interwoven plots are becoming progressively more difficult for me (and perhaps only me) to keep track of. I was rather surprised to see the anti-choice and anti-Clinton flags waved. One minor item. I don't think that the Red Baron became a multiple ace flying a tri-motor! a tri-plane, perhaps, but not a tri-motor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Predicable or not, I have enjoyed the TC novels so far. This one however gave me the feeling that the various plot lines were all written by different people. The editing in parts left me confused about where the plot was trying to go and several plot lines droned on for several hundred pages only to be left hanging. I was in the last hundred pages still waiting for the Rainbow Troopers to do their thing. After lugging this enormous tome around on the subway for the past month, I don't think I will be reading another TC novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I love the Jack Ryan series of books and eagerly awaited every new one. I have always found them to provide an excellent combination of story complexity, military strategy and technology, and interesting characters. This last book provides none of this. It is a single dimensional story with a totally predictable ending. In elevating all his characters to president and associates, Tom Clancy has written a book about politics rather than a military book. And in doing so Tom reveals his right wing attitudes e.g., Tom is very obviously anti-abortion, which is ok to a point but he pushes his views down your throat for pages on end (14 pages devoted to 2 priests berating China's One Child Policy!). And how many times were we reminded that Mao did it with 12 year old girls? Once would have been enough! As for his characters, Jack Ryan doesn't like being president so he winges about it for the first 200 pages, and surrounds himself with &quot;real world&quot; people that have to continually use foul language to make a point. As for the war that was eventually fought, totally predictable use of technology, no real strategy, just reactive tactics to what was happening. Oh, and if the US hadn't happened to get spy reports from a top level Chinese Minister's secretary (who did it for sex), we probobly would have lost the war. Obviously time for Tom and Jack to retire. Long live Jack Ryan, his series is dead."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The worst of the Jack Ryan series. None of the usual suspense, Jack &amp; his circle know everything that's going to happen before it happens because of a conveniently placed spy. There's none of the usual multiple sub-plots to speak of, just the impending conflict between Russia &amp; China. And even that's gets resolved in just the last few pages via the now popular 3-4 day war. The usual cast we've grown to know are all burdened with bit parts that really contribute nothing to the story, with a couple of them placed in highly improbable/unsatisfying positions. It's all the more disappointing because it appears to be the last of a very interesting and entertaining series. Definitely Clancy's weakest effort."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As Jack Ryan ascends politically, the farther he is removed from what makes a Tom Clancy book readable -- the action. Consequently, presenting Ryan the statesman forces Clancy to actually write dialogue, a skill with which he is clearly ill-adept and uncomfortable. The stilted, repetitious prose is unbelievable in the true sense of that word -- i.e., a husband and wife (Jack and Cathy) or a man and his best friend (Jack and Robbie)do not have to provide an extended factual foundation for every thought they wish to convey to each other (for example, Jack simply need not say to his wife: &quot;Since you are a surgeon, I know that you care for people, and therefore this situation impacts you more deeply . . . blah, blah, blah . . . finally, here's the point&quot;). No wonder the book soars past 1000 pages, it seems that no one edited it! It is practically insulting that Clancy does not trust his readers to understand and interpret the complexities of his characters, especially considering that most of the readers of this book are surely not Clancy first-timers. Substantively, Clancy's use of Jack Ryan to espouse Clancy's own half-thought, wrongheaded political and social values is tiresome, and makes me like this character less and less. I remember not being able to finish &quot;Executive Orders&quot; the first time through since I was so turned off by its &quot;Clancyism.&quot; Then a friend suggested that maybe I just wasn't reading it fast enough. Probably true. After all, the sooner you get through pap, the sooner you get to the action -- then, as usual, the pages really start turning."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I got 200 pages into the book and could not go any farther. Even enduring a cross Atlantic flight with nothing to read was better then reading anymore. I have always found Clancy's books riveting but this one seemed to be nothing more then a venue for his political views. That wouldn't be so bad if there was believable characters or an interesting plot (Maybe it comes later, but I doubt it). It's time to kill of Jack Ryan he has become such a stereotype character he's not salvageable. My recommendation is save the money and read something interesting."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Did Tom Clancy, the author of Clear and Present Danger and Hunt for Red October, realy write all these pages of endless, bland, conflict-less dialogue-scenes from offices, bedrooms, offices, bars and then more offices, where people who all speak like CNN correspondents preach to each other about issues they already agree on ?It is probably a fact (like it is stated in the book) that most crimes are solved by accidents in real life. But this is not real life. If I wanted real life I would have bought a true crime or true espinogae book. Tom Clancy has often chided Hollywood for not getting the facts right. But at least they entertain (well, sometime they do), and that is the main function of fiction.Speaking of facts: A PC with notes from highly confidential talks between members of the politbearau is 1) connected to the internet (!) 2) The secretary using the machine can install new un-chekked software herself on this PC (!). I just don't beleive it !Will the real Tom Clancy please come back !"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy eventually offers his usual tense, involving, techno-fare at the end of the book. To get there, however, Clancy forces the reader to wade through reams of tedious, repetitive, and shallow drivel. TC's command of the the technology of warfare stands in sharp contrast with his command of almost anything human. The Chinese are portrayed as unimaginative drudges led by Klingon-like Maoists whose only relaxation appears to be sexual abuse of the office help. When he isn't swearing like a sailor with his old military buddies, whining about how much he hates his job, or amateurishly plunging the world into nuclear war, Jack Ryan spends most of his time bumbing cigarettes and hoping his wife won't find out because she is a surgeon and might emasculate him. Apparently, no joke or shallow observation is too lame for repetition after repetition.TC needs stick with what he does best, because, if this book is any example, he can't do much else."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is starting to feel his oats a little bit. I suppose when you have enough money to buy the Minnesota Vikings, you have some justification. Unfortunately, his writing is starting to suffer because of it. In his earlier novels the main character, Jack Ryan, was an honorable, decisive, and likeable hero figure. In this latest story, Ryan has turned into a whining, foul mouthed, reactionary arch conservative. Clancy has combined the worst traits of both liberals (whining) and conservatives (reactionary), and made them a part of Ryan. Simply put, I do not like or respect the character of Jack Ryan any longer. As he is the main focus of Clancy's major novels, this puts a serious drag on his writing. Tom Clancy is telling a story of what HE would do if he were given a blank check US presidency, not what Jack Ryan would do. Mr. Clancy is not alone in his wish to make Washington DC what he'd like it to be, but tell it in an autobiography, not in a major novel people are paying [$] a piece for. At least then we'd know what we are getting in to.His telling of stories which fit in with the modern day world is still first rate. This time, a cornered and aggressive China is lashing out against a United States government that is FINALLY taking a hard line with them. The focus is on just how far these people will go to hold onto their power. This book presents one case for what could happen. Clancy has always found a way to present his ideas in a believable, and often unsettling manner. He still has this gift working at full potential. I have seen many complaints about secondary character development, but I found it adequate, though not stellar. Many people have said that they don't act the same as in the earlier novels, but like real people, they change as they get older. I suppose the same could be said about Jack Ryan, but he is the lead character, and a good writer must keep his reader interested and empathizing with him. Instead, Clancy has made himself the main character of the book. This was not a good idea.Another problem Clancy has is he has painted himself into a corner with Ryan as President. Before, he could tell exciting stories without reverting to the United States going to war. Now, that's the only story he can tell, as it's the only story worthy of a major Presidential level crisis. In earlier novels, the main thrust of the story could be a terrorist attack, or smuggling out a spy, or running a rogue anti-drug operation. All he can do at this point is tell about war with increasingly powerful enemies. He has now written a story about war with China. Where can you go from there? I don't think even hard-core Clancy fans will believe that the US will get into 4 shooting wars with one president.In summary, Clancy's strengths are still very much evident with regards to his storylines. His minor character development is alright, and it's good to see how some old friends are progressing through life. He comes out with some ideas that should be made into US law (like his wonderful 'Trade Reform Act'). He also gives a look into what he would do with the reins of government in his hands (a frightening thought), and something that has no business being in a novel we all paid [$] and waited really four years for. The book IS worth reading, but Tom, if you're going to do another one, tell us how Jack Ryan would be President, not Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy needs an editor who will cut much of the fluff. This book was mailed in without much time, effort or thought in producing a real book. While their is an interesting story within this book,it is presented in a more unrealistic manner than in other Clancy stories.All in all not worth the time necessary to read this novel."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"&quot;What Happened?&quot; sums up my thoughts after finishing &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot;. What happened to some of the characters at the end, the editing, the plot, Tom Clancy as an interesting author?I don't want to rehash what many other reviewers have already written - but come on - hire an editor with a #2 pencil &amp; a good eraser, cut about 400 pages and maybe a decent book will emerge."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I haven't read all of Tom Clancy's books but have got familier with the Ryan, Clark characters in the last few ones and got to like them. It was very difficult to get through the first half of this book and found it very repetitive on Ryan's (Clancy's??) political views. It was getting very annoying to read Ryan's ongoing whining about how he doesn't want to be the President. I am a Chinese and as I read the conversation parts of these Chinese characters, it is not all that farfecthed, the pharases they use are actually quite realistic (besides mixing up the language of Cantonese and Mandarin). But the mixing up of the difference between Chinese and Japanese social etiquettes (Chinese don't bow to one another as Japanese do)more than a few times does annoy me.The second half of the book does start to become exciting to read and as a matter of fact, I couldn't put it down... only when I get to the end, it was very disappointing.I agree with most readers that it dragged too long. Too repeitive on certain subjects (moral/ethical/political views) Just as it was getting interesting towards the end, it was abrubtly ended.I hope Mr Clancy would read all the readers' comments and do a better job next time. He had created some interesting characters in the past and would be nice to write some good stories about them."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read all of the previous Tom Clancy Jack Ryan novels, and I found this to be the most disappointing. It took him 500 pages to describe to us that the US had an agent in China and that agent was getting laid, and that someone tried to kill the former KGB head. Does Clancy get paid by the word??? By the time I got to the actual battle portion of the novel (about page 850) I just wanted this damn novel to end. And the ending was rushed and much too quick. Clearly all of those early pages of writing wore Mr. Clancy out."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Not Mr Clancy's best work. Until 3/4 of the way through the book it felt like a first draft. Then he got to the bit that he was interested in (the tech war), and the old 'Clancy Magic' began to take hold. I just can't work out how the novel in its present state ever made it to the printers. Maybe Tom couldn't be bothered to re-read and edit it, but surely an editor or sub-editor somewhere must have read it through once -mustn't they? Maybe they just skipped the boring, long-winded, poorly-written bits. Maybe I should have too! If this was the first Clancy I'd read, I wouldn't have persisted past the first 200 pages, and I certainly wouldn't have bothered with his earlier work-which would've been my loss. On a technical note, I don't believe that the C5 has ever been known to its crews as the 'Aluminum Cloud' (I think that was the B-36 from WWII) Isn't it an 'Aluminum Overcast'? If that little factoid is wrong, how much bother did he go to researching anything else. (Certainly his descriptions of Sydney in RAINBOW-6 were mistake-ridden and vague)This book is not the worst I've read -but it falls a long way short of the best. I couldn't recommend it to anyone. Please Tom! Bigger is not better! Better is better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It's mainly OK because there were things that happened in this story that we didn't need to know about. I picked this book up in August of 2000 but didn't really get around to reading it until recently.Tom Clancy could make this, and many previous books, much better if he would trim a few hundred pages of nonsense the reader isn't interested in as well as the techincal gobble-de-gook most readers don't undertstand, unless you're in the armed forces.However, toward the end, it does get exciting. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, but I thought for sure a nuclear war was going to erupt. It probably still will in the future books to come.I will say this though. Are we really expected to believe that after everything that occured, the United States in real life would just say &quot;Oh, forget about it&quot; to another country that nearly blew up a major city of ours? I think not.Tom, I'm sorry, but I think it's getting to be time to either kill off Jack Ryan, or retire him. He was a much better man when he was still in the CIA. Being POTUS doesn't give him much freedom, as we discover in this story."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a loyal Clancy reader and I count the days(or should I say years) between each book. This book follows in the basic Clancy mold. However I felt that this was not his best work.There was very little in the way of action, the bad guys did not do much of anything until the very end, and even then it was not much at all. It was mostly one sided,would of been nice to see a bit of action. We all know that Clancy is quite capable of that(Red Storn Rising for example). The worst part by far was the ending, what the heck was that with Ryan? This was a fairly big letdown from his previous book, Rainbow Six. I hope the next novel will have more of the Rainbow crew. Fans of Clancy will find this one to be a decent book, but will know that it is not one of his best."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Normally I begin a Tom Clancy novel resigned to the task of slogging through the initial 250 pages of exposition, knowing the story will eventually grab me by the throat and drag me through a wild ride of high-tech action, political intrigue, and vivid characters. I waited...and I waited...but it just never happened.I have five essential gripes with this book:1) How many countries are we going to go to war with? This time China, last time Iran, before that it was Japan. I can't wait for the next book, \\"Polar Bear Rising\\" in which we send stealth fighters to bomb the bejeesus out of Canada. The lack of a cold war has obviously emptied Clancy's bag of ideas.2) I really do believe that a President who whines that much about how much he hates being president should be either shot or impeached. Okay, Tom, the best politicians are the blue collar everyman types who reluctantly accept the burden of office for the greater good. We get it. We don't need to hear our otherwise brave hero whine about being stuck in the job in every scene like an eight year-old forced to go to summer school.3) There's nothing wrong with a political novel. There's nothing wrong with a novel espousing political beliefs. But if it's written by Tom Clancy I expect him to understand his subject as well as he understands spies and military hardware. His observations were the thin, vapid pablum of talk radio and his political scenarios were tenuous to say the least.4) This guy is the best selling novelist in America. Why do all his characters (even some of the Chinese ones) talk like potty-mouthed factory workers? Characters like Jack Ryan are suddenly so profane and vulgar as to become unsympathetic. I've seen Clancy do better and I'm amazed a novel that took two years to write reads like it was slapped together a week before he sent it to his editor.5) The plot was entirely predictable, the resolution being visible hundreds of pages in advance. I remember hating Steven Segal movies because he struts through the film kicking the snot out of everyone and never faces an opponent he can't humiliate with the wave of a hand. This book struck me the same way. I kept waiting for the agent in China to get discovered, but everything went according to plan. I kept waiting for China to pull some ace out of the hole in Siberia, but everything went according to plan. I kept waiting for the spy who tried to kill Golovko to shake his surveillance or try something unexpected, but everything went according to plan.I could go on, complaining about repeated phrases and poor sentence structure. (If I read one more time about our Navy giving them \\"one hell of a bellyache...) I just expected so much more from an author whose work I've loved so very much in the past. The Bear and the Dragon was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"With &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; I became a Tom Clancy fan. I agreed with all of the glowing reviews. And the next several books (and movies) also entertained me.However, after 50 pages of &quot;The Bear and The Tiger&quot; I concluded that Mr. Clancy must be getting paid by the word. After 183 pages I realized that he is trying to gain favor with the Catholic Church. His constant moralizing and preaching so clouds and distracts from the story line that one has trouble keeping one's place. He has Jack Ryan, who should personify competance, whining, and being bitter.If the book were edited to @250 to 300 pages it might be very enjoyable. Unfortunately it is 1028 pages of mostly preaching, moralizing, and patronizing text. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been an avid Tom Clancy since Hunt for Red October, but I'm afraid I've read my last of his works. I expected a technically-laced thiller, what a got was a conservative diatribe. I hate being preached to by extremists on both sides via the endless media blitz throughout the course of a normal day, let alone during my leisure time. I had to endure right-wing editorials on abortion, labor unions (they're actually conservatives and just don't know it), social security, the environment, tobacco (it's not actually bad for you unless you drop a lit one in your lap while driving), to name a few issues. We finally got the 'Tom Clancy' we all know and love in the last 200 pages. But even this scenario is getting old. While being relieved the editorializing ceased briefly I got the distinct feeling I had read this before. The story was ridiculous, implausible, and tortuous to read. The Sum of All Fears left me breathless at the end. The Bear and the Dragon had me breathing a sigh of relief that it was over. Please Tom, save the editorials for the papers, get back to writing novels."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is the book that will finally force me to stop buying Tom Clancy.There are only two principal problems with \\"The Bear and the Dragon:\\" the writing and the story. One gets the sense that Clancy writes in a fashion that would have made the old Soviet Union proud: pound out twenty pages of production per day no matter what the quality. How else to explain ten pages of verbatim sermons given by two tertiary characters - an event that barely moves the story forward? I'm willing to accept some clunkiness - if you've read other Clancy books, you expect it just like you expect the clear good guy / bad guy dichotomy - but over 1,000 pages of it was unbearable.Even worse, there's nothing really exciting or surprising going on. The plot is telegraphed well in advance, including the grand finale threat to the US. Even if the page count were chopped in half, there would be no avoiding this uninspired plotting. For the last thirty percent of the book I found myself flipping pages, wishing it were over so I could move on to something better.If you like this genre, James H. Cobb and Larry Bond do it much better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy ever since Hunt For Red October and I have to say that this is by far his worst book ever. The plot was so predictable I knew the end before I'd gotten halfway thru. The characters are beginning to resemble cardboard cutouts, without anything to make them human. Maybe Tom just needs to take a break, much like he had Jack Ryan do between Sum Of All Fears and Debt Of Honor. A couple of years to recharge his mental batteries and regain his edge."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a person who studied foreign policy and military affairs in college, I always found Tom Clancy's books extremely interesting and factually accurate. Unfortunately, while he's keeping up with technological changes, this book was incredibly slow and much more overtly political. I agree with other reviewers about the unkind view of the Chinese in this one too. If you are new to Clancy's work, skip this book and go back to read the Cold War classics. I never did read the last 30 pages of the book -- I simply stopped caring what happened."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"At about page 150 or so, thinking I could never get through the thing, I put the book aside. But, sadly, a couple of weeks later, I picked it up again. Now, I'm sorry I did. I've slogged through to page 460, a few pages, a few chapters, a night. But I can't stand any more punishment. I quit! Anyway, it's getting dangerous. I keep falling asleep under this huge, heavy book and I'm afraid it will fall on my face one night and break my nose.I had read and liked Clancy's novels up to Rainbow Six which was bad. But this is much worse. Repetitious, meandering, and filled with so much military jock-sniffing and political bloviating that it seems more like a parody of Clancy than Clancy himself. In a word -- boring. Make that three words -- boring, boring, boring.Unless you are completely in agreement with Clancy's politics and worldview and you have an absolutely insatiable appetite for having them shoved down your throat over and over again in every possible permutation do not even consider buying this terrible book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm on my third try with this book. The first two times I stalled out because I got so damned tired of Clancy's right-wing rants intruding on the story (why pause a military/political thriller to have the predictable Ryan deliver a predictable diatribe on, of all things, abortion?).All Clancy's strengths are here: ability to keep straight innumerable plotlines, mastery over vast quantities of information, &quot;insider&quot; info on how governmenr and the military work, a good over-all picture of the world we live in.Unfortunately, Clancy's weaknesses are here as well, the principal one being that Clancy/Ryan simply cannot grasp the concept of an honest difference of opinion. Either you share his narrow right-wing view of things or you are a gullible commie dupe/sympathizer. Ryan wins every argument and is never wrong. How realistic is that? The world Clancy/Ryan live in is very small and artificially black-or-white, us-or-them. And why is it that he LOVES the Russians while hating everyone else (non-whites like Japan, China and, mysteriously, India)?The only way to read this book, and probably all others to come, is to ignore what Clancy/Ryan thinks and concentrate on what he/they do. Like so many other authors, Clancy has become more pompous and self-important as he has become more successful. And if he would cut down on the sermonizing he could cut his books in half."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"One of Clancy's weakest efforts. First 800 pages are full of sophomoric dialogue of characters who think and speak in the same voice. Full of racist terms for Asians but not other races or ethnicities."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy's THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON debacle stands out in the sad decline of an author who doesn't write novels so much as squeeze blood from turnips. Reading Clancy is no longer to be introduced to a gripping story - the only appeal of techno-thrillers - but rather to be exposed to a sterile fantasy world of atrocious dialogue, bad similes, bizarre racial slurring, and a mind-numbing plot of little content. Throw in the puerile blatherings of the Ryan character's internal monologue, and I actually felt awkward on Clancy's behalf.The plot--what little there is--is an artificial mockery of what Clancy gave us with RED OCTOBER and CARDINAL. His characters have always been tedious, but the sad schmuck that is our dear President Ryan is one of the most ridiculous this side of an Ayn Rand novel. The Hero President's speech is delivered in the most contrived \\"aw shucks\\" attitude it becomes almost embarrassing. Ryan's self-indulgent odes to himself and his monotonous world are supposed to impress the reader with his noble detachment from the filth of politics, but instead we become teeth-grindingly tired of his pompous self-directed homages after about the ... oh ... thirtieth time. I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone read this book, but if you do, have no fear in skipping the often multi-page internal monologue of the characters Clancy uses to deliver a vapid political ideology, you will miss nothing of the rather elusive (yet predictable) plot. The characters are only able to communicate to each other in clich&eacute;, and each adopt an attitude of the most obnoxious condescension to each other that it is impossible to believe they would be able to interact civilly. The real target of the characters' snooty explanations of \\"reality\\" is really the reader, who ought to rightly feel offended by Clancy's repetitive and very exhaustible source of ideas.His treatment of the Chinese is one of the weirdest and most uncomfortable aspects of the book. Clancy historically has nothing but denigration for his \\"tree-huggers\\" and any media figures unless they submit to the bland ideology of our heroes. There is little but contempt for those who disagree with him, and he uses his characters to engage in their dismissal through epithets, rather than any kind of encounter with their ideas. However, the insistent reference of his American heroes to the Chinese as \\"slant-eyes,\\" \\"klingons,\\" \\"chinks\\" etcetera is not a man challenging PC oppressions, which is what he thinks he is doing. Rather, Clancy is presenting heroes who suffer from the same dogmatisms and closed-loop learning patterns with which he stereotypes his absurd and self-gratifying sense of Chinese psychology. The blind superiority he mocks in his villains is the mirror image of the self-validating world he creates.However, the outcome is never in doubt, no one of any consequence suffers. What little action there is is telegraphed to us in a routinized recitation of glorious acts. If fact, though a couple of F-14s get shot down, it is once again a bloodless and triumphant ride to glory for Clancy's America. It's very tedious, since Clancy is skillful at showing he has read a lot of Popular Science articles, and not at much else."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Apparently 1 star is the lowest ranking you can give. This is a real waste of time. I wasted enough to read over 200 pages. No plot. No character development. Just a continual summary rehash of the events of previous books. Plenty of Clancy's ultra-conservative political viewpoint expounded from many characters - mostly Ryan. And if you didn't get the utterly predictable and unimaginative drift of Clancy's social wisdom the first time, don't despair, he will repeat it several times. This is the product of a writer who has obviously lost his muse, forgotten his audience, and delights only in listening to himself drone on."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I started reading the Bear and the dragon as I was traveling in China. Someone should tell Mr Clancy that today's China is very different from the 80's USSR... I go to China quite often on business and nothing looks slightly familiar to what was described in this book. Government workers do not go to work in gray Mao style suits.....Every thing except thir state of mind is wrong. Anyway that being said, as I read the first chapter, I knew how the book would end up. The plot is predictible, Jack Ryan thoughts are predictible, the use of technology is not even as good as it used to be in the former Ryan series. What a disapointment, Mr Clancy is resting on his laurels trying to pass out his political agenda. Instead of writting mediocre books why doesnot he run for office. He seems to have all the answers..... The book is poorly documented, poorly written, it seems to me that Mr Clancy should retire with Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is probably the last Tom Clancy book I will buy. I have been a fan for over 10 years and have loved all his other books. But this one was very dissapointing. The character development is weak, there is very little action, the amount of boring scene descriptions is staggering, and the political soapbox is obvious. He has reduced Jack Ryan to a boring politician. I have been reading this book for over a week and have only gotten about a quarter of the way through. I doubt very seriously if I will even finish it. I never thought I would come across a Tom Clancy book that I couldn't care less about reading. I think he has lost his touch."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am (was?) a fan of Tom Clancy. Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games are superb books. But this.. Is it really written by Clancy? Is it so incredibly B-A-D. And the China portrayed in this book is right out of the 70s. People don't call themselves 'comrade' anymore Mr Clancy. Don't buy this boring book, it just drags on and on, it took me forever to finsih it. Reading the Sears catalog or TV Guide is far more interesting."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Just a few quick words and then I am outa here:1) For years Clancy has been eating away at me with his favoritism of Ph.D.'s over Master's over Bachelor's over no degree. Clancy has always ignored the enlisted man, and any use of them is reserved for those who go on to receive a doctorate from M.I.T. Until now that would be my only real gripe. It was a complaint that I was almost always willing to overlook, because as you know, every enlisted man in the military goes on to get a Doctrate and work as a consultant for the DOD, at least I and all of my friends did.2) I found myself skipping forward to the one of how many plot lines(?) I even wanted to keep reading.3) We all know you are busy, Tom, but why did you even bother with this one? Ryan would have been much better off stepping down and letting the democratic process run its course---much more believable, too. Especially that part about staying behind for the emolation of Washington D.C. Next time it will probably be aliens or some terrible subterranean monster. But then again, those movies have already been made.4) I have always known that Clancy books depend somewhat on serendipity and chance, but talk about pulling the Quantum needle out of the Relativity haystack, we have a better shot of discovering the secret to cold fusion than all of the elements of this novel have finding each other. Refer to Mark Twain's essay, Fenimore Cooper's Litarary Offenses in regards to the possibility of miracles in fiction.5) Perhaps Tom's next book can send the boys from Rainbow to find the purpose of writing this book, besides a paycheck."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have loved Tom Clancy and all his books since very early in his career but this book is terrible. As if we didn't know it from the last book, Jack Ryan hates being President. In case you didn't get it the last time, Ryan tells you about 200 times again in this book. We all know that Tom likes describing military equipment and proceeds to do so with mind-numbing detail. In the first 500 pages only two events happen, the rest is pretty much as I have already stated. This might have been a decent book by taking out about 600 - 700 pages of filler, i.e., Ryan hates his job, military equipment descriptions, Clancy's discourse of countries he either likes or hates, etc. Tom we know you are an ultra-conservative right-wing just slightly to the left of fascism but do we have to drone on forever just to fill in a book? Are you being paid by the word?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I used to enjoy Clancy books for its engaging plot and ability to make you wonder if something like that could really happen. This new book is nothing but trash and while most of his writing has been fiction, it would appear that Clancy has delved into the realms of fantasy. While he has always stereotyped to a pointdifferent race and nations, this book is basically a list of his perceived problems that people who are not red blooded American have. His racism is evident and his story is lacking. While I the basic plot of China invading Russia for resources follows from his earlier book and could have been a very interesting story, it appears Clancy just didn't try. I use to really enjoy his books, but this will probably be the last one I buy."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have also read all of his books but it took what seemed like days to get through the first half. Once it heated up it was very good. Think it should have been 500 pages even though I LOVE long books. But they have to hold my interest. Really do enjoy all the old characters coming into play again. I will continue to read Mr. Clancy's books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy appears to have decided not to put a great deal of effort into his latest work, borrowing liberally from one of his first efforts, _Red Storm Rising_. Unfortunately, this book doesn't quite match up to that earlier work. This is a long book, not just in the number of pages, but in the feel. Unlike most of his past efforts, it's in no way a page turner, but instead you read on simply to get to the end. And when you get there, be prepared for disappointment. After setting up an interesting premise, Clancy wraps everything up more neatly than most Christmas presents. The only plus to the work is the characters long time Clancy readers have grown to know so well--they remain generally the same, and are fun to follow, but their talents could be much better used. Perhaps it's time for Clancy to start a new series, as he appears to be tired of dreaming up new problems for Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The book takes an inordinate amount of time to build to the climax, then it is as if Clancy realized he had used 990 pages and had to end the book in the last 30.When you sit through the first part of the book, you expect the story to be completed.Mr Clancy should realize that &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, easily his best, ran only 387 pages in the hardcover edition."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Hey Tom, do you think you can make your next book move a little slower? I can't keep up with this one. I'm at 300 pages now, and I think maybe a week has passed in your book. Slow down, man, I'm getting white knuckles.Oh, and while you're at it, could you please throw a few more four-letter words into the text the next time around? You didn't quite fill every page with them. You came pretty close, but not quite. Better luck next time in your endeavors to make all of your characters pottymouths, including the President. Oh, and a few more sexual references too, so next time I won't feel disappointed when there isn't some overly-descriptive account of a sleazy activity going on.But I must commend you. It sure was a good idea to fire that editor of yours. After all, conciseness, cohesiveness, reader interest, and plot flow can all take a flying leap, because, hey, you're Tom Clancy, and you HAVE to know what is best for your book by now, don't you?I have every hope that your next book will surpass this one in length, which is an important goal. Because, the longer the book, the more valuable literary substance it will obviously contain. So try for 2500 pages next time. We fans will love it, and it will give us the opportunity to pump up those triceps while we're at it, and between reading sessions, it can double as a footstool.Lastly, next time you need to drop more obvious hints about your political leanings into your story. You were way too subtle this time around. Next time, devote a whole 50-page chapter to the words \\"Vote Republican!,\\" repeated over and over in 72-point type. That should get the message across to those who didn't quite get it in the current book.Follow this advice for the next book and you'll have a real winner!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What were you thinking, Tom Clancy? At 10028 pages this book is much too heavy for the &quot;I only have time to read before I go to sleep crowd&quot;. My husband loves Clancys books, but holding THIS tome aggravated his carpal tunnel syndrome causing the book to fall on his face cutting off his respiration and might have resulted in unlawful book death had I not detected the lack of snoring. He refuses to pick the book up again, so we will have to make do with the audio version. My advice is to take S. Kings advice: If the book is too big---make it a serial---or, make it part one and part two--if the story is good, we will be there to buy the book. At this size, The Bear and the Dragon is too dangerous to read!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Most of the complaints seem to be about the lack of editing, but what about the usual attention to detail. The length would have been no big deal if it was of the usual quality. Ususally, Clancy is rock solid on his facts, some of which were wrong, and you end up learning way more than you wanted to about something, not this time. It was more the quality of OP-Center books. Not too much thought. I've been debating China/Russia politics with my Army friends since the early 80's and it was an unfortunate waste of an excellent topic. Still even bad Clancy is better written than most books and even if it was disappointing it was still a good read as long as you all you expect is typical fiction."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am on page 315 and bored out of my mind with this book! When will the action begin? I too am offended by the increased use of foul language in this book, a definate departure from Clancy's other books, of which, for the most part, I have enjoyed reading. Since I am a die-hard fan, however, I will continue reading this book, although my money may have been better spent on one of the &quot;Op-Center&quot; series books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"In the summer of 1988, I had a day devoted to reading Clancy's first novel. Didn't eat, didn't sleep until I had finished it. And for every novel since, my life has gone on hold because I can't stop reading it. Until his latest, of course. Though some of his novels are a bit verbose at times, this takes the cake! Are his editors (if there are any) too scared of him to use their red pens? Or are they even bothering to read anymore? Publisher, beware: you will lose money and Clancy fans on this one - and deservedly so. Tom (if I may be so bold), beware: save your readers the sermons and the repetition and get back to the fast-moving thriller/suspense we have all grown to love. Might I suggest you revisit Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Or hire me as your editor."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy has always delivered a great plot, but with The Bear and the Dragon, the plot can be told in about 50 pages of the 1028. Characters, who continue to enter the novel even on page 800, are too many; the plot is tediously expanded with overdone details of military equipment. The plot becomes hard to follow and takes concentration when reading - when all one wants is a good, fun plot as Clancy has delivered in the past. And the overuse of the &quot;f&quot; word gets old."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy is in dire need of a Book Editor. This novel reads like an Unedited first draft - needlessly overlong, overwritten, with too few incidents occuring and a sluggish plot that never rises to the occasion (not even in the end). It's simply not worth 1,028 pages - and your time. It could easily lose 400 or so. It seems Clancy did a lot of research and dang! if he isn't going to include each &amp; every thing he learned. Back off, Tom! I loved his previous novels - but with this one, he shows that he's rapidly losing sight of simple, good story-telling. This is not a worthy successor to his previous novels. It's slow, excessively wordy, and too thin."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"OK, I have read all of Clancy's fiction, and have enjoyed them, but he is in danger of becoming the Neil Simon of thriller novels. Like Simon, who has written many plays and movies with essentially the same plot, Clancy reuses an old plot, in this case Red Storm Rising, only changing the location and character names. He did the same thing in Rainbow Six, which was essentially a cross between Executive Orders and Patriot Games. I won't even get into the constant moralizing that he beats us over the head with during the course of the novel. We get the point Tom, you don't need to belabor itAlso, no novel needs to be over 1000 pages long. Someone needs to remind Clancy that a wise man once said &quot;Brevity is the soul of Wit.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Boy, and I thought 'Executive Orders' was a yawner...wait'll you get a load of this one!By now my standard procedure for evaluating a new Clancy book is to start skimming at the halfway point. This is due to my noticing that the first half of all these books is just a rehash and a cleaning-up of the loose ends from the previous effort. Usually nothing starts happening until 150 or 200 pages before the end of the book.After 20 years of sampling this author, I am also growing very weary of this too-clever narrative style. For instance, each time when shifting to a different location/viewpoint, not naming the actors on the set -- only alluding to them in the most vague way. In other words, making you guess. It worked okay in the first two or three novels, but after all these years he continues trying the same trick in every scene of every book. It is really getting tiresome, Tom! As if it doesn't take enough effort already to slog through another one of your doorstop tomes.Another thing I hate is his habit of referring to characters by so many various tags from one paragraph to the next. Say we have President Jack Ryan (POTUS). He'll say use \\"the president\\", then \\"Jack\\", then \\"President Ryan\\", then \\"POTUS\\", then something or other. He does this with all the major characters. So distracting -- it's the same thing as using all the different possible synonyms for \\"he said\\", which editors will tell you is one of the outstanding marks of beginner writers.One thing particuarly cheesy is the lopsided outcomes of the combat. I count 200+ Chinese aircraft destroyed for the loss of a single F-14 -- and that's only because the PLAAF shot off 19 missiles at the one plane! Come on, where's the drama???? Yes, I know the Chinks're using GCR vice AWACs (and they even came close to nailing one of the E-3s), but surely they're smart enough to have invested heavily in mobile battlefield radars with EW and dummy emitters, no? Not enough SAM action, either.Technically, I find it very hard to swallow that the Chinese ICBM force deploys a \\"copy of the old Titan II\\". Surely a little research would have revealed that the Chinese have a force of modern solid-propellant road-mobile ICBMs, yes? And besides, even the old Titan II (1960s tech) used permanently-storable propellant, namely hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. No prelaunch fueling required, as in the story.And where's the USAF heavy bomber force? Surely if the Americans are that hard-up getting some quick firepower to Siberia, they'd send over some of the heavies, yes? Maybe, Tom, you should compare notes with Dale Brown on this point, because you two guys seem to be coming from opposite extremes of the spectrum, when any realistic portrayal of events would fall somewhere closer to the middle. Brown is all heavy bombers and almost no navy, and Clancy is everything else but never any heavy bombers. Perhaps I've simply forgotten that this is the Ryanverse, after all, where the orders of battle have been manipulated to serve the plot (such as it is).Yet another low point here is the tasteless portrayal of the all-too-convenient liason between Nomuri and Lian Ming. How could defeating the Chinese be any easier when you have a seat at the table of the Politburo. Couldn't you have come up with anything more original or intriguing than that, Tom? And didn't you pull something just like that in 'Debt of Honor' (or some such) as well?? Can't remember that one too well, wasn't it something like 3000 pages ago?Japanese sausage, anyone? What a classy note to end the book on!Oh yeah, almost forgot about the lucky strike the Russians got finding a \\"Persian Gulf sized oil field\\" and a \\"South Africa sized gold mine\\" in Siberia. Gee, I wonder what those Russia geologists and prospectors have been doing this past century. I could see overlooking the gold, but a Persian Gulf would be pretty hard to miss, even in Siberia. Makes it awfully convenient for the plot, doesn't it? Whatsa matter? Too busy investing your millions to think up a plausible plot? I see you haven't even the time to shoot a new photo for the back covers anymore...Actually, I can think of one thing I like about the book -- the idea that the USA and the PRC are on a collision course. As put forth several times, the Chinese are indeed \\"Klingons\\". Their society is not just foreign, it is positively alien. Too bad that wasn't competently delineated in the story. This is probably why the dialog during the Politburo decision-making sessions sounds so tinny -- Chinese people neither think nor talk as portrayed. As I saw one of the other reviewers comment: why did you not take the time and effort to actually DO SOME RESEARCH on things Chinese? If not an actual trip to the Orient, at least a few calls or emails to China experts?Clancy used to be good, but I think he lost it after 'Red Storm Rising'. I'm wasting no more of my time on him -- from now on I'm just reading the Wikipedia plot summary, and if it looks reasonably interesting, then I might go to Barnes and Noble to skim the book. But judging by the stellar success of Red Rabbit and Teeth of the Tiger I don't think that's in the cards."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The Bear and the Dragon IS a long book. Although I like the \\"techno\\" details, it does tend to bog down the story.I used to think that flying a plane into a building was fantasy...in Clancy's world maybe...not anymore. Economics bringing down a giant...in Clancy's world...not so unreal now, is it? China is facing a huge problem. The chemical additives in toothpaste and lead in our children's toys are making it through the Chinese factory quality controls. Remember the term, \\"real money impacts.\\" Is it going to push us into a nuclear war with China? Probably not, but Clancy's novels have a way of meeting reality on several layers.So, don't be so critical and enjoy the novel for what it is: a story told from the author's viewpoint, which no one has to agree with. It takes awhile to figure out how everything connects, but it leads towards an exciting conclusion. The ending was very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I was a Clancy fan up until this book. There is too much profanity, repeated and unnecessary. Sometimes a point can be made by it, but its excessive use caused me to begin just skimming the book after 300 pages.A good page-length for this book would have been 450, not 1000+."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm not sure what has happened to Tom Clancy in recent years. I guess he's been too successful and that he's just lost interest in his craft. What a tragedy. When at the top of his game (Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Debt of Honor), Clancy is one of the great entertainers in the history of fiction.That, of course, was when he was interested. Those days are clearly over. The decline that began in earnest with Rainbow Six has picked up considerable speed.The Bear and The Dragon is dreadful. Clancy retreads plot points from prior works throughout the book. The plot moves excruciatingly slowly. Characters repeat themselves ad nasuem. About 3/4 of the way through, I began to wonder if Clancy had even written the book. There were so many repetitions and blocks of incredibly clunky dialog that it appeared to me there were at least two different people telling the story. There were rumours a few years ago that Clancy used ghost writers. I didn't believe it then, but now I'm not so sure.It pains me to say this, but this is going to be the last Clancy book I buy. I'll keep my collection of his past great work, and every so often, I'll re-read his brilliant early stories. But no more. I'm tired of being disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The first 800 pages are pure drudgery. Not one exciting moment. Just trivial dribble and pointless dialogue. I've read every Clancey book but this book is horrible. When the action does finally start it has to be rushed to a quick conclusion because 900 pages have already been written. The battlefield scenes are shallow and undetailed. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"If you haven't read Hunt for Red October in a while, revisit it. You will find a Jack Ryan who is clever, brave, etc. -- but not the demigod he has evolved into. Why do Clancy's heroes all have to be so superhuman? Ryan is not just brave, but the bravest; the most brilliant (making millions in the market was too easy for him, remember?); the most righteous in every way. His wife can't just be a surgeon -- she has to be the top eye surgeon in the world, while also being young and sexy. Jack's buddy Robby can't just be a fighter pilot -- he has to be a top gun, rising to admiral etc. Even Robby's wife can't just be the wife of a Navy pilot -- she has to be a concert pianist. The peripheral heroes and heroines are likewise too perfect. It just gets tiresome after all these books.On the other hand, we could certainly use Jack, Robby, Clark, Ding, etc., in these dark days. But maybe that's another reason Clancy has become a little tiresome: in real life, our leaders and secret operatives just can't do what the storybook characters can."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Though Tom Clancy is a prolific writer who can churn out terrific action scenes, I found this, his latest book, to contain distressingly racist undertones. Most conversations in &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; were liberally sprinkled with racial epithets that were not only unnecessary, but extremely offensive. Of course, these taboo words are sometimes *meant* to provoke, but I was provoked once too often. The politicians and &quot;heroes&quot; in Clancy's latest novel are coarse and vulgar. The Chinese people are stereotyped and portrayed at their worst, coming across as &quot;slant-eyed&quot; buffoons. Though I am not Chinese myself, I feel offended enough for the Chinese people.To be fair, Clancy is a good writer. He may simply be trying to emphasize the feelings of his characters without even realizing that this is cause for offense. If not for the excessive racial slurs, I probably would have made it all the way through the book in a week or so, but by the time I got a third of the way through, I was sickened enough to throw the book away for good."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Full of what you expect of Clancy. Main plot, subplot after subplot. Very technical book as you would expect. Builds up his characters well. Very way out impossible settings and circumstances. If you have a dense mind, don't read it but if you enjoy good writing and fiction this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have just finished this book and suffice it to say, I am somewhat disappointed. Maybe the Jack Ryan story line is wearing thin, but this is the first book from Clancy which disappointed me. The ending seemed rushed.. (did anyone else get the feeling that at one time, the nuke actually took out D.C. with Ryan, only to have TC change his mind into the book?)What disappointed me the most was the overly excessive use of profanity. It added absolutely NOTHING to the book. I got the feeling that he was being payed for every &quot;F&quot; word and vulgar human anatomy term that he used...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"With this effort, Tom Clancy has dropped from my &quot;automatic hardback purchase&quot; list; the sneering, soulless _Rainbow Six_ has given way to the appalling excesses of _The Bear and the Dragon_. The primary plot line, as usual, is aggressive and intriguing, but the villains' brains in Clancyland have apparently not paid their oxygen bill for a couple of books now. Even worse, one of the subplots -- the one which closes the book down -- is leeringly written and utterly offensive. There's a decent story in here somewhere, but only an editor with a red (pen) army could have salvaged this book's feng shui."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"No new plots. Clancy's annoying habit of pontificating the rights and wrongs of the world culminate to a new high. The plot lines are exactly the same from his previous books, i.e. stupid_event + news_coverage = threatened_econmic_collapse_so_we_go_to_war_and_get_soundly_defeated_without_scratching_the_paint_on_a_single_American_tank. Clancy has such an unrealistic view of war and such an overwhelmingly overly optimistic sense of American fighting power that it is hard to stomach. Dont waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Boring, long drawn out sleepy book. Thank goodnes I can speed read. I feel sorry for those of you that have to suffer through the tedium of this thing. From racial slurs to swearing that just doesn't fit the situation. The only highlight was the new pig bomb; and the other pig, Ming. Japenese sausage? How freaking juvenille. This book smells of a ghostwriter, or Clancy is out of original thought and is done."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Oh for the Tom Clancy of yesteryear! Intricately plotted, well-crafted, a plethora of gadgets and military secrets....the man invented the techno-thriller! But now his books are mostly obscured by overly long, intermitablely slow plots.He should charge by the pound, rather then the spoken word (its a damn heavy book!), and one which could have and should have been cut drastically, without losing anything but weight.1027 pages that go generally like this - interesting, somewhat exciting opening (maybe 10 pages), 500 pages of tedium, a few more interesting snippets (maybe another 15 pages), then another 250 pages of tedium. Only in the last 250-odd pages does the book begin to take off and get interesting.If you are bored with from the usual endless soliquizing by main character Ryan (now improbably and rather unbeliveably the US president, as outlined in previous books) about the state of the world, the travails of the presidency, a rather unbalanced, somewhat naive (and very US-oriented) view of world politics, and a dash of anti-abortionism, the book contains very little that you will enjoy. I recommend you skip 500 pages or so at a time, until the action starts.The action (when you get to it) is first rate, but not terrifically gripping. If you are one of those people who, like me, stayed up til 3 am reading Red Storm Rising, Patriot Games, or the Sum of All Fears because you just couldn't put the damn thing away and sleep -- this book will leave you disappointed, weary and uninspired. Save your money, and hope (as I do) that the next book will be worth the effort to lug it around.Oh for the Tom Clancy of yesteryear!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I would always look forward to the Clancy books but sadly, this is no longer true. Completely disjointed, shallow, simple plot with no real satisfying ending. Barely worth reading for die hard fans, but wait for paperback."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Another overwritten book of overdeveloped characters through which Clancy lectures the audience on his own political beliefs. Clancy's distaste for government, liberals, the media, politicians, anyone who doesn't subscribe to Clancy's belief system, etc., permeates his writing, interfering with Clancy's obvious mastery of the technical art of war (i.e., the real reason people buy his books). The quality of Clancy's writing, brought to such a fever pitch with his first five or six books, has steadily declined over the past three efforts."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Clancy's books, own the movies and rushed to buy this one. Now I am rushing to return it to Costco.Page 181 and Mr. Clancy decides that the right to lifers deserve a forum. There were references to the Chiense and killing new borns early in the book, but when Jack Ryan descides the Supreme Court should reverse Roe vs. Wade I had enough.Mr. Clancy has done what my wife and children have tried to do for 30 years, make me a democrat. Monday I sending a $100 to AL Gore."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Pros - large-scale war descriptionCons - alas, this time to numerous to mention. Wheelings and dealings in Chinese Politburo are almost carbon-copied from Soviet Politburo in Red Storm Rising. Sermonizing on abortion and free trade was present already in two previous novels - why put it here again? Plotting became too predictable - the very moment Clancy starts to tell a story of old hunter Gogol (Jesus, is it too difficult to come up with other Russian names than belonging to Russian writers and artists?) and his war experiences, one immediately suspects that his skills as well as newly sent rifle will be used to hunt some important Chinese. Final pages - bingo! The tedious politeness of Russian who use Russian patronimics when talking to Americans is almost laughable (the same with Golovko referring to Mary Pat as \\"Foleyeva\\" :) Where Clancy gets these funny ideas? Does it mean that his research goes more into fighting characteristics of T-80OU than into real Russian life? Portrayal of Red China overly simplistic.All in all, the worst Clancy novel to date. If you want better war story - take Red Storm Rising. If you want more sinister conspiracy - choose The Sum of All Fears, if you need more realistic approach towards people and their lifes - pick up Patriot Games.One can only hope that the next novel would be better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I waited eagerly for this book and bought it the first day it was out. I really thought this was going to be a good read complete with unexpected twists and turns, intregue, very original ideas, good characterization, and a tight plot. Instead of a finely woven tapestry, I got a lot of machismo without much substance. Instead of playing to his strengths (multi-level character interactions, good plotting, unexpected developments, resourceful villains), I thought he cranked this book out without much thought.If he would have changed the four things below, he could have had a real winner:1) Unbelievable Character Names: Cardinal DiMilo(as in Venus de Milo), Ge(Spear)--Need some original names here -not stereotypes2) Predictable War Outcome: What makes these books great are the &quot;what ifs&quot; we ask ourselves. The more original the &quot;what if&quot;, the more fascinating it is. The war against Japan and the UIR already happened in Tom Clancy's world, why was the war with China so similar? Secondly, if the Chinese decided to invade Russia, don't you think that they'd be smarter about it? Where were the special forces cutting rail and communication lines? -After all, the story says they've been training for a possible operation into Russia for years. Why were they so sloppy about it?In addition, what made &quot;Rainbow 6&quot; great was the lack of a true war. It was more subdued and insidious. This subtlety made for a great story.3) Few Good characters: I thought the &quot;good guys&quot; in the Chinese Politburo were somewhat interesting, but the villians were just plain boring. There was nothing insidious about them. Where was the detail we saw in fleshing out the Japanese financier-turned-puppetmaster in &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, or the leader of the UIR? Both of these characters were devious and intelligent. The Chinese, who were supposedly partially behind the conflicts in &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot; came across as buffoons. Frankly, I expected much more.4) No twists and turns: Chuck Nomuri didn't worry about getting caught, the Russians and Americans had almost no bad luck, and the spy-vs-spy subplot through the streets of Moscow could have been much more suspenseful. Worst of all, Tom missed a wonderful cliffhanger opportunity at the end of the book, ensuring an audience for his next one.Even the post-conflict wrap-up seemed just too &quot;tidy&quot;. What happens now? Where will the next book go? Who's left to fight?Lastly, the military &quot;tough guy&quot; talk, and hardware descriptions make a good story better, but without that, they might as well be an awesome special effect in a bad movie----out of place and vain. He's done better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"At first I thought this book was racist, right-wing, dumb, unbelievable, unconvincing, badly edited, etc...and then I realised that perhaps unconciously, perhaps Tom Clancy has just got bored of the old political military thrillers like Red October that take months to research. All that time spent trying to work out how the weapons work, all that time trying to figure out a realistic plot development, all time spent building characters.And who could bregrudge him? Sounds like a lot of hard work to me. What I think he is trying to do is branch out into pulp fiction, and suddenly it all makes sense. The plotline is ridiculous? Of course, it's supposed to be! Endless lazy racism? Par for the course! Phlanxes of square-jawed American heros beating the dastardly foreigners? You bet! Beats reality!Of course I could be wrong and Tom Clancy really thinks that war between China, Russia and America could happen, that those really are his political views on EVERY SINGLE PAGE, and that he really thinks that all Chinese can be summed up in one or two racial stereotypes, and that America always wins wars. Just to be on the safe side, I have given this book 1 star, and vowed never to read a Tom Clancy book again. I am also re-reading Red October, just to make sure it is by the same author."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy seems to have found a new plotline in this installment of the Ryan Series. Instead of having America directly attacked whether via biological, nuclear or financial terrorists, the target is the fragmenting former Soviets republics, specifically, Russia itself. China enters the scene as the main antagonist bent on securing Siberia for their own purposes. A welcomed respite from the destruction America has had to suffer throughout Clancy's yarns. Well worth the read, especially since American soil is left alone and other parts of the world are allowed to take part."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was disappointed that other readers did not get the same enjoyment as I did."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I devour all of Clancy's books as soon as they come out. I agree that Rainbow Six was less than his best effort, but this one ranks up there with Debt of Honor as far as I am concerned (My favorite Tom Clancy book is Sum of All fears, and nothing has come close to that). The dialogue is somewhat contrived, but I have always fond that to be the case. What I like about this book is that it brings back the white-knuckle action and the sense of reality that makes me have to put the book down to realize that we aren't actually at war. I again found myself up until 3 in the morning racing through the last third of the book. This book is also full of the usual military techo-toys that keep us one step ahead of the unsuspecting foes."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What has happened to author who penned \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\"? Me thinks that alien seedpods have done away with the old Clancy and replaced him with a thoughtless, uninformed hack writer, whose disdain for his readership is only eclipsed by his apparent loathing for Asians. No point in reiterating what others have stated pretty accurately in their reviews. Save your pocket money; this one like the two Jack Ryan prequels, is absolute rubbish. If I could have given it '0' stars, I would have."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Clancy, though accused of being &quot;right wing&quot; and numb to the intricacies of diplomatic exchange by others who have reviewed this book, has accomplished his mission with The Bear and the Dragon. It was made clear just how frustrating and trying diplomatic negotiations can be, particularly when one or both parties do not care to compromise. The manner in which the plot was set up and the Chinese communists were portrayed are very well-rooted in reality; their unwillingness to conform to human rights standards as well as copyright and trademark laws and treaties are indefensible (both in reality, and in this work of fiction).Furthermore, amid accusations that Clancy is &quot;right-wing,&quot; even racist, one must remember that this is a fictional work, and the author is attempting to paint a picture of the world in his work. To condemn him for allowing his characters to call others &quot;tree-huggers&quot; or &quot;chinks&quot; or what have you is childish; perhaps you should read some Harry Potter instead. Language and nuance were never really Clancy's forte, rather the technical aspects of combat ruled his novels. This manner of character development and plot line reveal to me that Clancy has grown in his ability through his thirty-plus literary works. The Bear and the Dragon is a must-read, even for you left wing, bunny huggers."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"It is very sad to note that starting with this novel, Tom Clancy would no longer be known as the slick, sophisticated politico-techno-writer he had been when he wowed readers with his dazzling tales of anti-submarine warfare, covert operations, and Washington politics. His cleverly astounding, earlier efforts is now met with an equally astonishing feat of embarrassment, particularly his view on China. He writes of a China that does not exist; outdated, and clearly stereotyped. Clancy's China is an epitome of old-fashioned American conservative point of view, which desperately tries to maintain that Communist China has not undergone a capitalistic evolution, and would never change. It was as if Clancy stubbornly, and adamantly does not want to accept the truth that the China of today is beaming with skyscrapers. We could not deny the fact that even Tom Clancy is not impervious to the effects of senility; he sticks to his Old World fantasies. On Russia, it was equally bizarre. Imagine a covert military collaboration between Russia and NATO, his hope and dream of an ensemble of the best weapons and fighting men. Would Putin be shaking his head balder? The only saving grace to this book is that it is in fact listed in the fiction category. Even so, it was grossly unrealistic!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have to admit that I've seen better from Mr. Clancy. It was a long book, maybe he gets paid by the word now? - and there were several issues of repeated phrasing. Then again, I think I would run out of new things to say after a thousand pages as well.However, there are some things that people take for granted. Of course the plotline is going to be a bit unbelievable. The problem with big global-spanning action is that it would be too unbelievably complex as issues and events would take years to unravel to their final conclusion. Things that begin in the beginning of the book are all neatly wrapped up by the end. Unrealistic perhaps but not surprising.Clancy is a man who has his opinions about people and those best suited to run countries and which ones are worst. That being said, I'm convinced there aren't ten people in the world that don't have their own (likely dissimilar) views who lack but the forum to share them. Would they stop themselves if they had the chance? I doubt it.In short, it's a decent book. Worth the read, but nothing to get too excited for."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I just recently finished Clancy's The Bear and the Dragon and I have mixed feelings about it. Let me describe the story a little and then give my opinion.The Chinese economy is in serious trouble, and the Chinese Politburo members are not making things any better when they are unreasonable in trade negotiations with the US. President Ryan is fed up with their stubborn disregard for fair trade practices. China further makes things worse in their attempt to kill a high ranking Soviet official, not to mention the killing of two unarmed clergy members who attempt to prevent the abortion of a child in a Chinese hospital. Growing discontent from the rest of the world towards the Chinese causes those in the Chinese Politburo to attack Russia, where enormous gold and oil finds have just taken place. In this maneuver, China hopes to better strengthen it's position as a world power and more dominant political force. President Ryan and US armed forces come to Russia's aid and a riveting war takes place.What I didn't like about this book was that it takes so long to really get the real plot of the novel, which is the war between China and Russia. Clancy spends about half the book building up to this climax with the developments of the subplots concerning the assassination attempt and murder of clergy. These elements are entertaining and important to the story, but it seems like much less time could be devoted to their unfolding. As always, Clancy provides a lot of background detail which considerably adds to this book's bulk. It isn't until you've read over 600 pages that you really get to the war.What was good about the book is that once you do get to the war which occurs, the action is pretty much non-stop and very entertaing. As usual, Clancy displays his wealth of information on military tactics and processes which are a staple of his work. He also brings a wide variety of characters that have been in many of his books, such as Ed and Mary Pat Foley, Robby Jackson and John Clark and Domingo Chavez. Clancy does a fine job of making the political aspects of this story just as entertaining and pertinent as the military aspects, which I really enjoy. But, as I said, the book is too long and if were to be split into two halves, I'd probably give the first half 2 stars, but the second half 4 stars or maybe even 5.If you're a big Clancy fan I would recommend this book since it was overall a satisfying book and does have a rather good plot once you really get down to it. But, if you're somone that is just trying Clancy out for the first time, don't read this book. Read The Hunt for Red October or The Cardinal of the Kremlin or any of his other books pretty much. This book is too demanding time-wise if you're just trying Clancy out for the first or second time. It might turn you off to someone who really is a good writer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book is very very long. I started reading this last fall on a vacation which spanned 9-11 and dropped it at that point. I eventually picked it back up this year and fought my way through to the end. I liked it better than Rainbow Six, but the beginning is hard to get excited by. The best part of the book is the last several hundred pages. I give it 4 stars mainly because the story is fairly fast-paced and interesting once it gets going. Like most Clancy novels, the beginning of the story is a bunch of disjointed scenes which finally inter-weave with each other by the end in a manner that eventually makes sense. With an 1100+ page novel, it's not difficult to see why it is hard to get into it. Don't get me wrong, however, once you do get into it the story is pretty good. If you have the time, I'd recommend this book. I just hope that Clancy's next novel isn't any longer."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The most fundamental questions to ask when reviewing are (I think), &quot;Did I enjoy the book? Did I neglect TV for the book? Did I rush through household chores to get back to the book?&quot; The answer to all three of these questions is a resounding &quot;yes!&quot; for this latest Jack Ryan offering from Mr. Clancy. The king of the techno-adventure is back in spades, offering up some high-tech wizardry that may not be exactly true, but will almost certainly be in the near future. In addition, we have some good old fashioned action and intrigue.The book is about a war between China and Russia. We see the war coming a long time before the characters in the book do, because we have access to all sides of the conflict. It's fascinating to see Clancy maeuver his characters and countries into a position where war is inevitable. The battle itself is mildly disappointing in its detail (compared to, say, Red Storm Rising), but here is where we get to see nifty gizmos at work. Do they really exist? I'm inclined to believe most do, in a highly classified research lab somewhere.Others have complained that the novel is less realistic than his others. I have to agree, but for different reasons than they offer. Red October and Clear and Present Danger, for example, were more interesting because they were highly plausible &quot;could be&quot; tales at the time. Unfortunately, the Ryan universe has a life of its own now, and Clancy is maintaining his own consistency with a timeline that is increasingly remote from &quot;real life.&quot; The U.S. didn't have a mass-murdering plague and didn't fight a war with Japan in real life, but did in the Ryan universe. It seems to me that it's time for Clancy to retire this timeline and get back to more realistic scenarios. Finally, the book seems more overtly racist than his past efforts, which is a little disturbing.So, overall, the book rates 4 stars - it was hard to put down, but the Jack Ryan universe is unfortunately running out of steam."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This may be the last book of Clancy's that I read. Normally, I read one of his books straight through. Took me over a week, and I had to work at getting interested. Ryan has become self righteous &amp; goody two shoes. Over and over Ryan character tells us how he hates being President, but someone got to do it. He doesn't want to get use to people waiting on him, he just wants to be a regular guy. And he owes it to the American people to take the job. And I agree with the reviewer that was turned off by Pat &amp; Ed and their honey bunny. PLEASE!! The end was an exercise in reading page after page of military gizmos."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I am a Clancy fan and have read all of his single author work.The book dragged. It took a long time to get going and then it didn't last long. Mr. Clancy is famous for the techno thriller genre. In this one he forgot the thriller and the techno.His hero Jack Ryan, shows up to be a chain smoking, alcoholic, sexist, preacher for a watered down Roman Catholism. He is willing to comitt suicide, rather than be thought a coward. The villians are all shallow dirty old men. Two of his best characters are both gunned down early in the plot.There a long poorly done uneeded seduction scene. There is an account of diplomacy which if accurate would seem to indicate that all diplomats die of boredom.The story is pedicatable and not very interesting.Please Tom, we know you can do better."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Once again, Jack Ryan and his band of shooters and spooks save the day. Well-researched? Yes - TC's made this his benchmark since they came out with the Freedom of Information Act. Well-crafted? Well, sorta. He's come a long way since &quot;Red October,&quot; and anyone familiar with his corpus notices this in the text...to say nothing of the countless references to his earlier work.When interviewed on NBC's &quot;The Today Show&quot; in mid-August, Clancy was lambasted by Matt Lauer for his politically UN-correct turns of phrase (he mentions &quot;tree-huggers&quot; half a dozen times in the text), and a James Bond-like tendency to stereotype. The motivation for Lauer's question becomes obvious after the first 300 pages. Clancy's reply was straightforward: he doesn't write to the masses, just to those who know what to expect of the genre. For the rest of you, go back to Berkeley or Evergreen or Vermont or whatever den of warm-and-fuzzy sensitivity you came from - this is statecraft, and it ain't pretty.While digesting this new installment in the Jack Ryan Universe - in a lot of ways similar to how a python digests a gerbil - I couldn't help but notice some striking similarities to some gadget-driven geopolitical thrillers of days gone by. But don't take my word for it. Fetch a copy of anything Paul J. Eerdman wrote in the '70's (&quot;The Silver Bears&quot;, &quot;The Billion Dollar Sure Thing&quot;, &quot;The Crash of '79&quot;), or anything from the hand of cop-author Joseph Waumbaugh (&quot;The Delta Star,&quot; et. al.). Given the sheer girth of &quot;Bear and the Dragon,&quot; a comparison is begged to an equally verbose and detailed writer, none other than James A. Michener (&quot;Space,&quot; &quot;Chesapeake,&quot; &quot;Texas,&quot; and on and on.). But at least Michener's people checked for typos.Overall, though, a good read. Verbose, predictable, techno-glossed, but a good read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This book was decent (not his best by a long shot), but it may not be worth the time investment required to read 1000+ pages. It should have and could have been much shorter...."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have gobbled every TC novel down since Red October. This novel was the same--I couldn't stop reading it. However, something was amiss. Was this just a rough draft? There were numerous editing errors of use and of fact. The name China inserted where clearly the context meant Japan. The Beltway around Washington is 495 not 695--695 is Baltimore... This is something about which I am very disappointed and surprised because I have come to expect so much more. Lastly on this front, I thought the use of the F word was a little on the heavy side for no apparent reason. In previous novels, for the most part, the use was reserved for spoken dialogue in situations where it made sense. In this novel it was everywhere. Just seems like that was not very TC like.Besides all of the editing errors, what happened to some of these characters? When did Ryan become somewhat of an indecisive whiner? What happened to the person who penned the Ryan Doctrine? Plus, it didn't seem as if Ryan developed at all beyond his whining. I thought he developed the &quot;you won't that right in front of me&quot; attitude in London with the terrorists long before Red October. It was further refined in Exec Orders with the Ryan Doctrine. Now, he seems to have that same thought presented to us as new at Auschiwtz? Did Mary Pat ever say &quot;honey bunny&quot; in Cardinal? Here it becomes extremely annoying while at the same time making Ed Foley seem little more than an empty suit and a puppet.Lastly, and possibly worst of all, after 900 hundred pages of setup and 95 pages of bloodlust, TC wraps the whole thing up in a couple of paragraphs leaving huge holes. This was most unlike his other works and it left me to feel as if I had been dropped off of a cliff.Just my $0.02..."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"What allows this to book to be 1000 pages is the simple quantity of the sub-plots happening. But after that the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad. The good guys have phantastic technology that always works, and the bad guys are stuck in the 50's. This leads to very one dimensional story reading. And there is very little of the fog of war syndrome. In previous books by Clancy such as the Cardinal of the Kremlim and Red Storm Rising the good guys suffered defeats and set backs. Here the plot is on auto pilot. After the shoot starts the ending is a forgone conclusion and too short. So now that all the major power's have fought each other in the Jack Ryan universe, can we get back to some simpler well thought-out, well developed stories?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As Mr. Clancy ages he seems to ramble...This book could have been much better with fewer words."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"While certainly entertaining, I felt the book was not up to previous standards. A number of times, I had &quot;deja vu all over again&quot; as he seems to repeat himself in explaining a number of devices (both plot and technical). The characters are more two-dimensional than in other stories. The Chinese almost cartoonish. I'd hate to read this book without having read the entire canon of Clancy's Jack Ryan and Rainbow Six novels. As to the end of the book -- definitely unsatisfying in tying up loose ends, perhaps setting the stage for a continuation of the venue."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Although better than his last book, Rainbow Six, I was still disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest effort. Next to Rainbow Six this is his weakest work to date. It appears that Tom Clancy is running out of plot ideas because the story line is basically a combination of Red Storm Rising and Debt of Honor with the Chinese as the villians this time around. The story itself is pretty predictable, any body who has read any of Tom Clancy's previous works will be able to figure out the ending early on. The book is 1028 pages which is about 500 pages too long for the story line. Tom Clancy could have easily eliminated 500 pages and I don't think it would have made a difference to the overall plot. A lot of the superfluous text is the result of Tom Clancy injecting his own polictical views in the story via President Jack Ryan. I have nothing againts Tom Clancy's political views, I even agree with some of them, but add nothing to the story line, and in fact if anythng, they detract from the storyline."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Hey, it's typical Tom Clancy! He has always been wordy &amp; technical. He's just not talking military equipment this time. He's telling us to take note of who are future enemies may be. Even if he took out all of the &quot;duly noted&quot; and &quot;honey-bunnies&quot; It still going to be a long book... If your going to pay $18. for a book, don't you want to read it for more than one day? Talk about wordy books.... Read &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;. We loved it, too.

But I thought this book could have been compressed to about 500 pages and nothing would have been lost.Very repetitive. I hope he hasn't burned out from the good old days."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"President Ryan has his work cut out for him when he finds forces in China are moving ahead with a plan that, if successful, will change the world forever. The reader has his work cut out for himself trying to stay focused as Clancy gives us page after page of detail that sometimes reads more like a tech manual than a novel. Clancy's sub-plots are cumbersome and take a while to play out in this long-winded tale of war and espionage."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This one is usually fun, but it's just as often infuriating. Thinly-veiled cryptofascist politics, recycled dialogue, cliched characters and over the top emotional chain-yanking detract from what is otherwise a pretty snappy technothriller plot. As we've come to expect from Mr. Clancy, he's a name-dropper, especially in his attempts to convince us he's an expert on modern weaponry and intelligence gadgetry. Too often, he's wrong, though, such as when he misidentifies the main gun caliber of Russian T-80/90 tanks (and even when he screws up football rivalries in the Southeastern Conference, the cad!).Nevertheless, it's worth your time, if you don't mind waiting until around page 388 or so for things to really start hopping. Larry Bond, where are you when we need you?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Some people whine about how long this book is, well just try reading it in several sittings as I did. I found the book to be typical Tom Clancy material with lots of interesting military stuff, some political commentary, lots of detail. I could have done with less of the #%!** words although I think that it was probably what you could expect in the real world. I did notice, as I have in many of Clancy's other books, the irritating tendency to mix times and dates up. He has Ryan in high school during the Cuban missle crisis,(that would be 1961),yet from reading other books in the series the guy could only be in his early to mid 40's. Another detail gone wrong is the mention of the Capitol Dome, that was destroyed in Executive Orders. A little detail clean up would improve things greatly."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Somehow, when Clancy has become long winded in the past (and he usually gets somewhat long winded), I didn't mind as much as during this book. Maybe it was because something actually HAPPENED in all the other books. Or at least whatever DID happen was not telegraphed 600 pages before the end. I was caught off-guard exactly ONCE in this book, and that less than halfway through it. I can't say that I hated this, because just the idea of Ryan/Clark/Chavez gets me fired up, but I have a hard time recommending it to anyone. I've been more caught up in Op-Center books."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Yes, it's too long and loosely written. (Does anyone know who edited this? -- now there's a name to avoid....)Yes, most of us would have preferred more war and less limping along in aimless subplots.And yes, the Saturday matinee ending is awful.But...what's with all the pouting and hissy fits from leftish, oafish readers? The only offensive stereotyping in the book is the unnecessarily kind and fuzzy treatment of the media, along with a few &quot;Not bad for a white boy&quot; remarks. Is TC folding under pressure?Seems to me it's awfully close to midnight for the race-baiting, hate-filled ethnic capitulators who've dominated campuses and airwaves for so long. Is this what's making you all so mad? I do hope so."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I have been a TC fan since &quot;Red October&quot; (read when I was still in the Navy), and that's why I'm so bothered by this book. I won't argue the political leanings, but I was offended by some of the language in the book. The cracks TC had Ryan make about his secret service agent (when she's discovered to be pregnant) were fairly far out of bounds, but the most offensive of all was the final sentence in the book. It was just plain vulgar, and to no good point.And, as much as I hate to say it, I think it's time to retire Jack Ryan as a character - he's simply no longer interesting to me. He's become predictable and inflexible, and just not that much fun to read about.This is a shame, because the overall theme of the story had all kinds of great potential (and, admittedly, some was followed through on), but so little was done with it. What a pity."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"My father got me started reading the Jack Ryan stories by Tom Clancy, and I have been an avid fan ever since. I have bought or read all of Tom Clancy's Ryan books, and have been greatly impressed by his work. Until now. The culmination of &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, with Jack Ryan's assumption of the Presidency, may well have been the zenith of Clancy's writing career as well. Since then, his literature has gone downhill, beginning with &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, and continuing with &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;. Sure, in EO there were some exciting battles in the desert, and suspenseful moments during the Ebola outbreak, but the book is mostly an analysis of Ryan's thinking, and an attack on the Iranians/Iraqis. I lost count of the # of times &quot;raghead&quot; was used. In &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot;, Clancy shows his Republican, good ole boy side, with his blast of the New York Times' gun stance, his misogynist comments (i.e. &quot;when men were men and women were grateful&quot;) and his critique of Marxism. I suppose Mr. Clancy would say that I am &quot;un-American&quot;. Then what, I ask, is &quot;American&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"We've come to expect a lot from Tom Clancy of late, but it would seem that Jack Ryan can't get much more &quot;advanced&quot; in the timeline Clancy has created for him. I started this story in eager anticipation - where would the trail go from 'Executive Orders?' Some things Clancy is great at - and that's where his early successes in Red October and Red Storm stem from. However, his most current effort at further developing the Ryan universe left me somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the story itself is epic, worthy of the Clancy name. But something gets lost in the 1000 pages - one too many subplots, one too many character ruminations, one too many misplaced off-color remarks. Sometimes less is more, and I believe that to be the case here. Better to finish a book wanting and imagining more than to finish with &quot;Enough already, just trying to finish.&quot; Perhaps the editors didn't want to change much from the original manuscript...I think they could've done more.Overall, though, it's still worth reading, but I think the best of Jack Ryan has come and gone."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is another one of Clancy's epic novels which, as usual, means that if you can get past the three or four hundred pages of not terribly exciting build-up, you can hardly put it down for the remainder.While this book is excellent in places, it suffers from some problems. So much so, in fact, that I'm not sure whether to give a 3 or a 4 star rating. The biggest problem is that it's all been done by him before. This book is virtually a collection of all of the best bits from his other books, all thrown together into a giant, multi-faceted story. On one hand, this is good, because there are lots of good bits. On the other hand, it's nothing new.Another problem is simply that Jack Ryan cannot be developed any further. We've seen him go from a government lackey to president, and that's really as far as you can go. I thought Clancy was going to end the Jack Ryan focus with Executive Orders, and from Rainbow Six on, stick with John Clark and Ding Chavez. I guess not.One major plot gripe (not wanting to spoil here, but it happens near the start anyway) is the ease with which Chet Nomuri obtains his agent. I mean, we are told constantly in the book how no other countries have agents in China because they're so hard to get there, yet Nomuri turns his first attempted target after two dates. He must have been an ABSOLUTE demon in the sack, methinks!Is this the end of the line for Ryan? I don't think so. There are several indicators in the book of another one to follow, and I predict that the next one will be based around a civil uprising in the USA itself. Of course, given that there's no-one else left to fight, this is not that tough a prediction to make!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"My guess is that those people who have enjoyed most of Clancy's previous works will find that The Bear and the Dragon is classic Clancy - lots of pages, a large number of characters to keep track of, voluminous technical jargon on weapons systems, an evil government (and the leaders who run it) to serve as the antagonist, a protagonist in Jack Ryan, and a good story. While some find fault with the book due to one or more of these characteristics, anything less would not be \\"a Clancy.\\" The reprise of Jack Ryan as the central character is welcome. As the reluctant president, he serves as an interesting contrast to the candidates in the current election. The story itself was well within the realm of possibility and moved along quite well, despite the length. It was truly an enjoyable and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This was one of Clancy's better efforts. All of the old cast of characters is back -- Robby, Clark, Ding, the Foleys, the O'Days. As you might expect, the U.S. gets into the midst of a squabble between Russia and China.Clancy keeps a couple of dozen subplots going throughout the book, and they all participate in the ending. Much of the writing involves the characters' internal dialogue; and they are all grist for Clancy's personal moral and political philosphy. Typically, he pulls it all together in the last 25 pages.All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"As a returnreader to the Clancy books (I was in grad school for six years and stored the new Clancy books as they came out), I thought this was a GREAT read. I see a lot of complaining reviews about this book and its predictable plots etc. but I must say this was the most entertaining book I've read in years. It took about 300 pages to really drag me in, but after that, I had a hard time putting it down and the last 200 pages were really wild. If you expect a Clancy novel to be deep and thought-provoking--forget it. Go read some Richard Feynman instead. Maybe my expectations aren't as high as other readers and for that reason I was highly entertained. And everyone (which means fellow science-geeks) who I know that reads Tom Clancy had pretty much the same impression!!"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"I'm 90% done with the book (boy, is it a big one), and it's definitely a great page-turner. It's nice to see Clancy dial back the techno-overload a little (I never have minded it, but I can see where it makes his stuff inaccessible), but he still gets a little bit preachy at times. I've noticed in his last few books, he takes the chance, through the characters, to do a little over-the-top conservative preaching. I don't read the books for the politics, and it tends to go far beyond character motivation and into the author writing an editorial through the characters. It's only a bit less than previous books, but still fairly tolerable.However, it's looking to me that Clancy is running out of things to write about. Rainbow Six and Executive Orders had basically identical storylines (bio-warfare? Again??), and Bear/Dragon is pretty much an amalgamation of Red Storm Rising and Debt of Honor (uh-oh, major power in economic trouble, let's have a war). I'm not sure how it ends up quite yet, but it's looking fairly predictable at this point. The biggest casualty of the cold war ending appears to have been Tom Clancy's source of stories.Still, it's a fun read, and definitely worth $25.Hope this helps! -JAL"},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Tom Clancy outdid himself in this book. In my opinion, this is the best book he has written (Red Storm Rising was a close second and The Hunt For Red October in a virtual tie with RSR) The book combined all the elements of a great technical thriller: War, Espionage, Politics, and Humor. I could not put the book down. This book was amazing and (even though it is a year or two a way) I cannot wait until the next Jack Ryan book."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Wow! He's back. 62 of 1028 pages makes me a believer. I guess the lawyers have come to terms with threatened internet death of Jack Ryan because he's back too.So far, no doubts that Clancy has failed to seize upon the current impact of current geo-politcal realities and in so doing, weaves a spiders net that seduces the reader and suspends disbelief.Thanks, Mr. Clancy for bagging the &quot;OpNet&quot; disasters and getting back to what you do better than the rest."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ok, If you like Clancy's work, not that OP-Center, Powerplays or NetForce stuff, which is merely &quot;OK&quot;, and that's saying a lot (mainly because Clancy did not actually write the those books) and if you love the Jack Ryan Books, then please get this book! I won't spoil anything, just read the summary written above by &quot;amazon.com&quot; and it's all you need to know!

Maybe Clinton can answer that one."},{"Title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"Ok, I'll admit, I snuck a peak at the reviews before I started the book, just a small one, and they are right on point.First, and I'll address this directly to Tom Clancy, YOU ARE NOT PRESIDENT, and YOU ARE NOT JACK RYAN.I am so tired of his reactionary politics being inserted into every phrase. He denigrates, in no particular order : Jews, Jewish Americans, Asians, Asian Americans, Gays, Women, Muslims, and the poor. Women are there to be manipulated, used, and nodded to while they clean. Jews are smart lawyers looking to make money at the expense of working people. Asians are just too stupid to make any correct decision, even though they've had civilization far longer than we. Muslims are heretics. Christianity is all powerful, and abortion is terrible.Aside from his political views, can we get back to regular people? Robby Jackson was a great character, relegated now to a title, with perfunctory lines. Same with Jack Ryan. Basically, Tom Clancy now believes that he is Jack Ryan, and should be President, and XO and TBATD are his vision for the US, militaristic, xenophobic, exclusionary, and isolationist.Oh wait, am I whining and bitching too much? Maybe I'm becoming Jack Ryan too.Ok, on another note, completely aside from my view of his unnecessary insertion of political messages, WHERE WAS THE PROOFING!?!?!My dad has written a couple books, and he reads them 5-6 times between each draft, and he produces at least 5 drafts. That's before it goes to final review, which is before the publisher ever sees it. This book looked like he wrote it in Word at home, spell checked it, and emailed it to the publisher.Unfortunately, we've all been duped.

Claude heard a swallow crying just before his wife screamed as she saw the burglar. Perry, Della, and Paul Drake will visit his estate and inspect the property. Perry looks into the swallow's nest and finds something; the stored shotgun was not loaded with ammunition. They notice tracks and signs on a road outside of the fence. Perry looks at a trash pile and concludes it was from a man (Chapter 5). Paul Drake's detectives search for the man who bought a lot of groceries early Sat. morning. Their search locates the trailer, but its occupant will never answer any questions. The search for Marcia Winnett locates her by her clothes, and Perry and Della track her to her hotel. Marcia tells how she was blackmailed, and staged a jewel robbery for a payoff to Harry Drummond, her first husband. Della takes Marcia to a private hospital for her recovery.Perry gathers the facts, and surmises what happened (Chapter 10). Complications are resolved. Unlike many other cases, the murderer is somebody who has not been introduced earlier in the story.

While the techniques are pretty much limited to using one folding lockback knife (Spyderco Civilan model), it can apply to the karambit or other curved blades. While there are other preferred methods of carrying out this task with less threat of compromise, sometimes there is no other way around using a knife. Of course, having two or three men on one sentry is also preferred but in the case of an E&E; scenario for example, this may not be possible.Some of the techniques are a bit technical and usually the K.I.S.S. method is best here but if one has the time and inclination to practice, these methods should carry the day. The subject itself is not easy to find in detailed written or video format so for this reason its good to have if one is a Military Professional and/or Martial Artist who wants to study the more lethal aspects of personal combat.I knew the author when we were both in 10th SFG(A) together and later at DLI in Monterey. He was always a good guy and professional.

It was true then and it is true today. Dewart does not engage in any \\"pop\\" presentation of ideas but rather leads the reader on a rigorously exciting examination of an evolution in critical thinking. Dewart intends this book for those interested in \\"the problem of integrating Christian theistic belief with the everyday experience of contemporary man\\" (p.7). He is concerned mainly with the problem of everyday experience as understood within the Roman Catholic perspective at the time of the Second Vatican Council. The context in which Dewart writes reveals the issues and passions of the day. This is not a limitation. Although, not intended as a book on pastoral theology I recommend that the last chapter be read as such. \\"The Development of Christian Theism\\" has insights on self-conscious development of the Christian understanding of God that should be of interest to any critically thinking pastor of our day and age. Our conception of God is challenged by secular thought which fails to appreciate the Hellenist background to much doctrine and dogma. Dewart has presented, from this reviewer's perspective, an excellent academic understanding of the problem. He is able to help one to think one's way out of that Hellenist cultural setting and remain faithful to the truth it has expressed. Not to be overlooked are the copious footnotes in the text which indicate the seriousness and depth of Dewart's thinking. They are of exceptional use in helping the contemporary individual in understanding the evolutionary characteristic of interpretive thought. Further, these notes provide a much needed corrective to the misunderstood and misrepresented classical ideas of antiquity often encountered popular religious books. I would not recommend the book for the average reader, nor the lazy reader. In fact, this is a painful book, not so much to read, but to put into practice. It calls the reader to a future self-confidence based on a self-conscious awareness of who we are and what we have the potential to become. Understanding Vatican II as a Christian watershed, Dewart writes: \\"We now stand on a very uncertain terrain. We are justified in exploring it solely for the attempt's possible heuristic value\\" (p. 173)."},{"Title":"The future of belief;: Theism in a world come of age","review":"Leslie Dewart (1922-2009) was a Catholic philosopher who was born in Spain, and was an emeritus professor of the University of Toronto; he also wrote books such asThe Foundations of Belief,Christianity And Revolution: The Lesson Of Cuba,Evolution & Consciousness -OS, andDevelopment of Karl Pearson's scientific philosophy.He wrote in the first chapter of this 1966 book, \\"This book attempts to sketch an approach to what may be among the most fundamental theoretical problems which challenge Christianity (and specifically the Catholic Church, with which I shall be predominantly concerned here) in the present age, namely, the problem of integrating Christian theistic belief with the everyday experience of contemporary man.\\"He admits early on that Christian belief in its traditional form \\"is at its most basic level not attuned to the contemporary experience of man.\\" (Pg. 36) He then argues that in the Christian tradition, \\"WHICH God we believe in is of the utmost importance... the Christian faith requires us, under pain of infidelity, to profess ATHEISM in relation to every false God. This means that the Christian faith is both belief and dis-belief.\\" (Pg. 68) He suggests that the hallmark of of commitment to God is \\"the willingness to admit the real possibility of disbelief--both by another and by oneself.\\" (Pg. 74)He argues that the fact that \\"Consciousness develops\\" suggests why Christianity itself develops, since \\"this truth need no longer be understood as an essentially constant, and substantially immutable... relation to an immutable object objectively presented to the Christian intellect.\\" (Pg. 84) Consciousness is \\"not an essentially and originally private event afterwards communicated ... to other human beings\\"; Conceptualization is the process by which consciousness and man evolve. (Pg. 102)Dewart's book came out amid the Secular City, Honest to God, and Christian Atheism flaps in the mid-'60s; but his ideas (particular as they relate to religious consciousness) are worth reconsidering."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Millionaire Landlord","review":"Mr. Shemin offers a few good ideas, but this book lacks the detail of other texts on the subject.

Warner\\"The Landlord's Troubleshooter\\" by Robert Irwin..."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Millionaire Landlord","review":"This book provides some good food for thought. It encourages the reader to think about landlording in the same light as any other business, and about tenents as customers. It covers many often overlooked areas that can mean the difference between success and failure as a landlord. The information is presented in a direct, easy-to-understand format, without a lot of technical or legal jargon. The author also manages to make the text seem like personal advice from a friend. Examples from his own experience make the book engaging rather than dry.That said, I recommend that this be only a starting point or adjunct to one's education about renting property. The author's practices in some areas are shady at best, and illegal at worst. Additional testimony to the author's lack of integrity is seen in the way he describes a potential problem and says, 'that's why my company never (or always) does such and such'. Then later in the book he tells a personal story in which his company did exactly the opposite of what he'd previously indicated. Either he fabricates some of his stories, or makes false claims about his policies. In either case, his credibility is suspect. This happens several times throughout the book."},{"Title":"Secrets of a Millionaire Landlord","review":"People hate being landlords generally because they have not established proper business policy and proceedures.

I'm glad I bought it. It's generally agreed that no one book is adequate for a real estate investing education, so don't expect this to be all you need. His chapter on foreclosures is nice, but if you are serious about going after foreclosures, read a book about just foreclosures. Weaknesses: it assumed an economy that doesn't exist right now, and there were no principles to guide one in different economies. Other chapters only hinted at strategies but provided no meat. For example: flipping sounds cool but who would your customer be? It wasn't until a review of a book about flipping that I realized it's an investor who wants someone else to spend the time searching for the deal.I recommend it as your introduction to real estate investing.(note: I've not yet purchased my first investment, so mine is not the voice of experience!)"},{"Title":"Secrets of a Millionaire Landlord","review":"I found that Mr. Shemin presents some great ideas regarding aligning your policies with the interests of the tenants at hand, however I feel this book could offer more &quot;secrets&quot; as the title claims.

Soon after (I like to think) Schichler will be recognized at last as a rare comic artist (think Donleavy, Robbins, Exley, Groucho), a cackling Thoreau, a Kerouac of the waterway.Out of copyright, &quot;King&quot; will be bound and peddled by both the Library of America AND the Modern Library; it will bump Samuel Butler from the #12 position on the &quot;100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.&quot; Inevitably, it will be made into a major motion picture, perhaps starring a rumpled, half-senile Haley Joel Osment in the title role.So why wait 30 or 40 years? By the time this crafty book receives the recognition it deserves, you'll be dribbling on yourself with Ellis, Harding, and McMurphy in the dayroom. And by then, a copy of this first edition might even cover the expense of a live-in nurse.Drop this book in your cart now. Read it. Tell your friends to read it.

The story is further aided by the author's photographs of the Erie Canal and it's surrounding areas. These pictures and the creativity of Dr. Schichler generates a magical kingdom of both fantasy and reality, which causes the story to materialize into a waking dream atmosphere.

There is an extensive species accounts section that lists the abundance and location information of all birds seen in the State Park and gives locations on where the rarities were found. There is a section on Species of Special Interest, a plant list, census and count data, and a table of monthly occurence. The Site Guides are very thorough, giving a short introduction to the site, directions, user tips, trail descriptions and the vegetation to be found there, and tells what birds can be seen in what seasons and their occurence, and gives nesting data.

Games Workshop's decision to create a multiple volume coffee table sized book detailing this conflict with sweeping images combined with informative text was a wise one. The community responded to the announcement with barely suppressed glee.What we received was a mixed blessing. The cover of the book is beautiful, its paper is high quality gloss, its binding strong and sturdy and its size perfect for the \\"coffee-table\\" feel. However the art direction and content for this work is at true mixed bag. On one hand you have the staggeringly beautiful and epic creations of Adrian Smith and on the other the atrocious, barely intelligible, child-like etchings of John Blanche. I regret to inform you, dear reader, that Blanche's work is far more common of the two by a factor of around nine. Other artists are included all of which are superior to Blanche's hideous work and they make the book tolerable but only just so.The information provided within the Horus Heresy: Visions of War is light at best, pages go by filled with visuals and images only. This would be tolerable, as this is at least in part an art book, if when information was provided it was both well-written and extensive. Unfortunately it is neither.As a premise this book is a wonderful idea. Its execution, however, fails that vision almost completely. What we are left with is a tarnished diamond that you will want to own for its strengths and for its successes but its flaws will stare you in the face every time you open it.Here's hoping that the subsequent volumes will be superior to the first."},{"Title":"The Horus Heresy Vol I: Visions of War","review":"For a book which carries a $29 list price, it was lacking in the depth of art it covered. As mentioned in the other review, the artwork was from the Warhammer Collectable Card Game (CCG) by Sabertooth games. There is nothing wrong with the art, but I would liked to have seen more work from Games Workshops own artists who done many excellent pieces. The text was really the high point for me. The background of the Horus Heresy was interesting and gave me some added understanding of the 40K universe. In short, a decent book but not a great one. Probably not worth buying at the list price."},{"Title":"The Horus Heresy Vol I: Visions of War","review":"2.5 stars really, on the strength of the art, but still, for such an important conflict in the 40k universe I thought this was an incredibly weak offering from the Black Library.I'd like to see them collect the three Horus Heresy volumes into one edition and strike out the irrelevent references to the game, but I'm not holding my breath there.I can't recommend the Horus Heresy volumes unless you're a die hard 40k fan.

With the vast amount of artwork that GW has created on this subject over the last 15 years, I was hoping for a real in-depth visual history of the heresy. That is not what this is. It does contain work from John Blanche(of course), Adrian Smith, and many others. But there is no older artwork to speak of, just work related to the CCG. Not to say this book is a complete waste, the text is quite good. It is exhaustive in it's discussion of all aspects of the subject, but this is an art book, and in this regard I think it really lacks."},{"Title":"The Horus Heresy Vol I: Visions of War","review":"This book is beautiful.

The artwork comes from a related collectible card game, \\"The Horus Heresy,\\" from Sabertooth Games.Taken by itself, this book alone may not be all that impressive to some: the amount of artwork presented is limited, and even though there is a good amount of written background material it covers only a small slice of the \\"historical\\" era in question. But as this is only the first in what will presumably be a multi-part set of books covering the whole of the Horus Heresy, it isn't really meant to stand on its own.

The twelve-year-old tells her about his ancestor Josiah who carved grave stones before he disappeared during the start of the American Revolution. Sweeney is intrigued by his unusual death's heads, so she decides to do further research on him.Heading home, Pres and Sweeney find the body of a man dressed in a costume from one of the many reenactments that take place nearby.Meanwhile, Detective Tim Quinn is working on his own missing person case. A history professor researching Josiah Whiting in between reenactments in Concord has vanished. Why did his wife take so long to report him missing? Is he the body Sweeney has discovered? And what is the explosive revelation he had in his book about Josiah?Once again, Sarah Stewart Taylor has written a great book. She expertly weaves mysteries of the past and present together. I especially enjoyed the historical setting of the Revolutionary War since it's one of my favorite times of American history. The writing style continues to pull you in, and the events and characters have a decidedly dark edge to them, as you would expect from a series dealing with funeral art. There are some very cool twists in the plot; the fact that I spotted a couple before Sweeney didn't dampen my enjoyment of them at all.This book has a serious flaw, however. Tim Quinn has been elevated to co-star status, but he seems to be trying to take over the book. I didn't actually count, but it felt like he had more page time then Sweeney did, and his sub-plot about finding day care for Megan slowed down the first third of the story. He also felt like he got more character development this time around. This is all compounded by the fact that I don't like him nearly as much as Sweeney or even Toby, who only got a cameo roll in this book.Overall, this is another great book in a fascinating series. I'm certainly looking forward to Sweeney's next case."},{"Title":"Judgment of the Grave (Sweeney St. George Mysteries)","review":"With \\"Judgment of the Grave,\\" her third Sweeney St. George mystery novel, Sarah Stewart Taylor reaches an important crossroad with her amateur sleuth, who is an art historian with an interest in funereal art. If there is going to be a formula to Taylor's novels a third novel is the point where it becomes painfully obvious. However, while all three novels begin with a prologue in the past that give us some vague background on past events and while Sweeney's interest in gravestones, mourning jewelry and the like provide her link to one or more murders in the present, I am happy to report that Taylor is making a concerted interest to keep her character more grounded in reality and less in the fictional world where amateur sleuths stumble across murders on an almost monthly basis.By the end of \\"Mansions of the Dead,\\" her second novel, I suspected that Taylor was taking pains to avoid going in the wrong direction by telling us more about Detective Tim Quinn than we really needed to know. When Quinn's wife committed suicide at the end of the novel, apparently a victim of post partum depression, it seemed an almost gratuitous infliction of pain on a supporting character. But I suspected that Quinn was being groomed by Taylor to play a more active role in mysteries to come, giving Sweeney a legitimate liaison (if not more) with the police. Indeed, it is Quinn more than Sweeney who is at the nexus of the criminal investigations at the heart of \\"Judgment of the Grave,\\" and that is all right with me because it allows Sweeney to focus on her strengths in terms of historical research. Sweeney might not solve the case, but once again she finds the key piece of evidence.Once again Taylor tweaks my interest early on in her novel by touching on something I find fascinating, which in this case would be reenactors. I have been to some Civil War reenactments and while trudging up the Freedom Trail in Boston towards the Bunker Hill monument, walking past the Copp's Hill Burial Ground, we past a reenactor dressed up as a British Redcoat. Sweeney is in the South Burying Ground in Concord studying the work of a colonial stonecutter, Josiah Whiting, when she meets up with one of his descendants, 12-year-old Pres Whiting, who has been undergoing chemotherapy. Her concern for the young boy leads Sweeney to follow him home, but along the way Pres discovers the corpse of someone dressed up in a Revolutionary War uniform.Meanwhile, back in Boston, Quinn has been assigned to a missing person case involving a history professor who up in Concord for a Minuteman reenactment. You might be inclined to think that Quinn's missing person and the corpse discovered by Pres would be one in the same. But that is far too obvious for a Sweeney St. George mystery. Besides, it turns out that there are other questions to be asked about Josiah Whiting than why the carvings on his gravestones changed before he disappeared and was presumed killed somewhere on Battle Road as the British regulars retreated from Concord back to Boston. After all, you should never presume anything in one of these novels but pay attention to everything because it could be a clue and then, when Quinn and Sweeney start eliminating clues and suspects, make you best guess as to who did it.I am always in the ballpark with these mysteries, but I never quite put them together, which is like riding in the curl of the wave with these novels. You do not want the solutions to be so obvious that you do not enjoy the story, nor do you want to be so far behind that you lose the sense of participating in solving the crimes. So as far as I am concerned Taylor is doing it just right. Granted, it is easy for me to identify with Sweeney's vocation, but I also think she has a much broader appeal than to readers who share my admittedly eclectic tastes.Finally, I can understand that some readers will be bothered by the fact that Sweeney is dealing more with her personal life than with the mysteries at hand, but I see the net effect being keeping the character real, especially after having read all three novels in a fortnight. Besides, in her second novel Taylor spent more time developing the supporting characters and I can appreciate the desire not to discard all of them when she gets to the final page. But I always find what Sweeney is researching to be interesting without any corpses being part of the equation. In fact, if Taylor wanted to do an entire mystery in which all of the dead and all of the evidence was in the past and not the present that would be fine with me."},{"Title":"Judgment of the Grave (Sweeney St. George Mysteries)","review":"Sarah Stewart Taylor gets better and better.This was a very interesting mystery.

We start out here where a 12 year old boy, with cancer, discovers a body in revolutionary war costume, in the woods near a shack, and meets up with our heroine, cemetary and tombstone investigator Sweeney St. George.The resulting mystery is a real puzzler, and interesting Revolutionary War, Concord battle Re-enactors, and Minuteman lore are wonderfully drawn into the story. Having checked out these sites along with the tombstones, I found this sideline as interesting as as the plot!

He alter ego Sweeney St.George is a professor who teaches \\"funerary\\" art. So how does anyone make a living doing this?

She has had a sad life, loosing her dad and then a man she loved (Colm) to a bombing in Ireland. (Gee, do you get the feeling of death here.)This story is based in Concord, Massachusetts, and involved a murder during a Revolutionary 'Re-enactment'. What makes the story work is a parallel secret running along with the murder investigation and Sweeney's search for background about a stonecarver/revolutionary war hero from the area. \\"As I have read in another book, sometimes the first murder, is really the second.\\" Aye, there's the rub (pun intended).Her involvement with men, always disorderly to say the least, includes a Cambridge Police Detective (with a baby girl who Sweeney babysits for), an English Aristocrat (Ian) and an old platonic boyfriend.I found the relationship with the detective and his daughter to be a forced, based on the original Sweeney we met in \\"O'Artful Death\\". Not to mentions the 10yold boy (Pres) who is dying from leukemia, and becomes Sweeney's 'assistant'. SST is trying to hard to soften her. As is her relationship with Ian, who she met in the last book, and by trying to tie up loose ends with Toby, the old boyfriend.I know that SST is trying to mold SSt.G into a more rounded character. But, it seems to me like she's trying to hard. The next book in the series is out this September, we'll see how she does.

Pres tells her that his family has a grave stone carving business and has had one so since the late eighteenth century.When Pres struggles to go home, a concerned Sweeney follows him to make sure he is okay. Pres stops when a dog seems overly excited. He follows the canine to see what is going on when he finds the corpse of a man wearing a Revolutionary War reenactment uniform that includes a hole in his stomach. Pres shows Sweeney whose friend Cambridge Detective Tim Quinn investigates the homicide. Sweeney and Pres help him, but concentrate more on the disappearance of a minuteman in 1775.In her third appearance, the heroine provides an interesting look at graveyard art while in the background Sweeney and Quinn try to resolve two mysteries. Pres is a fabulous preadolescence whose health brings a pale over the who-done-it as the audience and Sweeney pray for a miracle, but doubt one will happen so they settle for Scherezade.

This series is marketed as being about Sweeney, an intelligent, independent woman. In this book she's been demoted to babysitter. She just sort of stumbles around doing research that ends up having nothing to do with anything, babysits a whole lot for a police officer she barely knows after admitting she knows so little about babies she can barely tell a 3-month-old from a 3-year-old (or something like that), then makes a last-minute dash onstage to play a sidekick role while the man cracks the case. As a side note, I don't much like reading about babies with zero personalities (who rarely cry or need any attention) going along in a baby carrier or stroller to interview suspects and check out crime scenes.I love Concord and love this writer, but this book really missed the mark for me.

But, \\"aye\\", anyone who's read ANYTHING by O'Hanlon knows that he has to be taken with a few dashes of salt, in this case perhaps a whole shaker. My problem with the book was that O'Hanlon's playing a bit fast and loose with the truth did not make it fun to read, as in his previous books. Indeed, I felt seasick and in need of sleep (though I'd had plenty) after some chapters. So, on the one hand, he DOES do what the trawlermen hope he'll do: Show us what a hell on earth it is like for them out at sea. On the other hand, these sleep-deprived manic ramblings are more than a bit hard on the reader. It's not a very jolly book to plough through, a first for O'Hanlon. So, unless you have some deep and abiding need to know what it's like to be on a trawler in the worse possible weather for days on end with no sleep, or desire to go on a fishless diet for some medical reason, my advice is to pick up one of O'Hanlon's earlier works, such as No Mercy. - I've been on many a deep sea fishing boat and never been seasick.

While not a trawlerman, I worked for several years with far too many sleepless nights on offshore drilling rigs. I recognized many of the strange non-sequiters, disjointed conversations, and random thoughts that passed through the author's head after 48 hours of intense work. And, the wry humor was much appreciated. Finally, for those you don't know an Orkadian to ask, \\"neeps and tatties\\" are mashed turnips and potatoes. Yum!"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Loved his earlier books in the Congo, Amazon etc... In fact I can still remember the best jokes 8 years later. In this one though his style has changed, less off-hand wit and more manic stream of consciousness. There's still plenty of fascinating info on the deep ocean fauna though."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I'm typically not a non-fiction fan, but my wife loves \\"real world adventure\\" books, and as a result \\"Trawler\\" hit my shelf. Now, to put things in perspective, I am a fiction writer, with two books under my belt: one about time travel, and one about zombie chickens (Cluck: Murder Most Fowl), so the fact that I enjoyed this riveting true story about fishing off the northern coast of Scotland should be a clear indicator that there's more here than boring facts and \\"oh my gosh it's cold out there\\" adventure prose.O'Hanlon is a master. A crazy master, sure, but a master nonetheless. The above statement that I enjoyed Trawler is perhaps a bit misleading. I LOVED this book. It made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions, and almost makes me want to head out into a Force 12 hurricane in January. Almost. The split-your-sides first-person commentary of the novice seaman Redmond O'Hanlon is interspersed with second-hand narratives of the crew: consisting of bank-indentured skipper; a marine biologist; and your typical assortment of cooks, engineers, fishermen and (to find the one common element among them all) crazy Scotsmen. The facts are fascinating, the adventure is fist-clenching (my copy is permanently warped), and the writing is fast-paced, eloquent, and excellent overall.Five stars for the book.Five more for O'Hanlon himself: if this is even 20% true he has a larger pair than I'll ever carry."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I bought Trawler because I had read O'Hanlon's previous books, Into the Heart of Borneo and No Mercy, and so thoroughly enjoyed them, I could hardly put them down. By contrast, Trawler was such a huge disappointment, I could hardly bear reading it until I finally put it down for good without finishing it. It's full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of Moby Dick, but without Melville's nuance or complexity. Instead, we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated \\"facts\\" that we might expect from someone in a drug-induced state, who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance. It's perhaps telling that early on, O'Hanlon admits that \\"months after the contract was signed,\\" he still owed his publisher a book. Trawler ought to serve as a reminder not to let term papers go unwritten until the night before they're due."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"If you're a fan of natural history and want to embark on a wild literary ride, don't miss Trawler. Another riveting yarn from Redmond O'Hanlon, this book is by turns thrilling, touching, and hilarious as its author hurtles and lurches into the lives of seafaring people most of us will never meet. Shades of Joseph Mitchell, Bruce Chatwin, and Studs Terkel."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"My own vocabulary fails me in describing how wretched and tortuous this book is. Frankly, I couldn't finish it. In the midst of one of O'Hanlon's many interminable ruminations about who knows what, I finally had an epiphany and realized I didn't have to put up with this anymore. I tossed the book aside and felt instantly liberated. I like what the reviewer Dr. Shuffhausen said about this book: It's an \\"unholy hybrid of Hunter S. Thompson and Spongebob Squarepants.\\" That about sums it up. What is the book about? A good quesiton. Ostensibly, it's about a scientist hitching a ride on an Orkney Island trawler with real trawlermen. In reality, it's about a pompous raving windbag who torments these poor working men with his stream of consciousness, random, irrelevant burblings. Since I didn't finish the book, I am wondering if there was ever any point where these men finally got fed up and threatened O'Hanlon's life. How they avoided tossing him overboard is beyond me, and is a testament to their great patience, forebearance, and ability to endure every hardship. A salute to the trawlermen, and a warning to the readers!"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read. Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic! manic! manic! I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm). Just a little hard to read, but very interesting."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"About a decade ago, I read Bill Bryon's A Walk in the Woods, a type of book I suppose I had never imagined existed: it was clever, funny, well-written, and loosely categorized as travel literature, a genre I had never heard of. I read other Bryson travel narratives and a few of his interviews. When asked, during one discussion, which writers he admired, the Des Moines, Iowa-born writer replied Jonathan Raban, Paul Theroux, and Redmond O'Hanlon. The interviewer told the interviewee his writing reminded him of O'Hanlon's and Bryson answered with something like, \\"Aw shucks.\\"I went on to read one book by Jonathan Raban and several by Paul Theroux (the godfather of travel literature, surely), but didn't get around to Redmond O'Hanlon until recently. I suppose I should have begun with one of his more famous books, like Into the Heart of Borneo, In Trouble Again, or Congo Journey, but I found Trawler staring at me from a bookstore shelf one day not long after I had thought a good idea for a story would be to go out on a lobster boat in Eastern Canada and write about it. O'Hanlon has saved me the trouble.I've never read anything like Trawler before. It is highly unique, and for that reason alone it deserves praise. Redmond O'Hanlon, an Oxford-educated academic, joins a Scottish fishing trawler from Aberdeen as it sails into the North Atlantic to go about its business. Yes, there are predictably humourous bits about the author getting seasick and banging his head on things and not being able to get his sea-legs, but this is not an account of a stodgy, over-educated Englishman and his laugh-a-minute travails aboard a working vessel staffed by a no-nonsense, unforgiving Scottish crew. It is more like a running dialogue; like one long, 340-page conversation with a somewhat no-nonsense, occasionally forgiving, extremely brave, superstitious, rather desperate, astonishingly knowledgeable, and slightly mad Scottish crew - members of which are both gracious and hostile, sometimes within the span of seconds.O'Hanlon provides very little commentary, something I've never seen a travel writer do. Instead, he focuses on relaying what happens and what's said, and if that sounds boring, it isn't, because the experiences and discussions are so authentic and so convincing you feel like you're onboard. When O'Hanlon is gutting fish with his tattered gloves in the fish room, listening to Luke explain how a hagfish evolved and what its defensive mechanism is, with tangents about love, life, hope, and fear, the narrative is oddly moving, mysteriously compelling. To say O'Hanlon has an ear for dialogue doesn't quite capture his talent. Perhaps the author has a photographic memory (my first guess), or maybe there were whole days where he mainly took notes and didn't mention this in his book, or he might have been recording the conversations, or I suppose he could have made much of it up - only the conversations are extraordinary, banal, weird, normal, angry, friendly, asinine, and brilliant. Many are not the type of conversations one would make up. O'Hanlon sometimes says incredibly daft things or rambles (because he's out of his element, because he's sleep deprived, because he's a bookish nerd), which he immediately regrets, yet he records his statements and the responses anyway. Again, it's all so real, and that's what makes it all so strangely riveting. What of interest happens on a Scottish fishing boat? Well, just about everything if presented correctly. There's no gloss, no sheen, no special effects -Trawler is like highly literary investigative journalism, with wonderful vernacular and lots of explanations about natural science and ocean life.Because the account is exceedingly realistic, there are lots of disturbing bits (trawlermen tend to verbally abuse each other when they haven't had any sleep in four days; and they tend to be unforgiving toward know-nothing landlubbers), but there are also plenty of deeply funny parts, and in addition to being unpredictable (how would you know when one of the crew is going to say something off-the-charts bizarre?) the humour is situational and fantastically awkward. British, in other words.One part that really got me, that completely had me in stitches, had to do with O'Hanlon's wanting to see a Force 12 hurricane. Apparently, he sort of requested or expressed a wish to see a fierce storm, asking to be woken up if he should be asleep when one occurred. One day he is woken up and sent to the bridge. Presumably, he thinks the skipper, Jason, is going to provide an overview of how a vessel like the Norlantean operates in a tempest. On deck, O'Hanlon is buckled into the First Mate's chair. Jason greets him:\\"Good evening, Redmond. Welcome to my bridge.\\"\\"Jason,\\" I said, \\"yeah, good evening. But is this it? Is this a Force 12?\\"\\"Aye,\\" he said, not looking at me. \\"Maybe. Maybe not. Who cares? Only you! But I'll tell you this, Redmond. In my opinion, and please, feel free to disagree, I'd say it's a stormy, stormy night.\\"O'Hanlon thinks he's going to get an overview of how a trawler manages during a storm, but instead he gets a lecture on how his generation glorified and ruined recreational drugs. And on it goes - one conversation blends into another and into another.... It takes a bit of getting used to, but I would say by page 30, you ought to be hooked. Trawler is more than a simulated jaunt on a fishing boat, more than a documentary in print. It's a commentary on the wonders, dangers, and absurdities of life.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I like O'Hanlon's writing and this book in particular. He's colorful, adventurous and always teaching something about the big picture, but what I like the most are the surprising thoughts that come to mind when reading his books. This one is no exception.Here you have O'Hanlon himself as the bumbling explorer, thrusting himself in that British ill-prepared way into this violent new world. Then there's Luke, the young and intrepid scientist out to discover all he can about the inner depths of this world, an endless appetite for information. And who does he give this information to? None other than the man with the power to do the most damage to this very environment: the heavily in debt captain of a fishing trawler! This tossing and turning little boat then is nothing more than a microcosm of colonization. Put them on land and by the time this zany bunch is through, the land's all mapped, resources found, forests felled and the large animals killed off. It's ready, in other words, for our farms, our civilization.Note to self: be more careful about information and who you hand it to (like this review!), you never know how it's going to be used."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Each time I (re)read this book it terrifies me. As an ex-seaman I have no difficulty in recalling the necessary details, sensations and vision to \\"be there\\" with this fine scientific eccentric and it sincerely scares me. I once narrowly escaped being made a Fleet Auxiliary Officer that would have entailed duties in the very seas O'Hanlon describes - but even back then, forty years ago, I knew enough of \\"The Fishing\\" to quickly escape from that particular opportunity!The book is best described in one of its jacket blurbs - unusually brilliant - \\"Trawler reads like The Perfect Storm meets Monty Python\\".Because of true Sleep Deprivation, a technique known to the author from his training and exploring with the SAS, the on-board conversations of all the crew soon degenerate into pure \`stream of consciousness', the \`crack-up'. But the best cracking is between Redmond, our Mad Scientists and a younger courageous Lifeboatman and Marine Biologist studying for his PhD who unwittingly undertakes to become Redmond's teacher. Amongst the hilarity there is some true science to be gleaned, about fish, yes of course but from Redmond's other adventures (Into the Heart of Borneo, Congo Journey) the key to the strength of the Spartans Army through homosexual love, the role of serotonin in the high rate of young American suicides, and how the League of Nations Polio Eradication efforts may have led to accidental spread of HIV by developing the vaccine locally in green monkeys instead of using the European stream, grown in cattle.There is a moment of potential embarrassment for avid readers when the two scientists, in mid rave, in mid storm, discuss the \`bookish' O'Hanlon. He is accused by Luke, the biologist, of being \`the kind of freak' who smells the inside of any new book.The sheer horrific hardships of the Trawlermen beggar belief, working conditions none of us would casually accept and even fewer, tolerate. The sleep deprivation is extreme and suffered each trip as the nets are shot and recovered and the fish gutted, sorted and boxed down into ice. Storms - terrifying storms in little ships - cold, lack of sleep, comfort and family, often poor wages, high risk of death .. it is still today the most deadly of all professions.We must eat more fish, if we have not already allowed commercial meal factories to totally deplete our oceans. We must help \\"The Fishing' afford safer and better conditions for these extreme, brave, hunters.

In this book, we enjoy the usual O'Hanlon comic genius. But this is truly a phenomenal immersion into the trawler world. Rather than describing that world, he becomes part of it and speaks from within. Redmond should be awarded for this work of art. Read it, enjoy it, and appreciate what he has done!"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"So, you take a bunch of men, put them on a fishing ship in the middle of a hurricane without sleep and magic ensues. It is, of course, confused, testosterone soaked madness and poetry, but that is what is both unique and wonderful about this book. If you want spare elegance, there is always the wonderful John McPhee, but for funny, touching, self-deprecating charm O'Hanlon is your guide.As for those who didn't like the book... treat 'em like trashfish. Chuck them over the side into the spuming brine."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Redmond O'Hanlon lost me on this one. There are a handful of fine vignettes of daily life and duty aboard the ship in \\"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic.\\" But those few succulent morsels are seriously outdone by a ponderous, rambling narrative, dashed off late at night which he never revisits to polish up, which simply, tires you out.I was disappointed because as an armchair adventurer, this could have been the type of tale I relish. But O'Hanlon's writing here is sloppy and loose, unstructured with lots of tangents that lead to dead-ends. It was too heavy to shake off.I can't recommend this book as a book of its type. There are many other seafaring adventure tales that \\"tell the tale well.\\" You might glance through this book and find the few juicy morsels but that's it."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"These guys go out in crazy weather to catch the tuna and lobster that we all easily go to the restaurant or grocery and buy to cook and eat.

But it's all about the fish and who can get the most fish, and hoping your family, if you still have one when you return, will come meet you at the dock when you return and be happy to see you. It is better for those that do and pretty depressing for those that don't. I never hear any mention of health insurance or extended time out with pay for a vacation or anything like that. You either go out or you stay home and relax and make no money. It's an interesting crowd to be around. I maay have to go visit the local bar there just to see it for myself!"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"New to O'Hanlon's work, I wasn't sure what to expect; however, I did not expect some of the outright \\"laugh out loud\\" passages in a book about going to sea in the North Atlantic in a Force 12 storm."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I admit, I'm a fan, but I still think this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Redmond O'Hanlon's style takes a bit of getting used to, but once there, that style can take you to amazing places. I noticed one reviewer saying to ingore the \\"manic rants\\", but they are just part of the magic ways O'Hanlon draws you into what must have been a truly bizarre world."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"This book has an interesting premise, adventure journey in the depths of winter into the harshest gales with the most foolhardy of fishermen on the North Seas. It's not an easy read, the narrative is disjointed and erratic. It's difficult to comprehend the purpose of most of the author's rambling passages other than to give you that woozy sense of nausea. At that, it succeeded. Like some of the other readers, the most pleasure I had from this book was realizing that I did not have to finish it."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"More pictures(they supposedly took tons of pictures of things you don't see everyday) would have made this book of incoherent babble more interesting.I finally tossed it aside before I finished.Overall disappointing compared to the early reviews.

Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them? Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's \\"Trawler\\".O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye! O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.\\"Trawler\\" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel. I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon. Aye! I won't! Never!"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"So you've noticed. Some reviewers give enthusiastic accolades, while others seem to denounce it. But why such polarized views?This is where the \\"expectation\\" can ruin your appetite. It is probably safe to say that Trawler by Redmond O'Hanlon is a unique and unusual read for everyone. The book could have discussed a plethora of political, economical and ecological issues surrounding Scottish fishing industry. Or could the scholastic O'Hanlon have delved into the biology of deep sea fauna. Each of such approaches would have led to a great story, but as it is, Trawler is about something else.O'Hanlon chose to limit himself to what had actually happened aboard a commercial trawler out in the frigid North Atlantic. He decided to focus on a handful of unfamiliar experiences that made his trip very special; the relentless weather and the incessant physical labors, the severe sleep deprivation, the encyclopedic knowledge displayed by a young biology student on the ship and the curious comradeship (or shall we say, the shipmateship) among the rough, hard-talking crews.The horrific weather is evident throughout the book; the simplest move is with utmost difficulty. And the first casualty is, of course, the author's GI tract. There is very little sense of time passing, which testifies to the hectic but monotonous nature of the trade. But most importantly, it is the sense of sleep deprivation (miserable brain malfunction) that O'Hanlon succeeds most in conveying; the bombardment of non-stop, uncontrollable, loosely structured sentences. A big chaos. A real stream-of-consciousness. But he manages to stop short of becoming gibberish. Yes, there are numerous chaotic passages, but they are there to help the (mock) experience of the reader. With all these, Trawler still manages to be informative; Greenland halibut and Orange roughy (critically overfished in the North Atlantic; try to avoid them at grocery store), a fear of becoming uxorious (being overly fond of one's wife) and the concept of sexual selection and alpha mates (O'Hanlon seems to be obsessed with this).O'Hanlon has an aloof sense of humor but is also poignant at a few key moments. Overall, it is an entertaining read. About two-thirds into the book, at the height of this all-neurons-gone-haywire, O'Hanlon's conversation with one of the most rugged shipmates of all, Robbie, reaches a revelation; the reason why he approached this book in the way he did. A good effort."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I usually like O'Hanlon's books...I usually can't put them down. But this one...well, I'm just not sure I like it at all. Written in what O'Hanlon, I'm sure, thinks is a style akin to the sleep-deprived ramblings he must have encountered on the trawler, the book instead veers into incoherence and becomes only annoying. Revelations only work if you feel some sympathy and identification with the speaker and I found the speakers, with one exception, highly uninteresting and unsympathetic. Only big Bryan held my interest and I wanted to hear more from him.I found myself heartily sick of Luke, the walk-on-water marine biologist...he was like an orchestra work comprised of one note, played over and over and over. Jason the skipper...same thing. O'Hanlon invests them with a false nobility that just grates on the nerves after awhile.I can't recommend this book, but I heartily recommend O'Hanlon's other works."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"After reading \\"In Trouble Again\\" and \\"Into the Heart of Borneo\\" I had pegged O'Hallahan as a prime example of the British \\"Fish out of water, funny things happen\\" school of travel writing. Sort of Bill Bryson in really exotic places. And I really liked these books.\\"Trawler\\" is something else, though. The setting this time is not some tropical jungle, but a fishing vessel in the middle of a winter storm in the Northern Atlantic. Nature becomes a terrorizing presence that robs the people on the boat of peace of mind and sleep, and leads to frenzied, almost delusional conversations about everything from life on small islands to marine biology. The pace is close to Hunter Thompson's drug-addled ramblings, but here it is driven by the need to make sense of at least something in the face of the on-slaught of the elements.The ideas expressed in the book would be interesting even if expressed in a more conventional setting, but the rythm that is pushed onto the people on the boat by the storm makes it irresitable. As much as I liked \\"The Lobster Chronicles\\", I don't think it holds a candle to this book."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Since reading the stories of the U-Boats and convoys in the North Atlantic in the middle of winter I've always wanted to see what it was like.This book cured me of any possible thoughts I might have had about actually doing something about it.Apparently the author had some of the same ideas. Unlike me he actually did something about it. I'm glad he did, now I don't have to. I learned from him that I especially do not want to go see the North Atlantic on a fishing trawler.The book is kind of strange in its way of writing. But I think he was trying to capture the actual nature of the conversations being conducted by sleep deprived men. He couldn't write this way, he couldn't think this way normally and be the successful author he is. I think that writing like this shows a lot more talent than the normal travelogue.This is a book that will make you think strange thoughts as you look at a piece of fish on your plate. If you want a book on going strange places, this is clearly the one."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"O'Hanlon has done as good a job as any with the given material. The book premise - go out fishin' on a trawler for a few weeks in the North Atlantic in the middle of winter. By the end of the book you certainly have a sense of it - arduous, stinking, sleep deprived, and relentless. He tries to portray his shipmates, mostly louts, as interesing and half succeeds. He attempts to make the specifics of trawling interesting but how could you? The book sinks under O'Hanlons rambling conversations with his mentor Luke most of which are not even vaguely interesting. O'Hanlon himself becomes an embarrassing burden to the crew as they grind toward their quota. It is in this burden that the theme solidifies - 'trawler life sucks'."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"My admiration for O'Hanlon's previous work lead me to this latest,somewhat muddled, endeavor.Somewhere in \\"Trawlers\\" 330 plus pages is a decent 300 page book.there is much to like here; vivid descriptions of life on a commercial fishing boat and the men who risk their lives in this most dangerous of vocations,some fascinating(sleep deprivation induced) steam of conscious ruminations, and some real human drama.But there are also enough pointless interjections and banal parenthetical asides to sink a trawler.Och, Redmond! (Old Worzel), where's your editor?"},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"O'Hanlon's story of his decsion to go to sea at the age of 51under the worst conditions imaginable is both hilarious andand educational. Working with a crew who are 20 years his junior,he faces long periods of sleep deprivation, incredible coldand dangerous working conditions that the crew just take forgranted.The crew are a likable bunch and the conversations they have after hours of hard work and no sleep are surrealistic and very funny. Marine biologist Luke's knowledge of the strange creatures that come up in the nets is mind-boggleing. A good sea story that gives credit due to people who work in one of theworld's most dangerous professions."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"REDMOND O'HANLON'S latest book, Trawler, reads just like the behemoth fishing vessel upon which it purports to report. It's a lumbering, slow-moving tome that searches relentlessly for a nourishing tidbit to dredge-up from some murky depth..O'Hanlon's heavy work might have been an insightful article had it been restricted to 2000 words and published in an industry rag such as TRAWLER TIMES, but at 339 pages it quickly becomes bogged in the doldrums.There are a few choice passages to be sure, but mostly it reads like a journal kept by a precocious and often sulky 14-year-old sea scout. And being English, O'Hanlon is given to whimsical asides the likes of which often give the impression that this scout was more than a bit petulant.Long passages of this book seem like wordy conversations simply transcribed, without edit, from some hidden recording device. There literally appears page after page of stream of consciousness-like observations, served up without paragraph breaks or meaningful insights.The overwhelming detail borders on the redundant, the character sketches seem incomplete, and the author's dense commentary so buried amongst the many pages that at times one would like to just tie a rope to this book and use it as an anchor.By the end of the volume, I felt as though it were I who had stood days on end in the fish cleaning room, repeatedly performing the same mindless task, but rather than gutting haddock, in this instance, it was the bloody drudgery of page turning."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"...than any other fishing story I have ever read, including the one about that big white whale.

It is a series of manic run-on sentences that are extremely distracting and hard to follow. It does depict some of the danger and difficulty inherent in fishing the North Atlantic in winter but deviates so often from the original topic that it is a waste of time.

Which, coincidentally enough, seems to be the impression that O'Hanlon's shipmates got of him after a few wretched days together with him at sea.I bought this book expecting perhaps high seas adventure, or relevant human observation, or even clear scientific insight on the order of KON TIKI or THE PERFECT STORM or BLUE LATITUDES or THE HUNGRY OCEAN or THE RAFT or ROUGH WATER. Instead, what I got, was an unholy hybrid of Hunter S. Thompson and Spongebob Squarepants. O'Hanlon's prose is so dense and manic and just plain stupid, you alternate between cringing in embarrassment on his behalf and chuckling at the insults his fellow shipmates hurl at him.A few relevant cultural observations do eventually seep through...the clash of cultures between \\"southern\\" England vs. Scotland and even the far northern islands of Orkney and Shetland is deeply felt and sometimes humorous, for example. And, again, one admires the piercing critiques offered by the \\"uneducated\\" trawlermen with regard to O'Hanlon's intellectual pride and vapidity.There is enough profanity, blasphemy, and over-the-top Christian bashing in the book to satisfy the most vitriolic athiest. But, even vitriolic athiests need a good story, and they won't find it in this book.

In fact, maybe, there's too much mercy -- depends upond how one feels about male bonding. Neverless, I've rarely read a more rivetting tome, really -- I'm talking finest kind here. It's just ... well, I don't know what to think of it yet.It's not like anything I ever read before ... and, fron O'Hanlon, that has to be a good thing -- but difficult to describe. Quite amazing.

He glances over all the technical details of the fishing, and concentrates on the conversations of the crew. This turns the book into an incoherent rambling, jumping from topic to topic. It's never quite clear what is fact and what is lore. The book is similar to listening to random conversations at a cocktail party where you don't know anybody, except it is mainly about mating rituals of different fish mixed with British accent swearwords.I would much more recommend \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" and \\"Lobster Chronicles \\" by Linda Greenlaw, or \\"Working on the Edge\\" and \\"Coming Back Alive\\" by Spike Walker."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"I went fifty pages.

O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts."},{"Title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea. So I was really looking forward to this book. I have never read a book more disappointing. The writing is almost impossible to follow. The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding. Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person. I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm. This book is not worth reading."},{"Title":"Nurse with a Problem","review":"From the back of the book: 'Only her work as a hospital nurse kept Noelle Carlyon from giving way to despair when her sister Leoni married Timothy Yorke - the man Noelle loved. Knowing that Leoni was not in love with Timothy made the position even harder to accept; Noelle could foresee tragedy for her spoilt young sister.Then John Corringway, a brilliant young surgeon, proposed marriage to Noelle, but Noelle, whose emotions were still centred on Timothy, could not accept, for her there should be no marrige without shared, equal love.A trip to South Africa gave Noelle time to clear her confused thoughts, but she had yet to play a part in a tragedy before she found true happiness.'"},{"Title":"Buckling Strength of Metal Structures.","review":"This is a classic book in the subject of structural stability.

We are using it for home school, and are very impressed with the fact that it's not just words, but several activities along with the vocabulary.

It was great advice and I want to contribute in the same way. These two books have already helped me in my career and given me added confidence.This book is one that will be helpful in dissecting some of the tedious, even boring language of leases. If you're in commercial real estate, it's hard to ignore because that's where half the work is. It breaks down topics into digestable chunks.Clients will expect you to know this stuff and lead them through a maze of commercial issues. The key is not to be an expert in everything but to have familiarity with the topics that invariably come up. When it's over your head, you need to defer to your team of trusted advisors, be it legal, accounting or engineering resources for instance. However, when it's suppose to be in your head and it's not, you can refer to this lease book time and time again and prepare yourself with the knowledge you need.I recommend this highly to people starting out in commercial real estate.

Not so! Burroughs knew what he was doing. He just had an extremely odd vision of the world (and an interesting new writing style to tell the world about it). He saw irrationality in rationality. Reading Naked Lunch, you'll have to see vice versa if you want to learn anything. The going-ons in the book seem bizarre (and they are), but they're actually directly parallel to the going-ons of the modern world such as fascism and overall hypocrisy. And if you don't want to learn anything, good enough. This book is funny as anything, and it's good to have a laugh. The shock value is something to read too (this book works on so many levels). It's still more shocking than anything else out there. It's hard to imagine what people thought of this when it was published in the 50's (the fact that it was banned tells you something, I suppose).Read this book. Even if you're bound to hate it, I'd still reccomend it. Reading it isn't as hard some would have you believe. This book is just cool."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is, to say the least, not for everyone. One of the main addictions featured in it is of course addiction to heroin, but the novel is about so much more than that. It's about addiction of any kind whether it's to drugs, money, power, or sex. Here we are introduced to Dr. Benway (a behavioral conditioning freak), a man who teaches his rectum how to talk, and to a group of people to hang themselves to feel that final orgasm which is rumored to be more powerful than any others you could ever have. In this book Burroughs also takes a swipe at the media and the written word (or \\"word-virus\\") in general, trying to destroy the importance of the narrative. Burroughs believed the media used language to control the way we think; I read somewhere that he called Time and Life magazine \\"some kind of police force for the mind.\\" Some call this paranoia, others call it genius. I suggest you read this book and decide for yourselves."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The first time I read &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; I was 17 years old and wouldn't know &quot;cut-up&quot; from &quot;collage&quot; either in painting or in literature. I did, however, enjoy the book immensely and the images and sensations (some would say thrills) it provided were enough to get my teenage mind going in all sorts of directions.Five years passed and as I now read it again I can feel the same exhilaration I felt then. Surely it's a masterpiece, a truly innovative book that opened then, and should still open now, new paths for written expression. The subject matter may offend you, since it's very graphic in its descriptions of homossexual sex, drugs and other &quot;violence&quot;.Just one last tip. As the author himself writes this book should be read not linearly but randomly, so to speak. Just open it on any page, any paragraph, any line, any word and start reading. Why should the way it was written not be the way it is read?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This is the one book that stretches the definitions of just about every classification ever made about it. Although it contains a whole lot of fiction (people turn into centipedes, scorpions, oozing masses of ectoplasm, etc.), it contains just as much stuff from William S. Burroughs' real life. However, he manages to blend all of it together in such a way that you can't tell just what's going on until about 50 pages into the book.It's certainly a daunting task trying to separate the wheat from the chaff the first time that you read it, but about halfway through, you start to understand Burroughs' bizarre sense of black humor, and you can begin to laugh at things like Steely Dan (a strap-on used by a characters girl-friend to... uh... bugger him) and A.J.'s various exploits (bringing a baboon into a bar, but trying to pass it off as a poodle).However, this book is not for everyone. If you are uncomfortable with things like frank depictions of the effects diseases (real and imagined), gay sex, and drug use by just about everyone from politicians to doctors (during surgery), then this book will send you screaming from the library. On the other hand, if those things don't bother you, this could easily become your favorite book of all time. Along with NAKED LUNCH, I'd like to recommend THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez. Thanks to the previous reviewer who recommended it."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch was the book whose landmark 1965 obscenity trial ensured literary freedom in the United States. Released shortly after its author, William S. Burroughs, regained control of his life after a fifteen-year addiction to opiates, Naked Lunch reads like a junky's account of a small, incredible period of time full of the extreme and incredible and told in a rambling, sometimes incoherent stream of conscious as if the author's mental health could produce nothing concrete. Feeling threatened by sadistic U.S. law enforcement, drug pusher and habitual user, Bill Lee, flees to Interzone a surrealist netherworld in Mexico filled with extremes of brutality, poverty, politics and madness. The book presents such unforgettable characters as sadistic medical artist, Dr. Benway; crude, international prankster, AJ and moraless drug dealer, Fats Terminal. In the forward of another novel, Queer, Burroughs states that his actual time in Mexico was made more enjoyable by the primitive nature of the citizens which Burroughs found oddly humorous, stating simple disputes ending in savagery and all types of what Americans would consider lewdness. Approach Naked Lunch as you would the account in Queer's foreword: An incredible account from a not-to-dependable source who has been to places and mindsets you will never experience and you will be strangely compelled to think how much of this savage book was based on an actual experiences or actual truths concerning cruelty Burroughs experienced. I think it was meant to be read as such considering the book of first released under the pseudonym of its main character. Of coarse being based in a fictional area of Mexico does not mean Naked Lunch has no parallel to life in the states. I can't help but see satire of America's social structure during the scenes portraying Interzone's political parties and scenes portraying its class stratification. Written superbly with beatnik-style lyricism, Naked Lunch presents wonderful satire and a confrontational nature destined to appeal to those of us with more extreme senses of humor."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is, for better or worse, the key to most people's experience of Burroughs' writing. And they either love it or hate it. Most people I talk to say they couldn't get through it, and this is easy to understand. What is it about this book that people keep talking about it?So NL was/is a revolutionary book, and reading it for the first time can be a fireworks experience. At the same time it must be admited that the writing is uneven - since everything was so new, he and his fellow editors could hardly tell what to keep and what to discard. NL is like visiting a genetics lab before they've had a chance to throw out all the failures.Naked Lunch is a record of a Burroughs' writing break-through. He started trying to write another Junky (see NL's first chapter) and ends up trying to destroy language (the cut-ups he slips into the end of the book - contrary to common belief, NL is not a &quot;cut-up&quot; book in the sense of the technique Burroughs later employed).My own advice to first-time readers is to skip or skim the first chapter, which drags and creates a wrong impression of the rest of the book. Thereafter you should read as the mood takes you, receiving the writing as a series of darkly-humorous skits, lectures and moods.It's perfectly valid to just dip into the book anywhere, and read for as long as the mood holds you. The structure Burroughs' originally planned for this book was disposed of in the final edit, and the published version is almost completely random. The book may also be a little disconcerting because of its period - a lot of the satires and characters relate specifically to the repressive USA of the late 1950's, and many of these archetypes are now extinct.Finally, it's important to remember what came after the revolution - Naked Lunch was only the beginning. The 1960's saw his strangest period - the &quot;cut-ups&quot; - when he pursued his destructive/creative technique as a philosophy, and pushed it beyond all rational limits. The 1970's and 80's saw another revolution - the return to narrative, in a distinctly Burroughs way, and a refinement and enrichment of his style. Some would consider his finest writing to be in these later works."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I find it very scary that William S. Burroughs lived his life in the grip of these heroine-induced hallucinations, and that people walk around everday seeing the things that are documented in this book. Some of the parts of the book were very funny, some were stomach-turning, and most were unintelligable."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"From my observations of the reviews thus far on amazon I have noticed two polar sides. On side--open minded, and unfortunately somtimes excessively pretensious people, saying that it's a masterpiece. On the other side--More structured people, and unfortuanately somtimes excessively close minded people, claiming that they hated it. Now instead of espousing my opinion, or regurgitating others, I figured to give a sort of guide. The more open minded type, if they actually enjoyed it, liked the effect of chaos and poetry woven throughout the book. They like the idea of escaping from the boundaries of conventional plot and character development, and experienceing somthing new. On the other had, the more conservative group of people feel differently. They are bothered by a lack of plot structure, and they are confused by the meaning of the book. So who are you? Are you willing to read an esoteric dark comedy with a challanging plot line and grotesque descriptions... or would you rather read a Tom Clancy book? Their is no shame in either--just read what you enjoy..."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is a seminal 20th century novel, but it probably isn't as widely read as it deserves to be. Many potential readers may be driven away by its total abscence of plot, its notorious obscenity, and its sporadic and impenetrable hallucinogenic passages.The novel is not as inacessible as its reputation suggests; the first step towards a better understanding of this beat classic is researching its background, and its author. William S. Burroughs was an eccentric who went through phases of obsession with various esoteric themes, and he wrote Naked Lunch during the height of his obsessions with control, dehumanization and addiction. The novel itself is edited down from a thousand pages of 'notes' and is not meant to be ingested as a continuous whole - as Burroughs suggests in the introduction, you can jump in at any point.Read some of Burroughs' essays, read about the Beat generation, and read Burroughs' more straightforward debut 'Junky,' and things will begin to come together in the surreal satire that is 'Naked Lunch.' The bizarre images and phrases will convey the bleak poetry they were meant to in the first place."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"That this book is considered a literary classic is probably due more to its utter uniqueness for its time period than its literary merit. I realized halfway through, and Burroughs says it in the \\"Atrophied Preface,\\" that you can pick this book up, start at any page in it, and not lose any of its narrative. That should tell you something about the narrative, or lack thereof. As for the imagery, it is perhaps some of the most vile, violent, grotesque depictions of hell or nightmare I have ever read. Parts of it made me physically queasy. In that regard, it is a powerful book and I applaud Burroughs' abilities. At the same time, though, I admit I enjoyed very little of this book. Working in a creative profession, I've been warned more than once about getting drunk or high and expecting it to enhance my creative output. I've tried it, and the best I've ever written drunk is hardly coherent sober. That's how I felt about much of Naked Lunch. When a master of Burroughs' obvious literary talent shoots up and then spills his head onto the page, there are bound to be moments of brilliance and depth. But as a whole, perhaps I would have enjoyed reading this more had I not been completely sober."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"As I have explained in another entry in this space in reviewing the DVD of \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I mentioned there, as well, and I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on Jack Kerouac's seminal \`travelogue' \\"On The Road\\", that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space.Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of his better known works dedicated to Lowell's \\"bad boy\\", the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers, Jack Kerouac. And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Neal Cassady and a whole ragtag assortment of poets, hangers-on, groupies and genuine madmen and madwomen come to mind. They all showed up, one way or another (under fictional names of course- Burroughs as Bull Lee), in Kerouac's \\"On The Road\\". So that is why we today, fifty years after its original publication (after much literary and governmental controversy), are under the sign of Burroughs' minor classic \\"Naked Lunch\\".Minor classic? Well, yes. The various sketches, pieces and partials that make up the commentary in this science fiction-like exposition is filled with \\"weird \\" characters and likewise is filled with future prophecies that became, in some cases like AIDS-type diseases, realities at a later time. No question this is a difficult book to get through cold sober. In fact I put it down a few times before I completed it back in the day. But look at it this way, if Kerouac represented a different way of telling a story through his use of spontaneous writing Burroughs also showed innovation by taking the haphazard, the derelict and the off-beat and made literary music out of it.Maybe not your music, or for that matter mine, but surely music nevertheless. This \\"novel\\", moreover, extols thing that today are rather taken for granted like illegal(and in the book and in Burroughs personal life seemingly excessive) drug use, homosexuality, the use of \`obscene language', the dehumanization of modern society. Sound familiar? Of course, but Burroughs said it when it was not fashionable to do so. No wonder he was the \\"mentor\\" for those young kids, Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso, etc. when they hit New York in the mid-1940s looking for \\"something\\"."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is one of the few books that poeple will never take the time and thought to recognize its powerful meanings. When I read this book, I found myself slipping from reality a sentence at a time. Few books have the power to do that. And few authors are willing to go to that extreme. William Burroughs was definitely not afraid of the reactions he might get with this one, he poored his emotions, whether they make sense to anyone or not, and that is very admirable and brave. With Naked Lunch, you'll either despise it or love it, and many poeple won't understand it till about the third time through, but it's well worth the struggle in the end. It shows what most poeple are afraid of seeing and creates disturbing and descriptive images that many authors try to do, but fail . It has the power to open anyone's eyes to the reality of this world."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I couldn't read the book the first time through. The second time, I started in the middle, read through, and looped back around the beginning. It was great. As soon as I could get past my need to rationalize and HANG ON to things, it was fabulous. Let go and read. You'll get frustrated and realize just how programmed you are to need to be lead and entertained like a mindless puppet. You might even have the mind to throw the book across the room in disgust that you just can't hang on to the story. Perfect. Burroughs has succeeded."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"(...) The pages of this book were scattered about Burroughs Moroccan den known as Villa Delirium, written during a several month long binge......There is no strict story line just scenes, all of which take place in America. Drugs were Burroughs way of reordering experience according to his need and so thats what the reader gets. The sex is of the extremely unusual kind and is what caused all the controversy about this book upon its publication. The defense of the book by other authors like Ginsberg and Mailer is insightful for the light it sheds on Beat values which will never be mistaken for middle American values, nevertheless the book won its right to exist and remains amazingly popular among retrobeats. The court case is usually summarized in the preface of editions of the book, sort of like a cartoon to prime you for the feature. Weirder writing you will be hard pressed to find. A summary of the book is not a reasonable request but I will say there are some good scenes(\\"they are rebuilding the city again....\\") which reveal a state of mind, or an orientation to reality that anyone who has experienced a hangover will be able to comprehend. Be American, assert your rights as a reader and read this un-American manifesto destructo. Its a gas."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"A work of art that I could not put down from the very start. Burroughs takes you to a confused fantasy world that is terribly brutal, but express his views of politics, drug use, capital punishiment, and society, in a funny, comedic light.

Open your mind, open this book and prepared to be terrified and laugh your ass off at the same time."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Wow, this is an unbelievable book which has no equal, disguised as a self analysis of herion addiction, nobody would doubt the social or political significance of this book.

It's a nightmarish dive into a drug addicits' mind in which turns into a variety of &quot;routines&quot; that will linger with the reader for a very long time. This is the best book to read out of the beat generation and will give would-be novelist a different idea of what a &quot;novel&quot; can do and should be."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Don't worry if you feel like your watching a foreign film in a language you don't speak, with a hidden plot. However, I don't think the plot is the essential element to this work: it is the characters. Even if you don't have a clue to what's going on, sit back and enjoy the variety of rich, complex characters that Naked Lunch has to offer."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"To fully understand Mr. Burroughs' novels (especially this one) the reader must be completely honest with themselves- attempt to remove conditioning from their internal mental processes and permit their mind to wander through the artist's world of naked reality... one finds their own relative space within such a raw painting of existence- standing naked with Mr. Burroughs confronted by the complexities of humanity interacting according to some notion of society."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I must admit, I only grabbed this book because a character in another book I read was into Burroughs. That, and he was compared to my favorite author and thinker- Jack Kerouac. Even people that don't love the Beat generation will fall in love with Naked Lunch. It is very descriptive and will put some pretty crazy pictures in your head. No, its not for everyone, nor do I think people that aren't interested should read it. But, it is a definate beatnik classic- so fellow open-minded thinkers- READ ON. And if you're worried about its profane nature and illicit foulness, fear not- I read it in ninth grade, and am letting my ninth grader read it now."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"A friend recommended NL to me, without preparing me for the literary experience I was about to embark upon. Burroughs puts to pen his hellish experiences as an addict to junk. The characters and plot fade into a nightmarish landscape of Mugwumps, centipedes, mad doctors, and corrupt cops, who have the nasty habit of disolving the essence of others into themselves.Burroughs plays with words the way Charlie Parker or Coltrane played with notes and rifts of music. There is high poetry found in these pages, with much to enlighten and much to offend (or scare off) the squimish or self-rightous. This book will challenge and expand the limits of the open-minded, it will entertain and horrify, it will repel and make you laugh outloud.Convinced yet? Naked Lunch should be on the reading menu of everyone."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs takes the reader on a tour de force journey inside the mind and experiences of a junkie. The novel is unlike any other your will ever be likely to read. The scenes of the Black Mass in James Joyce's Ulyssess, inside an Irish whore house, are perhaps the closest literary experience to Burrough's Naked Lunch. Ironically, for a noble and steadfast reader, Burroughs places the &quot;prologue&quot; for NL at the end of the book. I found reading this very helpful to understanding the novel, as much as I could understand it on first read.Burrough's placement is not arbertrary, to say the least. In that moment of &quot;waking clarity&quot; that preceeds sobriety, and eventually, kicking junk for good, (&quot;there are no old junkies&quot;, Burroughs reminds us), the glimmers of sanity from obscure madness shine through at this point.Naked Lunch is not for the casual reader. It is a book to be devoured and continplated, and frequently leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Such is addiction to junk, nothing glamerous, only pain, death, madness, and the relentless search for the next fix.But for those willing to embark on this journey into hell, be advised that the best advice, echoed by several reviewers here, is to just read the words and don't force a meaning into them...you will find no meaning in addiction to junk, only pathos and dispair."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is a rollercoaster ride; filled with thrills and chills but definitely not for the squeamish. If you have a narrow view of what fiction should be and what it should or should not contain, then don't even bother. Your mind will be challenged by the visions that are offered up here; all of it written in a book without chapters. Some of it reads like drama, some are litle vignettes, and other parts more resemble unstructured short stories, and you will find an occassional segment that is more of an essay than fiction. If you find yourself up to the challenge you will find not the spaced-out ravings of a... but a true gem of literature and a genius of an author."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I would love to pour on and on about Mr. Burroughs and this book. I want to spew forth thoughtful, intelligent, and academic critiques of Naked Lunch. I would love to dwell on the symbolism and the genius present in the text and analize it, break it apart, and teach those who cannot see, how to. Moreso, I would love to explain that it is more than a drug induced, hypnotic, homo-erotic, chronical of hell........ but, sadly, I can not. Following the point, structure, and overall theme of the book, I think it would destroy the very meaning the book holds by dissecting it, praising it, offering my mediocre take on Mr. Burroughs masterpiece. Such works can not be explained. They create a thought, an idea, a feeling within the reader that can not be expressed, and therein lies the genius. Naked Lunch has left me awestruck, and examining life on a whole different level. I feel dirty, exhilerated, perverted, emaciated, withdrawn, euphoric, and numb after reading it. I feel, this was Burroughs intent."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"After reading the introduction I assumed (stupidly) that this book would be a worthwhile endeavor. After reading the majority of it (it is required for a course in literature) I felt as if it were useless trash. I understand the ravings of a junky could be wild and yet I find no value in this book. I dare not consider it literature and I am uncertain as to whether it should be considered fiction. Did this happen? To whom? My professor claims it to be satiracle and yet this is not to be remembered (much) by the author. I suppose that it has left me confused and astounded. Perhaps I am more of a prude than I would have imagined"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is one of those books that people talk about a lot, but probably never actually read. If Burroughs's intention is to shock, sicken, and disgust the reader, then he accomplishes that task. Not only hard to understand (does it even HAVE a point??), but grotesquely profane, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Save yourself the money, and rent the film instead, which has absolutley nothing to do with the book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I searched far and wide on the net and other places to find out what exactly is the PLOT of this book. You all remember plot, right? Novels usually have plots. I keep reading that it's this hallucinogenic, psychedelic, quasi-sci-fi weirdo drug novel about drug-addiction, and an allegorical battle between Good and Evil; Individualistic (as well as drug-addicted) &quot;good-guys&quot; fighting uniformist, totalitarian, evil &quot;bad guys.&quot; Reading this, I very vaguely found something like that. But this book seems to be an almost random splatter of grammar-lacking wording and nonsensical statements. There's no true form. Burroughs will be talking about something, and just when you think you might've caught on to what the heck is going on, it gets all freaky and nasty and random and--BLAH! The sex scenes are vulgar--I mean a beyond-hardcore pornographer on acid would throw up reading this stuff--and not only mindbendingly, gratuitously vulgar, but constant! There's always mentionings of &quot;cunts&quot; and &quot;cocks&quot; and &quot;sperm&quot; and &quot;fags&quot; and crap! Is that stuff really necessary? The stuff is chemically-induced scribblings, based on nightmarish drug hallucination. That would be cool if he added order and storyline to the thing! Where are the fights between Good and Evil? Where's the fight for Individuality against conformist totalitarianism? Heck, where is the STORY? Where's the order? The book's sloppy, vulgar, random, and a sickening letdown! All these people giving such rave reviews for this weird acid pulp made to rot, I would probably appreciate this &quot;novel&quot; a bit more if someone explained it to me! I prefer storylines in my books. I like surreality and weirdness in my fiction, but from now on I'll consult the likes of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and Franz Kafka for that kind of fiction rather than Mr. Burroughs."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"If you want to see what a journal would be like of a man dealing with his own personal demons and putting his mad network of thoughts onto paper (while making an exception for some thoughts being attributed to his drugged state), this book will be fascinating to you.If you generally enjoy novels with some form of linear or non-linear story, enjoy multi-dimensional or even consistent characters, do not look in this direction.I think the best description I can think of for this novel would be \\"a collection of 3-page surreal vignettes readable in any order.\\" A secondary caveat would be that a lot of the language he uses seems to have inside references -- think of your group of junior high friends and the words you made up with each other.As far as the language goes, it seems to be a mix of now-dated street slang, Clockwork Orangesque made-up slang, dashed with a few $10 words here and there.Why two stars? Again, for a bit of a hint as to what the author is about and for some interesting information about the obscenity trial at the start of the book.Why not five stars?1) Being shocked doesn't make a five star book (and given the state of the internet it's mighty hard to shock someone these days).2) Most of the social commentary on topics such as the death penalty are few and far between. Those claiming that the commentary is dense in the book are usually grasping at symbolic straws.3) Probably the most subjective, the book itself as art. If you think this book may have five-star potential for you as art, grab it from your local library, read the first 10 pages while standing by the bookshelves. I doubt there are many that can get through the first 10 without deciding how they feel about the work as a whole right then and there. To anyone that says \\"you can't decide how great a novel is from the first 10 pages,\\" I ask you this: what if it were discovered in 5 years that the book was originally 2500 pages? Would your opinion now be invalid?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"\\"Naked Lunch\\" is a challenge to read that rewards careful preparation. I got out some sliced turkey, a loaf of bread, and a glass of milk. It was about noon. Then I stripped off my clothes and sat down at the table and started to read. This set the mood, and I found that I understood the points the author was making much better this way. It was a little embarrassing when the magazine salesman came by, but he seemed to understand."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I've read \\"Naked Lunch\\" twice and I keep trying to figure out what the right drug I need is. I am amazed at how ingenious it is, at the originality of the scenes, of the language, of the episodic and deliberately choppy narrative (which seems like a stream of consciousness nonetheless). But I can't agree with those who see the book as any kind of \\"indictment\\" of American society. I don't think it really knows what it is saying; the drugged-outness runs so deep that I can't make out an argument. Not that that's bad. Good literature doesn't need an argument to be good literature. But if you take away this side of Naked Lunch, then you have to throw up your hands at the sections where it SOUNDS like some kind of condemnation and say, \\"Well... Whatever.\\" I guess it's like a picaresque novel on barbiturates.I don't see this as one of American literature's \\"must-reads,\\" except to help gain some sense of the Beat movement and of the kind of stuff that developed in reaction to 1950's pop culture....."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs's vision of decay through the eyes of the junky may be the most innovative (and infuriating) book of the twentieth century. Burroughs blends fact and fiction into a melange of imagery that assaults the senses and purees the brain with its &quot;trust me/trust me not&quot; sensibility. Naked Lunch is like Henry Miller meets Thomas Pynchon (though it's faster than Miller and, in the end, more understandable than Pynchon). Every adult should read this book, if for no other reason than to blast them out of the cocoon of suburban domesticity that we make for ourselves in this day and age. BRAVO"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Quite possibly one of the most difficult reads in the history of mankind. Yet worth it once you do complete it. At it's core this novel is about a man dealing with the outside world he has come to despise. Of course this is being discussed by a man in the major throws of a haroin trip. So of course it's going to be a little graphic. The junky sees the world in a different way than you or I. Burroughs grabs hold of this feeling and reveals it to the world."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This is by far my favorite book of all time. Not only because it's very grotesque, but because Burroughs uses a vast array of imagery to illustrate his novel in the reader's mind. Although the story is shouded in drug related and homosexual exploits, it comes otherger at the end with the appendix and is also brouight together by the forward. This was the first book that I've read that I needed to read the forward to understand the whole point of the book. It may sound laborious to have to read not only the forward but an appendix as well, but it inhances the reading enjoyment of the otherwise hard to follow book. The characters are described in such detail that the reader will see the events unfold before their very eyes, one attribute that Burroughs has mastered wholly. In closing, this book should be read at least once by every man, woman, and everyone in between because it will give us all an insight in to the harsh realities, and not - so realities of drugs and homosexuality."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is quite simply the most deluded, dissonant, shocking, revolting, pornographic, amazing, mood-shifting book I've ever had my pleasure(?) to read. It's not the best 20th century novel, in my opinion. It's very difficult, fantastic, and down-right hillarious. It's hard for me to say that I liked it. I think I did. I couldn't put it down, and it made me crack up at times and boggled my mind. It also shocked the hell out of me and at times I had no idea what was going on or horrid imagery was repeating over and over and over that I could not wait to get through a chapter. Though several of the larger chapters I read three times, I've read the whole book all the way through only once, so it's possible I'll see more and more as I read it again, as reading the large chapters a few times does certainly help. If it's too weird and you cannot handle it (I nearly could not), skip to the last chapters, starting with Islam, Inc. In fact, the second to the last chapter clears things up a good deal, but the novel still seems to be a disordered, incoherent, revolting tool of destruction. If you are looking for something different, or just what to see what the fuss is all about, read it. It is quite simply fucked up."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I was hesitant to give this book a starred review. Can I accurately say that I liked it? Well, yes, I can admire its inventiveness and originality, Burroughs' unwillingness (although surely not intentional, since the book was written in a drug haze) to bow to convention and &quot;decency&quot;, and the sheer audacity of some of it. But also, the book disturbed me. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I also have to frown on the way wannabe beatniks and artsy-types have latched on to this book. It is a book. It is not the best book ever written, it is certainly not the worst, and it may not even be the most daring book ever. I appreciated it, and chances are that somewhere along the line I will read it again (if only to remind myself why I now shudder when I hear anything by or relating to the rock group &quot;Steely Dan&quot;). It's hard to say anything about this book. It really is."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is fantastic, because it is brutally honest in it's use of the written word."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch must be the most horrifying, the most revolting, the most disgusting, the most repulsive, the most depraved, the most obscene book I've ever read. Not that I didn't like it. It has many moments of fine satire and surrealism, though the graphic scenes of homeosexuality and constant profanity are a bit over the top. Consider a scene in which a Mugwump graphically rapes and mutilates a young man. Read Naked Lunch, but only if you have a cast-iron stomach."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I don't think I could add anymore to the multitude of reviews below me without being redundant. The book is fantastic. By far Burroughs best work and the best piece of non-linear writing to come from the beat generation. I have to respond to morbeus' review below. I agree with Burroughs trying to con us, in a way that's true, but the comment on not thinking Burroughs was a day to day junkie slumming it out in morocco in the late fifties is completely untrue. It was the allowance from his parents that allowed him to get into the junk scene in the first place without much effort. By the time he descended to where he was in Morocco he was a full-fledged addict, have no doubt, and I have it on a good source that when Ginsberg did find him in the single room apartment he was very close to gone. Maybe its a misunderstanding of heroin's effects that leads to this belief but there are moments of clarity in between fixes, and there might be a couple of days inbetween fixes (usually when the addict decides he's quit) before resistance wears thin. Burroughs thoroughly used these moments to type. I think the biggest con to the reader, and the best, is how one's lead to believe the book was incedental to his experience when the experience was almost setup to produce the book. In that regard he knew that something could come from this binge, something that would be extremely well suited to his style of cut and paste writing (which is by the way aa attempt to mimic a junkies thought patterns, but I think someone already said that."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs paces across the spectra of feeling and creativity in this classic book (it doesn't really feel like a &quot;novel&quot;). He induces confusion, disgust, hope, insight and various other reactions in the reader, and if the reader &quot;gets&quot; any of it, there is a big payoff. You see, Burroughs is a fantastic writer. He can take absurd situations and make sense out of them, all the while dazzling the reader with his weird feel for structure and plot. I've read this book a dozen times, I think, and I'm always discovering something new. I bought the cassette version, with 80-year-old Burroughs reading the thing, and listening to that turned the book on its head for me, making me appreciate points I hadn't noticed before. So why not a 10? Because this is a cold piece of art, rather than an uplifting experience."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is a personal favorite of mine, I've enjoyed it ever since the second time i read it. The first time I read it, I was quite taken aback at the, umm, interesting content. Past that, I was totally confused, and bewildered. In order to &quot;understand&quot; the book, one must know it's background. Burroughs wrote those words not to confuse the reader, but because they made sense to him at the time, he was going through withdrawal, and in that state, anything goes. If the people who wrote reviews before me had not liked the book because they didn't understand it, what they needed to do was go learn more about Burroughs, and read some of his other books that do make more sense. I highly recommend &quot;Queer&quot;, and &quot;Junky&quot; as guides to the perplexed. and, above all, nothing beats listening to that voice on the audiobook, everything will snap into place, it's a very good book, but you've got to do your homework first."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I guess unless you have been, or intend on being a junkie, it's a very hard and disturbing read. One for the literary elite."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this book is dense with insane intensity, a crazy read that will take you on a constantly looping rollercoaster, a real adrenaline rush."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Imagine a mix of Raymond Chandler, William Blake, Swift and Genet. That is about as close as you will get to Burroughs. But the man is unique. His satire is utterly incisive. His ear for prose and dialouge is impeccable. And his imagination is prolific, as beautiful and truthful as it is violent, vile and so on.Still, Naked Lunch is not for the faint of heart. And my suspicion is that unfortunately, it is also one of those books which, while generally understood by those who have already arrived at an understanding of its core ideas via their own routes, is seldom comprehended by those who haven't.The majority of readers are likely to be left cold, nauseated, or outraged and to come away having failed to connect with what the author is communicating.So before I leap into proclaiming this book as a work of genius and poetry - which it is - I would also add that NL is frequently obscene, gratuitously so. There are plenty of scenes in the which are simply pornographic, and/or grotesquely violent, and which don't have anything more profound to them than that. Not all of the \\"colourful\\" details in NL connote something more than what's there on the surface.That said, this book is serious literature, great literature that has I might add (ad hominem, I know) been praised by the likes of J.G. Ballard, Christopher Isherwood, Angela Carter and Norman Mailer."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"hard to follow in some parts? Oh, yes. Insanely incoherent in other parts? You bet. But, somehow, for some odd reason, I did like this book. There were little meccas of comedy, and strange, perverted truths scattered throughout the text.Alhtough we all know he was on drugs when he wrote it, it's worth a try. If you don't like it, trash it. But you just might, so give it a shot, even if you don't normally read Beat-Gen stuff."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I have read this book three times and every time I feel something twisting and breaking inside of my head. Like I'm losing part of my sanity with each passing sentence. It is one complex yet enjoyable read. It's disturbing and beautiful. If you've only seen the movie then you owe it to yourself to read the book. Because the book is incredible. You'll get a lot more out of it. Though the Cronenberg film is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book certainly isn't for everyone, but none the less this book is a gateway into the strange and humorous world of William S. Burroughs. Personally I don't think of this as a great piece of literature, rather I think of it as insight into an individual that had a very unique way of looking at things in the world. At points this book is dark, unintelligible, crafty, and flat out funny if you have a black sense of humor. A good companion to this book is Call Me Burroughs where you can hear a couple of sections of this classic read by the author himself."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book really gets to me. It's got all of the bells & whistles of taking an altered trip, including extreme hallucinations, time-shifts and paranoia. (\\"I can feel the heat closing in.\\"-first sentence.) It's dark, twisted, demented, funny, contemplating, with an anti-heroin finallity. Bill comes to many conclusions on various levels; touching everything from power-abuse to medical abuse, to sex abuse and all other things that are happening either without our knowledge, or without our care. I've read somewhere that this is a cut n paste job made for artistic value to deviate from what readers are used to --but this is irrelevant. It's a masterpiece of social commentary, looking deep within the mind of one who is in the midst of what is really happening... seeming to use drugs in order to cope with it... and realizes the horrid state of affairs Western society is actually emmersed in. Put Bill Burroughs alongside Samuel Beckett, George Orwell and Oscar Wilde, in telling it like it is, holding nothing back."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"William Burroughs' 1959 'novel,' or work, perhaps, \\"Naked Lunch\\" is really a wild and dirty (not a value judgment) cultural artifact. It can be extraordinarily difficult to follow and understand, even from one page to the next. The whole is composed of sketches, or episodes, some having no apparent connection to the others, except by associations of sexuality and rampant drug use/addiction/recovery. There are a couple of major structural elements that comprise the work: scenes and descriptions of the moment of 'need' for the addict (particularly of opiates) and of the social, economic, and political climate that perpetuates the problem; and the futuristic-Orwell-on-Heroin story of Interzone.Interzone, located nebulously in North Africa, is the site of cultural crossings, and a corrupt and totalitarian government, that seeks to control the bodies and minds of its 'citizens'. Some of the horde of villainy amok in Interzone: the nefarious Dr. Benway, whose crass self-assurance underlies anxieties brought on by his insistent medical prosecution of homosexuality; A.J., an opportunist, whose maddening interests include abortion; and a host of Party Leaders whose distance from the 'ordinary people' they represent is a severe critique, particularly on American government. Written during the Cold War and the persecution of Americans for supposedly 'communist' activities, Burroughs' work offers admittedly Swiftian satiric glances at many aspects of 1950's culture in terms of gender, complacency, and isolationism.For good and ill, the portrait of Interzone in \\"Naked Lunch\\" is no less a prophetic vision of a dystopia, such as we see in George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" published just 10 years before. Both works are concerned with the brute physicality of life, as it is and as it could be in the future if current trends are left without check or amendment. Like \\"1984,\\" but surpassing it in some ways, \\"Naked Lunch\\" addresses the dangers of government power over the human body, its reproductivity, and the unfortunate similarities apparently viewed by the state between its citizens and common herd animals. \\"Naked Lunch\\" is pervaded by scenes of overt sexual practices and orgies that 'bugger' description and even more disturbing scenes in which people are depicted as beasts - baboons and insects abound in the work. These are mitigated by references the narrator makes to himself as similar in bearing to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\"Ancient Mariner\\" - Burroughs asks his audience to listen or read in silence - because these are stories and vignettes which he must tell, both for his sake and ours.Scenes from real life, along with an introduction and appendix that deal with the experience of drug abuse provide an anchor (however tenuous) to the reader. If one reads the episodes that take place in Chicago, New York, Tangier, etc., as examples of the worst of humanity in our contemporary world - and sees this as the very foundation of the socio-political climate of Interzone, then the despair and challenge of the work become clear. Burroughs is reaching out to us to change our world fundamentally to be more tolerant and understanding, particularly in an era where, increasingly, strictly defined notions of nationality and national cultures are becoming ever more faint. This is a book, like Orwell's, which is more relevant than ever to readers in the early 21st century. It takes patience and application to read, but is ultimately rewarding and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I had to read this book. I read the sleeve notes and that was it. Basically from what I gather it's a bit of an autobiography. I have since read about William S Burroughs and to me it seems that this book is a story about him and his life on whatever drug came his way and whatever character came his way. It's extremely disturbing at times and utterly confusing at others I recommend it is read more than once. This is definately a book you can't put down. You get a glimpse of what must be happening inside a junkies head, and it's not nice. There should be a warning that people with weak consitutions shouldn't read it"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Here's a good book. You might not read it to the end, but what you do read, you'll remember. William Burroughs is basically a common man of America with a common addiction, but he has an uncommon, unflinching imagination, helped out by his addiction and withdrawal from heroin. Electricity, hallucination, paranoia, sexual fantasy, and hip talk permeate the pages and keep the reader confused, disgusted, and blissfully entertained by turn. Go ahead and buy this book, because you might need it at some point in your life. After all, if junkies can't get their fix, if the heat can't sniff out a pusher or two, if upstanding, sexually-repressed Americans can't wet and soil themselves in public, and if good, brown, Arabian boys can't be violated, where would any of us be?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"i had a permanent wrinkle in my forehead while reading this book.

After reading this book, you may once see, as I had, why it was banned, topics of book burnings and trialed for obscenity.....a definate classic"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this book was a total heroin shot in the whole literature world, it turned it all upside down. kafka, dadaism, surrealism its all there . i really started to write after rereading it."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is a big disaster in my opinion. I have read several books that deal with the same topics and are situated in similar eras and environments, and I must say that this is the worst one of them all (don't be confused here: I loved the other ones I have read, e.g. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).Its unclear what exactly Burroughs was trying to do here. In the introduction he said that this book is a creation out of notes he took during his lengthy period of drug addiction--perhaps he should have reread them when the drugs lessened their toll on his mind. (Note: things that seem 'cool' when you're high, seldom remain that way the next morning). If the point was to illustrate the disgusting world of addiction then in my opinion he utterly failed.Furthermore, its not clear why so much of the book concerns itself with the detailed description of little boys mutilating each other and their tales of sickening fornication. If this is a book on drug addiction (though I'm told it has several 'levels' of meaning that deal with all types of addiction) then why so much talk about twisted Freudian psychoanalysis-gone-Nazi bad psychology and condition techniques? Usually I can take intense detail but this book was too much. If you're interested in a good story about addication then rent the movie 'Requim for a dream'. That deals with everything Burroughs tries to write about (i.e. drug addiction, sex addiction, media control) including all the graphic detail and \\"unusual\\" storytelling, the only difference is that 'Requim' is done extremely well.The most dissapointing part is that the book fails to be a story. After reading 100 pages of the 225 paged book, I had no idea where there characters were, who the characters were, as well as having no idea where the story started and to where it is going. I gave me no desire to read on simply because I had no idea what the book was about.So read it if you like, there are many 5-star ratings on this review board, but in my opinion you shouldn't waste your time with this dissapointing book, there are many other wonderful books out there."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I am no novice to William S. Burroughs, but this IS my first time reading Naked Lunch. I respect opinions of people who say this book was too &quot;out there&quot; for them, but I disagree with them.

I don't think it's premature for me to be writing a review before I finish it, because I know whether or not I like a book within the first 10 pages. I'm not too sure how many of you can relate to this, but for me, reading Naked Lunch is like listening to Mr. Bungle. If you never heard them, listen to a whole album, and you will understand. It is all so sporatic and surprising, yet flows so well and fits together perfectly. Once you get into the right mindset, nothing is confusing about this book...all of it has been crystal clear to me so far. I love it. And as soon as I am finished with Naked Lunch I am starting on his cut-up trilogy. Just because something is different or extreme and breaking the rules doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, in that case it deserves my utmost respect."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"No book I have read has ever explained the skewed view of the junky's mind better than this one.

If you see a ranting heroin addict on the street, would you understand what he's saying? Then how could you possibly understand one who writes a book? My guess is that he's writing about everyday life, but from the perspective of a &quot;junky.&quot; As he says in the Introduction (it helps if you read the Introduction before the actual book, that is if you choose to buy it), he makes a comment about how he would stare at his shoe for eight hours. We, the (hopefully) non-user population, would consider looking at a shoe a normal and pointless activity, but to a junky he sees a whole different world, and that's what is written in Naked Lunch: The everyday world as a junky sees it.I might not be 100% right on my theory, but only Mr. Burroughs himself would be able to tell me for sure, and he's dead. So putting aside what the book may or may not be about, I could easily say this: If you have patience and like things that are really different and off-the-wall, then this might be something you would be interested in reading.

Not because of the \\"story\\", but because it was so slang-heavy I had to stop a hundred times and try to understand what was being said. Alot of the terminology was above me I guess. Also the cut-up style of writing threw me. There was almost no flow. BUT I did find alot of it interesting, humorous, and his vocabulary is no doubt impressive. I even watched the movie afterwards and it hit me the same way, like...huh? I can easily see why some might stop reading, give up, and even hate this book. It's really graphic. I was fine with it, but I can't recall any other book being so sex and drug heavy. Honestly, if you removed the pages that mentioned drugs and sex you'd have about 14 pages left. I'm sure some of the appeal of Naked Lunch is that it's so unique, and unlike most other books. In the end I'm glad I read it, just prepare yourself."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"No, this book isn't for everyone. Yet I would recommend it to everyone simply on the grounds that it is such a piece of groundbreaking literature. It is a book like no other. If you think you've read it all before, then read this.Granted, I'm a huge William Burroughs fan. He has inspired a lot of my own writings and showed me that sometimes no structure is the best structure. Let the reader make what they will of your writings. That giving the reader their own opportunity to explore your creations rather than map it all out for them is an experience unto itself. And whether or not they love it in the end is not the big prize. Having given them the experience is.Naked Lunch took me quite a while to read. The first Burroughs book I read was Junky, another tale of drug addiction filled with Burroughs' own brand of slick humor. However it was completely straightforward. Naked Lunch is, by all means, as twisted and turned as literature can get.Once you get past page 3 of the proceedings, just enjoy the ride. You may feel the need to go back and reread what you just read, but don't. There is no point in doing that, because the &quot;meaning&quot; of this novel comes and goes. It loses itself within stories within stories within stories. To sit here and try to explain what Naked Lunch is all about is futile. It's like trying to find a word that rhymes with orange. It just can't be done. Hence, each reader will have his or her own experience with this book.There are plenty of horrific and grotesque images in this work, yet they are vivid and wonderful in their own ways. Burroughs' mastery of language and especially the beat style and rhythm is awe inspiring. The words flow by breathlessly, no matter what they are conveying. Reading this book is like no other experience I've ever had. It is scary, funny, sad, hip, and cool. I'd also like to thank the other Amazon reviewer for recommending THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez -- as a &quot;failing and flailing writer&quot; myself, this book is a great comfort to me."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I am going to risk a less than one hundred percent positive review of Naked Lunch. I have never been a heroin addict, but I have had the electricity turned off in my house for a month. First, there's a CRASH; then NOTHING; the TV, OFF, lights, OFF, clock, MOTIONLESS. You can't bath, you can't cook, you feel too oppressed to eat, and worst of all from about five o'clock on you can't see. You wait for the dark to fall, the house like a dimmed cafe, knowing that there are hours of blindness ahead. This is depression. When even the TV soap operas don't want you . Then well before you are ready for bed STASIS; utter SHUT DOWN; DARKNESS, SIMULATED DEATH; A COMPLETE FEELING OF EMOTIONAL ISOLATION.This is the nearest approximation in my memory with the experience that you go through with Naked Lunch. The book is cold: ice cold: the frostiest literary experience I know of, a vision of the BIG SHUT DOWN. But after the SHUT DOWN the mind keeps going -- cause you ain't dead -- and, continuing the house analogy, as you lay in the darkness of AN UTTER LACK OF HEALTHY STIMULATION what tends to fill the void are images of sex and violence. Repetitive thinking, revenge fantasies, paranoia, mindlessly elaborate and vicious sexual combinations, warped logic and the twisted images of all the people you are going to get back when you get back on your feet again. Degradation this extreme doesn't make you thoughtful. You lose after awhile the need or desire to justify yourself; your body stinks, your mind stinks, and you sink to juvenile,narcissistic level of existence. Junk does all your thinking for you.And therein lies the rub. For all its flash, dazzle, and pop relevance, Naked Lunch has the emotional maturity of a fifties comic book. The style can't save the substance.The prose really does make sense, and follow a loose kind of narrative sequentiality. I thought of angular panels, big thought bubbles and exaggerated illustrations. It's beautifully effective: more like a comic than any other book: language in the pithy, violent and elliptical style that's usually associated with words accompanied by visuals. The visuals are absent. They are unnecessary. They are in our heads as a symptom of today's visual culture. Naked Lunch is the finest example I know of a book that follows more a visual, or cinematic than a traditional literary logic.Now for the part that will likely anger some of Burroughs more dedicated believers. The flaws of Naked Lunch are the same flaws of the hip culture that so admires it: a lack of seriousness, a superficialness. For all his interest in everything that influences junkies Burroughs doesn't know what self-reflection is. As he states in his previous novel Junkie, he \\"doesn't believe in psychotherapy.\\" The question that ought to be at the center of his vision WHY SOMEONE BECOMES A JUNKIE? is shunted aside. Burroughs doesn't seem to really believe there is an emotional side to life. Burroughs loves to smirk, smirk at everything, including groups he belongs to. He offers a positive alternative to nothing. I think his popularity with hipsters is due to this hardboiled attitude. Everything is a joke; nothing can hurt me; I'm so cold and hard inside that I'm safe.Naked Lunch is hilarious but at its core it is a very defensive book, a flippant hard shell. Burroughs' cynicism and paranoia remain very much angry white male attitudes. He is too flippant, and heartless to write otherwise....-- every cliche about black and Asian sexual organs is pulled out at some point or another. Naked Lunch is particularly weak in its attempts at social commentary. The great enemy is the STATE. The Forces of CONTROL, THE MAN. This is a cool attitude, but a too simplistic one. Naked Lunch needs more sociology, more psychology, and more caring. More of the qualities that make 1984 and Animal Farm so much superior analyses of the state, class, and the human condition. For Burroughs the BIG SOLUTION is to form our own communities and get the STATE off our back. Maybe, except the idea that such a community, populated by Burroughs clones, would be happy place is a laughable one.His admirers should seriously consider that in his addiction Burroughs shot and killed his own wife: was the state at fault for that? Naked Lunch needs less vitriol, and acuter self-examination. As it is, Burroughs tells us more about the paranoia and defensive attitudes of addicts than anything else. A greater degree of self analysis would build a firmer basis for his social analysis, but that would also wipe the smirk off Burroughs' face, and above all else he wants to keep the smirk. The smirk provides some wonderful entertainment; verbal fireworks; wild, enticing language acrobatics, sick humor. He was a great trickster, a language gypsy. If no one can quite understand what you are saying, no one can accuse you of anything. Insofar as that goes, he was a master.So I don't mean all this to sound like Naked Lunch is \\"a bad book\\" Quite the opposite. In my opinion it remains a very good one. I don't however think it is a masterpiece on the level of Notes From the Underground . The core problem is that there is more pose here than substance. The clever, coded language disguises the contradictions in Burroughs' own thought and only secondarily assists mankind against its enemies. The junk world, try as he might, isn't an effective position from which to criticize the straight world, or really much of anything. Social commentary and the human condition are compromised by junkie con."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"There's really no way that I can apply any sort of standard measurement or review to Naked Lunch. Here is a book that is, for all intents and purposes, plotless; the author himself says it's to can be read in random order, diving in and out as you please. And what chapters there are exist more as catalogs of surreal, nightmarish, and very often incredibly obscene, even pornographic, imagery. And yet, you can't deny the power and impact of Burroughs' writing, nor the way he immerses you in the life and hallucinations/musings of a drug addict, creating a waking hell which he seems to be simultaneously enjoying and trying desperately to escape. Naked Lunch is a challenging read; despite its short length, it feels daunting, and even having finished it, I'm not sure I can really explain what I read. But as a defiant jab at 50s culture, a desire to express a world that so many never wanted to see, an effort to express his complex worldview, and an attempt to expose the world to a thriving subculture, it's a powerful achievement. A standard review seems impossible for me to achieve here, and even my grade is only an approximation of my feelings. Did I always like it? No - often I was frustrated at its incoherency, annoyed by the incessant cavalcade of grotesque imagery, or exhausted from trying to piece it all together into a whole. But at the same time, was I fascinated and drawn in, unable to stop reading? Undoubtedly. Was I often impressed by its thoughtfulness, odd humor, and surreal imagination? Oh yes. And did I admire it as a cumulative accomplishment? Most definitely. I can't say I would recommend it for many people, but for those with a taste for adventurous literature that ignores boundaries and rules, Naked Lunch is an essential piece of reading."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"\\"I can feel the heat closing in, feel them out there making their moves, setting up their devil doll stool pigeons, crooning over my spoon and dropper I throw away at Washington Square Station, vault a turnstile and two flights down the iron stairs, catch an uptown A train . . .\\"How could one not love a \\"novel\\" with such an opening page? We're given a three-word chapter heading signifying the genesis of the protagonist's journey west (note direction) then jump straight into his mind as he hurries his way onto a New York subway, paranoid that he's being tailed by a narcotics agent - all of this told with Burroughs' feverish style that meanders constantly between poetry and prose.OK, admittedly this isn't a book for everyone. Readers who find coherence of plot to be paramount need look elsewhere. In fact Burroughs himself said the book was meant to be read out of order, at random. After all, it was born from a mad collection of papers scribbled onto by Burroughs during a long bout of habitual heroin use (to name one of the substances he indulged in). The book's protagonist follows a vaguely biographical journey paralleling Burroughs' own during this time period, except rather than told from the detached and reflective viewpoint of one who has escaped his addiction, we're given the raw emotion and perspective of Burroughs as he saw the world while drugged out and imaginative, and if nothing else it's entirely original.I feel the perspective the piece offers along with the poetically insane language are enough to merit reading this book. But there is indeed something of a vague plot line to follow (a plotline perhaps drawn in chalk during a rainstorm . . .) as well as Burroughs' deeper sentiments - sometimes manifesting in allegorical anecdotes, usually sexual in nature - concerning politics, society, art, etc. Just don't expect these things to jump out of the page at you.

This will give you a better understanding of how this group of friends chose to write, with Ginsberg being, in my opinion, the most easily approachable and Burroughs being a little bit more obtuse.

That all said, I still love this book and am excited to read it over again and again (but not too soon...)"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is the ultimate cut-up/quote bible/scrapbook of what it was like to be alive and a free-thinker in the Fifties. As well, the horrors of the &quot;oil-burning junk habit&quot; and the worlds in which the visionary dwells, are covered in great detail. There is somewhat of a back-story, dealing with a kind of Rodgers-and-Hammerstein-meets-HR-Giger-meet-sthe X Files cabal of aliens and other species infiltrating the human race. Burroughs sees himself as a catch-as-catch-can reporter on all this, &quot;like an agent who has forgotten his own cover story [but] all agents defect and all resisters sell out.&quot; This book is one wild ride, and should be read as a poetic scrapbook. Definitely worth you time. Give it a shot!

But how do you describe it? I took a stab at it and said it was about a drug addict and in a sense that's right and in a sense that's so far from the truth as to be absurd. But absurd is what the book is all about, Burroughs seems to be lampooning and satirizing everything he can about American culture, from the highest skyscrapers to the utter dregs in the gutter, he hits all the highs and lows of this country, and you can spend multiple readings trying to piece together what it all means. The narrative is completely non-linear and really only the beginning and end make much sense, whether that was delibrate or not or whether it was just the way it all fell together is beyond me. The middle you just sort of have to experience and get whatever out of it you can, needless to say don't skip it, once you wade past the bizarre imagery, absurdist characters and situations and the nonstop onslaught of sexual activities (most of the them drug related), you'll find some of the best writing this century. There's science-fiction, hallucatinations, crime, just about everything you can think of. And while you might think that Burroughs is just messing with the reader and throwing up all that wild and perverse stuff as a front to pretend he's a good writer, get to the literally breathtaking end and you'll see that this man had talent that we rarely see. Extremely ahead of its time (it was written and published in the late fifties . . . there was nothing remotely like this back then), much like William Gaddis' The Recognitions a few years before (though for completely different reasons), even today and in the years between, very little has come along that even begins to match it for sheer style and audicity. Not for the faint of heart, but something everyone should attempt anyway."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"After reading several of the reviews by customers regarding their frustrations and &quot;exuberance&quot;, I can find it plausible that so many would discard this book as complete babble and non-linear. At the same time I find the &quot;over-analysis&quot; by others to be completely &quot;over-analizing&quot; in attempts to &quot;get it&quot;, much apologies for the expression of an opinion. Burroughs' Naked Lunch is one of the most misunderstood books ever written, second, I believe, only to the bible in misinterpretation. While Burroughs was a habitual drug user, he wasn't the crazed, strung-out heroin user with no mental functioning, if so how did he write it in the first place. Of course his pals Ginsberg and Keroac &quot;constructed&quot; the book for him or did they? This was a book intended to con people about what a book is, should be and what the writer is and should be. Naked Lunch can be looked at as a collection of scenerios describing both the non-afflicted mind and the afflicted mind of a drug user. To think that Burroughs would have been slumming the streets in ratty clothes is laughable at best. This is a writer who up until being published lived off an allowance from his parents. Naked Lunch is a part of Burroughs and the two are intertwined in that the presentation of image is based on the lanquage being used to present that image. Think of Burroughs' anti-establishment presentation of himself and the his Nike commercials...too hip. Then think of the image Naked Lunch presents to the reader. Naked Lunch is a book by not being a book, the non-linear construction was intentional not thrown together or was it? Naked Lunch can be understood by everyone, the need for a English degree is non-essential nor is the idea of analytical comparisons to other authors. Naked Lunch is and isn't. The con is what Naked Lunch is. Naked Lunch can be read in any fashion and the message is the same, you've been conned. Time stands still, moves, intertwines. Reality exists and doesn't exist, Bill Lee is William is Dr. Benway is the talk asshole. Naked Lunch allows the reader to experience their own conciousness in the fashion in which &quot;it&quot; operates. Naked Lunch is one of the finest examples of 20th century literature for what it accomplishes. Naked Lunch is everything and nothing to everyone who reads it. No one interpretation is right, but all interpretations are right. Everything you read in Naked Lunch is based on &quot;Solid Fact&quot;. Read the beginning of Naked Lunch and you are given the story of &quot;I wrote this while completely on drugs and I had no idea what I was writing&quot;, then read the end with the &quot;scientific&quot; disertation on drugs and what treatments are and what Burroughs is telling the readers, then...Think of the image being presented to you and then question everything being said on the page. What is the image? What is the story? What is the meaning? What is the message? Am I being conned? If you answer these questions and find answers question the answers, then again you could just read the book and enjoy the paragraphic &quot;scenerios&quot; and not think about the &quot;message&quot; or the &quot;big picture.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"&quot;Put this in your pipe,&quot; muttered Dr. Benway, &quot;I've just returned from Interzone and well...lets just say the flys are definitely on top of the substance that is hitting the fan.&quot; He seemed world-weary and timeless, what the hippies might call an &quot;old soul.&quot; Hah - the patchouli people had never been so damn close to hitting the nail on the head. &quot;In Interzone you'll hear, among other things,Hassidic hip-hop heroin sit-com novelty songs, Metallica-Prozac marching anthems and Gestapo acid-jazz.

I also found this book boring, similar to Kerouac's \\"Visions of Cody\\" and Richard Farina's \\"Been down so long it looks like up to me.\\" Most reviewers who say these books are \\"brilliant,\\" are just following the \\"in\\" crowd and don't want to sound unsophisticated, but these books suck!I'm not saying it's a bad book, but not for my psyche maybe, however there are many reviews that find this book a literary masterpiece in avant garde, in spontaneous flashes of insight over organized, plotted out themes.There's no doubt this book was ahead of it's time in both it's \\"cut-up,\\" colloge style and it's modern expose of the lifestyle of a depraved junkie and sexually explicit, violently extreme, grotestly vile. And there seems to be this painful suffering with pleasure to writing sexual experiences and mental patients being chemically abused, bloody doctor fights in operating rooms for abortions, and eating s**t and generally depravity and a perception bound by a negative struggle.It's written in a style that's not easy reading and yet very descriptive with tangent laced directions taking you in many different places, all so with a lot of non-conformist sexuality (to say the least), drug addiction, and the life that devalues and demoralizes others, abuses others both mentally and physically, that finds pleasure in seeing other's pains and torture, and somehow through the thick of it all, seems to enjoy the intense emotional and mental suffering. An ideal book for the lovers of sadism and masochism, as there is a lot of pleasure in the suffering of the pain of both the self and other people.Although at this time of writing I haven't read other books of Burroughs, but in relation to the descriptive tangents of this book written in multiple directions, I found such hard to digest, that is in a coherent organized way, thus making this book a difficult reading of you would normally find; the sequential reading found in novels. And it appears that the reason for this hard digestion of words is the style of Burroughs writing that Allen Ginsberg speaks about from a 1968 interview in the book, Spontaneous Mind, page 136, says on the writing method of Burroughs;\\"Now Burroughs doesn't see words - words don't go through his head, pictures go through his head. So his method of composition is sitting before a typewriter sort of looking up in the middle distance at the wall, seeing pictures flash through head like . . . mugwumps seated on a barstool slurping up honey with a long reptilian tongue. And then he simply transcribes it into pictures - words, picture words.\\" Burroughs also writes in letter to Ginsberg describing his cut-up style of writing, that is, to cut up the sentences and rearrange them in any order\\"And from Yage Letters p.59, in a letter to Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs writes,\\"Take the enclosed copy of the letter. Cut along the lines. Rearrange putting section one by section three and section two by section four. Now read aloud and you will hear My Voice. Whose voice? Listen. Cut and rearrange in any combination. Read aloud. I can not choose but hear. Don't think about it. Don't theorize. Try it. Do the same with your poems. With any poems any prose. Try it.

The Old man Of The Mountain.\\""},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Not only can you see the words, but you can smell paragraphs, feel the sentences and taste the chapters. William S. Burroughs has managed to cheat the structure of the English language by flat-out denying the existence of orthodoxy, tradition, convention, rules, principles and standards to deliver a fresh 1950s account of what it is to be a free person, although albeit with the paradox of equally being hooked on every conceivable vice.Burroughs treats character development, plot and structure as mere formalities that have no place on the page. To him the essence of writing is to convey an idea of an experience by any means necessary. This is inclusive of coining new words, new grammar and new syntax as long it gets the message across. In many ways Burroughs achieves the expression of his deranged take on the human condition, and the inhuman one, by simply never coming to terms with life as anything more than psychotic mayhem with the assumption that being \\"correct\\" is with population numbers that concur with one another on the trivial points of livelihood. To him it is all pandemonium whatever way you try to cook it and since disorder and chaos are the meal of day why not just dine on it like a King's banquet.The premise here is non-existent. It simply delves into some sort of a junkie come spy come homosexual cover operative who travels to a place called the Interzone to write daily reports of his experiences there. The narrative is fresh, bold, thoroughly unique and actually interesting. It is inspiring but any attempt at trying to do a genre like it can only be seen as plagiarism. Not only has Burroughs cornered his market here, but he owns it through and through. There is nothing else like Naked Lunch and there probably never will be.This book was so shocking when first published that it was tried under obscenity laws. By today's standards the work is quite heartening but is still thoroughly deranged material. It is evil because it is destabilizing on the reader who is brought to a resounding crunch as their mind leaves all rational thought behind. At that moment anything can happen. Let's just hope that the reader can tell the difference between fiction and fantasy before it is too late.

He deals with such issues as hero worship, the abuses of power and prejudice. The relevance these themes have only become inflamed in the time since his book has been published. As I have come to believe, the vulgarity of the book is used as a tool to try and evoke sympathy for the hellish torment that the protagonist must endure in his quest for an escape.

As of this writing,my opinion of Ginsberg and Kerouac has changed little(Truman Capote's assessment of On The Road as &quot;not writing but typing&quot; seems to me a fair assessment).I will give Ginsberg credit for influencing other poets of greater talent who have benefited from the freedom he iniated in poetry,but little else(I still consider Howl to be worthless and self absorbed) The same is not the case with Burroughs.Though he never approached the level of invention present in Naked Lunch(save for perhaps Cities of the Red Night),his style and Humor(which eluded me during my iniatial reading,but upon subsequent rereadings became more and more evident)and his dark satirical intelligence,place him in the company of Joyce,Henry Miller,Thomas Pynchon and others who possessed the boldness to present reality in all it's beauty and disgust.The Lunch is indeed naked."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"As the veteran reader will know, Burroughs spent much of his life in drug-induced states of existence, not easily described.

What is apparent is that Naked Lunch is a very ugly book indeed - seemingly composed of the same madness which may have gripped its author in his darker moments of insanity.What becomes quite clear upon reading through the book is that its writer is a most extraordinary man, possessed either of a truly warped imagination, or at the very least subjected to extreme situations and still alive to write about them afterwards. Throughout the novel various characters are introduced, from the unforgettable Dr. Benway ('I deplore brutality. It is inefficient') to the 'nameless asshole' whose suffering seems to comprise much of the book. These characters, involved as they are with psychedelic dealings in nightmare landscapes, are etched in the memory as bloodthirsty, perverse, wicked...and also very, very amusing.Assuming the book survives a preliminary perusal (a task in itself), subsequent readings are less trying and Burrough's rough and ruthless sense of humor becomes identifiable. Having swallowed the initial nausea of the sheer unpleasantness of the book, the hopeless floundering of the addict takes on a gripping and desperate edge; the evil machinations of world leaders are breathtaking, and the depths of depravity to which they sink are laughable.Repellant, yes, but also entertaining, and it is in this manner that the novel is a success: It is impossible to throw up while you are laughing. While it may not be everybody's cup of tea, pot of hash, or plate of stir-fried entrails, Naked Lunch makes a lasting impression on the reader. The more conventional reader will not enjoy its violence, prurient sex, and unselfconscious drug-addictions; those with a stronger stomach and more liberal imagination will appreciate its frank confessions, di! sjointed descriptions, and of course, its very dark sense of wit."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"&quot;Unprolific, self-repelling, the dark power hid.&quot; The apotheosis of a Burroughinian world.

There are certain people I know who would only be harmed by the contents of this particular tome. Therefore, if you are negatively affected by harsh, gut-churning, vomitous presentations of humankind, then, brother, this is not the book for you. To understand the story of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; one must understand the P.O.V. of a person on severe drugs. Keep that frame of mind, and the story won't run away with you.

Burroughs was an icon of the Beat generation, he is the junkie encountered in New Orleans in &quot;On the Road&quot; by Sal and Dean, he worked with Ginsberg, and more recently, Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain. Burroughs strength lies in his disregard for sanity, addiction of anykind is a prison from which no rational thought may escape. Here, in the world of junkie and pusher is the ever present battle for control and freedom in modern life. While quite often frustrating, and almost always offensive, Naked Lunch has moments of profound humor and insight. Few books have made me laugh as hard as some of the scenes in this book.Naked Lunch is so named because according to Burroughs, it describes &quot;a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork&quot;. Note Burroughs does not limit this moment of realization to drug addiction, it applies to all aspects of life which seek to enslave us.Naked lunch, as a result, is hard to digest. Readers who look for plot or coherence will be sadly disappointed, and perhaps give up reading this book for something more palpatable. But hang in there, and just enjoy the ride. Naked lunch is a book I am still working through, and will continue to ponder after I have finished it, (26 pages to go!). How many books hook you in like that?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this is literature for insects. this was burrough's way of fooling intellectual half-wits into the sleazy underground, making offers to both sides. many people like to play the soundtrack to the rather poor cinematic version of &quot;naked lunch&quot; while reading it, but i suggest insect drug music. i actually recommend reading &quot;exterminator&quot; first, and then this in the same session, &quot;exterminator&quot; is ever-so-slightly less morbidly pornographic. dont be surprised if you dream of cockroaches."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is one of the most frustratingly amazing books in the world! I cannot believe that I made it through, but I did. When I was finished, I was exhausted, perplexed, and startled. At first glance the book looks like a novel, but it reads like an array of short stories interlaced. The scenes jump around so much that you get the real idea of what goes on in the mind of a heroin addict. Burroughs is one of the most masterful poets in the world. My recommendation is do not try to read this book to find a plot, understand the characters, or make sense of what happens. Just read the book word for word, sentence for sentence, and paragraph for paragraph. Take it at face value and you will enjoy the book thoroughly. Try to think too deeply, you will not be able to take it, and the book will anger you to no end. Definitely a good read!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This is a book that truly presents a multiplicity of elements and allows for the reader to combine them as he pleases. Thus, as this book comes from many different angles, there are many different ways of interpreting the style, themes, and general content. Most of the scenes in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; come off as cartoonish, however, this does not mean that the social commentary is weakened; nor does it mean that Burrough's vision of &quot;hell&quot; is somehow thinned out. Rather, only by writing in such a manner is Burroughs truly able to exploit those elements of humanity that he wishes to discuss and comment on. That is, he takes something (for example, addiction in general) and raises it to the highest power--exploiting the exploitation. On another level, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; can be interpreted from an aesthetic viewpoint. Remember, it was Burroughs who saw that &quot;literature was about 50 years behind other forms of art&quot;. Thus, we get the cut-up method, which is roughly word-collaging. This method allows for Burroughs to present multiple layers and form various connections both within the text and to elements outside of the text that normally would not be made. This method allows for the writer to truly refute &quot;the man&quot; in the sense of all of those do's and do-not's that we have been taught about writing; it allows for one to enter the text at any point and form a maximum amount of relays both within itself and with the outside world. Thus, to call commentary that is carried out in such a manner &quot;juvenille&quot;, etc. seems to ignore exactly what Burroughs was attempting to accomplish (among other things) in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Granted, if one is expecting suspenseful plots, one will be dissappointed by this book, but to a degree, that is the point: that direct story-lines are the ideal creations of authors and fail to display, in thier very conception, the various layers at work in life. Because of the complexity of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, it demands to be read multiple times and the outrageous, and often funny, scenes make this an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It is a must for anyone who dare think of themselves as literary connoissuers (sp?). Filled with humor, symbolism, fantasy, and ground breaking writing style, I recommend it to everyone. The book replaces traditional measures such as &quot;plot&quot; and &quot;story&quot; in favor of creating an overall &quot;feeling&quot;. When you are finished it will hit you, and when it does you will never forget Naked Lunch."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Whether you like this book or not has nothing to do with how stunning it actually is. I myself enjoy Burroughs' writing style, but aside from that his book rings true throughout, even today, and gives a relevant, if not totally bizarre, depiction of society and the people in it. READ IT."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I have to admit that I was turned off when I first read this book by the nature of some of the more gruesome parts (and this was after reading Cities of the Red Night). But after listening to the sadly out-of-print recording made by Burroughs himself, I truly appreciated the brilliance and humor of this work. I particularly enjoyed the Chicago references, having grown up in a Clark St. rooming house off Lincoln Park."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is a 10.000-year-trip to the dark side of the spoon! Of course it's drug-induced and some scenes are really disgusting, but it is a highly innovative vision of a cybercpace-wasteland, a fever-dream of sex, drugs and freedom. No boundaries! You can start reading at any page you want, there's no &quot;story&quot; at all, just imaginative hallucinations, a pornograffity of a universal and enlightened mind. Sick at all, but isn't reality always sranger than fiction? I found it quite hard to read, sometimes the pandemonium of fascistic agents, hedonistic drug-takers and futureal cyberpunks really blowed my mind. But after i read it, i had the feeling of having discovered an author, who found the nucleus of a time to come. Frightening, but fantastic!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This has got to be one of my favourite books. I was expecting something twisted and it didn't dissapoint. In fact, the book is admirable for it's lack of &quot;decency and good honest work ethic.&quot; Isn't that why someone would read a book like this? I don't think I've ever come across a more honest book. As a hetero male, I found this book particularily interesting. It's probably the first book I've read written by a homosexual author who actually deals with the subject in a satirical light. The part about A.J. just kills me and I find myself constantly returning to the pages that &quot;describe&quot; him. In this day and age, I think it's important to read books as $&amp;%*ed up as this one. Everything is sooo normal and boring in the nineties. In fact I'm surprised that literature has even survived. This book screams &quot;art.&quot; Yet, if you read it with an open mind, it's completely accessible. Some people expressed surprise when I told them that I had read &quot;Naked Lunch.&quot; Apparently it's one of those works, like Joyce's &quot;Ulysses,&quot; that most people claim to have read, but few have actually finished."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I was searching for this book for over a year.!! I finally found it and read it. While not sure exactly what it was about I was overwhelmed by how great it was.

My advice is to order it from amazon cause I sure had a hard tmie finding it."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"What in the world is up with this book? This was an interesting story. There is no plot, which gets a little confusing. This book was really confusing to read because it seemed to jump around and not have a continue flow. William Burroughs was very creative in coming up with this story though. How many authors have the imagination and courage to write a story like this? This book went through a lot of court cases because people were trying to get it banned. But in the end it won the court cases and is permitted on the bookshelves. Even though I found this interesting it took me a while to realize that the only way to understand it was to just read and not really understand it. That made it a bit confusing, but it was actually pretty fast reading. It's been a while since the last time I could say that I was able to read 90 pages in just one day. I recommend anyone who is up for a good read where they do not want to have to really think when reading, to read this book. I am not used to reading books and not thinking about them and just reading, so it was a little difficult to make myself do at first, but after not very long it was a lot easier and made the book much more enjoying not having to think about what I am actually reading. Overall I really thought that this was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"When people look back on the silly actions of past critics who used to slate some of our now-revered artists, we often think how could they not see the true beauty or message or whatever. Ah, but you have to understand what it was like at the time critics blinded by the shock of something genuinely new that doesn't fit with their preconceived ideas. Shame.I dont pretend to follow all of this book, its heavy to read through like a normal novel, it works far better if you just flip it open to any page and just read.This isn't always accepted in the mainstream as the revolutionary work that it is - it still shocks fourty years later - but who cares whether the &quot;mainstream&quot; accept it or not.As well as a sarcastic caustic satire, strange sci-fi trip and an intensely honest book - it stands as a giant finger up to the modern way of life (still) - give it a try... I"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book takes on an interesting point of view, but its sole quality is the descriptive power of the author. This alone will should not create a classic. Naked Lunch is read and applauded simply because of its unconventional approach, and not for its content. It has been considered controversial ever since the first printing, and is still admired solely for that reason. If you needed to read the entire book through to get his simple message, then you probably never got it, anyway. If this book was rewritten, with the same message, but minus the gratuitous sex, it would sell about a dozen copies."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Too bad you can't give a book &quot;zero stars.&quot; This is the worst book ever. Burroughs attempts to offer up the complexity of a &quot;Ulysses&quot; or &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; with none of the talent or intellect. Unfortuanately, drugs don't make you deep, they make you incoherent. Absolute, chemically induced nonsense, like listening to someone slam on a piano keyboard for twelve hours and then tell you that it's not that they can't play, they're just interested in slamming on the keys. The big mystery is how this nonsense got published, but, after reading some of the reviews, I see that there are some people who seem to &quot;get it&quot;. &quot;Wow, man, dig it, it's like, so surreal...&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"A classic of the Look at Me Look at Me I'm Going to Shock You Out of Your Bourgeois Complacency School of Literature. Ground breaking only in that Burroughs was one of the first to get this kind of book published.

I have seen very intelligent people rave about this book, but I just can't get into it. I do think it influenced Layne Staley of Alice in Chains though, so all you Dirt fans might want to check it out.

It's worth at least checking out--then if you don't like it you can come on this page and write another review no one will ever read, trashing the novel...."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"the book came in on time and in great shape! i had no problems with this vendor and the way they listed the condition of the book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the \\"naked\\" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, \\"Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!\\" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"There has been much written about Naked Lunch, so much that the basic facts can be stated from memory: written in Tangiers while the author was addicted to heroin, edited by Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, sold to Olympia Press in Paris and Grove Press in New York, made the author famous and ranked him with Henry Miller and the Marquis de Sade, suffered obscenity trials that ended literary censorship in America, filmed as a movie by David Cronenberg almost twenty five years after publication. And don't forget that Steely Dan got their name from this novel but they claim they never read it.That is the story of its life: few people have actually gotten through the whole book. It reads in fragments with inconsistent characters morphing, changing and altering identities. Dream, hallucination, reality and drug visions blend and merge and disperse. Scatalogical routines take coherant form and read like vaudville humor from a bathroom wall, then deteriorate into filthy fragments and irreverant and often disgusting descriptions of sado-masochistic sex acts. Everyone is a junkie, everyone is gay, everyone screws teenaged North African boys, everyone is insane, psychotic or diseased. Doctors kill their patients, police murder their suspects, drug addicts infect their marks with insect diseases and turn into centipedes during sex acts that threaten to nauseate the reader.So what does it all mean? What is the motivation or the reasoning behind it all. Burroughs was no fool and he had a strong moral intent all the way. He considered himself a reporter who has entered behind enemy lines, like a photojournalist who returns from Vietnam with pictures of napalmed babies. The title Naked Lunch evokes an image of someone being wised up to what they are eating. Burroughs is depicting the relationship between the junkie and the drug dealer to be a metaphor for all control systems, for all vampiric systems whether it be capital punishment, abuse of political power, police states, etc. By the time Burroughs wrote this novel he had suffered through decades of abuse at the hands of federal agents, narcotics police and the customs officials of all the third world borderlines that he crossed as he moved from New York to Texas to New Orleans to New Mexico to Mexico City to Tangiers, all the time running from the police, none the least of reasons being that he shot his wife through the head during a drunken game of William Tell (she put a glass on her head and challenged him to shoot it off -- he lost the challenge).Burroughs was a troubled junkie from a distinguished southern family, a Harvard student who studied archeology and linguistics, who studied medicine in Vienna, who went to New York to find work and wound up hooked on heroin. He took part in the birth of the Beat Generation in 1944 before setting off on his long tortured odyssey that led to more drug addiction, the death of his wife, and the bottom that he hit in Tangiers. He went there in the mid-50's to impress the exiled community of writers including Paul Bowels (who wrote the Shelting Sky) but who rejected him because he was just a filthy junky with a gun fetish. Instead he wrote Naked Lunch. It is a descent into Hell chronicled by a man who was to become one of the best writers of the 20th Century.The events that led to the writing of Naked Lunch is chroniciled in the amazing documents known as the Letters of William Burroughs 1945-1959. These letters were the source of Cronenberg's screenplay of Naked Lunch, more so than Naked Lunch itself. Read the letters first, then read Naked Lunch. Then see the movie. In that order. It will all make sense...in the end.A book that changed our cultural landscape. It never became dated. It exists outside of time and space, in the Interzone of our polluted minds."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I have had my copy of Naked Lunch for years and years, read through it many times, but have never attempted to write any kind of review on it, up untill now, because it is just such an amazing book that no words could ever do it any justice! Right from the beginning the writing is brilliant and creative and the pacing is absolutely furious.There is no simple way to convey the 'story' because indeed nothing like a linear plot line exists. Many people, my own brother included, hate this and simply will not read the whole way through it for this reason alone. The only way to attempt to summerise the book as a whole in a tidy fasion is to say that essintialy it chronicles a mans journey from the United States, the heat was closing in, to Mexico and later Tangiers and finally to the imaginary Interzone.Along the way we meet many colorful charaters, the most memorable of which is the charming and diabolical Dr Benway, and visit many exotic dreamscapes like the Meet Cafe where patrons eat the black meat of the giant aquatic centerpede while mugwamps dispense addictive fluid from their heads. At first glace the reader may assume that this dark world with its evil political factions and infernal beaurocracies is a paranoid nightmare of the author, but when you look closer it is the dark side of same world that we live in everyday rendered down to its most extreme and 'naked' form.While many would like to put William S Burroughs down as nothing more than a junkie who killed his own wife and whose writing is very overated, there is simply such power in his words that cannot be denied. The captivating writing style and the amazingly hilairious black humor that abounds throught out the book (and is probually some of the darkest humor ever, in any medium) come straight off every page. Likewise many people, insecure people I would assume, look down on this book for it's sections that are some what pornographic, not that they that far from your average 'rommance' novel, but because they consist of homosexual activities. Obviuosly Burroughs's unblinking brutal disection of our darkest desires and addictions, whether it be drugs, sex, money or power over the mind of others was too much for the general public to handle when it was first published and it is a shame to see that even in this day and age there are still some who express those same small minded attitudes when they are confronted by the intensity of this writing.The best way I can think to express my opinion of Naked Lunch is to say that I feel it lives up to it's strange title completely, indeed contained within is the most 'naked' view, the most powerfull, raw, twisted and decidedly dark take on reality ever told. And when you read this book it's is as though you have sat down to 'lunch', the book is such a feast for the mind, evey page full of energy, heavy idea's and thick with creative genius.Not a book for everyone, but those open minded will find reading this book to be a genuinly enriching experience, indeed there is no other book quite like it, but squares should stay away."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"What else can I say, other than that this is &quot;the&quot; book that has brought William S. Burroughs the most fame(infamy?) and glory. Most people interested in Beat Literature choose Kerouac for insight, but I feel that Burroughs gets to the root of the Beatniks' most defining element: Drug use/abuse. His style is unrelenting. His prose harsh and ragged, not unlike himslef for some 15 odd years of his life in which he lived as a junky. I urge the reader to not read this book in sequence from beginning to end as a traditional novel. Instead, read a chapter or two at a time. Then, set it down and leave it alone for a day. The next day, return and continue reading. Each pargraph; each page is a message unto itself. Burroughs uses a rehab center in a place called Interzone, the character William Lee, and a sadistic orgy to help convey the over-all idea that the junky is a sad and tragic individual. But, what makes the junky so tragic is not his position in life. It is the sad fact that he put himself there in the first place. And, to spite himself, the junky's body must continue this act even though his mind says no. It is sad that this book has not been given the credit that it is due. Only at the end of his life did Mr. Burroughs begin to reap the rewards of his, and his comrades' work. As though he couldn't stand another minute in the world of the straight and narrow without a friend(Allen Ginsberg, the last Beat), he died after a life of extreme hardships and bittersweet success. Needless to say, this book sums up Burroughs' early life on the streets before any real intimations of success. It is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for those of you who prefer &quot;popular&quot; literature. It is for those of us who seek the truth, and read books about certain topics for an element of reality."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"It's been almost three years now since Uncle Bill scored the Immaculate Fix, but his spirit still lives on. This novel, Burroughs' greatest work was written in the late 1950's, a time when American pop culture reached untold heights of banality. Enter Naked Lunch - a double-barreled assault on truth, justice, and the American Way. No institution is safe, nothing is sacred, and the taboo is made holy, as capitalists, racists, fascists, homophobes, doctors, cops, Christians, and hypocrites of all sorts get their just desserts. Burroughs, a fortunate son born into wealth and power, dissects and destroys proper society in his prose, exploding mind bombs of words throughout. Veering somewhere between a bad acid trip and exact Swiftian satire, Naked Lunch remains the most original work of fiction ever written. A must-read for all serious students of literature, this is one of those books that you just can't &quot;like&quot; - you either love it, or you hate it. I absolutely loved it! This book also begs for re-reads as new insights are revealed with each reading. And please, PLEASE be sure to listen to Burroughs read the abridged version on tape! After completing this novel, Burroughs went on to invent the cyberpunk sub-genre of science fiction with his Nova Trilogy of novels. As Norman Mailer once opined, &quot;Burroughs is the only American novelist living today who may concievably be possessed by genius.&quot; Squares need not apply. A word to the Wise Guy."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"As other reviewers have complained, this book is lacking a plot and doesn't have much of a structure. A reader looking for a a more clear and simplistic Burroughs should try out his pulpish but entertaining _Junkie_ and _Queer_. These books use an autobiographical format to show the author falling into a life of drugs and homosexual dependence, which the author clearly viewed as entrapping and morally wrong, even as he fell into them and maintained a objective viewpoint.Naked Lunch takes these themes and greatly improves them. After starting with a scene of the protaganist fleeing the law, it's broken into vaguely related scenes of several pages each. These scenes are often bizarre or disgusting, but are always intriguing. Taken together, they give an impressionistic look into the life of an addict. They are often extremely funny, and the writing is very impressive. I enjoy pulp fiction, and Burrough's take at pulp fiction at the end, with Hauser &amp; O'Brien, is perhaps the strongest piece of hard-boiled detective writing I've ever read.Drugs are central to Burrough's vision, but this isn't really a drug book, either, and is more about Burrough's compelling if slightly twisted philosophies. Heroin is used as a central metaphor for systems of control that Burroughs sees elsewhere - in domineering characters, in 50's politics, in modern science, in patriarchies. If the reader can get past the initial shock of the book, it's extremely readable and I'd recommend it highly"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"As an avid Stephen King and splatter-movie fan, I can still say that Naked Lunch is the most genuinely disturbing book I have ever read. Written under the influence of what was apparently a really bad heroin fix, Naked Lunch is the stuff of nightmares. I can't stress this point enough: Burroughs doesn't just cross boundaries of good taste, he utterly destroys them with sadistic glee. No stone is left unturned, no taboo left unbroken.That said, this is a pretty enjoyable read. The lack of a coherent story line may annoy some people, but it also shows how sporadically the author's hallucinations appear and disappear. The only main character seems to be heroin. This is the literary equivalent of the film Eraserhead; dark, morbid, sickening, and about as close to a nightmare as the conscious mind can get. And like Eraserhead, it's impossible to fully interpret or ignore once it's in view."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is what you get when you cross a Harvard education with a heroin habit.It is incorrect to describe it as a \\"novel\\"; instead it is a collection of short vignettes bound together by recurrent characters, themes, and motifs. Many reviewers who have given it one star complain about its obvious lack of plot, but such is your life on The Junk: you drift day to day, fix to fix, with no real direction.Naked Lunch is a powerful anti-drug novel, but more-so it is about ALL addictions. Sex, food, greed; any all-consuming passion is worked in and exposed with vivid horror. There is a lot of subtle social commentary lurking beneath the surreal imagery, though it often takes several readings to find it.Many people view this book as pointless and grotesque, while others (such as myself) see it as a sly, sardonic comedy. If you think the movie \\"Clockwork Orange\\" is *funny* then you will LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"It would be easy to dismiss &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; as a junkie's incoherent nonsense, but, like most surrealism, there is an artistry and intelligence in it that must be acknowledged. Like Herman Hesse's &quot;Steppenwolf,&quot; but going much farther beyond the bounds of literary convention, it is about a man's mental journey into the absurd, combining a cautionary tale, political satire, science fiction, and science friction into a world shrouded in a narcotic haze.Burroughs's novel has no plot and no clearly defined characters. It is a story narrated by a junk (opium and opium-derivative drugs, including heroin) addict who is sitting in a barren room somewhere, not having washed for months, needle in hand, searching desperately for a vein anywhere in his body that hasn't been worn out yet from repeated injections. His trips take you to a place he calls Interzone, a multicultural panorama where deranged totalitarian political parties threaten to destroy each other, junkies and perverts writhe in festering filth, and violent orgies of sexual depravity, homoeroticism, pederasty, and scatology fill page after page in lurid detail. It's like a travel guide to Sodom and Gomorrah.I was completely absorbed by the book, even though there was much in it that I honestly didn't understand. I enjoyed the colorful imagery and the frequent sentences of crystalline beauty (&quot;The subway sweeps by with a black blast of iron.&quot;), and I just let myself get swept along with the stream-of-consciousness flow of the words.The book is not anti-drugs, but it is anti-addiction and anti-sickness. What Burroughs is emphasizing is control -- if you don't have knowledge about something, it will control you rather than you control it. In the Appendix he writes frankly about the various drugs he's taken, their effects on his health, and their potential for addiction; and while he may not be the most credible scientific authority on the subject, his explanations are clear, concise, and helpful. All this is much more effective and informative than any of Nancy Reagan's flimsy &quot;Just Say No&quot; cream puff propaganda of the 1980's. &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; deserves praise for its honesty rather than criticism for its imagery."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"i see how some people fail to understand why Naked Lunch is indeed one of the greatest books of this century - the first contact with it leaves you shocked, disoriented. There is no real storyline one could easily explain, nor are the characters defined - Burroughs instead creates atmosphere, litle bits of subreality, and ends up with a world that is in a way more real than it oughta be - he is not afraid of loading it with an oddball mix of tiny stories, poems, events, descriptions and dialogues that dont have much to do with the 'main' story - as long as it's one huge nightmare, he keeps pushing it - and you simply have to enjoy it, even if you cant really tell why. Take a stab at this great book! Special thanks, too, to the guy who recommended that book by richard perez -- The Losers Club, maybe the best recommendation i've had in months."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This novel is unlike anything that I've ever read. Burroughs's flights of fancy are wildly imaginative and often repugnant; he displays an unusual mastery of language and an outrageous prose. With its highly volatile and pornographic content, sometimes homosexual in nature, it's somewhat hard to believe that &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; was printed in 1959. (In fact, censorship proceedings are documented in the introduction to the paperback version. For this episode alone, the book is important.)Whether you like this fiction is a serious matter of taste, but it IS vilely artistic and undeniably useful to the student of literature. What's ultimately the point of the novel? I can only offer a subjective opinion. But we are fed the notion that the novel condemns all forms of addiction -- addiction to drugs, power, subservience, sex, etc. -- though it's difficult to see this without prior guidance. I thought that I'd seen and heard everything, but my first encounter with Burroughs proved me wrong -- big time!This kind of writing isn't for the faint of heart. Although Burroughs definitely displays a prodigious talent, his art may be compared to Henry Miller on drugs. If you feel that you COULD'VE liked this book, but the style threw you off, give Miller's &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; a whirl."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"...but that's to be expected. Before you read this book it's vital to listen to some spoken word recordings of William S. Burroughs. Once you hear him speak for 5 or 10 minutes you'll be able to read the book with his voice in mind. It's a monotone, world weary, deadpan voice, dusty dry and gritty. There's a lot of pain in this book. It's an EYE opener."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Ever want to understand what its like to live in your most depraved state? Well William Burroughs hit the hammer on the head for me. This book is like a nightmare ranging from subtle shout outs from the sub-concious to full on mass orgies of blood and murder.Although sometimes hard to understand i think the book shouldn't be taken litteraly. Its more like trying to understand a dream or (no offense) reading the Bible."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"When the film of this book came out there was a temporary resurgance of interest in Burroughs, mostly to do with the controversial aspect of his work. At the time my older sister had this book and wasn't very interested in it so being a curious 13 year old I picked it up wanting to find out what was so 'depraved' about it.From the first page I quickly found myself immersed in a very strange, paranoid world indeed and found it absolutely fascinating. The writing style is quite manic, jumping through different subject matter, sometimes incoherently. It took me a couple of chapters to realise that most of the prose is the hallucinogenic ramblings of a drug addict. When I realised this I stopped trying to read the book like a novel or look for any kind of storyline for that matter and just read excerpts, sometimes twice for good measure. Despite the constant drug references I feel there is a strong anti-narcotics (certainly heroin anyway) theme, Burroughs conveys the sense of helplessness he experiences at trying to kick his habit insightfully and deliriously. If there was an overall storyline to this book then it would be a tale of decline; from his sometimes charming descriptions and interludes with the junkies in his area of New York, over the course of a few years his deranged drug life and spirit of adventure takes him to Tangiers. During the course of these travels his desire to kick the habit becomes stronger, the naivety of his New York life is stripped away and his furtive hallucinations become darker and more schizophrenic as he searches for a place of refuge away from the 'normal' America he fears and dislikes. This book isn't so much a story as a visceral experience. It makes you curious about the drug induced beat culture he was at the centre of, though his disdain for the 'junk' which controls him is always apparent. The literary credibility of this book is often disputed but regardless its comically entertaining and its influence cannot be doubted."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"If you are considering reading Naked Lunch, you should be warned that it is one of the most challenging classics of recent literary history. The infamous novel, scrawled down during the twilight of author, William S. Burroughs' fifteen-year addiction to opiates, has frustrated countless readers with its inability to fit into any type of classification; its vulgar, offensive nature and its shaky stream-of-conscious narration. To some, Naked Lunch may seem like tasteless gibberish (That is certainly how it seemed to the Massachusetts Attorney General who unsuccessfully tried the novel for obscenity charges in 1966). But by taking the right approach to this story of Bill Lee, a drug pusher and habitual user, and Interzone, the surrealist, netherworld in urban Mexico to which he flees, you may find it to be a spectacular writing.Keep in mind that Burroughs is the definition of a beatnik, an author who forbids himself any scholarly instruction and simply wrote as he felt, scraping satire, fantasy and social realism together into one vessel. Understand that he lived much of his life as a drifter, pulled ever downward into society's grimier aspects. Vulgarity and mortification are simply results of the author writing what he knows. Remember that his psyche had been scrambled by opiates and that Naked Lunch's rickety form intriguingly mirrors Burroughs' sense of reality. Now you are ready for this bizarre, extraordinary book.Although reading Naked Lunch is a thorny process, it offers numerable delights: Deep belly-laughter at Interzone's funhouse mirroring of American decadence, intense visualization of the area's vividly described, baroque spectacles, astonishment at its denizens' all-consuming greed, hypocrisy and sadism, speculation at how much of these strange observations were based on what Burroughs actually experienced and fascination at the way in which the narration breaks down as the speaker's mind erodes. I hope that you find that, despite its disregard for almost every rule taught in High School English; despite its rawness and vulgarity and despite being an exceptional challenge to follow, Naked Lunch is a mind-blowing book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, is like inhaling a tornado of vision, of America, of the soul of humanity, and of the junkie from a heroine addict's hungry mind. In Naked Lunch, Burroughs denounces the gray of mass conform-ism, which has settled like a sodden sponge over the square inhabitants of America. He shows the American way of life, as being policed by mom and pop and their good ole' Christian values. Burroughs relayed in the novel, that America is censored by the extreme fear of erotica, sexuality, drug use, and the queerness of the hip. Also, Burroughs prose navigates its way through many layers of the human mind, exploring and allowing you to become the screwball, the sick, the perverse, the nymphomaniac, the junkie, the racist, the politician, the homophobic, or the square. Burroughs also bluntly states that the junkie is the saddest form of life, fueled entirely by the utter need for junk. Burroughs describes junk as an \\"evil virus\\", decaying body and mind into slime pools of agony in a never ending lust for the pleasure of high. In Naked Lunch, Burroughs writes in non-linear prose, in a confusing, at times plotless vision of himself and the world. His words are a roller coaster of thought and reflection, vision and persecution, wake up call and warning, but his choppy whirlwind of words could be confused as a haze of junk crazed babble, which it is definetly not. Naked Lunch, in the opinion of many, sits on a hairline between the art and rawness of the mind and how it interprets addiction, and something along the lines of extreme indulgence, and pornography. I would recommend this book to the person who enjoys the obscure world of oddball beat poetry or stream of consciousness writing. I would also recommend this book to someone itching to find a novel, which allows them to think and come upon their own realizations of life, or to someone who is simply looking for a twisted, thrilling novel. Naked Lunch, is one of the best books I have ever read. Burroughs created a window into the nuclear wastelands of a junkie's mind in Naked Lunch; it's a frightening and illusive place for many, but its all the more real from reading this book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs's controversial masterpiece is one of the greatest works of the past century. The work combines the elements of a hard-boiled detective novel, science fiction, and pornography into a post-modern cornicopia of thought. Aside from Burroughs's signature black humor, the text non-linear plot involves such timeless themes as paranoia, sexuality, politics (a la 1984), atop of Pavlovian psychology. All of Burroughs's ideas are represented in a linguistic style that is well worth the effort. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"If you read those two books, This book still wont make any sense. But you will have a better feel for it."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I can't believe how amzingly interesting this book is! I have read it many times and will continue too for a long while. It is also amazing that my school teachers(yes I am only 14, I can still read) tell me that this book is just plain crap (and then force us to read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; for the 3rd time and tell me how much it changed modern literature and blah blah blah). This book influenced tons of writers, poets, visionaries, hippies, artists, and a bazillion other people. Come on, this book influenced modern music! Any book that can change the music world is very special and important (it heavily influenced the writting of Lou Reed in his Velvet Underground days of the late 60's). Everyone seems to take this book solely as a book about a junky's hallucinations and a vehicle for Burroughs' cut-up style. It is moslty in Interzone (the hallucinatory planet,city,whatever..), and I am sure that this place was created by various drugs. That is all beside the point, this book is mainly about addiction, not necessarilly addiction to smack or junk but man's addiction to everything he may be addicted to. All in all, with this book, you have to take it as it comes. If you don't like it, don't bother to read it, but you'll be missing out on an amazing literary work of great beauty."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is almost devoid of plot, you really have to look hard to find it, but it is one of the most compelling and disturbing books I've ever read.If gay sex, rape, abuse, drug addiction, anti-narrative, and paranoid delusions bother you, then give this work a wide, wide berth. However, if the above do not trouble you then this may be 'the' book for you.I read this once before in my early 20s and was put off by the homosexuality...just couldn't find a way into the book because of this. Now in my 50s I've re-read it and have found it one of the most compelling books I've ever read. Easily one of the top 10 works of literary fiction in the 20th century. Essential reading for anyone interested in or studying 20th century American Literary fiction.Cannot recommend this book highly enough...though mind my above provisos."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is almost impossible to read straight through, but taken in little pieces, as a result of the cut-up method the author uses, can really free one's mind on what a novel can be. This book is for anyone who is a fan of the beat generation and want to experience the strange and rambling mind of Burroughs, but without the highs and horrible lows of drug addiction."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch was one of many dog-eared, obscene books that were passed around in theAir Force barracks where I was stationed in 1961 and 1962. Others included Henry Miller's Tropics books. Both Lunch and the Tropics books were hilarious. Burroughs' surrealistic scenarios were less plausible than Miller's. Lunch is still entertaining. I suppose you can call it a novel if you want to. To me, it is a series of entertaining vignettes. Read it for fun but keep it out of the reach of children and sensitive persons. It has no redeeming social value."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I'll never forget the first time I read &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. I was 15 years old and the book made my imagination take off to places I never knew existed, where sex was dangerous, and junk put you in some sort of sci-fi world where nothing was solid or stabile. What made my mind reel most was the brilliant use of the cut-up system which completely transformed my way of writing into something as close to honest as I've ever been. The plot is slippery and hard to grasp at first, but I think thats what appeals to me. If you love jazz and if the rhythm, flow and atmosphere in a book is as important to you as a good plot this is definitely and without a doubt the right book for you - you can thank me later...:)"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"You know Burroughs to me, is very hit or miss. Junky was a hit. Some of interzone was a hit.... But Naked Lunch to me, while I guess many consider it a great work of art, seems to me to be a rambling self indulgent diatribe. Again maybe I have to read it again, but I don't quite have the desire to do so. There are some good moments it the book. But since it's basically a junkie talking while on junk I didn't think I could relate. Burroughs was a fantasic writer with such a sharp mind, and occasionally I just think he is being lazy with it, masking bull for ART."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I read this book in 3 1/2 days, after receiving a reccomendation from a friend. This book is absolutely unbelievable. It twists your reality and perception to new points. It mocks government and people, and shows what lies at the base of every human action; lust, greed and addiction. It shows humanity as its uncovered self, and exposes the bizarre society He has created. This book is deliciously warped and will blow your mind with its awesome descriptions and well-selected scenes. It is drugs sex and society. It is life. I highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a life-changing book. This book had me spell-bound, nothing like anything I had ever read before. I'm immediatly going to buy &quot;Junky&quot;-its sequel- now that I've finished &quot;Naked Lunch.&quot; This book is a lot like one of its main characters (heroin) in how damn addicting it is. Get this book for a motivating and enlightening experience."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I am only half way through this book but already feel the need to give my opinion. This is a truly amazing book, even though it includes several ideas which some people may find affending. The language used is quite difficult to understand, so it's not an easy read, but with some concentration you uncover a wonderful storyline. The beginning is very intreging with the court case around naked lunch, this really launches you into the book. I have already orded another book by the author which I know I will enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I heard a story about the author on the ABC Radio. What an interesting story I thought. Author, gay??, married???, straight????, kills wife at dinner party, alcoholic, drug addict. How more interesting can it get? Well what the ...... it didnt make much sense. How can this be a literary masterpiece. I just dont get it. and I tried. good luck if you give it a go."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I bought this with great intension to give it as a gift, but I ended up reading it myself.Most of the time I was trying to stay awake.Both the movie and the book are really boring, and I'm not sure why it reached such notable claim.I would recommend anyone wanting to read something like this to just bite the bullet and read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson. It paints a better image, and at least you'd be awake to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The book was in perfect condition and it was so inexpensive , I'd definitely order from them again.And the book is fantastic too, very diverse writing style."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend; I have since recommended it to other friends. It has been said that &#34;Naked Lunch&#34; is one of the hardest books to understand, but it is also one of the most influential works in American literature. After reading the book, I can certainly say this is true. Burroughs definitely hits upon the myopic, corrupt, and power-seeking attributes of governance, as well as, America's quest for constant euphoric and titillating (and sometimes depraved) stimulation and/or pleasure.Due to the use of vulgar language, violence, and drug references, this book needs parental discretion. However, it is still a great book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The book seems to be about a person taking drugs, mostly herioin. But their mind and perceptions seem to be all messed up. At least this seems to be what I've read. I've found the book fairly difficult to read, though I read a wide range of books."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is one of the most difficult to understand pieces of literature ever constructed. Written in a non-linear, juxta-posed, cut up manner, Naked Lunch parallels the eratic synaptic internal firings of a junkies brain and bodily functions. Occassionally dispensing refreshingly riveting insights into a heroin addicts out of body experiences, Burroughs presents a garbling and violent depiction of the dark recesses of demonic drug possession. Frightening and clairvoyant in its brutal, uncensored portrayal of 1950s, expatriate, existentialist drug excesses."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"After reading Junky and Queer, this book was a major disappointment. It is confusing, and not very well written. There is not real story here, just a lot of confusing rambling."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I know what you're thinking. \\"Who's this square that doesn't like Naked Lunch? Must be some kinda conservative nutjob not to like this amazing piece of counter-culture artwork!\\"Hey, I get it. You're edgy. Go you. Yes, shocking images of sex and drug use and pedophilia and cannibalism and stickin' it to the man, man. Just leave this where your parents will find it and you know you'll earn cool points with the cats back at school. Leave it on your coffee table while your friends come over and you know you'll get to share some good stories while passin' the bong around, man. I'm sure you're stoked about that.Sorry, but I hated this book for reasons that differ from why your parents hated it:1) \\"Edgy\\" doesn't sell with me. Maybe in 1959, when this book was first published, this stuff was cutting edge. Maybe it's still cutting edge in the sheltered suburbs of America. But anyone who's been on the internet as long as I have and has long ago found the dark corners has already seen and read far more edgy stuff than what's in this book. You want edgy? I can direct you to some websites that will make Naked Lunch look like a book for 3rd graders. It's 2012. I'm not impressed with 1950s \\"edgy\\".2) It's not a good or enjoyable book if the \\"edgy\\" thing doesn't catch you. The stories, if you can call them that, are disjointed, often lack internal cohesion even from one page to the next within the same story and just aren't remotely interesting narratives. I get the idea that we are supposed to be taking a wild ride through the drug addled brain of the author but if you've read a quarter of the book, you've read the whole thing -- it's nothing but more and more of the same nonsensical pseudo-stories. By a quarter of the way in I was like, \\"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Drugs messed you up. Let's get on with it.\\" And he never got on with it. Just story after story of cheap \\"shocker\\" material that's probably excellent and revealing if you feel like an overly sheltered artist waiting to break out of his protective shell.For the unsheltered generations, the book is a bore, at best. Maybe it's interesting discussion material regarding the repressed generations of decades gone by, who really had their socks knocked off by what was in this book. Maybe it's interesting discussion material about how some people will like just about anything if they think it makes them look \\"edgy\\" in the eyes of their peers. Maybe it's a good book for convincing your kids to stay off drugs, especially if they want to ever become coherent writers.But as a book just for the sake of reading, it's an insult to authors everywhere. Anyone can sit down and write a bunch of pages of incoherent babble with disjointed stories that make no sense. Not everyone can write a good, interesting story, and the author is a great example of one of those people. This book has finally displaced L. Ron Hubbard's \\"Battlefield Earth\\" for the title of \\"worst book I have ever read\\"."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Pure smut. But good. You will feel like you are on drugs as you read it. Some parts of it you will have to read 2, 3, 4, 10 times. Unless you're a druggie, then you'll get it.No part of this book is really coherent beyond a couple of paragraphs. Lewd sex acts come out pretty clearly. Violence comes out pretty clearly. But everything else is more than just a tiny bit muddled. Makes you feel like you're strung out while reading it. Who needs drugs?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Don't know how to really review a book of such. People labeling it like \\"for the sadist and masochistic\\" or \\"uncatagorized\\" being shallow in their depths.Purly a book that steady recognizes how threatening it's ideas are to the reader ( or should i say \\"the subject\\"), any reader, no matter what opinion of individualism, even collective, holds. The fact the book dislocates your rationale on theory's of idea & concept as the subject as a matter a fact surly evokes all sorts of relative opinions being irrelivent and irreverent in compartive. I'm not one to talk anyway; but this book obviously did and still does take no prisoners, \\"and no holes barred!\\".As complicating and de-escalating as the book allows itself to be you still find an inhibited coherence staggering uninterupted through the course of every sentence; something too horrowing and complete, history driven, eccentricly riveting and fanaticaly innocent among the happenings of humanity that drove the author to write.Without a doubt the scariest book ever written.The concept of dehumanization can not be ignored by anyone who lives, and in pieced-part what the book may be about. The book takes egocentric forms of fantasy, adventursome, vision, experience, rebellion, terror & sabatauge on a universal scale beyond peaks of mear interest and just might make you look at everything including prehistoric events differently.A physicality lives inside the book, pages turned.It has everything from pirates to aliens, information classified about past events and future even if the imagionable is the only thing that recongnizes or comprehends.\\"With it and for it.\\""},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book made me sick. It took me ages to read it, because I had to keep putting it down. But that's the beauty of it: the ramblings of a junky have never seemed more real nor more potent.

This truly the most bizarre and &quot;far out&quot; book I have ever read. And here's the catch: I liked it. In the end, I really liked it!!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Sever yourself from reality before you read this book, you will not understand it otherwise. Burroughs writing extraordinarily moves from reality to hallucination from the point of the hallucinator. You will not realize you have entered a hallucination until the hallucination has ended and you think, &quot;Wait, that can't happen.&quot;I find the book to be filled with social commentary, others do not. I find wonderfully written allusions in many of the characters and settings. Take from the book what you will, but you will certainly take a lot!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"With a natural talent for writing and a drug-fueled imagination, Burroughs is truly one of the greatest writers of all eras.Naked Lunch is hilarious, as well as serious, and above all a great collection of \\"under-the-influence?\\" observations and notes that were put together to create an illusionary, unique, and thought-provoking novel of sorts. Greatly recommended to all."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I honestly had no idea what to expect when i opened this book and after reading a bit into it i still had no idea what was going on. But after a while i finally grasped onto the pace of the book and what was being written about, you can't attempt to make sense of what you are reading or you will be confused you have to just let the words grasp and play with your mind and you can try to make sense of it all later. The book is also very very funny at parts and very very graphic and distrubing at others, it is not for everyone, but i certainly enjoyed it"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"My hat is off to William S. Burroughs for the ugly blatentness of this, his much acclaimed and often under-acclaimed masterpiece. It is not at all a pleasant book to read, except in the parts where his disturbing wit surfaces. The words at first glance burn our eyes but widen them all the same. It is not, however until they infiltrate your gut that they start to do the real damage. The narrative format is realistically choppy in consequence to how the then narcotics addict author thought.No other book this century affected in whole all that Burroughs's Naked Lunch did. The obcenity trial following its 1960s United States publication virtually ended literary censorship in America. Good God, if you aren't convinced to read it now, what are you even doing reading these reviews?"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs at his best. A must read for anyone wanting to start reading Burroughs or hasnt read it yet."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"What would the world do without this kind of book? It brought back so many memoreies of my Jewish childhood, that it must be one if the most enthralling experiences I've had in years!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I found it to be an amazing and insiteful look into the heart of a man riddled with addiction.The things expressed in this book may seem disgusting or displeasing but read on and you will trully be entertained"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is an incredible book for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that somebody had the balls to think this stuff up and write it down. It's a pity William S. Burroughs never again reached this level in his writing, but where do you go from the top? As the artistic embodiment of an argument against censorship &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is almost without peer. This is a gritty, harrowing, often laugh-out-loud funny book, that will turn many stomachs, but resonate deeply with many minds."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is important now as ever. Think of it as a public service announcement, a warning against heroin. More important today as there are 3 times as many users than there were 10 years ago. I can't help but think that if some of these users had first read this book they'd have never started. That's because Naked Lunch draws the peramiters of hell on earth and hell on earth is caused by pure and total addiction. Addiction to drugs, sex, political power or what have you. It's not an easy read because much of the prose style is fragmented, just as our actual thoughts are...but if you take time to examine some of these paragraph length fragments, more often than not you'll be rewarded with thought provoking insight, and sometimes with lyrical poetry. And then sometimes you'll just be discusted. But you don't wade neck deep through Borroughs filth and get nothing in return. He's dredged the bottom and brought back some important messages. I suggest not begining this book at the begining but randomly opening it to the middle and begining. Read it at random just as it was written and you'll get more out of it. Finally, if the US government were a bit more hip they'd be wise to how much this book could help them in their anti-drug campaign. Naked Lunch is a friend to the US government? Now that would really make Buroughs roll in his grave."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"His work is like a dark mosaic and I do recommend this book and all his other work. I recommend the audio stories and poems on CD's and the film &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. BRAVO to Burroughs, a great dead friend...a divine master in literature. END"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this is not a book you read if you want to sit back and relax with something mindless. it took me a chapter or two to get use to his style of prose. but it was worth it, his images of a drug addicted life are stark and surreal. Some of his prose was pure poetry. when I finished this book all I could say was wow, you don't have to follow a set of rules about writing to create a masterpiece. sometimes all you need is orginality. The book of Burroughs letters to ginsberg is a great companion piece to this book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Yes what more can you say about a book that has so settled itself in the collective mind and that itself points a knife to anybody who dares to say something, because it deals with all the lies we build up in our addiction to life and fear of death? Through all the noise a silence emanates from this turmoil of 'written pages'. His cut up trilogy would give words to that feeling, here it only exists in the mind of the reader who gets knocked out. But it is such an exhillarating book at the same time that with all the death smell in it you come to suspect that the writer has a deep love for the truth of being. The hatred he spits out is that of disgust for the trampling of just that truth, and he sees himself as an agent for this. A double agent, fallen victim to the enemy and struggling to escape from this untrue situation. There the book has a key to our sympathy. He engages us in his own battle, showing we are all double agents. And his language is so fresh and direct and full of images and sounds from the street that you are sucked into its world. And transformed. Dont't mistake Naked Lunch for a drugdream. Passages may be written under the influence, but it is the attempted transcending of all influences and control that lend this master piece its lucidity."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"when finished reading this book i was overwhelmed with the sensations that it brought, yet could not find a way to exactly describe what it was about. on one hand we are asked to view it as the choice piece of literature of the drug world, but it seems presumptuous to view it merely as that. the surrealistic world burroughs portrays at times mirrors our own with mountains of scandals, filth, and secrets and is also completely foreign with its aliens and strange sex games. it is a very sensual book yet maintains a distance the entire time. i found this method quite interesting as we are thrust headon into this world yet somehow we are never fully a part of it. while i certainly wouldn't recommend this book to everybody, i would definitely suggest reading it. it is a wonderful book by one of the greatest writers of this century."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch will surprise you. I went into this book expecting complete absurdity and choas, but I found more choas than I thought possible. I read Naked Lunch for the Burroughs/Beat angle, but it is so completely different from other Beat Generation works (ie-Kerouac) that I didn't get much out of it in this respect.The writing is amazing. Burroughs' command of language is unparalleled and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the quirky phrases he uses. The writing also makes it hard to follow both the ideas and the &quot;plot&quot;. I confess that I didn't get a lot of the ideas, but the sheer originality and creativity of the work makes it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"A difficult work (I finished the second-half of the novel after a three-year hiatus) that definitely demands re-reading. My difficulty in reading this novel stemmed both from the disturbing starkness of the subject matter and from the experimental prose through which this subject matter is presented. In other words, don't expect a plot, character development, or any other standard literary convention in this exploration of JUNK.According to the author, the title refers to experiencing life without any blinders, preconceptions, etc., i.e., a \\"naked lunch\\" in which everyone is aware of what precisely is on the end of every fork. From what I gleaned in the front matter, portions of the novel--probably the sections that most disturbed me (e.g., those involving hangings, necks snapping, and strings of \\"rancid jissom\\")--were written as a Swiftian satire against the brutality of capital punishment. Although it is the barbarism of capital punishment, akin to the religious sacrifice of human beings, that Burroughs specifically wants us to see nakedly, this \\"banquet of naked awareness\\" applies equally well to all areas of human endeavor in which we blind ourselves to our true motives, feelings, etc.Being a clear perception of the Hells created by the blind pursuit of technoscientific domination and the addiction to power and control makes this novel utterly important and incredibly difficult."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Beyond a doubt, Naked Lunch is the absolute funniest book I have ever read ... far more outrageous than HSTs &quot;F&amp;L in Las Vegas&quot;. Dr. Benway is a character for the ages.Of all of the heralded &quot;Beat&quot; generation writers, Kerouac is probably the most lauded. Keroac was cool -- a tragic hipster trying to find himself in the dawn of corporate growth, but Burroughs was (and still is) the perfect counterpoint to a &quot;Leave-it-to-Beaver&quot; America.Anyone who actually read this book and did not find it mesmerizing and hilarious were obviously in waaaaay over their heads (it's okay to admit your shortcomings), and should stick to King, Clancy or the latest from Danielle Steele. After all, people who still need to sound-out words when reading have no business picking up an actual piece of literature. Much like a non-swimmer diving into the deep end to impress the county cutie, that type will quickly find themselves in a lot of trouble, and will ususally come up with the standard excuses for why they didn't get the book. So you folks can keep reading about how our hero Sgt. Bloodspiller saved America from the evil Arab hoards, or how Ms. Frostypants finally found true love at the hands of the neighborhood plumber. But those who can actually taste the words of a well written book will be wee advised to sink their teeth into this one"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"When I read Naked Lunch four years ago, I was completely astounded. I'd felt I had a contact high from the pages. The book began to work its way through my skin and on to the printed page: My writing hasn't been the same since.I was so freed from the conventional, and often times restaining &quot;rules&quot; of structure, plot, theme, and character. While Naked Lunch definately has some of these elements, mostly in the theme department, and little else, it works. I've noticed that readers of Jane Austen or the like usually DO NOT enjoy this book. It's threatening to them. They like their &quot;story&quot; served on a silver tray.YES, to have to think when you read this novel. You HAVE to read it actively, but at the same time, exterminate all rational thought. Let the book captivate you like a frantic jazz solo. It's not one of those arm chair books one sits down with and puts their brain on remote control. You can taste the violent music of Burroughs' work if you allow it. This book is nothing less than an experience.Do yourself a favor... EXPERIENCE IT."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I picked up this book because of its reputation of being an underground classic. After suffering through this horrible &quot;work&quot;, underground (DEEP UNDERGROUND) is where this tome belongs. Basically, the book is an unending montage of nonsensical images spliced in with bizarre homosexual occurances. You could literally pick out a page at random and still have an overall feel for the book. It can be simply described as a junkie with homosexual tendencies who prattles on and on, thinking he's interesting. Many have tried to have this book censored from schools, but that should never happen. Far from it. All juveniles should be FORCED to read it to see what happens when you're constantly stoned. A stronger anti-drug message could never be made. Stay away from this stupid book unless you just want to be bored senseless."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The Naked Lunch - 50th Anniversary EditionISBN: 978-0-8021-1926-1Grove Press2009Content:I will keep to the content of the book, for much criticism is available on the text.This edition presents comments by the author, divided in 4 texts in 13 pages, plus \\"Burroughs Texts Annexed by the Editors,\\" a selection of outtakes.Once I have decided the text is worth my attention, I do judge a book by the cover, therefore I feel this particular edition deserves harsh criticism, for the quality of the material used is just too poor.The 50th Anniversary Edition was a major let down for the paper is the cheapest anyone can find, already rough and dry to the touch and sure to become yellowed and brittle in no time, so this tricky US$24 hardback book in a luxurious slipcase is nothing but fool's gold."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I enjoy reading literature, and am rarely disappointed when I read a book that has been labeled a classic. \\"Naked Lunch\\" is an exception. I had to force myself to finish this book, because it just did not really hold my interest at all. Although I could appreciate the dark, twisted, imaginative imagery, there was just no real story to speak of. There were hints of satire here and there, but then the prose would just descend into an incoherent mess. I can only recommend this book as a cautionary tale about the nightmarish, horrifying, delusional state that being a heroin junkie must put you in.For a more clear and coherent surreal pornographic nightmare, I'd recommend \\"Story of the Eye\\" ..."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I'm not going to lie and say I even understood this book 90% of the time. What I'm going to say though, is that the book held my interest throughout. Burroughs use of language is enough to do that. There were numerous portions that made me laugh out loud, and equally numerous portions that made me cringe. Of course, I still didn't understand a word of it. So, in short, I'm not real sure what to make of it. My advice for anyone who is thinking about reading it is to give it a shot. If you're adventurous enough, you'll probably get something out of it, and if you hate it, you won't have to waste much time with it (I read it in about three days). It's something different, and that alone makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"NAKED LUNCH is at once a hieroglyphic message and a tract. It is also a warning, a song, and a confession of the depraved.

When someone first reads Naked Lunch, they usually begin with a clear mind but soon get caught up in Burroughs's abstract rhetoric which, may seem like gobbledygook to the average layman. Relax, Burroughs does this for many reasons, especially as an effect to create emphasis on what was previously said. Generally, these \\"cut-ups,\\" or gobbledygook, are assembled with many words already stated, but in several different arrangements. However, a lot of these cut-ups are developed extensively in other Burroughs novels (i.e. The Soft Machine), and is occasionally used in NL ---- what's used in NL is essentially a standardized Burroughs technique, very similar to the writings of Tristan Tzara and other surrealists. Although a lot of the writing was drug induced, it was not published in its original raw form ---- as some narrow minded readers would say. A lot of the book was revised and edited by people such as Allen Ginsberg (Howl) to Paul Bowles (The Sheltering Sky), who saw the book as revolutionary even in its greenly jumbled format. Several stories were extracted from this rough manuscript (entitled Word Horde) to make many of the \`Cut-up trilogies,' particularly The Ticket That Exploded, and Nova Express. Although these two novels may seem even more abstract than NL, they still sustain a general theme, which is clearly evident in The Naked Lunch. Nevertheless, Naked Lunch is the kind of book the reader has to view in its total perspective, therefore the flashy jargon and word play will be more understandable than when it was picked up. Give it a try, put it down, then step back and look at what's on the tip of your fork --- hence a naked lunch."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Stronger than a thousand 'just say no' campaigns, Burroughs wanted to show the reader what's \\"on the end of that long newspaper spoon\\" by taking his own drug addiction both concretely and as a metaphor for human existence--in a strange sense, that we're addicted to being who and what we are, and that forces in our \\"civilization\\" are living vampirically off the energy of our frozen patterns of behavior, like a power-pyramid whose apex is anywhere the Man can be found. There are those addicted to controlling their own and others' humanity, and those who let reality speak through them.The form of this book is a revolt against habit as well. \\"Naked Lunch\\" is a loose collection of writings about the yearning for freedom from embodiment. In this, it's like a contemporary work of Gnosticism. While reading it you get the sense of a tremendous self-exorcism, a huge confession from a diseased state of being. Burroughs' content will be the most repellent imagery you'll ever encounter in fiction--visceral and dehumanized sex and violence, overlapping conspiracies between transpersonal agencies who are fighting each other for continual exploitation and total control on all levels. Burroughs' truncated medical training (and his interests in anthropology and \\"primitive\\" religions) shows up almost continually, through an obsession with exotic diseases and bodily functions and in the character of Dr. Benway, a perverted scientist obsessed with mind control. On top of all this, it's written in underworld slang which is frequently hilarious and for which he provides a glossary.The \\"Deposition Concerning a Sickness\\" and \\"Atrophied Preface\\" of \\"Naked Lunch\\" are the best things Burroughs ever wrote; they are powerful indictments of the misguided policies of law-enforcement zeal for purity. Yes, Burroughs may have had a terminal case of \\"shock-the-bourgeois\\", but as Norman Mailer once said of \\"Naked Lunch\\" it was written with utter seriousness of intent. Burroughs' writings are simultaneously some of the most precise, shocking, evocative, and almost poetic prose I've ever read."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"this book is not for everybody. it is a series of visionary vignettes that have a similar theme and are placed in a somewhat haphazard order. the theme is one of addiction of all types and the visions are indescribable. some chapters are better than others. an understanding of drug lexicon is very helpful. some of the concepts are intriguing. my favorite is &quot;bureaucracy is the cancer of democracy&quot;.most readers will find parts of &quot;naked lunch&quot; tasty, parts will cause indigestion, and parts will be unchewable and indigestible. for those readers that can handle that---dig in!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked Lunch is a buffet of all our bullshit for all us cannibals. The point is that we are sick passive addicts hosting nasty viruses we tout around as virtues or human qualities. First case in point: the emperor wears no clothes--found in reviews of Joyce (both Ulysses and the Wake) and of Kafka and used as a book title and for a number of other anti-intellectual tirades. The cliche is an infectious parasitical &quot;meme&quot; (check up on meme theory--stolen from Burroughs, or contracted)that keeps people replicating past events--keeping the truly human dead. Burroughs meant to show us the repetitive ugliness of ourselves--our shit--so we would stop digging in it and putting it out as something glamorous. The book is highly theory-dominated, with metaphysics, epistemological models, ideo-political constructs. The plot is of Bill Lee's heroin addiction, withdrawl, and his on-going treatment. But the addictions are also to violence, sadomasochism, medical power, authority, revolt against these, and most everything else. The novel is all allegorical. Inter-Zone comes from the latin for the in-between. Caught between space/time and death/X, few can escape from the vicious cycle. &quot;Who scared us into time?&quot; Burroughs asks. His answer is, &quot;Words.&quot; &quot;All love all lust all hate all pain is held in words.&quot; Naked Lunch should sicken us--the same as his apo-cure, since words, consciousness, and their products are the true illness. This book is a pharmakon: poison-cure. The disease: morality, idealism, romanticism--what you will,--Burroughs pronounces our civilization one vast hypocritical cancer, a malignant tumor, proliferating through idiocy, supporting atrocity, never advancing., forever regressing. The work should be read beside Rimbaud's Illuminations--specifically, Parade, Soir Historique, Villes I &amp; II, Barbare, Aube D'Ivresse, Metropolitan, Nocturne Ordinaire,and L'Impossible from Une Saison en Enfer. The true junkie is the one unaware. Who is worse--those who think the book is too OUT THERE, or those who only see it as WAY OUT? &quot;In and out in and out in and out in and out. Over and out.&quot; &quot;The way IN is the way OUT.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book's value as a literary work has often been questioned, but even those who cannot see its value as a work of social commentary should be able to see it as stunningly horrifying for another reason- how many chances to do you get to experience a direct glimpse into a junkie's mind? after forcing myself through the first few pages in a state of deep confusion, I found myself unable to put it down- I have never read anything quite like it nor do I expect to. it's not for the weak of heart, though; it's easy to see why so many peopl e are revolted by this book, but Burroughs is a genius in his ability to manipulate words into incomprehensible patterns of incoherent ideas, and to make you question the very meaning of the words you are reading. And for those who say, &quot;what's the difficulty about NOT having any semblance of plot or character development or any other accepted element of writing&quot;, I say- try it. It's not as easy as it seems. A must-read book."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Where do I start?

Read it until you can actually recall someparts which you found particularly funny, disgusting, happy,etc. and then think about the book as a whole. Read it untilyou get the main idea. Then buy another copy and read this onefrom back to front. Repeat all steps for previous reading anddiscard both copies. Buy 3 more copies and read them simultaneously:one front-to-back, one back-to-front, and one you should readby randomly picking a page, reading a word off that page, highlighting thatword with a yellow or black marker, and continuing until every word ishighlighted thusly. If done properly, this results in either completeunderstanding of Burroughs' mind and the minds of everyone else onEarth as well as telepathic abilities--or a headache.If done improperly, it results in your catching a disease thatnot even them jungle dudes with their jungle medicine can cure.Share and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroughs scores some points for having the gumption to put something out there as unrefined and experimental as Naked Lunch-the book is the abysmal howl of the agonized junkie in the street. Unfortunately, howl that it is, it often falters and falls into the inarticulate. The reason being, what the cut-up method gains in striking imagery and jarring juxtaposition it sacrifices in meaning-it often tends toward nonsense. To see work that is stylistically as innovative, as evocative, that is far more haunting and adds up when the last page is turned, check out two underrated underground classics: Julio Cortazar's Hopscotch and Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City. Okay, Czyz's book is only two years old, it's not a classic yet, but like Hopscotch, it goes far beyond the simple stylistic power of Naked Lunch and both books mirror their lyrical prowess with structural genius (Hopscotch moreso than Adrift). These two are probably everything Burroughs wanted to accomplish, but didn't have the right drugs to pull off. As for eroticism, Czyz and Cortazar have scenes unparalleled in the raw poetry of sex (wait till you get to the scene in ancient Sodom in Adrift). Take it from a man who's spent his life underground eating from a can, these two guys blow the doors off Burroughs."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I don't want to sound stupid or something, but it took me three times to get through this book. It wasn't because I was offended or anything but because it was so weird in parts that it lost me. Determined that this book was not going to kick my butt I went back and read it, and this time finished it. And it blew my mind. There were parts of the book that I wouldn't call offensive (maybe because I'm not easily offended), but there are parts that are not for the weak of stomach...the whole affair with Slastubitch (I believe that's his name) comes to mind. Yet it's there for a purpose. Burroughs was pointing out just how ignorant and hypocritcial society of his time (and of our time too) was, and writing about Mugwumps secreting juices out of their penises was a sure fire way to do this. There are also parts of this book that I found to be downright hilarous, particularly anything involving a purple assed baboon. I've practically lent this book out to all my friends, or have convinced them to buy it. One of my professors here at RU told me that of all the beats, Burroughs was the true visionary of the bunch, and upon reading the Naked Lunch, his remark is easily justified."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I will try to present a review that is both helpful to those new to Naked Lunch as well as though familiar with the work. Before I begin to do so I would like to make a comment about the newly released version (Naked Lunch: The Restored Text ISBN: 0802116396). Although I have not had a chance to read through this edition first hand, I have been told that it leaves out essential elements included in the original. If this be the case, I would highly recommend avoiding this edition and go with an early edition of Naked Lunch. With that said let us begin....First off I will start for those of you new to William Burroughs, if you have never read anything of Burroughs before approaching this book DO NOT expect to pick up Naked Lunch and understand it. Although this is generally regarded as his greatest work, Burroughs' preceding books are fundamental to understanding much of what takes place in it. This text is important for a variety of reasons, however, if you go into it blind you will probably find it so unpalatable you may not even finish the text. It may be like nothing you've ever read before. It is dark, mordant, overtly sexual, drug infested, and extremely autobiographical (which is why the books leading up to Naked Lunch are important to understanding this work). I highly commend the list created by Steve Hancock (Map to Burrough's Interzone). This is an excellent roadmap to Burroughs. I advise any novice to begin here. If nothing else, start with Junky (ISBN: 0140043519). This is the first novel by Burroughs and will give you much insight into the man.Now for those of you that have read Naked Lunch, got it or didn't, the above advice may be helpful as well. A book I would recommend as the perfect companion to Naked Lunch is Interzone (ISBN: 0140094512). This is a collection of works between the transition of Junky to Naked Lunch (originally titled Interzone). Sections of this book are letters/notes to Allen Ginsberg and Burroughs himself. Other parts are short stories, diary entries, letters, and autobiographical sketches. I cannot say enough good things about notes in this book describing Burroughs' intentions with Naked Lunch. This would be an wonderful book to peruse for those unsure of the genius of Naked Lunch.\\"What am I trying to do with writing? This novel is about transitions, larval forms, emergent telepathic faculty, attempts to control and stifle new forms...Control, bureaucracy, regimentation, these are merely symptoms of a deeper sickness that no political or economic program can touch...The fragmentary quality of the work is inherent in the method and will resolve itself so far as necessary. That is, I include the author, Lee, in the novel, and by so doing separate myself from him so that he becomes another character, central to be sure, occupying a special position, but not myself at all...I would always be the observer and not the participant by the very act of writing about a figure who represents myself...The novel is a dead from, rigid and arbitrary. I can't use it.\\" (selections from Interzone by William S. Burroughs edited by James Grauerholz)"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"\\"Naked Lunch\\" is William S. Burrough's masterwork. Reading this is a little like reading James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" crossed with the Marquise de Sade. It has a stream of consciousness form, and often reads like a poem. Burrough's said that the purpose of it was to open up one to possibilities. In this sense it is meant to be open ended, and can be opened and begun anywhere, not unlike the music of John Cage. The book takes the reader beyond the cozy confines of one's world and throws one into the challenging, and unsettling world of a junkie. Burrough's wrote this novel during his many years on heroin and multiple other drugs. Finally in Tangiers his friends, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, helped Burrough's put his multitude of writings together into book form. Burrough's has said that this is not a novel, but a book. It is an assortment of thoughts and ideas, not a narrative story that follows a logical progression to an end.In 1959 in Paris, Olympia Press published \\"Naked Lunch\\". It would be three years later before an American edition(Grove Press) would come out in 1962. This 50th anniversary edition includes an appendix section which includes numerous letters, out takes, and alternate versions of various sections in the book, as well as an exhaustive discussion by the editors about how they compiled this particular version of the novel given that the Olympia and Grove Press editions were so different from one another, and that in 1998 the original typescripts were found in the Ohio State University which reveals fragments lost between the last typescripts and the Olympia edition. How the book came together makes for nearly as interesting a read as the book itself."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"After I closed the book, shook the bugs out of my brain, and had a pepsi and a cigarette, I was able to decide whether or not I was able to decide whether or not I liked the book...following which I was able to decide whether or not I liked the book...you get the idea. At times far too surrealist for my finite imagination, I was blown away by Burroughs' inability to sound pretensious...I suppose some might argue that there's no pretensiousness in gibberish...howevah.... Three words, people: You'll have nightmares."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Well, now that he's dead, WSB is going to be the latest craze of a genius author that you've never taken the time out to read. There will be various special displays at the book stores and libraries in his honor, just like they did for Ginsburg. A brief sentence in the news, a paragraph in the paper, maybe a short paragraph and a few links on amazon's site. Somehow there will be new readers, and some will say they liked this book because, even though they didn't get jack, they heard it was good and don't want to sound stupid. Some will say they hated it because they didn't get jack and don't want to. some will get jack, some will get more jack, but no one will get all the jack in this book. Funny, first time I read it I didn't get jack and I still loved it. It's not for everybody but everybody should read it. It's a book designed for people to hear it the way the artist wanted them to, not the way the publisher wants the editor wants the store owner wants the stockholder wants the people to hear it. Here's to a man who said it the way he wanted"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is both a test of the metal of &quot;open&quot; minds and a bath in a world that existed. A previous reviewer asked &quot;Did this happen to someone?&quot; Yes, it did. Naked Lunch is a collection of visions William S. Burroughs had in his many many years of hard core drug abuse. Reading this book has convinced more people not to do heroin than any public service announcement. I, for one, wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life suckered up to the penis of a mugwump"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Being a writer and lover of literature I really wanted to give Naked Lunch a chance. I forced myself to read it far past where I wanted to put it down. The style of writing was confusing and prohibited access to the larger meaning of the novel. I understand that many think this is a revolutionary piece of work. I gave it a two because I thought it took a chance, but I'm afraid if the reader can't stay involved than ultimately the author has failed."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I am actually in the middle of the road when it comes to liking this book. Obviously it must have hit me strong enough to write a review about it, but I can't see where it would be \\"life changing\\". I think that the over-the-top 5-star reviews are a little much, but this book does (at times) create horrific visions and shows that the book shouldn't be totally ignored. Most of the book is a chore to get through. To me, the book seems like short stories (if you can call them stories) chopped up and mixed together.It is very hard to follow a character or even know which character we are looking at. You can basically tear the pages out of the book, rearrange them in any random order, and read the re-ordered book and it wouldn't make that much difference. As A matter of fact I believe that is how the book was put together in the first place. I will remember the book by is its dark and sickening sexual images. Burroughs does a good job of making you feel very uneasy, almost sick at the images he throws at you. Once more, the book isn't that great of a casual read since it has very little character developement or plot, but the language is used very well and is an inspiration for new authors. If you want to read it but don't want to dish out the dough just borrow it from the library...it is there most of the time."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Having occasionally shared neighborhoods with junkies, I have always been amazed by how thoroughly uninteresting their lives are. This book confirms my view. It works really hard to make lives of junkies literary interesting, but fails since the material that the author works with is intrinsically dull. One cannot but help shedding a tear for all the trees that has been wasted making this all too thick book.(A disclaimer: If this book picks up in the second half I may be a bit unfair. Somehow I seriously doubt it. Particullarily because of the cutting technique that has been so much better applied elsewhere)"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Open mind or closed mind, you can't get blood from a stone. If 232+ pages of incoherant, rambling nonsense is your cup of tea, this is the book for you. If you would like to spend an afternoon confused and bored, this is the book for you. Otherwise, I don't think I'm the first to say THE EMPEROR WEARS NO CLOTHES."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Naked luch starts out as absolute gibberish, and I almost gave up reading it.

It begs to be read as an example of how you can fool people into believing you have something to say. It is just a long trip from old William, but heck, anyone can get high and write nonsense. Besides, irreverent tone (remember the accursed poets?), rupture of the traditional narrative (remember Joyce?), surrealistic experience (remember Breton himself?)... let's face it: William Burroughs was a rebel, and an elocuent icon of what contemporary ideology hates, and an incredibly strong figure at that; however, that does not make him a good writer, much less a literary vanguardist, only a critic. Naked Lunch is the living proof of the author's wit, given his ultimate status as a popular icon... evidence of how something exotic or irrational can automatically be taken as interesting or avant-grade."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Probablythemost creative book ever written up to that point.Or as creative(2)you click clickclikcprofiles theexploits ofthe exploitation ofstripping bloodlines oftransformationgood4learnin'.profiling thenaked illuminaticlicking to locate the naked illuminati(name and address)my bloodlines: kennethbruce updike, jrHesse, St Luke, Bauer/Rothschild, brainwashing minions,not willing to mainstream the one black sheepon the profile,the link to the documentation.A meal."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"In my opinion, Naked Lunch was a phenomonal book that introduced me to one of the most talented American authors. William S Burroughs brought into clear view the workings and frailties of a heroin soaked mind. In my opinion, the greatest tragedy in this book has to be the book itself. I would best describe this book as looking into a ghost. With a ghost, you see everything, but it is only a sparse outline of what was, or in this case, what could have been. Burroughs' true talents were indefinitely damaged by his addiction, as was noted by Norman Mailer in the court transcripts in the beginning of this book. As frank and explicit as this book was, it only served as a shroud to the ghost of his genius."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Some people believe that this book is nothing but some old junky rambling incoherently. I believe these people have no vision, no understanding, no comprehension of how this book works. Naked Lunch is not a plot neatly cut with stereotype characters and appeal for the lowest common denomenator. Naked Lunch is an experience; a bold, powerful, mind shattering text. A person, however, must keep an open mind. To do otherwise is to cut the circulation of thought completely. Personally I think that Naked Lunch, when properly recieved, is a literary milestone... Read it yourself and draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"You can look at all of the reviews here and see 1-5 stars. That in it self, says something very impressive to me. Good art, in my opinion, evokes strong reactions. You either love it or hate it. If you only get a half assed reaction, then you've done a half assed job. Burroughs creates something completely different and amazing here, but not everyone's going to see it. Even if you like the book, you might not see it ... I'm not sure I have. But much like the work of artists like John Cage, Picasso, and David Lynch ... there's something bigger here."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"Burroghs was a revolutionary. Burroghs though manages to stray from the standard revolutionary protype. No borrowed ideals or feelings in this book, Burroghs Naked lunch is a result of turning one persons reality into a universal reality. One mans addiction tells the story of mankind. Burroghs Naked Lunch is by no means an autobiographical account, simply what happens when authors ignore the factual and engage in the truth. This book was not written as entertainment, Burroghs makes this clear near the end of the book. Whether readers take an inclination towards this book, time will tell. Naked Lunch is a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is very obscene and that's why I love it so much! I've read it 6 times already and I enjoy it more every time.

Picked it up again last year and got exactly as far as the first time. Not that I didn't get anything out of the book or that Burroughs isn't a hoot, it's just that after a few hundred pages, you get the point and don't have to read any more.This is the beauty of the cutup technique. You can read any 150 page block in this book and get the same information as reading any other 150 page block of the book. It's like a hologram of Burroughs' head - you can reconstruct the whole from any fragment.So pick up the book, open it anywhere and start reading. When you get tired, stop, no need to go on, you will not learn any more by reading on."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"This book is absoultly one of my all time favorites.

It was neither enjoyable nor interesting. If this book had not been charged with obscenity, I doubt if it would be read by anyone at all. A Reader describes it excellently, \\"to manipulate words into incomprehensible patterns of incoherent ideas.\\" It does not describe what it is like to be alive and free thnking; the book describes (poorly) death and the enslavement of the will by addiction.

They're the ones that look like the artist just dumped a bunch of paint onto the canvas and decided to call it art. He probably took no more than 5 minutes to make one. Well, the same can be said for Naked Lunch by Burroughs. To me, it seemed he just wrote whatever came into his drug-addicted head, had Ginsberg or one of his cronies compile his scribbling into a novel-form, and decided to call it a book. What a joke. I was always told in my writing workshop classes to show--not tell. But all Burroughs does in Naked Lunch is tell. No wonder it's only 200 pages long! If he actually showed some things--it would've been twice as long and probably a lot more interesting. Naked Lunch is a perfect example of &quot;lazy&quot; writing. The Lost Generation writers (e.g. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce) started a movement like the Beats--but at least they weren't lazy. Hemingway would spend hours on just one sentence--he was that meticulous! And look at the results--Hemingway won a Pulitzer Prize (for Old Man and the Sea) and the Nobel Prize for Literature; Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is considered to be one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century; and Joyce's Ulysses is considered by many scholars to be the BEST novel of the 20th century. It's no surprise that the Beat writers never attained the same stature as the Lost Generation writers--they were lazy and not any good."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"amazingly, a junky can in fact pen a few words while high as a kite.

For a laugh, I reread Naked Lunch and my review of it. My review was laughable because of my age and conceptions of worthy literature. And Naked Lunch was just as funny because of its overwhelming and glaring badness and lack of anything redeemable. And I think you (the potential buyer) needs to also reconsider your purchase. Naked Lunch is awful: since when have the intoxicated ramblings of a junkie ever been considered literature? And the whole story of it being a social document or a personal expose is pretty shaky ground. Literature is a carefully wrought expression of desire, pain, joy, etc. As Arnold Schoenberg so eloquently said: &quot;Art is the cry of despair of those who experience in themselves the fate of all mankind.&quot; The implied statement Mr. Schoenberg would like to add for your clarification is: &quot;Art does not have room for gentlemen like Mr. Burroughs because the weight of the world is lightened when you have a needle hanging from your arm and your find your foot facsinating.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"great book, but unfortunately the binding broke as it is like 40 years old. literally."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I thought this book was an utter waste of time (and money.)"},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"The consistency of the story is kind of non-edible but the story keeps you on your heels.

I finally finished reading this beginning to end after several previous attempts - its a fairly short book and starts out well but I found a chore to read primarily because large parts of it are totally nonsensical. Maybe it did challenge the meaning of literature in the 50s like James Joyce's Ulysses did in the 20s, and maybe its value is in its perceived offensiveness, which was oh so shocking when first published. I could appreciate some of the wit, especially with regard to heroin use and in this respect it was slightly insightful, but I didn't find the gratuitous gay pornography and violence particularly shocking or interesting - in fact it bored me. Primarily because of the lack of structure (there are characters but not really a story line) but his style - perhaps because it's a much celebrated subconscious stream - doesn't seem to aid expression, it serves to confuse, and a lot of the dialogue doesn't make any sense either. Now I do like the beatnik subconscious stream style (or whatever it's called) to some extend, but often it just ends in nonsense. Maybe the value is aesthetic, in the sound of spoken word, but I am in favour of content over superficiality anyway. Kerouac on the other hand is amazing, and I'd recommend reading some of his books instead. Ginsberg's poetry has strong similarities to Burroughs style, but after all they're poems, so they're shorter and meant to read aloud, and therefore appreciation can still be found in his drug induced ramblings."},{"Title":"Naked Lunch","review":"I read \\"Naked Lunch\\" hoping for a gripping story of darkness and despair, but instead I found this book to be a little light in comparison to similar works like \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn.\\" While its content is equally disturbing, the tone is not as dark as it ought to have been to better explain the story.

It's small enough to go in a purse and it has quite enough information in it. I loved that it told you which Metro exit to get off on for each attraction. The organization was good and I had no problem finding places at all.This little gem covers the main points of each attraction, has a plethora of maps that are easy to follow, and is quite simple to just pull out and use. Of course one must mention the pictures as they enhance the experience by leaps and bounds. Bravo! I brought this guide and theThe Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C.

(Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I concur with the other reviewers that this book is definitely worth it to purchase if you plan on visiting the D.C. area. I purchased the \\"Washington D.C\\" (Eyewitness Travel Guide) because I had a strong feeling that this book would help pinpoint some of the best places to visit in the D.C. area. I have been happily living in this area since May 2010, and I was inspired to make the best out of living here when I met a loving and happy couple at a concert that I recently attended. They were helpfully giving me some ideas worth pondering for going out. The close and cheerful couple that was encouraging me helped me realize that I can easily make the most out of living here, and with my schedule I can at least visit many of the sites on weekends (I am a resourceful college student). This book contains alot of helpful information on transportation, many fun museums and other events to go to, and other accomodations that are good to know whether you are just visiting and/or you already live in the area, but you prefer to be self-reliant in discovering the exciting places to go to. The following is some of the amazing information that is contained in this book:The various museums available to visit in downtown D.C. such as the National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of American History, and the National Gallery of Art.Entertainment in Washington D.C. area such as: the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts (in Vienna, Virginia), the Shakespeare Theatre, National Symphony Orchestra, and the Library of Congress.There is information on sports and outdoor activities that are listed: The couple that I mentioned about told me about how the Verizon center has sporting events (such as the basketball games) in addition to musical concerts. The Washington D.C book on pages 204 and 205 (Eyewitness Travel Guide) also lists the RFK Stadium and the Nationals Park Stadium.For men and women just visiting there are handy guides on recommended places to stay starting on page 172-195, shopping in Washington D.C. (pages 196-199), restaurants, cafes, and bars (pages 182-195), and there is a handy metro system map and street finder index for those who plan to take public transit in the D.C. area.I admit that I have only listed a sampling of what is in this useful and informative book. If there is only one guide that you have the time to look at for the Washington D.C. area, then this is definitely the one to consider."},{"Title":"Washington D.C.

(Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"As a 10 year resident of Washington DC, I think that there are many areas that have developed recently that deserve to be mentioned here. Also, there are quite a few inaccuracies. Although crime and racial discrimination are part of the city living so is the new development of a multicultural city. For example, there is a large number of Latinas/os all over the city who have their own newspapers, radio stations, health centers, neighborhoods (despite the gentrification efforts by the new rich or yuppies), restaurantes, theaters (e.g. Teatro Gala), bars and discos, which are very good and cheap, and a large number of Latina/o intellectuals; also the Ethiopian community is quite strong here with lots of restaurants to enjoy so there is more than black and white but the whole rainbow of human beings are here and every one has some cultural influence on the city. Also, I think that far beyond the Mall there are quite a lot of interesting and beautiful sights that this guide fails to mention such as the National Shrine (Catholic cathedral) with some pretty sights around as the Franciscan Monastery with their catacombs and the new Jean Paul II museum among many other sights and places beyond the Mall such as 14 St. and U St. areas. DC is very expensive place to live in. Although it is not NYC or San Francisco, DC is not far behind in rent and housing prices so even a very tiny one bedroom apartment can reach $5,000 a month, depending on the location. DC is also a college town. Yes, a college town! Did you know that the city itself has ten major colleges such as Georgetown Univ., George Washington Univ., Catholic University, Howard University, Gallaudet University, Trinity University, American University, University of the District of Columbia, Southeastern University, and Corcoran College of Art and Design. Plus the nearby University of Maryland (one of the top ten largest campuses in the US), George Mason University, and John Hopkins University, and many local chapters of other institutions of higher education which amount to 500,000 (yes, half a million college students!). I guess this is something worth of mentioning it in a tourist guide, right? There is a new Museum too which is the Native American Museum and the Newseum is coming up by the end of 2007 and also there is an initiative to build one for Latinos. There is a lot more to see than the Mall in DC and Georgetown and that beyond is pretty as well and very multicultural. In summary, I wish that the people from this publishing company did a better job at talking to the locals and looking beyond what is classic and researched ten years ago."},{"Title":"Washington D.C.

Eyewitness Travel Guide is MISSING the first 24 pages.Can the seller please send me another copy of this book?D. Sparks"},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I am planning a trip to Washington, DC, in September 2006. In order to prepare for my trip and gain insight on the many attractions in the nation's capital, I purchased the \\"Eyewitness Travel: Washington, DC\\" guide from Amazon.com in the month prior to my trip.I was expecting to find a non-partisan, non-political guide that would not pander to any agenda or movement (we get enough of that from the liberal news media every day, and every time we go to the movie theater, as we are force-fed leftist, politically-correct propaganda spewed by the \\"cultural elite\\"). Boy, was I wrong!The first few pages deal with the history of Washington, DC, with pictures of the various protests over the years, from women's sufferage, to anti-Vietnam War rallies, and anti-Persian Gulf War demonstrations. At first this didn't concern me, until I recalled the numerous pro-life rallies that have taken place in DC, drawing tens of thousands of anti-abortion opponents on an annual basis. Or how about the many \\"support the troops\\" (pro-war) rallies that have occurred in 1991 and since the 2003 liberation of Iraq (and I am a member of the Army National Guard, by the way)? None of those pictures were shown, but then again, that wouldn't be very PC.Pertaining to security, page 212 of the guide attempted to minimize Washington, DC's notorious crime problems, stating: \\"Although as in any major city there is crime, Washington has made great efforts in reducing problems and cleaning up its streets, and with great success\\". That's news to me, because Washington, DC remains one of (if not THE) murder capitals of the nation, with crime beginning to affect some of DC's more elite neighborhoods and tourist areas. In late July 2006, news coverage spoke of increasing robberies, muggings, assaults, and rapes at or near the Mall, mainly during late evening and night hours. As for cleaning up the streets, I hope that DC has made progress since my last visit there in the summer of 2003, as the block behind the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building (10 Street NW) was riddled with homeless people and the sickening sight and smell of human waste. But then again, it would be very un-PC to focus on DC's crime and homeless problem.The kicker was when I flipped to page 203 and viewed the \\"cultural events pages\\". Mixed in with the area theaters, opera halls, ballets, clubs and bars, was a seperate section naming the location of three of DC's \\"well-known\\" gay bars. Again, political correctness is force-fed to us, as the gay agenda finds its way into a tourist guide.In all, the guide was very informative with detailed information about the many things to do in the nation's capital and surrounding area, but why was such a liberal slant allowed to ruin an otherwise very enjoyable and helpful booklet. If I had known this, I would not have purchased the \\"Eyewitness Travel\\" guide to Washington, DC."},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"The book looked ok- however I returned it because, by the time it came, I was already in Washington."},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"We try to visit DC every couple of years, and next time we were thinking of paying for one of those guided city tours. We don't need the sites pointed out to us, but those tour guides always seem to have good information and anecdotes about the sites that you don't hear anywhere else. I thought that maybe we could save a couple hundred dollars if we could find a book that has that type of information. I bought the Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C., and I also checked out the Frommer's Guide. They were very informative, but they didn't get me excited about any of the sites. They were pretty much just reference books (with very limited photos). However, when I opened up the Eyewitness Travel book, I was blown away. The color photos and color floor plans/cutaways of the buildings are outstanding. It really got me interested in places that I wouldn't have thought twice about if I had read just a text description.The book also tells about the history of certain places and tells you what to do and where to go on three guided walks. It is a gourgeous and entertaining book that doubles as a tour guide (only cheaper). To keep up with the other guides, it also includes hotel and restaurant information.I am not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about. I find it funny how some people politicize everything that they see, hear or read. I am into history, not politics, so this book was exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"The Eyewitness Guide to Washington, DC starts off with a brief introductory section that includes a history of the city, general information, as well as a summary of the major galleries, museums, and memorials. This section is almost reminiscent of a Frommer's guide as it includes a best of list and a sample itinerary, which are both staples of that guidebook franchise.Next, the book moves on to a section-by-section examination of the city. There are five geographical areas within the city as well as two more beyond that are broken down here. Each section offers a reasonable amount of information on major attractions. With the maps, photos, and 3-D style cutaway representations of some of the major buildings the Eyewitness Guide is far superior to others when it comes to giving you a sense of the physical reality of Washington. No amount of words can communicate as thoroughly what a place is like compared to these pictures. I found this invaluable in helping me decide which attractions were most important for me to visit in my limited time in the city.The book also contains a list of hotels and restaurants but this is the weakest part of the guide. There are only the most basic descriptions and information and no ratings are offered at all. Another guide such asFrommer's Washington, D.C. 2007 (Frommer's Complete)or theThe Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C. (Unofficial Guides)will be far more helpful for this aspect of planning your trip.Overall, I found this guide very useful for deciding what to do while visiting Washington, DC. It is nowhere near as helpful for choosing restaurants and hotels and I recommend buying a second guide to get more information of that kind. No one guide will have everything you need but this one will be a great start."},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"Another success for the DK Eyewitness series.

There could easily have been an extra twenty or thirty pages - or am I just being greedy?As I live in Australia, I thought Washington DC would mean the entire capital. The book mainly focuses on the areas along the Potomac, such as the Mall, Georgetown, and Foggy Bottom. Areas such as Dupont Circle and Kalorama have been relegated to the 'Further Afield' section, which I found disappointing.There's quite a good section on the White House and the beautiful buildings which surround it, but again I was left wanting more.It's still a beautiful book though, and the photographs are clear and crisp, but there just wasn't enough for this armchair traveller.

The pictures are wonderful for understanding the various areas."},{"Title":"Washington D.C. (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"My ultimate opinion on how to rate a guide book is the frequency with which I use it while traveling. I spent 6 days in DC, bought this book on my first day there, tried to use it that day and the next, and finally just gave up. While the graphics are very attractive and while the guide LOOKS very helpful, the appearance proves to be mostly superficial. It seemed like, whenever I'd consult the book with a question about a particular site, it lacked the information I needed. I found myself using it mainly for the phone numbers, which I think I easily could have obtained without paying for a whole book.A guide book should provide quick answers and clear directions and information, but I got very little from this. Instead I found myself consulting other sources. I had a map from my hotel, several National Parks brochures, and a pamphlet from the Smithsonian institute, all of which proved infinitely more useful than this book. And, as previous reviewers have pointed out, I found the restaurant section very lacking. I carried this book around with me for the duration of my stay, but whenever I reached into my bag for information I invariably grabbed something else."},{"Title":"Washington D.C.

If you have ever seen a DK book you have an idea of what to expect, lots of valuable and interesting information along with great photos and brilliant 3-D cutaway drawings of the major buildings of Washington. This book is slightly geared towards visitors from outside the US (it describes our currency, our government, our electric plugs, how to drive here, etc.) but is still invaluable for anyone who wants good information on D.C.

D., stale, blocked & fearful of the impending disaster, remembering the horrors of WWI, to meet with Freud himself in Vienna (1933, 1934). The analysis was a success--her writing again became inspired. Her Tribute to the \\"Professor\\" portion, \\"Writing on the Wall\\", written in 1944 (she says) London, is an account of their interaction. The last diary-like dream-recording portion of her time with Freud, \\"Advent,\\" was put together much later after WWII, while in Switzerland, when she reworked the earlier work & incorporated materials from her journals.She tells him how her brother borrowed a magnifying glass from their father's forbidden desk. He showed little her how it could be used to burn some paper, and how the father only mildly reprimanded him, so unlike Prometheus' Father.And of how once her brother got stubborn, and wouldn't come home with his mother who went around the corner and pretended to leave, and how little Hilda stayed with him, rather than following her mom. In analysis, she saw Freud as \\"mother,\\" not reaching the desired Oedipal stage, according to the Professor.And in a discussion on ambivalence, she slyly asks the Professor how the word \\"ambivalent\\" is pronounced, \\"ambi-valent?\\" or \\"am-bi-valent?\\". Freud, just as slyly, says he wishes someone would explain all that to him.Being a student/analysand in his very chambers was a crowning \\"achievement\\" in her life of \\"spiral-like meanderings.\\" As the poet thinks of this development she remembers The Chambered Nautilus in \\"life's unresting sea;\\" of how Freud had \\"brought me home\\" as was the weary wanderer in Poe's To Helen.In one session Freud gave H. D. some oranges from a box he had received from his son, who had brought them from the south of France. Some of the oranges still had attached branches & leaves. She thanked him, perhaps with \\"how lovely,\\" etc., but couldn't speak the singing thoughts the fruit brought back: about a song she sang in school, Kennst du das Land ...where die Gold-Orangen grow. (We find that the word paradise is derived from the Hebrew word for orange grove, pardes .) In Corfu with Bryher in1920, H. D. had three visions in her bedroom: perhaps of her brother, killed in the war, then a chalice, then a tripod of victory or \\"the tripod of classic Delphi\\", while outside their actual window were orange trees in \\"full leaf and fruit and flower.\\" She thinks of Edenic green pastures, still waters, \\"fragrance of myrtle thickets ... and the groves of flowering citrons.\\" She asks herself, \\"Kennst du das Land?\\" & replies, \\"Oh yes, Professor, I know it very well.\\"Ein sanfter Wind \\"Yes, It was dark & cold and there was the rumbling of war-chariots ... but upon the old Professor ... a soft wind blew ...\\" Die Myrte still und hoch der Lorbeer steht? Still we have \\"the myrtle of Aphrodite and the laurel of Apollo...\\" And yes, \\"the myrtle ... did not flutter a leaf, and the laurel grew very tall there.\\" Goethe's poem became rather a loom; her non-linear weaving & reweaving (like Penelope she says) became a tapestry of her concerns & Freud's responses. There is much more not touched on here.Kennst du das Haus? Und Marmorbilder stehn ...\\"You do know the house, don't you? ... It is there that we find the statues ... on the Professor's table. The statues stare and stare and seem to say, what has happened to you?\\" Mostly ancient Greek & Egyptian, Freud said that she was the first person who came to him & looked at his figurines & art collection before they looked at him!Kennst du den Berg ... Going to see Freud, \\"The Porter said, \`You know Bergasse? She \\"turned in at the\\" famous \\"entrance, Bergasse 19, Wein IX, it was.\\" ... und seinen Wolkenst? \\"Do you know the mountain and the cloud-bridge?\\" \\"There is plenty of psychoanalytic building and constructing in this bridge. A suitable \\"translation of the Professor and our work together.\\"As the person's soul asks or implores, H. D. circles back through her thoughts & Goethe's poem, a lyrical round, picking up new comparisons, new energy, new import. She slowly & gently impresses us with her account. We go with her, with Goethe's soul, with Freud: o mein Geliebter,... o mein Besch&uuml;tzer Oh my beloved ... \\"I want to go with you there, O my Guardian, O my Protector.\\"Of Freudyou sang enjoyed.We hear your song,loving, warm, not sang-froid.Oh H.D.!Poet, vestal, womanly,forget you not shall we!And we are reminded of these lines from one of her early poems, & her a Graecophile:What are the islands to me,what is Greece ...What are the islands to meif you are lost ... ?(rev. 9.28.09)"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden Riches, set in modern-day Philadelphia, brings together Jed Skimmerhorn, a discontented police captain and Dora Conway, an antiques dealer. Captain Skimmerhorn is the new tenant in the apartment located above Dora's antique shop and across from her own living quarters. No doubt that their feeling definite attraction toward each other, Skimmerhorn fights against his feelings for Dora and the loving, overwhelming Conway family. Forces change however when he is pulled in by Dora, who unwittingly stumbles into the evil world of art and antique smuggling valuable and finds her very existence threatened. Hidden Riches is quite a suspenseful story with a love story happening along the way. Skimmerhorn, a strong, brooding man has that some demons from his past to conquer. Dora is a strong character-a woman who is independent, intelligent, beautiful, and determined. Drawn together by forces greater than themselves, they are forced to face his past and the future neither had planned for. This book is one of my favorite that Ms. Roberts' has written - strong characters, excellent setting. One of Nora Roberts' greatest stories!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"First, let me say that I am a HUGE Nora Roberts fan! I have read nearly ever book she's written, including the chilling series penned as J.D. Robb. I have been reading her books for years, and she rarely lets me down. This is one of her earlier novels.HIDDEN RICHES is a story about Dora Conroy, a feisty, beautiful woman who owns an antiques store in Philadelphia. Dora's store is broken into after she makes the winning bid on a painting at auction, which is really a priceless masterpiece disguised. Once the painting's real owner realizes a mistake has been made and someone else has his precious painting, it becomes the focus of much criminal attention, placing Dora in danger.Jed Skimmerhorn is Dora's love interest in the novel. He is handsome, rich, socially prominent...except he is also miserably unhappy after the death of his sister, which he feels responsible for. He has gone into early retirement from the police force and is renting a room from Dora when she becomes a target for the criminals. The novel details their growing romance, Jed's internal battles as he tries to come to grips with his sister's death, and of course the battle between Jed and Dora vs. the criminals!HIDDEN RICHES, in traditional Nora Roberts style, features great writing and witty dialogue that flows and feels natural for the two characters. As a few other reviewers have noticed, Jed's character was a little dark at times, in part because of the shadow of grief and guilt that seemed to hang over him. Dora was very light-hearted and quirky. Her family was especially loveable, as Jed soon found out--a troupe of actors with larger-than-life personas and huge hearts!While I did enjoy the novel, I had to take off a few points because of the suspense-romance aspect. Romantic suspense is one of my favorite genres...it's usually a lot of fun, because you have two great characters who fall in love while trying to solve some kind of mystery together. However, the thing I didn't like about HIDDEN RICHES was that there really was no suspense. From the get-go, readers know who the bag guy is, and personally, I enjoy trying to figure out who the bad guy is! The only thing that built up as far as the suspense part of the novel goes is the ultimate confrontation between Jed & Dora and the villain.Of course, Nora Roberts is a force to be reckoned with, and she has a very devoted following of fans. Her clever writing and strongly-drawn characters make her a favorite of mine. Anyone who has read the earlier romantic suspense novels Roberts is so popular for will have to add this book to their collection. I also recommend TRUE BETRAYALS and SWEET REVENGE."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"\\"Hidden Riches\\" by Nora Roberts is a fresh, intriguing and exciting tale. The characters will grab your attention and make you care about them right from the start, as Roberts once again proves why she is the queen of romantic suspense.Antique dealer Dora Conroy buys a lot of items, including an abstract painting and some porcelain figures, at an auction in Virginia. Unfortunately, Dora's new acquisitions actually belong to a cold-blooded criminal who will stop at nothing to get them back.Dora's new tenant, Jed Skimmerhorn, a prematurely retired police captain, is dealing with the guilt of his sister's death and doesn't need a woman like Dora complicating his life. However, Jed and Dora are undeniably drawn to each other, and their tentative friendship blooms into a lovely romance.A break-in at Dora's shop starts Dora and Jed on a trail that leads to the truth about Dora's auction items, and on a collision course with the intended recipient of her items, an obsessed and unbalanced killer.Dora is in extreme danger, but Jed is determined to protect her and get to the bottom of the mystery. Roberts skilfully builds the suspense and excitement in this novel, leading up to Jed and Dora's inevitable confrontation with the culprit.\\"Hidden Riches\\" kept me enthralled from start to finish. Roberts' interesting and vivid characters compelled me to read their story, and the plot itself was original and lots of fun.

THIS IS NORA ROBERTS BEST BOOK EVER!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I hate to give negative reviews, especially in a forum of all positive reviews, (this usually means I will be negged with 'unhelpful votes') But here is the deal... I didn't like Hidden Riches! Mostly, because I HATED the hero, and the writing was dated. I don't know of any modern women who would or should put up with the treatment that Jedidah Skimmerhorn (terrible name) treats her.Here's the story: Jedidiah Skimmerhorn, millionaire cop (must all Nora's heros be millionaires?!) whose parents didn't love him enough, tries to rediscover himself and to escape a past tragedy by renting a quiet room in a modest downtown apartment owned by our heroine, miss sunshine Dora Conroy. So far so good. Unfortunately, during his first meeting with the heroine, he slams his door in her face. I know Nora intended for us to find the hero's rude growls, irritable snapping, 'charming' 'exciting' and 'attractive,' instead Jedidiah comes off as a spoiled baby, who needs his diaper changed.The villain is a cardboard cookie Nora villain, on the insane side, who is an avid collector. When a shipment goes awry and is accidentally shipped to Conroy's shop, instead of his penthouse apartment, he sends one of his flunkies to investigate..I really wanted to like Hidden Riches, but I just couldn't get past the Skimmerhorn character. I don't find abusive men attractive, and Skimmerhorn was abusive enough in once scene to leave bruises on Conroy's arms and throw her up against the wall, ripping her bathrobe. If I were the heroine I'd sue Skimmerhorn for assault, but of course, Conroy being the gullible loving heroine forgives him.... Yuck...... Nexxxtttt......"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden Riches, whose setting is in the city of brotherly love, brings together Jed Skimmerhorn, a dislusioned police captain, and Dora Conway, an antique dealer.Jed, who is from a disfunctional rich family, has had it with life. He abandons the life style that has brought him nothing but heartache to move into a sparse apartment owed by Dora Conway.Though Jed fights against the physcial and mental pull toward Dora and the loving, overwhelming Conway family, he is pulled to them when Dora unwittingly stumbles into the evil world of smuggling valuable antiquties, and is noe threatening her very exsistance.Hidden Riches is a story that will draw you into the characters lifes. The hero is a strong, brooding charcter that has the good sense to admire and be drawn to a heroine who is also a strong witty character. They never let you down by acting wimpy or stupid even when danger is near and the heroine will try to get herself out of danger rather than wimp out,Bravo Nora Roberts, another excellent novel."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts books. I absolutely loved the character of Jed, and Dora is one of the best female protagonists Nora Roberts has written. She doesn't come across as needy, weak, or remotely unsympathetic -- she's strong and independent and still a lot of fun. There was no real &quot;mystery&quot; in this book -- you knew who was trying to steal and why -- but that's okay. I was so wrapped up in Jed and Dora's story that it didn't really matter what happened with the &quot;hidden riches&quot;."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Of all of Nora Roberts' books--and yes, I've read them all--this is my favorite. It is undoubtedly her funniest. I first read it six years ago. I loaned it to a friend who forgot to return it, so I had to buy it again. I'm on my fourth copy now, I've read it probably ten times, but I keep on loaning it out and reordering and re-reading.The characters are lovingly developed, and the dialogue quick and genuine.Dora, our heroine, is a gutsy gal who takes no gruff off anyone, especially her new tenant, ex-cop Jeb Skimmerhorn. They're a recipe for great romantic sparks and hot sexual tension.This is truly Nora at her very finest. I wish she'd write another just like it. Or almost like it!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I picked this book up while on vacation a few years ago. I had never heard of Nora Roberts and was not a romance fan. This story introduced me to Roberts and romance.The plot revolves around Dora Conroy, a quirky proprietor of a small antique shop, who inadvertently interferes with the illegal shipment of some smuggled artwork and becomes the target of a ruthless and deadly businessman. Her new tenant Jed Skimmerhorn, an ex detective with the Philadelphia PD, is reluctantly attracted to Dora and feels obligated to protect her when the bad guys break into her apartment and threaten her. Add Dora's spirited family of actors and their bizarre show biz friends into the mix and you have the recipe for fun.The story is at times humorous, often suspenseful, very romantic and always a great read. You won't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Nora Roberts is always a go to author who guarantees an entertaining read. I liked the story line and the characters were not bigger than life but flawed and interesting."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"What can I say, it's a Nora Roberts early book but every bit as good as any other. I thorougly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden Riches is my #1 favorite Nora Roberts non-series novel. All of Nora's characters in all her books jump off the page but the heroine's family in this story are so identifiable with people we really know ..... and the mystery aspect takes the hero and heroine from coast to coast with just enough suspense to keep you turning the pages --- and the antics of the heroine's family makes you chuckle ..... next to the McGregor series (the best books ever!!!) Hidden Riches is always my number one recommendation!!!!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"To Amazon, I was interest in the suspence of this adventure.Sometime when you read a book you think could this really happen!Dora and Jed were ment to be together. Everyone will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This book was awesome, just as Nora Roberts' books are. The plot is excellent and the romance is great. I loved it. As usual, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"another good book from Nora. Although I perfer the books in sequence to know more about the characters withing the series, this is still one of the better books from Nora."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Ms. Roberts takes the reader into the world of collectibles and junk trinkets. To spice it up the bad guy is a ruthless collector who will stop at nothing to add to the art he has amassed by any means.As with most of Ms. Roberts's works, the characters are strong and likeable. Except for the protagonist, of course. You just have to dislike him. The suspense builds nicely, along with the romance.This is a book worth adding to your collection."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This is one of Roberts' better books, with an uncomplicated, likeable heroine, a surly, tortured hero and an assortment of charming or frightening secondary characters. The plot is simple and there is no doubt about the identity of the villain. There are two reasons why I didn't give this book 5 stars. First, the hero and heroine smoke, which may not have been a big deal in the 1990s when this was written, but by today's standards it's a jarring note. Second, the heroine's charming father drinks. A lot. And everyone dismisses it as a little quirk that does no harm. Again, by today's standards, this is something that is unacceptable."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Nora Roberts never fails to give us a great story and this is one really good one. Nothing like an evening with a good book. I highly recommend Hidden Riches."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This was one of Nora Roberts' good mystery-romance novels. I liked the characters and the plot. But, as usual with her books, she ends them abruptly"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"i liked this book. as always, the relationship between dora and jed is perfect (from bitter to insulting to love) and the family of dora is a strong one (seems like im talking about most of nora roberts characters huh??) and the evil bad guy is always full of greed and ....well....evilness!!! ::smile."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"In typical Nora Roberts fashion- this mystery is interesting and exciting and the romance is hot.I Loved this book. The relationship as it grows between Dora and Jed is fun to read about. The mystery kept me interested and added some spark to this book.It is obvious that Nora Roberts did a lot of research when writing this book. I appreciate that as it shows through in her writing and makes the book that much more realistic.Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This book was interesting from page one and remained interesting until the end.

After reading all of Nora I can find, this one still remains &quot;Top&quot; on my list! The characters are a riot, such chemistry!!! I would love to see a #2 Book for a continuation of where we leave off! NORA'S A &quot;MASTER&quot; OF GREAT WORKS...WEAVING LOVE, LAUGHTER, LUST, AND LOST OF TWISTING SUSPENSE!!! Her way of writing is not designed as &quot;chick books&quot; so check her out &quot;guys&quot;! READ &amp; ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Roberts throws her main character, Dora Conroy, into a suspense filled adventure when Dora buys a few antique pieces at an auction for her store. All too soon people connected with the purchase start showing up murdered. Her young viral renter, Jed, in the apartment across from her and above her store is a retired policeman. Threats are made and Jed goes instinctually into action.The thriller develops with a kaleidoscope of interesting characters. All the while the romance simmers. Roberts certainly brings out what oppressed collectors will do when they can't get the objects that they want. They will get it at any costs even murder."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Wonderful characters, interesting story line. As usual Nora Roberts delivered again. I always enjoy how Ms. Roberts develops her characters. Great fun."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"It was an interesting read, but it didn't rate a 5 Star from me, because there were too many bodies.

I must say that i thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I laughed out loud so many times reading the book. Nora's very good with sneaking small funny details in her books that catch you off guard. &quot;My dear Izzy, the deed is done!&quot; :P I think this book mixes the right amount of suspense and romance, and humour, which makes it a very engaging read. Yay to you, Nora!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I have only read a few of Nora Roberts's books and have never been a great fan until now. This book has what a romantic suspense book should have, a great balance of both. Most books lack in one or the other. What I also liked is that the suspense take hold of you early on and stays until end and the characters are well developed. I hope to find more like this."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden riches is the only book i've read for Nora Roberts..actually it seemed boring at the early chapters, Roberts gave boring details of everything in the scene, but i have to admit that as soon as the action starts, the novel changes completely, i couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I am absolutely amazed no one has reviewed this book. It is excellent. I am not going to give a synopsis becuase you guys can read the editorials above.

So I turned to older stories that Nora wrote. I liked this one. It's good."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Actually, I would give this book 4-1/2 stars. Being a Nora-addict, I spend most of my reading time enjoying her many novels. This story brought me back to the Dream Trilogy where the girls opened the shop \\"Pretenses.\\" Isadora Conroy is a young lady from a family of actors who decides that while acting is in her blood and enjoyable, she much rather run her antique shop. She and her sister partake on an buying trip, puchasing, unbeknownst to them, items that are a cover-up to several extremely valuable and very expensive original antiques, including an original Monet painting. Enter Jeddiah Skimmerhorn, rich, good looking and an ex-captain of the police force who is trying to sort out his own tragic loss of his sister while on the job; this event being the cause of his resignation from the force. Jed decides to leave the mansion he was raised in and go to a no-frills, comfortable apartment way of life where he plans on being able to live the life of a hermit. Dora, happy with life and very much the extravert, happens to be the landlord of the apartment he rents and this is where our story takes off. The characters are very entertaining and the story never lets your down. Dora's family, mom, dad, sister and kids are a very enjoyable and entertaining group. There is comedy, romance, intrigue and espionage. \\"Hidden Riches\\" is certainly a story worthy of reading."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I enjoyed this book. I enjoy romance books, but I cant stand to have them cheesy. I like a little romantic suspense, i don't like having everything a girl wants to read about being in one book all together and having it all predictable. If that makes any sense... But this book didn't have that as much, so I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Dora and Jeds \\"words\\" between them. Sarcastic smart-assy remarks, I really enjoyed. They made me laugh and think how real life they could be."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"HIDDEN RICHES is a tale about an antique dealer (Dora Conroy) who buys some items for her shop at an auction and becomes the target of an international criminal. Enter Jed Skimmerhorn (where did she get that name?) who is an ex-cop and new neighbor of Dora's. His attraction to her causes him to jump back into the crime game to protect Dora at all costs. They have to figure out why she is the target and they find out that treasures can be hidden almost anywhere. Of course they have to battle a mutual attraction along the way!Ok, this theme has been done over and over again, but not was well as Nora Roberts does it! Once again she adds romance and mystery together for her own special blend of wonderful reading. She does it so well, that I've forgotten if she writes a better romance novel or mystery. She always has strong characters and interesting locations. She doesn't buy into the one weak and one strong character issue, but instead combines passion, strong wills, intelligence, etc. This is a much more realistic view of people in today's world.I've read most of her books, and with the exception of a few Silhouette Romance novels in the beginning of her career, I haven't found any that I didn't like. I've especially enjoyed her latest (actually those from the last 5 or so years!) which combine the genres and create a fictional account that is her own extraordinary writing style and has something for every type of reader!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"The novel starts off with Jed Skimmerhorn, and ex-police officer. He moves into an apartment just above Dora's Parlor. Dora Conroy is an ex-actor who opened her own business selling antiques and collectibles. She is Jed's new landlord.At an auction, Dora wins a few boxes of artwork and various trinkets, not knowing that they will get her into a lot of trouble with some smugglers and bring her closer to Jed.This is an incredible romantic thriller. It was the first Nora Roberts novel I have ever read, and it inspired me to read many others."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"&quot;Hidden Riches&quot; was my introduction to Nora Roberts, and it hooked me from page one. Just the right mix of suspense and romance. The romantic tension of the two main characters will often cause you to smile, because you just know that these two were meant for each other, stubborn as they are. I can distinctly remember sitting in my living room as I started this book, how it was cloudy outside and I had the heater on and a glass of lemonade on the table next to me. Definitely says something for the author that I can remember so much of the setting when I started this book! One thing I can say for Nora Roberts is she's inspiring! Every book introduces an occupation or place which makes me want to do that or go there. Antiques dealing (Hidden Riches), glass blowing (Born in Fire), Ireland (many, many of her books take place there). Nora Roberts writes high quality romances, many with a touch of suspense which helps give conflict and interest. Try &quot;Hidden Riches&quot; I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"If you like Nora Roberts, this is Nora at her best. If you've never read her books, please do -- you won't be disappointed! In &quot;Hidden Riches&quot;, Dora is a delightful character with the kind of quirky family we all wanted as kids! Jed is a gorgeous cop who is trying to reevaluate his life. Put them together, with a &quot;love to hate'em&quot; bad guy, and you've got a book that you won't want to put down. I've read this book several times over the years, and still love it."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"What a wonderful story. Jed an inactive cop (his resignation was not accepted but was put on leave) moves into the apartment building that Dora Conroy owns to get away from the house he grew up in with bad memories. Dora an antique collector owns her own little store downstairs. She finds Jed very attractive and while he is also attracted to her, he tries to stay away from her because he has no desire to be involved with anyone. He feels too much guilt over things that happened while he was an active Captain. She is more of the aggressor but not in a pushy way. She sees he's a man with much hurts to overcome and she knows she's the one to help him through. The dialogue between these two is incredibly funny at times. She purchases two items from an auction and the problems begin. The shipment sent to this auctioneer was sent in error. This shipment should have gone to a very wealthy and very crooked man who will stop at absolutely nothing to get his merchandise back. He too is a collector of the fine arts and antiques but he smuggles to get them. Trying to get the items back after they are sold at the auction is what the story is about. A great read from beginning to end. The ending was better than I could have imagined."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"An OUTSTANDING read - I only wish Nora Roberts would make a series of books based on Dora and Jed. Dora's colorful, warm family getting mixed up in &quot;intrigue&quot; and dragging Dora into it, Dora helping Jed out on a case or two with her unique talents and knowledge - I can see many wonderful mysteries and adventures in their lives that I'd love to read about. This book was just too wonderful, the charicters too rich and warm, it leaves the reader wanting MORE."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden Riches,I got this book Nov,2009 /audio book, audio cd/Unabridged versionand have Read (Listened to it a couple of times) Since I received it, Enjoyed it Very Much!* Antiques dealer Dora Conroy's hidden riches start with the painting she bids for at a local auction, unaware of the treasure it conceals.

The love between Dora and Jed, family ties and value of friendship are so well understood and explained by Nora Roberts.

A must read for anyone who loves LOVE....."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This is my all time favorite Nora Roberts book!

This is my 9th book and it's amazing that all her books are so entertaining.

Unromantic but he sure knows how to win a lady's heart. This is a must buy book."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Nora Roberts has again done what so many other authors strive for - she creates real, credible characters with honest emotions. Dora Conroy is a little bit of every woman - strong, smart and human enough to be afraid of getting hurt.

Fast, witty dialogue, a fascinating plot, deeply interesting seconday characters and two protagonists that make me laugh out loud and feel real empathy for their all too human foibles.I may be in love with Jed Skimmerhorn for the rest of my life. I don't think anyone writes a male character for women better than Nora. They are all flawed and vulnerable, but you don't feel like mugging their therapist. They are annoying, infuriating, by turns selfish and self serving, but also sexy, warm, smart and gloriously interesting!!! Her female characters all make me want to have drinks with them. My highest compliment"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"One reviewer felt the male lead was abusive. I completely disagree. He's a guy with issues. A guy who's essentially scared to get close. Your basic wonderful, stupid man. LOL. Anyway, he feels he stepped over the line and has resigned his position as chief of Police.

But Nora sort of let me down on this one. And there are enough reviews about this book that I don't need to go into more plot description. Let me just say the first two chapters were a total bore to me because I don't need all the fancy description of antiques and paintings and jewelry. Actually, I could care less. So I felt a lot of the pages were filled with words that could have been left out, allowing the reader to get to the heart of the story. And if that had been the case, then I think this would have been a wonderful story. HOWEVER, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Roberts created a certain style of writing from the very beginning that set her apart from the rest as a great romance writer. And to those who've read enough of her earlier romance novels, then they know exactly what I'm talking about. This book didn't come across with that great Nora Roberts style of writing to me. Guess every book with this author's name on it can't be a 5-star, but she's still doing great."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"I just finished reading this, and I've read about 50 of her books, and this is one of my favorites. Dora, the main character is amazing, and never quits trying to defeat the villian, even when she's not sure who it is. There is a wonderful cast of characters, and you fall in love with all of them. And you are truly upset, when they are upset, and happy when they are happy. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This is one of her best books I have read. I absolutley loved all her characters in the book. The storyline between Dora and Jed was fantastic. You could just sense Jed's pain when remembering his family and the discomfort of now knowing how to deal with Dora's family when first introduced to them (which by the way added a cute storyline on the side). I recommend this book to other readers."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"NORA ROBERTS HAS GOT A BEST SELLER WITH THIS ONE FOR SURE!

I admit that the Sister's trilogy (which I would love to see expanded) was the very best, but this was excellent.I DO wish, having creatively used the word \\"fisted\\" which was initially interesting in context, that Ms. Roberts would lose that word for a while as it has begun to be an unexpected annoyance given the frequency it is now used.Otherwise, I can't think of literature to which I would rather escape in this genre."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"Hidden Riches is one of my favorite books, if I'm in the mood for a saucy romantic mystery this is the one I pull off the shelf.The growing romance between Dora Conrad and her anti-social tenant, former police lieutenant Jed Skimmerhorn is flirty, sexy and sweet.The mystery surrounding a purchase from an estate sale and menacing break ins of Dora's antique shop draw them closer and closer together despite themselves. The resolution of the mystery and romance are both satisfying.Nora Roberts' quirky, eccentric and endearing characters pull me into Dora and Jed's adventure every time. Closing the book is bittersweet."},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This is an earlier book by Herself that I had not previously read. Not sure how I managed to miss it, but it is well worth going back to find and read. The characters are well enough drawn and with enough complexity and humor that the book came close to her current work for a satisfaction factor. Not quite up to her J.D. Robb incarnation, but getting there!"},{"Title":"Hidden Riches","review":"This was the first time I had read Nora Roberts and I really liked her writing style. It was a fast read and every time I put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. The heroine had a great personality and there were touches of humor that made the characters endearing. I can't believe I've never read any of her books before, especially since there are so many of them. I can't wait to get my hands on as many as I can. I guess there's a reason why she is so popular and has been able to publish so many books...duh. Give her a try, I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"A Case of Hillary's Cat (Hillary King Mysteries)","review":"A very entertaining mystery that is hard to put down.

I strongly encourage the readers of the negative reviews to take them with a grain of salt. We are Bible believing Christians and found the info in this book biblically accurate. Look up the verses....they are there. If you don't like the way they apply the verses then just let it go. Pray on what you have read. The Lord has given us the ability to interpret scripture so do it. Most of what they say is very true and encouraging. We joyfully became pregnant with our fifth child after reading this and prayerful consideration. No book is 100% accurate 100% of the time for 100% of all people. Take what you want from this and leave what you don't. I didn't agree with everything they say but it helped me to step away from the world's view of children and to see God's view. Children truly are a blessing, not because I say it or the Hess' say it but because God does. I am very thankful for the way the Hess' shared what they have lived."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book is one of the ones that changed our family. We opted for surgical sterilization never thinking for a minute that interfering with God's plan for our family was sinful! We had four and by the world's standards that is a lot! Mr. Hess pointed out scripture that I never applied to that decision. How useful it was!! This book alone will not convict you, that is strictly up to God, a doubter cannot be convinced...but study it with your bible in hand and just see your convictions change. It is truly a worldly view that children are a burden, God says they are his blessing! Thank you God for using Mr. Hess!! Expecting #6!! 1 Timothy 4:4-For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book challenges the very heart of parenting. It forces you to either see children as blessings and gifts from God or as necessary burdens we must bear in this life to somehow prolong our names. After reading this book, my husband and I not only had a different outlook toward our own children (and as to how many we have), but it also gave us a new outlook on children in general. I think all Christian couples should read this book to help balance the perspective of childbearing we have received in a world that tries to pawn our children off to others as their responsibility."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book gave me a whole new perspective on family size. We have been conditioned to believe that a small family is normal, yet it is so contrary to God's word. This book gives you bible scripture to study and also challenges our own personal view of a very anti-children society. It tested my own view point and after I read this book it made me realize how much my thinking was wrong. I recommend that you buy a copy for yourself and at least one other for someone else that is suffering from infertility. I believe this could help give them hope. It's a book that must be shared with someone else."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"In a world of &quot;Me&quot; attitudes, A Full Quiver was an inspiring look into the ways of God.

This book shouldn't be passed up."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This was one of the most challenging books I have ever encountered. I read it as a new wife and was suprised but refreshed by the notion of trusting God with the size of one's family. Not using birth control was something I had formerly considered a poor use of judgement. My heart and opinions have been profoundly changed since reading this book three years ago. We now have two beautiful children and I'm so thankful and blessed I opened my eyes to what a blessing children are (and what a burden they are NOT!) :)"},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This is a wonderful book that examines many controversial issues in regards to family planning. It addresses them all from a strong Biblical perspective. As a physician I agree 100% with the Hess' position."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"An entertaining read, I found this book light hearted and funny... an interesting path to take considering the controversial subject! Obviously, Christians are on both sides of this issue. The Hess family does an excellent job of accurately handling scripture and sharing their own family experiences.The highlight of the book is the \\"20 questions\\" section. The author has anticipated every argument against his position, from \\"We should have the number of children we can afford\\" to \\"Everyone else is using birth control, even in my church.\\" Well handled with scripture and a sweet sense of humor, the hardest logical conclusions are handled with grace and a sweetness that the Christian reader will recognize as the working of the Holy Spirit.The negative reviews of this book are a little comical... in their accusation of \\"legalism\\", they are actually confirming the author's position. This book takes the position that there are things in scripture that are commands... the Christian walk is not merely a delightful stroll through a gentle path where we should always choose the direction that appeals most to us. Rather, through all history, God has called every believer to difficult decisions and the true examination of His word and His will.The Hess family has done a brilliant job with a difficult subject. Their handling of God's Word is to be commended for its careful attention to accuracy, and their warm and friendly delivery makes you feel like you are sharing a conversation with a close friend. A gentle, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"I found Rick Hess's \\"humor\\" to be a bit hostile and sexist in places (such as on page 88 when he implies men would rather kill themselves than let their wives manage their homes.) It distracted from what is a serious subject.The probability chapter struck me as being quite irrational. Mr. Hess's states that there is no such thing as probability, that we are denying God's sovereignty, when we believe that 2 parents with blue-eyes are very likely to have blue-eyed children. What I think Mr. Hess is denying is the clear evidence that God *usually* acts within the physical laws he creates. Yes, he can override genetics and give a child any color of eyes he wishes--but under ordinary circumstances, we can safely count on God to follow the laws of genetics. Following Mr. Hess's statement that there are no laws of genetics, one could state that with each pregnancy they would have no idea if they would give birth to a human, a cat, or who knows what. How ridiculous! I'm not even sure how he thought this anti-probability chapter contributed to the central thesis of quiverfullness. If anything, it seems to take away from his argument, since if God is soveign and totally unpredicatable, then we have no reason to think that birth control would ever work anyway, so what would it matter if we use it?While the book makes an excellent case that children are a blessing and that Christians should desire to be blessed with children, it doesn't make a Biblical case that the use of non-abortifacient birth control is \\"sin\\". I think many Christians would like the issue to be cut and dried, but the truth is, God does give us choices in life. Many times there are equally valid choices. Sometimes one choice is \\"better\\" than another choice, but that doesn't make the lesser choice \\"sin\\".Still, many informative & interesting points are brought up in the book. It is a quick read, and probably worth the read for someone seriously investigating this subject. In my opinion a much better read on this subject is \\"Birthing God's Mighty Warriors\\" by Rachel Scott."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book has a trap title. I began reading this thinking that I would re-inforce my belief that my \\"Quiver\\" was indeed full.

If you are considering what the Lord intends for your family, this is a must read. Some of the statistics are old, but the scripture and meaning is unsurpased!"},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book is direct insight to the plan and design the Bible has created family planning to be. This book is written(mostly) by a man, so it has more male language then female language but it is still correct. However, when reading this book, directly afterwards, I read Nancy Campbell's, \\"Be Fruitful and Multiply\\". I believe both books should be read together."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"My husbands cousin gave this book to my husband and I as a wedding present. I kindly thanked her for it and laughed as I stuck in on a shelf to be read when I felt like even considering having kids. A year and a half later I saw it on the shelf and decided to check it out. A few hours later I had read/skimmed the entire book. It was one of the better arguments I have read regarding having as many kids as the Lord provides. I'm not entirely sold on the idea yet, but it's a worthwhile read if you are determined to live by the Bible when it comes to your family planning. I recommend it."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"I was recommended this book by my sister who is whole-heartedly devoted to the concepts in this book. She's a home-school mother of 5 (and possibly more in the future). I value her opinion greatly so I read this book.I think Rick and Jan Hess do a wonderful job in portraying how the family is seen in modern times. Many people see kids as a hindrance to their personal freedom. It was refreshing to read the biblical support for how valuable children are and how blessed a couple can be with them.Nonetheless, I felt like there was something missing... I use birth control pills and I felt like the Hesses were saying that that means that I don't have faith and trust in the Lord to bring me my God-chosen sized family at the right time. I don't think I agree that my trust is lacking. I believe that biologically, having sex lends to making a baby. I do believe that God can choose to intervene whenever he sees fit.The bible talks a lot about the blessing of children in the Old Testament (be fruitful and multiply). But isn't the new covenant that Christ commanded to go make disciples of all men? Most of the authors of the New Testament were single and their mission was to go out to the nations. Should that be a testament to us to look beyond our own household?My husband and I hope to have children someday soon. I think the Hesses make a good point, but I don't think it is as black and white as they stated in their book."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"Like everything else in your life, let the Holy Spirit guide you to find out what's God's will for your family and the purpose for your life. The follower's of Jesus did not all have a quiver full, but their lives still had a great purpose for God! Depends on God's plan for your individual life.sex=babies...it would be selfish of me to not use birth control and God-given common sense for basing how many kids the Holy Spirit has impressed upon me to consider having. If left to God's laws of nature and not His Holy Spirit, I would have more than He's purposed me to have, by the laws of nature He's put into place. He is in control of my heart's desires too and Lord of them...I can trust in His still small voice for His wisdom in this matter, too. (For example, gravity is also a law of nature, and yet we are expected to work with it too using our God-given common sense!)"},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book is yet another entry in the genre of anti-contraception books being written for evangelical Christians by the Religious Right. The arguments against birth control are based on a select few verses which are taken out of their historical context and turned into commands for all people at all times. For example, God tells Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply so the human race can get started - according to the anti-contraception crowd, this verse means all of us should have as many kids as possible. This is obviously false, since the greatest Biblical heroes (Christ, Paul) were celibate men, and Jesus extolled a devoted life of celibacy over family life. But, as always, the Religious Right has little use of the New Testament.I have been to India, and I can say without any doubt that over-population is real, and the cause of great suffering and misery. I also live on the east coast in the U.S., where urban sprawl is so dense that uninterrupted concrete and asphalt can be seen from space stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C. Houses virtually anywhere on the east coast cost more than $300,000 - even with the recent housing slump - and condos are the most many people can afford. Books like this rely on junk science (like global warming denial, and the thoroughly-debunked \\"cornucopian\\" theories of Julian Simon and his ilk, who say that natural resources will never run out), and there are two sinister agendas that these authors will rarely if ever admit to: 1) that evangelical Christians need to make more babies on the presumption that their kids will become evangelical Christians, so we can outbreed the \\"unsaved\\" and win the \\"culture war,\\" and 2) that over-populating the country will result in many people being in poverty, which will make many people desperate for any job they can get and give the wealthy even more power to prevent \\"socialism,\\" as they call public health and welfare policies, from creeping into the government. A video available on the Internet shows a speaker at the 2007 College Republicans convention, hosted by one of Sun Myung Moon's institutions, making this exact point.Both of these points are false. Evangelical Christians do not need to worry about being outbred by Catholics, Muslims, and \\"unsaved.\\" Nor can they assume that their children will grow up and embrace evangelical Christianity. Christians are called to witness to people, not try to \\"outbreed\\" them in the deluded belief that Christianity is somehow genetic. Too many unsaved people per capita? Then get out the tracts and start saving souls - forget about impregnating the wife! Furthermore, the idea that we should drive the U.S. further into poverty, giving the rich even more power thanks to the vast misery and suffering of hordes of unemployed people, is just insane. Even in the Old Testament, God sometimes told people not to have children because of the misery and suffering that was coming upon the next generation (for example, the prophet Jeremiah).Each family must make up its own mind about how many children to have and what if any measures should be taken to manage contraception. I have no problems with people choosing any course of action for themselves. But don't trick yourself into thinking that God has given us a one-size fits-all standard on this issue. He hasn't. Don't misrepresent God."},{"Title":"A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ","review":"This book, whilst sincere and helpful in small parts, is sincerely misguided.

The world needs less children not more.God gave you a brain, a sense of self-restraint, and hopefully, common sense. Pumping out kids simply because your biology allows it is both irresponsible and in this age, arguably unethical. The endorsement of such irresponsible behavior certainly is. Yes, if you try, the bulk of you can breed like rabbits, whether you pray to God or not. That doesn't make it a good idea, for you, your kids, or the rest of the planet.Moderation, folks.

Rick and Jan Hess go into marvelous explanation of why God should be your birth controller.Birth controll is convenient to a country like america. It is also too much the norm. But is birth control really safe? Is it biblical? You will find answers like these in this book. I especially liked the chapter titled: \\"Who didn't come to dinner\\" It gives you a list of famous people who were the last child or one of the last children to be born in their family. It makes you really think: Who have I not let be born? What blessing to this world have I rejected because of my desire for convenience or for financial stabiblity? Very eye-opening book if you are searching for truth. If you are thinking, why have so many kids when there are so many who need homes. Then do both! We are going to!

Mr. and Mrs. Hess give an excellent presentation of the fact that God is in complete control of all things - including the womb, and He is all the birth control we'll ever need! I bought the book in 2004, right after my wife and I had our first child and have read it a couple of times since. I recommend it to every couple who is planning to get married.\\"Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.

Like the rest of us (come on, let's admit it) they have an agenda and the whole book, including their interpretation of Scripture, is funneled through the filter of their agenda.That said, I would certainly recommend this book as it exposes us to something we all need: awareness of the diminishment of the family in our culture, even in the church (I mean that in both a figurative and literal sense), and then the contrast which is found in God's word. The most important thing I got from this book was the uplifted feeling of how important children, my role as a mother, and the family unit are to God.Other than occasionally slipping into the role of conscience-dictator (a job which belongs exclusively to the Holy Spirit) Hess' writing style is overall humourous and compassionate.

It assumes that every child born is a Christian, forgetting that salvation is a choice given to all to accept or reject.2. It assumes that American social problems can be overcome by having Christian families outbreed the rest, forgetting that this generation of \\"immoral\\" people are also descendants of what they call a \\"Christian America\\".3. It assumes that making more babies is the solution to every social ill on the planet.This book does not talk about:1. The concept of spiritual children2. It ignores discipling - it doesn't talk about the importance of raising a child up well.3. it doesn't talk about how Israel in the old testament, despite growing to a great and \\"strong\\" population, ultimately rejected salvation when given the choice4. The book does not talk about winning souls for Christ as the primary means of winning the world for Christ.

It's certainly not the most well-written book and the humor is kind of cheesy. But it made me smile and it definitely made me rethink much of what is \\"normal\\" in our modern lives. I think the authors did an excellent job of presenting what the Bible says on the subject of families and children and not just writing their own opinion. I personally have felt very convicted and feel the need to change my whole way of thinking when it comes to birth control. Praise God that my husband is open to reading the book and the Bible with me so we can better discern what is right and pleasing to God. We are in for an adventure I'm sure! It is worth a read and considerable prayer. Christians need to stop going with the flow and following what everyone else is doing. We are supposed to be different from the rest of the world.

Hess could have benefitted from having someone else actually write this book for him because his sarcastic tone reveals someone who is reacting to the wrong attitudes in our culture. It's irritating to find such good thoughts presented in so unpersuasive a style. Still, this is a perspective on family that Christians ought to think about.

Self? Or God? He is sovereign, and knows what is best for each of his children.

As London prepares for WWII, Willie is evacuated to the country, where Mr. Tom takes him in. Over time, he comes to know how to love and be loved. Even after being forced to return home to his mother, he discovers that true love and friendship can help him overcome anything. Typically, war brings bombs, rations, and death. Good Night, Mr. Tom reveals that despite all of this, war can bring love and friendship to even the most disadvantaged child. Through her novel, Michelle Magorian teaches people that child abuse affects a child far worse even than war. When Willie arrives in Little Weirwold, he is a fearful, sickly child. He expects a whipping for every little action. The reader quickly realizes that the abuse causes his condition. His mother has frightened him into thinking that simple things, such as dogs and beds, are evil and dirty. A little love and affection can make a child whole and complete. This novel clearly shows how the giving and withholding of affection can seriously affect a child's social, physical, and mental well-being. The images depicted in this novel show the world of child abuse exactly for what it is: a horrendous crime that hurts children far more deeply than bruises and scars show. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been abused or who is appalled at the conditions many of the world's children live in. It is a story of hope that will brighten many lives."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"This was a fantastic book.

It made me so angry that she could treat her child like this. I found the ending to be an achievement of Will's.

Everything 'as its own time,&quot; is the theme of the entire book because it captures every struggle and every triumph that Willie overcame and fought. Many young readers and old readers alike can identify with the characters throughout the book and the experiences that each character takes on. The reader is exposed to various issues dealing with parentage, loneliness, abuse, death as well as friendship and love. All these issues are addressed in such a fashion that the reader doesn't even realize that there is a thematic role to each character that is being portrayed. You feel sympathy along with joy over the challenges that Will passes through as a child--learning to love, finding true friendship and growing up. I would compare this book with Bridge to Terabithia (underlined) by Katherine Paterson because both books deal with not only friendship and love, but also with death and growing up. Though this book proves, in my eyes, to be the leader of the pack of books that I read for my Children's Literature class, I believe that both stories conveyed a strong and believable story of children having to grow up too early for their time and facing trials that children can identify with. For example, every child faces class bullies and best friends and each book incorporates each theme sympathetically as well as ideally in the lives of Willie and of Jess."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Mogorian, Michelle.

Willie gets the chance to live in Mr. Tom's house. Willie is a timid child, and his life change completely after meeting Mr. Tom because Mr. Tom treats him different from his mom. Mr. Tom is a single man and doesn't have children.The Good night, Mr. Tom book has a happy ending. The War World II ends, and Willie and Mr. Tom became best friends during the short period time of living together. Willie makes a lot of friends and starts to go the school for the first time. Mr. Tom adopts Willie after War World II because Willie's mom died during the war. Willie starts to see Mr. Tom as a father. He life changes because he is sleeping in a bed, having three meals a day and going to school.Good Night, Mr. Tom is a very good book to read. I recommend the book because the book tells a really wonderful story and the book talks about how child abuse can be hurtful to a child. Another reason I recommend the book is because the author won the IRA Children Book Award in 1982, which I think that makes the book special. The book has drama, tragedy."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"&quot;Good Night, Mr. Tom&quot;,is an excellent historical novel, by Michelle Magorian, set in World War II. This is a wonderful and touching story, about a small boy, named Willie Beech, who is evacuated from London to live in Little Weirwold with a complete stranger, Mr. Thomas Oakley. Tom is an old man, not used to children (he had a baby bay that died, but that was his only child), but he is kind to Willie. Willie is a deprived and abused child, and he is afraid of everything, because he wasn't let outside much in his earlier life. Slowly, Willie starts to think on his own, and he forgets the hate and despair of his past. Tom comes to love Willie like a son. Then a telegram comes, and Willie must return to his abusive mother in London, but weeks pass and Willie doesn't come back, so Mr. Tom goes to London to try to find the boy he has come to love so much. I would recommend this book to anyone young or old wo wants to read an excellent book. I hope all who read this book enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Timid, scrawny, Willie Beech is the abused child of a single mother. She sends him to Mr. Tom, who lives in the English countryside, because London is being bombed by the Nazis.The two main adults in this story, the mother and Mr. Tom, seem very similar in the beginning. Yet, by the end, we see that they are completely different. What really hit home was this: hard times can make hard people, but one's true colors shine through when faced with others in need.Mr. Tom's gruff exterior is only his exterior. He's really got a warm heart, which he opens up to Willie and shows him the love that's supposed to be in a family.The mother's quiet, strict exterior masks her bitter, mean nature. She has no love for her children, and abuses them in subtle, neglectful ways.We don't actually see the abuse, we see the end result...which, in my opinion, is far more powerful. I cried for Willie at the end of this book, and cheered Mr. Tom for doing everything he could to save this poor boy. When children are old enough to understand the results of abuse, every family should read this book."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Set in pre WW2 Britain this award-winning novel describesthe birth and growing pains of affection between two strangers, joined by the bizarre circumstances of war. Eight-year-old Willie Beech is one of many London kids sent to the country for safety in the late 30's. Recognizing their children as the country's most precious assets, London parents reluctantlysacrifice the presence of their offspring by entrusting them to the care of country folk. Paired with Tom Oakley, the crusty recluse who lives next door to the church, the lad arrives terrified of everything: the friendly dog, asking questions,even of smiling. Expecting nothing, he dares not hope to be recognized as a human being.Not that he has had anything to smile abobut in his miserable years alone with a mentally- disturbed, abusive mother. Mr. Tom, as the boy calls him, quickly realizes that the boy is in desperate need of healing: for his tortured body, his twisted mind and his lonely young heart. As the dour man cares for the sick child (malnutrition, bedwetting, nightmares) he develops an unspoken but deep fondess for the unloved and friendless boy. Compassion for Willie brings out Tom's long-buried tenderness. It takes many months for Willie's true self to emerge: good country air, tender care of his battered body, cultivation of his active mind, and the boon of natural socialization with his peers. Gradually sloughing off his urban shell of fear, Willie makes his first friends, learns to read and write, and then discovers his natural talent as an artist.But these evacuees are only temporary residents of Little Weirwold; we realize that eventual separation and future heartbreak are inevitable. What happens when their rightful parents reclaim these kids? This is a heartwarming tale of the transformation of a rejected weakling into a healthy, lively and accepted member of a generous country village. It is also a story of gradual healing and rejoining of the human race by Mr. Tom, the embittered host--who never came to terms with the death of his young wife and infant decades earlier. We learn many details of Britain's preparation for war and the blitz. But this story is really about the value of human relationships. Two separate entities can become a self-contained family unit, but will the authorities permit the boy to stay with the older man, who is no blood kin? Magorian provides touching insight into the mysteries of friendship and the nature of grief, as one abused little boy takes the country cure. GOOD NIGHT MR. TOM presents readers with an historical setting for contemporary understanding of child abuse issues."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Eight year old Willie Beech knows that he is a bad boy, his mother tells him, and she only gives him the most gentle beatings. But now, his mom has sent him away to live in the countryside like all the children in London during World War 2 to protect them from the Nazi bombings.At first Willie is terrified of Mr. Tom, but gradually he learns to trust him. Eventually it is safe to return to London, but is it safe for Willie to return to his mother? Tom reluctantly allows Willie to return, but when Willie dosen't answer his letters Mr. Tom goes to find Willie.A bit of caution with this title, the episodes of child abuse and neglect are rather strong, and may not be suitable for all ages...at least the abuse is not described in action, we just see the end result.A great book to examine the relationship of family, and love. This book is a great book to read-aloud to your children and have a discussion...but you may want to read it first to see if your child is ready for this one."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"\\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" puzzles me. When I read it objectively, looking only at the writing, it's not so impressive. The flow isn't particularly good and at times the book clunks along. The dialogue is engaging, though, and thoroughly real.And the story itself is incredible. \\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" tells of a young London boy who is sent out to live in the country during World War II for his safety. There, away from an abusive home, Willie is able to grow and learn what it means to be loved.With a series of remarkably realistic and fun characters, Willie (renamed Will in his new home with \\"Mr. Tom\\") moves and grows. Aspects of the book will make the reader cry (quite a few), aspects will chill you, but on the whole you will smile through your tears, because this book is just... special. It's got a very special feel to it, through tears and sad moments.So while at times the story gets dull, it's an excellent book. I would recommend this to young teens, mostly because it deals with serious issues and might be a bit much for younger kids.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Good Night, Mr. Tom is one of the best books I have ever read. It takes the reader on a jouney to England during the brink of World War II. William Beech, an abused child, is sent to the countryside to get away from his mother who beat him badly. Mr. Tom, the nice, gruff man who has taken him in as a foster child, introduces Willie to things he has never experienced. While Willie and Mr. Tom have a lot of good times together, they must still remember that England is on the brink of war and they must prepare for the worst. Mr. Tom and Willie built a shelter just to be on the safe side in case there was a boming and this would eventually come in handy. Good Night Mr. Tom takes the reader into a world of happiness, sadness, and adventure. This is a book that is hard to put down. I recommend this to every reader ranging from the young to the old. A must have."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"My son had to pick a book from a long list to read over the summer for school. After reading the reviews for this book, we chose it. It was a very touching story, sad in places and happy in others. You really are cheering for Will and Mr. Tom. The author uses colloquial accents of rural England, but you really get used to it. My son is reading the book now and isn't having a problem understanding what the characters are saying. He is also enjoying the book a great deal, and having a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"My daughter Kate who is in grade 5 and 10 years old thinks:It really is a very good book for all ages, especially for people who want to find out about World War II. I learned a lot about what it feels like to have no one. And then to find someone. The ending made me cry! You will love this book!!!Sometimes the way they speak is hard to read. They have an accent and the author writes it with strange spelling the way they say things in London.

Since then I have often returned to it's pages so I can see life through the eyes of an abused unhealthy boy and an bitter old man. One of the things I love most about this book is that it points out how powerful of an impact people can have in other people lives, for good or bad. In this case, Mr. Tom learned to love again, and Will finally found someone who would love and care for him, a parent that he deserved. I very highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but be prepared to cry. Even though I've read it dozens of times, I still can't get through it without crying. A must have for your personal library, I promise that you will cherish it for years to come."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"In Michelle Magorian's novel Good Night, Mr. Tom, she brilliantly illustrates the hardships of a young child growing up post World War II after having being abused and abandoned by his mother, the one person who was truly supposed to love him. After being shipped from London to the English countryside to live with Mr. Tom, Willie has to adjust to living in a world he never knew existed. A world in which love, affection and friendships flourish. Magorian uses what she knows to set the plot, being that she was born and raised mostly in England. Her parents met each other during the World War II and perhaps she was reflecting on her own issues because as a child she lived a couple of years in Singapore and Australia. She eventually came back to England when she was 9 years old, but had already been moved around a lot, as did the main character in the book. The New Yorker called Magorian's novel \\"An engrossing and poignant story, with much sunlight to balance the darkness.\\" Jim Trelease from The Read-Aloud Handbook said it was \\"powerful.\\" And that, it is."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Never in my life has a book made such an effct on me.

Good Night, Mr. Tom is a wonderful book! While it does have its sad moments, it also has many happy moments, so it generally evens out.

It is about a boy named William. He lives in London and is very poor. Then, a war starts and he is sent into the country with other kids to be safe. He is left with a grumpy old man named Mr. Tom Oakley, Mr. Tom for short. William, called Will by Mr. Tom, Willie by his terrible mother, and William by strangers, softens Mr. Tom's heart.

However, the plot structure is a bit flawed. The author has tried to cram all of life into this little paperback book: child abuse, death, love, art, sex, religion, friendship, equal rights for girls, war, growing up, being small inside and out, fright, trauma, illness...The list goes on and on, and it can detract from the main plot of the book."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"When I read Goodnight Mister Tom I was absoloutely entranced. I think Michelle Magorian uses her talent in an oustanding way. The book was exciting and sad plus everything in between all mixed together. The recent T.V film that was shown over Christmas let down this brilliant book. People are watching the film and not reading the book which means they miss out on the magic of the book. The film has missed out so much of the book, a lot of which is the most important bits. Some of the things they missed out include: when Tom Oakley took Zach and Willy to Salmouth or Salt-on-the-mouth as they called it, George, Willy's friend, who was one of the main character wasn't mentioned in the film and the whole bit about Spooky Cott was missed out.

I was pleasantly surprised. The book uniquely evokes a wide array of emotions. For example, while reading this book, I comparatively felt the anxiety Will had when first meeting Mr. Tom. I similarly felt Mr. Tom's growing endearment to Will. I also felt the anger and pain associated with the subsequent events leading to Will's hospitalization. The story, as it were, &quot;was a roller-coaster of emotions.&quot; The book did not allow me to stop; I was caught up in wanting to know &quot;what is going to happen next?&quot; Although some of the episodes within the narrative were borderline believable, the way in which the author wrote the story (intricate detail placed in the emotions of the characters, their interactions with one another etc.) allowed me to believe the story. Another reason for my interest in the book is my identification with Will, the protagonist. Even though my experiences at that age were not as drastic as his, I could relate to his lack of confidence; I was very timid and afraid of making mistakes. The examples aforementioned cannot justify the quality of Good Night Mr. Tom.

The book consists of Willie being abused by his mother and Mr. Tom being a father figure towards him. Also Willie's sister dies in the basement as Willie is taking care of her.The book gives a very clear background picture of life in England during World War 2. The difference in the country life and life in London was very different. People were dieing and staving in London and everything was peaceful and quiet in the country back then.This book shows how people can change. William was described as a skinny, timid, ill looking person and as he grew up he was described as a strong, talented, healthy young man.

Tom is a bit of a stock character, the gruff man with a heart of gold, but his love for Will was so real that I didn't mind his slight stereotypical personality. Will stands out as the hero of the book. His growth from a frightened, abused child to a strong, happy, young man was an excellent example of good character growth. All the characters reacted as real people would, felt like real people would, and ultimately, were real people (Except for maybe Will's mother. I'm glad to say I've never met anyone like her and hope I never will.).There are several poignant moments in the book.

Both boy and man have been damaged and they help each other heal and grow. I just love this book and would recommend it to anyone, child or adult.

First and foremost, the book tells the compelling story of a young boy from London sent to the countryside during World War II. He leaves behind an abusive mother to live with an old man who has cut himself off from the world since the death of his wife and child. The two bring each other back to life, and it is a joy to read the story of their rebirth. This book is more than an old tale retold, however; plot twists and unique supporting characters make it fascinating, and for a young person, it is interesting to read about a different time and a different country."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"This book made me cry. Will's mother was the most horrible person i've ever heard of. I think that it was a good thing Tom did take him from the hospital.

Michelle Magorian did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Good Night, Mr. Tom is a suspenseful book that will melt your heart. It is set when London is on the verge of joining World War II. Willie is an evacuee from a poor part of the city whose mother is abusive. Mr. Tom is an old man who has shut himself out and only goes out for shopping, etc. Tom is chosen to house Will while the war is going on.The first reason I love this book is how well developed the characters are. They all have there own adventures and lives. You really get to know them and understand their parts. Good job to Michelle Magian, the author. This excellent novel is about friends, moving on, and discovering yourself.

Up until that point, I had not been very impressed with the books my class had been assigned. I assumed this book was just going to be another boring book I'd have to suffer through, but as soon as I started it I found it difficult to put down. I read it whenever I could, and found myself completely engrossed with it. I absolutely loved the book, and when I was done reading it, I was glad that I had been assigned it. I kept the book over the years, and today I pulled it off the bookshelf. I haven't read it since 8th grade. I started reading it out loud to my fiance, and am one-third of the way through it already. He seems to be enjoying it as well, as I thought he would. I know the title doesn't sound that thrilling, but if you've never read Good Night, Mr. Tom.. give it a chance. It just might suprise you.

This scene showed the reader yet another great length that Mr. Tom was willing to go for this young boy. I was also moved by the mutual happiness between them both when the reader learns that Mr. Tom will be adopting young Willie.

It is a true mark of her skill as a writer that our brief glimpse into this darker side of the story is done with a very light touch, making it completely believable, but not at all overwhelming.

I'm glad I own it so I can enjoy it again and again."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I had not heard of the book, Good Night, Mr. Tom, by Michelle Magorian (copyright 1981) until my mother-in-law mentioned it several years ago. She had been evacuated during World War II and recommended it highly. Reading this book was like stepping back into pre-World War II rural England, complete with thatched cottages, heavy country accents, and hard-working, thrifty villagers. (Perhaps I've seen too many episodes of the Vicar of Dibley on PBS, but the characters in this story seem very vivid and realistic.)Good Night, Mr. Tom is about a young boy named William Beech who is evacuated from London at the beginning of the war to a safer rural village called Little Weirwold. Nine-year-old Willie is the only child of an abusive, over-religious single mother. We learn that his mother will not allow him to be evacuated unless he can stay with someone \\"who is religious or who lives near a church.\\"Tom Oakley, 60-some-year-old caretaker of the local village church and cemetary, is a cranky, embittered old man who ends up with Willie. It soon becomes clear to old Tom that Willy's life in London was very different. Like many children from poor London neighborhoods, Willie is suddenly exposed to a whole new life in Little Weirwold. He has never seen a cow before, nor picked blackberries, nor slept in a real bed. He knows nothing about fresh milk, squirrels, garden dirt, horses, riding a bicycle, swimming, or even petting a dog. Timid Willie has no friends and cannot read.We learn through the course of the book about Tom's life as a young man and the tragedy of his beloved wife Rachel. His gruffness begins to fall away as he and his little dog Sammmy help Willie learn to read and to heal. Willie begins to live life as a normal boy with Tom's kindness and his newfound friend, Zack, a fellow evacuee who is Jewish. Willie makes friends, and his talent for drawing and painting begins to blossom. He becomes a part of life in Little Weirwold. It's a happy life, in spite of the outbreak of war.The reader begins to forget that Willie is an evacuee. He has gradually become a happy, healthy, pink-cheeked little boy--not Willie any longer, but the \\"William\\" that Tom has helped him to be. William and Zack, such opposites, are the best of friends (or, as Zack says, they're \\"jolly, jolly fine!\\")Then comes a message that William's mother is ill. She wants him back in London. William must leave his life in Little Weirwold to reunite with his mother. Tom waits for three weeks, but there is no word from William. Fear drives Tom to board the train to London to seek out the boy he was begun to love as his own. . .American readers will learn a great deal about English life during the 1930-40's: Terms like \\"blackout curtains,\\" \\"Anderson shelter,\\" \\"balaclava,\\" billeting,\\" \\"cuppa\\" \\"drapers\\" and \\"Mackintosh.\\" Various British accents of the characters mingle to create a realistic portrayal of the island: Tom's thick country accent, Zack's \\"posh BBC\\" kind of London accent, Glad's toothless lisp, and even the young Scottish soldier's speech on the train. Most of all, it is a rich story about realistic characters that unfolds gradually and naturally--or as Tom says, \\"Everythin' in its own time.\\"Although we meet Willie's mother only once in the book, fairly late, she remains the unseen force that controls William's life. Willie has been abused, but the abuse is not the focus of the plot. It is the relationships between Willie, Tom, and Zack, which give the story its heart. Ultimately, it is the mother who determines what happens for William and Tom.Good Night, Mr. Tom, is truly a heartwarming story, bittersweet, at times a bit raw, but never contrived. Michelle Magoria received the 1982 IRA Children's Book Award as a new author. I would strongly recommend this for readers ages 11 and up who enjoy history and are looking for a quality reading experience."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Willie (Will) Beech, the likable main character in \\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\", is a shy, scared, malnourished 8-year-old evacuated to the English countryside from London in World War II. Willie goes to live with a kind older man, Tom Oakley, whom Willie affectionately calls Mr. Tom. Willie, who was frequently abused by his mother in the past, learns new, loving ways of life while in the care of Tom. He grows both physically and emotionally during his stay, but many times this growth is interrupted by thrilling plot-twists.Though \\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" is heart-warming and most definitely a page-turner, there are parts that are quite graphic, and others that are remarkably sad. I would not recommend it to those who prefer stories that are entirely happy, or to those who cannot tolerate gore. However, I would definitely recommend \\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" to anyone else.USEFUL INFORMATION: Since the story is set in England, (the English countryside, more specifically), the author writes each word exactly as the characters would say it. This dialect can be a bit confusing, but it's not too hard to comprehend."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Experience the life of a young boy who has never known what love is until he moves in with a man who loves him like his own. Good Night, Mr. Tom is a realistic fiction novel that everyone at any age would enjoy. The author, Michelle Magorian, uses such enthusiasm to make you feel like you are actually part of the story. This novel is not part of any series, but should be because all of the flashbacks and realistic dialog making it come to life.William Beech is an abused evacuee from London that is taken to stay with Tom Oakley during World War II. Tom lives in Little Weirwold with a loving environment and supportive neighbors. All of little Will's past has been about hard discipline and regular abuse, but when he arrives at Mr. Tom's house he can finally breathe and make friends of his own especially Zach. All of the other people in town will guide him while allowing him to learn new and different things. Will has endured many ups and downs. His talent comes through his drawings, and he is faced with death and hardship. Along the way many distractions will come along to interfere with the growth and progress he has made so far. Will he be able to stay and live with the kind hearted man he has came to know and love, or he have to return to his mother along with his old lifestyle? Will all the problems he has overcome pay off? In the end while he answers these questions, he will have faced many emotions each and every day. At such a young age and everything Will has went through, you will surely think anything is possible.I have enjoyed reading this book so much over the month time frame that I read it. This novel is one of my new favorites. It reminds me of Waiting for Christopher because in that novel a little boy was abused as well. I really wish I could have read it quicker because of all the wide range emotions I felt for Will. The main emotion I felt was sadness, but when I was happy I tried to make it last. So remember that when you have an argument with your parents it is not nearly as bad as getting abused each day."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"&quot;Goodnight,Mister Tom.&quot; was an enjoyable, touching novel which showed the growing relationship between an eight year old evacuee called Will, and a lonely old man called Tom, who takes him in during the second world war.

It is a classic. Should be made into a movie."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"The book Good Night Mr. Tom by Michelle Magorian, was a book I extremely enjoyed reading. When I first looked at the title, I wasn't too attracted to reading the book but once I caught the basic idea on what it was about on the inside, I was eager to read it. I'm glad I did, because this book is one of the most heartbreaking stories I have read. The story starts out very nicely, introducing the main character, William aka Willie aka Will. Unlike some books, the beginning of the story catches your attention and does throughout the whole book. The sad part is, Will is an evacuee and constantly gets seriously abused by his mother. With no father to help him out and his mother not willing to take him during a war, Will is sent house after house with other children to be accepted somewhere else. Will's mother is a religious type but takes everything to another dangerous and extreme level that hurts herself as well as her son. Will is very lucky and ends up in a small town named Little Weirwold with Thomas Oakley, or whom Will learned to call, Mister Tom. Hardened by the loss of his son and wife, he gradually starts to accept Will and in a way, takes him in as his own son. After making friends, discovering talents, creating memories and going on wild adventures, he slowly regains the childhood that he missed. Learning that his before life was not suppose to be, Will is reluctant to return to his mother because she is \\"sick.\\" The rest of the story is something you need to find out yourself. Even I cannot express the joy and sorrows with reading this heart touching story. Only the readers can feel this by encountering it for themselves. The reason this book received the rating it did is because it was so nicely put together, it makes the reader see the innocence of Will when it's such a heart break just to see him learning new things that are common to us. Michelle Magorian also brought out the infinite patience and love of Mister Tom. This made the story even more special because of the hero role he plays to Will. Another reason is because she makes the conclusion and ending worthwhile the read. It was as if the only reason I was reading the book was to get to the end. The final important reason was because the whole book was exciting. I cannot remember one moment in the book where I wanted to stop. The experiences little William became a part of me and I wanted to encourage this character as he went struggling through his rough life. Overall, this book was very satisfying. I hope to read more books like this in the future... a true heartache. (Very special book)"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"You won't regret buying this one...it's a classic.

When every I am unhappy I come and read this story, and I feel that my passion for life is renewed. An excellent book for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Goodnight, Mr. Tom is a charming, yet saddening book. The book is about a boy named Will trying to survive as an evacuee in World War II. An ornery old man named Tom chooses to house and feed Will. Throughout the course of the story, Will and Tom become closer and closer until Will is then sent home to his mother. Tom instinctively follows and rescues the boy so they can live together in peace.I loved this book for many reasons. One reason was the way that Will, a small boy, brings back the memories of Tom's wife to Tom. This I like because in the beginning Tom thought that Will would be a burden, but near the end, Tom was starting to love the boy. With every new day, Tom was being relieved of the sadness of his wife's death. When Tom visited the paint shop, he felt happy, not sad, about remembering his wife Rachel. Another reason why I liked this book was the way the author describes the relationships in the story. I knew what each relationship was like with each passing page. Many times throughout the story, descriptions were added explaining the tight relationships of each and every one of the characters.Lastly, this book gave me mixed emotions. Sometimes it was very gloomy and sometimes it was joyful. When Will was told that his best friend had experienced a tragedy, it was a like you were actually there experiencing the pain along with him. Also, when Carrie was admitted into high school, I was like \\"Oh Yeah!\\" It kept me emotionally involved with the story.This book was extremely good reading, and on a scale from 1 to 10, I would give it a high 9. I recommend that any person able to read it should give it a go.Reviewed by a Cincinnati reader"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"If you are a sixth grade language arts teacher and you are looking for a great book to use as a class novel, Good Night, Mr. Tom is it.

The story is set during early World War II when London and coastal cities in England were being bombed. Children in these areas were evacuated to the country where willing families took them in for unspecified lengths of service. (If you recallThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, the book or film, then you understand this evacuation.)Pale, thin, and small for his age, William Beech (Willie, he is called) is placed with Tom Oakley, a gruff man in his 60's and resident of Wierwold, a tiny village north of London. What Tom discovers is a multitude of bruises and sores from repeated beatings with Willie's big belt and buckle that hold up his pants.It's with this discovery that Tom rises up outside himself to become not only a caretaker for the duration, but eventually a father figure. As a young man, Tom lost his beloved wife and baby son in childbirth and became the town's recluse. We don't know his occupation, but I wouldn't be surprised if he hadn't been a weaver, much like that one in Raveloe, who also was reclaimed by a foundling, that ol' Silas Marner.Like Silas, Tom has not had much to do with other villagers until now. Caring for an abused boy brings him out of himself and into the world to assume the care--quite capably and generously--for this bedraggled boy.In the six months or so that Tom has the boy, Willie grows out of his fear into love and friendship. Even at 10 he cannot read, but Tom teaches him. Willie slowly joins a world he didn't know existed. Also, he becomes very best friends with Zach, another evacuee (his first friend at that).All good things come to an end. Tom receives a telegram from the mother, requesting Willie return home. She is ill and needs him. Willie can barely remember this creature he calls his mother and fears this trip.\\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" is truly a heartwarming book. Watching not only Will learn to love, but also Tom is a reading experience to savor.

William Beeche is a young boy who has been separated from his abusive mother, to live with a grumpy widower named Tom Oakley.It soon becomes clear to Tom that William has been cruelly treated by his mother when Mr. Tom sees the bruises on William's body. William's mom sends a leather strap with him, so that the person he is staying with can also beat him. However, Tom refuses to use it.William is a boy who looks sickly and ill. He frequently wets the bed, but Tom is very understanding. William becomes more comfortable and happy, also the bedwetting stops. William also learns how to read and write and is good at drawing and painting.Willie is then called back to London. His mother is unwell and asks him to come and take care of her. Mr. Tom starts to feel alone and incomplete without Willie so he travels to London to bring Willie back to his house. When Mr. Tom gets there Willie is found in the basement with his dead sister. After a while Willie got over the death of his sister and was later adopted by Mr. TomThis book is very sad. The book consists of Willie being abused by his mother and Mr. Tom being a father figure towards him. Also Willie's sister dies in the basement as Willie is taking care of her.The book gives a very clear background picture of life in England during World War 2. The difference in the country life and life in London was very different. People were dieing and staving in London and everything was peaceful and quiet in the country back then.This book shows how people can change. William was described as a skinny, timid, ill looking person and as he grew up he was described as a strong, talented, healthy young man. Mr. Tom was described as a grumpy widower until Willie came into his life. Then he became a loving happy old man.If you're looking for all of these kinds of things in a book then I would recommend Good Night Mr. Tom for you.By Germany Savedge"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I read this book in eighth grade, and I have loved it ever since.

However, some parts in this book made me a little sick - just a warning to those who have not read this book. I love the setting in the book, which takes place during World War II.

He had never celbrated a birthday or even seen a cow this book is great for all readers at any level."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"An award winning story and rightly so. This book works on so many levels. Set in the first year of the second world war, it follows the lives of some evacuees - and one in particular - a boy who has suffered from neglect but who slowly comes out of his shell in response to the love and care of the man who takes him in, and the village they live in. This was a wonderful story - educational, gripping and playing nicely on the emotions too. It has poignant moments but ultimately a message of hope.I read this a few years ago, and my 11 year old daughter has just now read it too. She was gripped by it from the start and rea the whole thing in a day or so, and has been singing its praises as one of the best books she ever read.Thoroughly recommended for children, young adults and adults alike. Also fits nicely with the year 6 Second World War studies in schools."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I read this book a few years ago and it touched me so deeply that I ordered several copies for my friends to read. This book takes place during WW2 in England, and it has everything in it. It's filled with tears and laughter. I wanted to meet these people and be friends with them. I was so excited to see this author has a new book coming out. After reading Goodnight Mr. Tom, I bought all her books. She has a gift for telling a story. Have I mentioned how much I love this book?"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"This is a simply wonderful novel that by no means should be pigeonholed as \\"young adult\\" if that means being denied an adult audience, though it had more than a few elements in common with \\"Anne of Green Gables.\\" It works on so many different levels and is both sensitive and intelligent. The characters are memorable and believable. And it doesn't just deal with child abuse, though it does so convincingly and heart-wrenchingly, but is equally good in its descriptions of children being nurtured creatively, and in its depictions of friendships between adults and children. I can hardly think of a thing about it I didn't like, and I look forward eagerly to more from this author."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"This book is very intense but a good read. It is about evacuees from the London area because WWII was beginning. This particular town is painted different than most during this era. The people are nice and giving. If anyone does misuse the children they are put out for it! The major characters meet each other and both are not too sure of the other. It tells the story of a lost soul bringing healing to another lost soul. There are some intense and disgusting scenes but when you come out on the other side it is worth it! I don't recommend this book for anyone under the age of 12 or 13."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"What would it feel like for you if you were an eight year-old, abused by his mother, then sent to the country when WWII broke out? To stay with a man you had no idea what his first name was?I know how William Beech felt. Scared, alone, frightened by what is life has evolved into. Willie, an eight year-old boy living in London, and being abused by his mother. In the book GOOD NIGHT, MR. TOM, it tells the story of Willie, when he was taken from his home when WWII broke out, and sent to the country. His caretaker, Mr. Tom Oakley, a nice but stern old man, living in Little Weirworld, a small country themed town. Almost in the middle of Nowhere. it had a calm set mood to it, feeling safe, even in the middle of the war.Mr. Tom and Willie didn't get along at first, but you'll be surprised to read about what they become.How the characters talk in the book is a little hard to understand, but once you get used to it. The book is very well-written and I never wanted to put it down. The writer has a good writing style because her characters can relate and connect with many readers.This book is fictional, but it seems like there really is a Willie Beech, and a Mr. Tom.This book is a wonderful book to read. It is a book for anyone. I think it would attract adults more, because younger kids may not understand it.As you read this, did you answer my question at the top, do you know how you would feel? When you read this book, It will tell you and more, everything in my question, and then, you will know the answer. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I decided to read this book for seventh grade accellerated reader. This great piece of literature has quickly become one of my all time favorite books. I'm very hard to please when it comes to books. When you read this, you become so attached to every last character. It is truly amazing."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"As World War II was raging on , young Willie Beech had no choice but to be evacuated from his unsafe home in London. However his home was not only unsafe because of the war, but also because of his abusive and bigot mother.William \\"Willie\\" Beech, a timid 9-year-old, gets evacuated from Deptford to Sussex, and is taken in by Tom Oakley because of the war. Oakley is a widower who has allowed himself to become bitter ever since his wife and child died of scarlet fever 40 years before. As they get to know each other they cause the other to open up, and Tom even helps Willie to read and write and encourages his talent for drawing. Eventually Willie is called back to London by his mother, and Tom gets worried when he doesn't write back. His love for Willie is shown even more as he goes to London looking for him. After awhile Tom finds Willie tied up and malnourished with his mother's baby lying dead in his arms. Disgusted by what he has found, Tom takes Willie back to the country and later adopts him. His mother is later found to have committed suicide.Goodnight Mr. Tom was an excellent reading experience. Its strong points were its characterization which could affect most reader's emotions and its effective descriptions. Another strong point of the book was that it had some very deep themes in it, such as child abuse and losing loved ones. I would recommend this to all adults and children alike; anyone could be interested by this masterpiece.The best part of the book was its deep character detail which made you feel as if you actual knew the characters. For example, throughout the book you can see how Willie changes from being a timid and sickly little boy, to a stronger more confident young man. This can also be seen as Mr. Tom begins to care more about Willie and even looks for him when he doesn't write back.In addition, the book had amazing elaboration which really gives you the feeling of how it was back in those times. For example, during the night Mr. Tom has to put the black things over his windows so that the spies cannot see the light coming out of his house. Throughout the book many other things about the war are described such as hearing bombs in the distance and the whole evacuation process.Another good, but at the same time sad, thing about Goodnight Mr. Tom was the deep themes incorporated to make it a well rounded story. Examples of these deep themes were when Willie was getting beat and starved by his mentally ill mother and also when the death of Mr. Tom's wife and child were described. This gave the book more meaning and these dark themes also made the reader have sympathy for the characters.The synergy of the deep characterization and the great detail provide for a magnificent book. The deep themes make the book even more meaningful, as they show the troubles of child abuse and issues with mental health. Overall, Michelle Magorian's book is a sad yet heartwarming tale that will continue to stay in reader's minds for years to come.-C.Duncan"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I just finished reading this, and (I'm in eighth grade) realized how important it is to have some one to love, someone to laugh with, someone to cry with, and to have someone to cherish life with.It has such a sad ending, it almost made me cry. I was so horrified that WWII was really like that. And the thought of ever losing someone, you think you can handle it, but when it comes, you can't bear it. Even if you think you really don't care about someone, you do, deep inside, like Mr. Tom.It's also sad that there was the same type of abuse mothers had towards children. I cannot believe what the mother did with the baby. I was so grateful I have a mother than can care for me ( a father as well, Will has none) and knows that I have my own personal interests, and that may not include reading the Bible all day, sleep, and repeat your schedule of reading the Bible. Life is to have fun, and we should all be doing just that.I also like that even though Will cannot read or write, and can draw amazingly. And that helps him write, because he thinks that writing is like drawing.This was an amazing book."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I have been evaluating a high school library to see which items should be kept and which should be weeded when I came across this book. Since I read ALOT and had never heard of this author, I took it home to read. I couldn't put it down! The plot takes some interesting turns, the characters of Will and Tom and Zach are wonderful, heart-warming and so very realistic. Even the mother is frighteningly realistic. This book illustrates that, no matter what happens, people can bounce back and live wonderful, happy lives. Tom and Will compliment each other and make the story a wonderful experience to read. I'm going to buy a copy so I can re-read it any time I want. I may even share it with some family members."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"An abused eight year-old boy gets evacuated from London away from his abusive mother to a little town called Little Weirwold during WWII, to find that his mother is ill and he must return home from his loving life in Little Weirwold. William \\"Willie\\" Beech gets evacuated to Little Weirwold to live with an old man named Tom Oakley. He cares for Willie as if he were his own son. While Willie was in Little Weirwold, he made a lot of friends. He had never had any friends before especially ones that cared for him as much as his friends in Little Weirwold did. Willie was very saddened and horrified to return home to his dreadful mother. After two months of Willie not writing Tom or anything, Tom decided to take a train to London to see how Willie was doing. When Tom got there he found that Willie and his baby sister had been locked up in a cabinet for what looked like days. He then took Willie to a hospital to make sure he was alright. Tom later on ended up kidnapping Willie because they were going to make him go to a boy's home. This book is a very good book and I would most definitely read it again!\\"Good Night, Mr. Tom\\" is a very good book that shows lots of love and heartrending stories. One of the most tearjerkers was when Willie said \\"I love you\\" to Tom and later on started calling him dad. That meant a lot to Tom. Especially since he had not been loved by anyone like that since his wife and son died just after giving birth. Another tearjerker was when Willie's best friend, Zach, died in London while visiting his sick dad during the war. Willie had never had any friends his whole life. A best friend meant a whole lot to him and for him to die was atrocious. It took a lot of strength for Willie to except that fact that he was gone. That was very hard for him. Another thing that was saddening was how Willie blamed himself for his baby sister, Trudy's, death. Willie could not help the fact that she was dying. They were locked up and there was no way that Willie could have gotten her any more milk. It took a lot for Willie to get over that.This book is also very good because it shows Willie growing up and opening up to a new lifestyle. It's very interesting book and hard to put down. It's very interesting to see Willie learning how to read and write. He puts forth 110% so he can move up classes with the kids his age. He was put in the younger kid's class because he was eight and still did not know how to read or write. Tom helped him every night before bed and even put post-it notes around the cottage to help Willie. It was very exciting to see Willie open up and actually audition for the Christmas play. He was one of the main characters! That was shocking to a lot of people because Willie was always very shy and kept himself to himself. It was a big step for Willie to participate in the play. Another big difference that you could tell in Willie was that he was independent and brave. He was the only one besides Zach that didn't back down when going to Spooky Cott. Even though, when they got there it wasn't haunted or anything of the sort, it still said a lot for him not to have backed down like all of his other friends did. Willie has changed so much through out this book. It's amazing.Another one of the best things about this book was that you got to watch and learn as Willie \\"found\\" himself and the special talents that he had that he never knew existed in him. He found out that he was an artist. He was the best artist in all of Little Weirwold. He was only eight when he discovered that talent of his and he still could out draw anybody in Little Weirwold. Willie also discovered that he had the talent to act and perform. If Willie had not have acted in the Christmas play he would have never known how good of an actor he is. He was almost as good as Zach and Zach had grown up with his parents being performers and practicing all the time. Willie excelled in a lot of things while being in Little Weirwold. He learned how to ride a bicycle which he previously had been terrified of and that he actually really enjoyed doing so. And he learned how to cook with Mr. Tom and that he loved doing that also. He also loved learning and going to school even though Zach was no longer there to comfort him and make him laugh and help him with his work.This is definitely one of my favorite books and I would read it again anytime. This book shows how a weak little abused eight year old can grow up and become a very independent young boy. Willie has gone through a lot in his life and suffered tremendously, but he still manages to thank God for everyday he lives."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"I think Good Night, Mr Tom is a great book.

The story of Will, an abused little boy evacuated from London during World War 2, really touched me. The gradual development of WIll from a scared little boy to a proud and happy child was a real gem. Characters such as Zach and Mr Tom, Carrie and George all helped to story to become a truly memorable one. This story should be on all school curriculum, and should be read by all."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"This is the most fantastic book I've ever read, It will have you laughing and crying.

I recomend this book to people 9 years and up. FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"William Beech and his relationship with Mr. Tom shows the reader the meaning of true love and what entails a family. This compelling story of an abused child finding comfort, safety, and love through this old man can encourage and give hope to others similar to Wil. This book is not only entertaining but powerful, displaying life events that most people face: starting a new life, making friends, death, and more. Readers who come to know this story will not be disappointed! I enjoyed reading this book because I could really relate to some of the things that Wil had to face. The way this book was written also helped me to feel apart of the book. A good book is when the story (its style, characters, setting, and plot) touches all the senses, which Goodnight, Mr. Tom does. It contains dialogue with words that help the reader understand the character's dialect and as a result, the reader becomes emersed into the setting of the book. Goodnight, Mr. Tom can also be used as a tool to reach all audiences--young children to adults. This book will take the reader on an emotional rollercoaster--from laughter to sadness to weariness to joy. I highly recommend this story for all ages."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Good Night, Mr. Tom is an excellent book because it offers so much to a reader. After reading the book, the reader can have a better understanding of what abuse is and the lasting effects of abuse though not only a child's eyes, but through the caretakers eyes. Through Willie, the reader is able to grasp the concept that children who are abused feel that it is their fault, that the child did something wrong for the mistreatment to occur. Through Tom's character, the reader can sympathesize the difficulty of getting to know someone, and then the fear of losing that person. We see Tom's rugged personality soften up as Willie enters his life. Willie is the key to unlock Tom's past pains, and Tom is the key to unlock Willie's fear of love. Both characters learn what it means to love and the lengths one would go to save a person. Through Tom's patience and kindess, Willie is able to overcome his insecurities and learns that there is something beyond abuse, and that is love."},{"Title":"Good Night, Mr. Tom","review":"Good Night, Mr. Tom is an excellent book because it offers so much to a reader.

Many SF novels suffer from poorly thought out cultures; a particular problem is that of monoculture, when the various cultures presented in the book have only superficial differences. Ms. Slonczewski avoids that completely. There are, by my count, four main cultures in this book: the ageless Elysians, the Clickers from Bronze Sky, the Urulites, and the Sharers. There are also several other cultures which play a less important part in the book.Each of these cultures is completely distinct from the others, with regard not only to manners, customs, and dress, but also some of their fundamental assumptions about how human society should be organized. The interplay between members of these cultures -- their conversations, arguments, and differing opinions -- bring to life a novel which might otherwise have been tedious. Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Daughter of Elysium","review":"For anyone who has read Joan Slonczewski's &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;, finding another book by the same author is extremely exciting. The reader, however, is in for a few minor shocks if he/she actually reads this next book. First of all, don't expect a sequel to the sci-fi classic &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;. Daughter of Elysium takes place long, long, LONG after &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;. There is a whole new dimension added to the already complex Shora, as a civilization of beings which never grow old has settled on the ocean moon and is coexisting peacefully with the Shorans. If you're wanting more of the Shorans themselves, this book is only sometimes for you -- the text is interwoven with some &quot;ancient&quot; Shoran history, namely what happens after the end of &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;. On the whole, both the history and the new plots are intriguing and well-written. It's the kind of book that you can't put down -- as much as for its own greatness as for that of the one which came before it. It's a must-read, but don't expect it to be QUITE as dazzling as &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;"},{"Title":"Daughter of Elysium","review":"Following a couple centuries after \\"A Door into Ocean\\", \\"Daughter of Elysium\\" revisits the planet Shora, home of the ocean-dwelling Sharers and the city-dwelling Elysians.

Her scientist husband was invited to assist in delving into the secrets of Elysians' longevity and in solving the Elysians' inability to bear children. The technologically superior Elysians live a pleasurable existence surrounded by their robot servants, who are slowly gaining sentience despite various precautions. In this epic sci fi tale, various threads entwine and produce a glorious and compelling exploration into compassion and humanity that fascinates as it entertains.

The story itself is gripping -- a struggle of foreigners on a world full of nearly immortal people. A tale of cultures, feminism, grown technology and growing sentience, as well as the differences between the poor and the rich, the ageless and the short-lived.I'm actually writing this because the Kindle version has a serious formatting issue about a third of the way through -- everything starts underlining. It's detracting from my otherwise happy enjoyment of the story of Raincloud, Blackbear, their children and the world of Shora.(This would be 5 stars except for formatting. The book itself should be 5 stars, and perhaps the formatting should be a 2)UPDATE: The formatting is supposed to be fixed.

I am a Christian, and I didn't agree with th author putting all those gay couples in the book.

One brother is prosperous and surrounded by family but is also very nasty and cruel while the other brother is lonely and with little in his life. Then one day the lonely brother finds an unconscious woman on the moors and brings her to his home to bring her back to good health. But for many days she lies motionless and the man is broken hearted. After he emotionally breaks down and leaves his home, the maiden does awake. She explains to the shepherd's three faithful dogs that they must help her to return to where she belongs and in turn will help the shepherd find true love and wealth. After the maiden is transformed into a beautiful swan she sees to it that both of the brothers get what they deserve. But to find out what each deserved, you will have to read this book.I thought this was a wonderful fairy tale. In addition the illustrations were simply beautiful. I am currently teaching a unit for a 7th grade language arts class on fairytales. I read this book with my class as an example of a fairytale which includes the elements of a fairytale which we discussed in class.I would recommend this for young adults and adults alike."},{"Title":"Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race for Superweapons in a Fragmenting World","review":"Although slightly displaced by developments in Iraq, this book remains of interest and contains a good brief madman portrait of Hussein's atomic bomb attempts, in the context of the greater history of nuclear proliferation since the American opening of Pandora's box, now seen in its consequences a generation later. The brief snapshots of the sordid history are effective, India, Pakistan, China, Israel, the Osirak reactor, to the bit players and their arms merchants and the underworld of financial hoodlums, e.g.BCCI. One is struck by the sheer and immense waste of resources, especially in the case of Hussein, enough money to have turned Iraq into a highly developed nation, instead... Unfortunately the USA had a choice, and made that choice, to use the bomb. Right or wrong? The problem is obvious, noone in the political nuthouse will ever listen again to the dangers of proliferation, in the scramble for national 'safety'."},{"Title":"Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race for Superweapons in a Fragmenting World","review":"The book examines each and every detail about Nuclear Proliferation and regional politics. Nothing however is more thrillling and hair raising than the narrowly averted confrontations between India and Pakistan. Some facts however look unbelievable, like Pakistan's claim that it's planes could have bombarded Indian nuclear centers hundreds of miles away and with number of anti-aircraft batteries on their way! Otherwise its definitely well researched. The authors speak the facts and the hidden meanings behind each explosion or missile launch. For example, they point out why Pakistan was almost branded a Terrorist state by USA after the Afghan war and why India relentlessly pushed forward its missile program. A must read for anybody interested in the future of the world."},{"Title":"Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race for Superweapons in a Fragmenting World","review":"I purchased this book for a former office mate who was an N-weapons designer. A copy of this book (hardcopy) is frequently visible in the background book shelf on the Today show (NBC -- AMs): the hardbound dust jacket has a red stripe on the top and the bottom, a white background middle on the binding with gold lettering for the title. You can't quite read the title, but it is very distinctive behind many Today-show guests.Burrows is only a reporter and bound to get some details wrong, but he has assembled some interesting photos including claimed photos of SA-weapons vaults.

Dale makes no bones about speaking: you can read all the books you want; unless you take EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE - you just won't improve much.I've made a couple of commitments to build my speaking confidence (not directly suggested in the book, but based off of the lessons)... such as (1) using people's names in retail stores (they have name-tags for a reason), (2) making an honest effort to say what's on people's minds (but spin it good-like) when public shenanigans occur, and (3) small talk more in lines, stores, et cetera. So far so good! It's getting easier and easier! I still suck at it, but now I care less about looking a fool and am working on technique!There are some great general take-aways, plans for active speaking, and some little \\"a-ha\\"-esque nuggets that will make this book worth your while... especially if you found for $3 @ Half Priced Books like me. :)The book was finished up by his wife - and a fine job it is.

This book will aid the newbie in becoming a much better speaker - and perhaps take some of the butterflies out of the stomach if that is a problem for the reader.

So forget the age of the book - speaking in the ways of the past is better because in those days, speaking was the TV, Internet, etc, a speaker had to be good or he did not speak - you will find many very good strategies to help make your speech very impactful and persuasive.Two other books that can make your speaking like dynamite are:How To Preach Like A Preacher!: A Complete Training How-To Book For Preaching Like A Pro!Mastering Persuasive Public Speaking: The Influence ApproachSee you on stage!"},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"I never took up any efective speaking book before.

I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first.

This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"This book has 14 chapters of examples and insight into public speeching. The author, who taught public speaking at seminars for 40 years, has learned alot and communicates his ideals well in written form. I really envy those who had a chance to listen to his public speeches. That is the weakest part of this book, which the author admits. It doesn't matter how much you read about speaking, you have to go out and do it, or you can't get better.With that noted, this book does a great job at describing the speaking process. It starts by reviewing &quot;the basics&quot; and then divides his book into the special potential needs of its readers. At its core, this book tries to address the fears of its readers. It appear that public speaking strikes fear into more people, then anything else. If you are scared, you can't think well or express yourself clearly. Thus, if you can conquer your fear, you are on your way to giving a great speech.&quot;Quick&quot; discusses three things to do. First, be prepared. You can't talk intelligently about any topic, if you don't understand it. Second, try to speak to your interests. The more you care about something, the more interesting will be your speech. Third, remember your audience. Even if you love __________ (fill in the blank), you need to understand that your audience may not. Since, no speech is effective if you lose your audience, you have to remember their needs.The other thing &quot;Quick&quot; does is give you good tips. Don't try to use them all at once. My advise, pick the one, or two you like the best and work on them. Once you perfect them, or decide you don't like them, try something else. For example, I like &quot;Quick's&quot; suggestions of using names when you tell a story. &quot;Imagine a hero with no name&quot; who would remember him? Well, if you want to use an example with people, give them names, it makes it easier for your audience to relate to them.This is this book's strongest foundation, the colorful examples and the author ability to relate to his readers through them. He quotes famous people like Lincoln and Julius Ceaser repeatedly. He also cites more ordinary people to show how real people have good insights into life.Overall, the examples and the organization are interesting and add to its strength. &quot;Quick&quot; is a good book, a good &quot;primer&quot; for new speakers. I don't think more experienced speakers will enjoy it as much, but there is enough here to please most people who want to improve their speaking skill, novice or expert."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"The book has been reworked so may times and improved by the experiences of the Dale Carnegie Organization. That is what makes this book so good. This last revision by Dorothy Carnegie based on Mr. Carnegie's notes and plans is benefited by a strong editorial approach. The most important persistent advise is to talk about things you care about and are extremely knowledgeable about. Be excited about the subject or pick a new topic. Find every opportunity to speak and prepare for each one as a major opportunity. It tells how to limit your subject so that you have time to fill in the details that make it a winning talk. It guides you on how to personalize the speech and use words that have impact. The easy introduction to the methods of studying and understanding your audience are very important. It makes a good start on the field of audience participation. This book provides excellent advise on rehearsal.This book along with every other speaking book drives home the point that there is no such thing as a good impromptu talk unless you were very lucky. In reality you work on subjects and material with a plan to use it at some future time. When you are speaking there are many things to watch. If you speak impromptu on a new subject some thing is going to suffer.Introducing a speaker or presenting an award seems to stimulate reckless behavior much like the cutting desire to hurt people of newscasters. This book explains why this behavior is so short sighted.Having read a Dale Carnegie book decades ago, I put off reading this book for fear it would be full of positive thinking dribble. This book is completely straight forward in style. It is in textbook format, but it is extremely easy too read. The examples of actual students and successful speakers get a little shallow sometimes. The outstanding thumbnail review of each part of the book is very helpful. I have read 21 books on public speaking. Right now this book is my leading candidate for someone that is only interested in reading one book on public speaking. It just happens to be a very low price."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"I've been a member of Toastmasters Clubs and been trained in all the &quot;fundamentals of speaking&quot; but I'll tell you something: Carnegie's three fundamental principles are all you need. He's the only speaking teacher I've ever read who points out that all the superficial effects, like your voice quality and your gestures and whether you say UM or not, these aren't important. What really matters is that you're speaking about something you really believe and really want to say to this group, and something that you REALLY know, either from experience or intense study.If you only speak on those topics, all the superficial stuff works out. You communicate. And you'll feel comfortable doing it. Carnegie's three fundamentals are the most important you'll ever encounter on speaking.I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on the subject, and I'm telling you if you want to help yourself to better speaking skills, study and practice the principles in this book and forget the superficials."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"Before I joined Toastmaster International about year ago, I always wanted to speak better in public. Now I am a member of Toastmasters Club, I find this book very helpful whenever I give speeches at our meetings.The nice thing about this book is that it is full of practical and proven techniques and fundermentals of communicantion and speaking. No elaborate theories, just plain simple but extremely effective ways of preparing talks, short or long, what audience likes to hear about, how to give attention getting openings and closings in your speeches among others.All these ideas I put them to work right away in every speech. How many times can you read something and use it on the same day?I strongly recommend this book to everyone not just for public speaking, but for daily interaction between people, jobs and social occasions."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"I read this book back in 1972 and it had been around for many years then. It is simply the finest single book I've read on public speaking, and for several years I made my living on the platform. I've suggested it to many people over the years and have never heard anything but compliments.Someone wrote a negative and mean spirited review of this book, even suggesting it was written by someone else after Mr. Carnegie passed away. What garbage. To give himself creditability he indicated he was a college professor. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't but I also teach at a university and I felt compelled to write this.Despite what this person says, Dale Carnegie's book on speaking has been in print for many years and sold copies in the millions. This is what I'd call surviving the test of time. The public, by deciding where to spend their money really determines the worth of this book.If anyone is serious about learning to speak in public, I can't think of a better book to suggest."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"As a member of Toastmasters I have access to a wide variety of materials and seminars on public speaking. However, this one book covered more material in less space and in easier terms than all the seminars I've attended. His style is not that of a college textbook - if it were I wouldn't have read it. His style is straight from the hip. I consider this book to be my textbook, with Toastmasters providing the chance to practice what I've read. This book has done more to improve my speeches than the formal Toastmaster's evaluations."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"If you have never gotten up and spoken in front of a group before or if you have spent years on the lecture circuit, Carnegie guide on speaking will help you and improve your speaking skills.Carnegie lays out the ground work starting with the fundamentals of speaking such as effective ways on keeping and holding your audiences attention and then moves more into detail in giving the tips and tricks of how to handle different areas such as introductions, presenting awards, and the ever abundant fundraising and call to action speeches.What makes the book really interesting is all the stories he provides from his years of experience in teaching these classes. These tales put into example points he is trying to make in his work.Overall, Carnegie work is effective in it's approach, easy to read and follow and highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"You can rarely go wrong if you follow this rule of thumb: If it's by Dale Carnegie, then it's going to be well worth reading. 'The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking' is no exception!To be honest, though, the title probably doesn't do the book justice, because while being an effective and very marketable title, if fear of public speaking had a 'quick and easy' solution, there wouldn't be so many folk out there still fretting about it.That said, if you want a beginner's guide that startes out by covering the fundamentals in a clear and user-friedly way, then you wouldn't be making a bad choice if you opted to read this.'The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking' covers the basic speaking process, dealing with the fear of public speaking, which, if we are honest, is THE key element that leaves us tongue-tied or backing away in dread, which in turn, is bound to affect the quality of our speech, no matter how well prepared we are in other ways.On choosing a topic for the speech, Dale gives us refreshingly realistic advice - to choose a topic that we already love and know a lot about as a basis for a speech, but to be aware that it may not be your audience's choice.All in all, you're in good hands. Dale draws upon his vast experiences as a speaker himself, and a teacher of public speaking to help the reader understand the process. He also draws upon the public speaking abilities of great men in history, such as Abraham Lincoln.Recommended."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"Dale Carnegie discusses several aspects of effective speaking:1. Keep your goal before you, visualize success, and seize every opportunity to practice.2. Prepare well and be confident.3. Speak on a topic that you have expertise in and are passionate about.4. Limit the scope of your talk, know 10X what you put on slides, and fill talk with illustrations and examples.5. Talk to your listeners' interests, give honest and sincere appreciation, empathize with audience, make them a partner in your talk, be modest.6. For short talks, give an example / incident from your life (70%), state your point and action desired from audience, and the benefit that the audience may expect.7. For informational talks compare strange with familiar.8. For impromptu talks, get into an example immediately, speak with animation / enthusiasm.9. Converse with your audience, specific details helpNumerous examples reinforce the above notes. Useful and easy to apply."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's \\"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking\\" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more.

The easy five-step program will show you how to be a powerful and effective speaker."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"Dale Carnegie, most known for his masterpiece \\"How to Win Friends & Influence People\\" produces a compelling and articulate work with The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking.Carnegie has the writing skill to convey the obvious in a manner that leaves one asking themselves why they had never put these principles into action in the first place. Many detractors of Carnegie's doctrine have suggested that he merely affirms the obvious; yet the intrigue is buried within the notion that while apparent, few people actually in fact apply these simple principles.Carnegie's standards are derived from countless studies, trials and investigations; thus his premise is sound and proven. He delves into a all encompassing overview of what is needed to fully be an effective public speaker. Each chapter has a mission and covers such topics as confidence, content, reading the audience, and being persuasive.I have no doubt that anyone seeking to improve, perfect, or even start a public speaking endeavor should review the principles outlined in The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking, thus I recommend this book favorably."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"I wasn't planning on giving a speech when I read this book -I just thought it would give me some ideas in case I had to do so in the future. As with Dale Carnegie's other books, \\"The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking\\" presents individual points of advice fattened by entertaining anecdotes and examples from the lives of well-known people and from Carnegie's own experience. As Carnegie himself suggests, the actual advice could be summarized within the space of a few pages (There's a summary at the end of each chapter) but the stories and examples make the the information more digestible. This edition was actually edited and released posthumously by Dale Carnegie's wife. The title is a little misleading because the number one lesson of public speaking to take away from the book is the importance of practice and preparation. There are no shortcuts. Although some of the examples are a little dated, this is still a worthwhile book to read especially if you enjoyed Carnegie's other books."},{"Title":"Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business","review":"I loved this book.

This book seems to be an updated revision of a book on public speaking by Mr. Carnegie which was written long before.

This book would only be useful for someone who has years of public speaking experience. But for someone like me who has no public speaking experience, this book is useless and gets quite boring.

It is a sad reflection that so many of us are seeking something deeper but cannot easily find it. The monotheistic religions of the West have, at times, tried to accommodate gay and lesbian practitioners by becoming more \\"liberal\\", yet these attempts are, in my mind, patchy at best. Fundamentalism is still going strong. There are many Gay Christian organizations working hard to help those so inclined, yet so often, Biblical exegesis seems aimed at making excuses for the intolerance of the Bible and there is still a great ambiguity when it comes to pleasure and the human body. At times it seems that the western religions view of acceptance is homosexuals becoming like heterosexuals.In the Dharmic religions, specifically Hinduism and Buddhism, there has been a long tradition of sexual tolerance. While certainly there has been inroads into these faiths by Puritanism, especially under the British in India, the core traditions remain very sex friendly. This is especially true of the Tantric traditions and those related to Shiva and Shakti. (Shaivism and Shaktism). It is also true that Vedanta and related schools and many branches of Buddhism have a more open approach.At the same time there is little in print for the seeker wanting a Gay spiritual life. While the works of Alain Danielou, a great Shaivite, musician and scholar, who also happened to be gay, offers more theoretical information on sex positive aspects of Hinduism, there is little practical advise.Gay Tantra is a unique book. It is not a text of training in \\"sexual prowess\\" as so often the term Tantra is misused today. It is a guide to a practical spiritual life for the modern gay man. It avoids the new ageism and superficiality of many modern gay spiritual books and expounds an extremely erudite view of traditional Tantra. What is so powerful is that this traditional approach is coupled with a praxis for the modern gay man. The author clearly has had a lifetime of experience in Tantra, Vedanta and the gay community and is able to offer his distilled wisdom for the benefit of the reader.Gay Tantra is intelligent, articulate and erudite. It shows a deep understanding of the core of the mystical traditions of the east and especially those of Tantrism. At the same time it brings with it the experience of a gay male who has worked through the pain of internalized homophobia and the baggage that so many of us must carry. Together these two elements make this one of the most important books on Gay spirituality ever published.As someone who has studied the Tantric traditions, especially Shaivism, for some years. It is a great privilege to find such an author, someone who understands the true nature of the tradition, has a good intelligent grasp of the heritage which he is transmitting and yet also appreciates the unique situation that the modern gay male is in. Schindler is hence able to offer us the voice of an experienced soul who is proud of his sexuality and his body. Gay Tantra is a profoundly practical book that gives us the keys to applying this age-old tradition in the modern world. It is surprisingly comprehensive, extremely well written, insightful and practical. There is an excellent section of exercises and lots of superb advise.For those seeking to appreciate Gay love as a spiritual path this is a profound and moving work."},{"Title":"Gay tantra","review":"\\"Tantra\\" in the west is often interpreted to mean an ecstatic experience with spiritual dimensions. This concise and well written book provides a larger cultural perspective that has been targeted to the needs of gay men. As a westerner, the \\"guru-master\\" element of the spirituality of the subcontinent must always remain foreign to me as a spiritual democrat. This book has been largely shaped by the views of one such 19th century guru.But those heirarchical relationships are authentic to the culture of tantra. Heirarchical relationships are no problem for the gay man whose erotic interests are congruent with the leather/BDSM world, and this world is well represented on the author's Ashram West website. For gays interested in spirituality and/or tantra this book has a lot of value to offer."},{"Title":"Gay tantra","review":"When I got this book, I was concerned that it would be another watered down spiritual book for gay people with it sole aim to make us (gay people) feel better about ourselves. I also thought it may be a narrow, distorted version of tantra that is oh-so-common in the US. I was surprised to find that it was neither. In fact, it is a solid spiritual book aimed at introducing gay people to the powerful spiritual system of tantra. (And no this isn't about sex). Tantra, as it is so thoroughly explained in the book, is about finding the Divine in all aspects of life. It is about divinizing all of life to bring one into conscious awareness of God/Goddess and to attain final liberation. The author directs this book to gay people, but this book is excellent for anyone who wants to understand Tantra philosophy and practice better. As a gay man, this book is a refreshing find in the genre of spiritual books."},{"Title":"Gay tantra","review":"I like the book and it gave me insite, and it was in the shape it was said to be."},{"Title":"A constitutional faith","review":"Mr. Justice Hugo Black will rightly go down in history as one of the &quot;great dissenters&quot;. His views of the incorporation doctrine - that the fourteenth amendment demanded complete incorporation of the bill of rights to the state level - procedural, rather than substantive, due process, and his first amendment absolutism virtually ensured that his opinions would be dissenting ones. Of course, while many of his theories, like incorporation, have long since become legally commonplace, others, like his push for procedural rather than substantive due process, have become even less fashionable today than they were in Black's day.Quite simply this is an immportant book of jurisprudential theory. In a few more than 60 pages, Justice Black lays out his theory of democracy (that courts need to limit themselves to the law's letter so as not to usurp democracy from the people), dual sovereignty (thet whenever possible, the judiciary should not invalidate state legislation, but assume that the people of that state can do so via the democratic process), his views on what is and is not due process, and most importantly, his defence of judicial literalism.Since his defence of literalism (an often overlooked, but very sensical theory) is so important, here is a taste: The founders created a written constitution when they did not have to. They added an amendment process to it. They created a judiciary to interpret the law 'under the constitution'. These three things very easily point to a literalist conclusion. Had the founders wanted judges to read broad principles into the constitution - letting the documents meaning change with changing situations - the founders wouldn't have WRITTEN a constitution, but rather given it a Magna Carta, will o' the wisp, style. Had they wanted an 'evolving constitution', they wouldn't have put a legislative amendment process in (implying that this is the ONLY way to amend the document).Of course, the other main reason for Black's textualism is his observation that as standards of what is just, fair, and right, change from time to time, unelected judges should not concern themselves (at least do so as litle as possible) with them. If judges can re-interpret statutes from year to year based on their own standards of 'reasonableness' or what have us, then, Black argues, what is the point of having a statute at all?But I've digressed - hopefully enough to whet your appetite. In the tradition of Holmes, Cardozo, Frankfurter and otheres, Black gives us a rare oppurtunity to see a justice step out of their robe and let us read through their thoughts on method. This is a truly thrilling book about an overdue judicial philosophy."},{"Title":"A constitutional faith","review":"As controversial as many of his veiws were, Hugo Black is considered one of the staunchest defenders of free speech doctrine, especially as a man who sat on the supreme court through the civil rights era. Although still controversial, his 'absolutism' led him to to write some of the most impassioned defenses of free speech in his well-known dissents. This book is well worth reading as the an expression by one of the greatest justices in history."},{"Title":"The Book of Strangers","review":"I came across this book entirely by chance, and only picked it up because the back cover claimed that it was the &quot;Sufi Siddhartha.&quot; Being already interested in Sufism, my curiosity was piqued. And once having read it, I felt compelled to read it again and again. This is no mere introduction to either Sufism or Islam in a purely intellectual sense, as is so common in Western books on the subject. Still less is it a &quot;novel&quot; intended to amuse. Rather, it is an allegory of one postmodern, Westernized individual's journey into the Islamic Tradition. As such, I found it to be just as powerful as some of the classic allegories and poems written by the great Sufi masters of the medieval period. The plot is very simple: the story is narrated by a young man who works in a University library at some point in the near future. He is appointed to head the library after the disappearance of its former keeper. In this time, libraries are no longer merely buildings which house books, but they have been reduced to processing stations in which computers select and digest materials for scholars and students in such a manner that nothing will distract them from their area of specialization. However, the narrator becomes curious, and begins trying to solve the mystery of the previous librarian's disappearance. He soon comes across the missing man's journal, which contains the story of his growing dissatisfaction with modern life and his interest in ancient mystical writings as a more genuine form of knowledge. Finally, not content to merely read about the mystics of old, the vanished librarian ends his journal by confessing that he is journeying to the &quot;desert lands&quot; in search of living mystics from whom he can learn. The narrator very soon decides to travel in his footsteps, and departs for an unnamed location (most likely North Africa) to see what he can find out. The rest of the story details his gradual journey, first into Islam, and then into Sufism (Islam's mystical heart), after which he changes irrevocably. The book is interesting not so much for its plot but, as in any good allegory, for the record of a man's thoughts as he undergoes an inner transformation.While I have read many books on Islam and Sufism, I have not encountered another work quite like this one. Most books on Islam intended for Westerners pander to modern beliefs and prejudices, treating it either as a relic of the past requiring modernization or as a threatening political force. This book treats Islam not as an intellectual or historical abstraction, but rather details the thoughts of a man, initially utterly submerged in the lies and half-truths upon which modern Western society is based, as he abandons his prejudices and comes into contact with the genuine reality offered by spirituality.A brief, biographical note on the author is warranted. Ian Dallas was a Scotsman who travelled to Morocco during the 1960s and became involved with the Shadhili Sufi Order of the highly respected Shaykh Al-'Arabi Ad-Darqawi. After reverting to Islam and studying with the Shaykh for several years (the same period during which he wrote &quot;The Book of Strangers&quot;), the Shaykh appointed Ian Dallas as his successor. To this day, Dallas continues to lead his Order as Shaykh Abdalqadir, and has written many books on the subject of Islam under this name (although he has written a few other works under his original name). Thus, Dallas was uniquely qualified to write this book as a record of how a Westerner can come to understand Islam from within, rather than as an outsider. As such, it is a unique bridge between the modern world of deceit and the timeless, Traditional world of the spirit. If you have any interest at all in Islam, Sufism or any spiritual Tradition as something to be experienced rather than as a mere intellectual abstraction, I highly recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"The Book of Strangers","review":"I read the Turkish translation of The Book of Strangers twenty years ago.

Six meditations deal respectively of the hero as: Divinity, Prophet, Poet, Priest, Man of Letters, and King. If this book can't rightly be shelved with philosophy or history, it belongs in Literature with a capital &quot;L,&quot; and Poetry. Carlylye loved the English Language and used it masterfully, energetically, and reverentially, without a trace of the trivial overindulgence of self-conscious and self-absorbed &quot;poets.&quot;"},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship, and the heroic in history, (The Riverside literature series)","review":"Six lectures delivered by Carlyle in 1840. He classifies six kinds of heroes: as Divinity (Wotan, paganism); Prophet (Mohamed); Poet (Dante, Shakespeare); Priest (Luther, Knox); Man of Letters (Johnson, Rousseau, Burns); and Ruler (Cromwell, Napoleon). The trait that defines a hero is: absolute sincerity and firm belief in his principles.In his highly rhetorical lectures, Carlyle highlights and reinforces the role of the individual in the social process, as opposed to the role of the masses. And he did that precisely when the foundations were being laid for the most influential &quot;pro-mass&quot; movement in History: Marxism. The tragedy of Marxism, at least one of them all, is that, when translated into action, the blind masses were also led by &quot;heroes&quot; of the most authocratic sort. Not properly the work of an historian, these lectures are vivid, inflamed and enthusiast. Their uselfuness for our present age is precisely that they remind us of the crucial role significant individuals play in history, to accelerate or slow down (and even reverse) the process of social change, which is usually more gradual, diffused, and diverse."},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship, and the heroic in history, (The Riverside literature series)","review":"This is an extraordinary work, let modern liberal critics say what they will of their 'mass movements' and 'diversity'. Long after they and their productions have bitten the dust, Carlyle will continue to speak to the enlightened few, and perhaps one day, it is to be hoped, to the enlightened many.This work is much more than just a study of various influential men in history. Carlyle has very interesting notions of the historical process itself, the spread of religions and their demise, the importance of \\"true belief\\" in things, as opposed the unbelief that merely follows rituals and procedures. For Carlyle, true belief, is the beginning of morality, all success, all good things in this world; Unbelief, scepticism, the beginning of all corruption, quackery, falsehood.Unbelief, for instance, is at the root of all materialist philosophies, eg Utilitarianism which find human beings to be nothing more than clever, pleasure-seeking bipeds. It is also at the root of all democratic theories: faith in a democratic system means despair of finding an honest man to lead us.Whether one agrees with Carlyle or not in his appraisal of democratic and other systems, one must admit, at least, that very little good is to be gotten from \\"the checking and balancing of greedy knaveries.\\" If we have no honest men in government or in business, but only a bunch of self-interested quacks, then we cannot expect any system, however ingenious, to save us. Even the most skilled architect will not be able to construct a great building, if you give him only hollow, cracked bricks to build it with. Find your honest men, says Carlyle, and get them into the positions of influence; only then will it be well with you."},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship, and the heroic in history, (The Riverside literature series)","review":"There are not many books sold at Amazon.com that were written almost two centuries ago. There might be a few written a few millenniums ago but they are mostly translations. There is something special when one reads the spoken word untranslated. Only in its original form, words have the mysterious effect that let the reader have a special connection with the author.Carlyle was Scottish and lived in England, but he had close relations with the \\"New World\\" and had readers in United States. He had a lifelong friendship with an influential American Philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson. At his time, there were not many philosophers who witnessed the industrial revolution but still kept a transcendental and not a materialistic view of the world. In the 19th century, Materialism was in full swing, and the people in the West were mesmerized by the scientific technological advances of the times and running away from God like herds of cattle, just like the way intellectuals of the East did a century later. Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau and a few others were the only exceptions in the West that still tried to keep what is beyond the \\"apparent\\" in focus or at least in search of it. Bediuzzaman tried to do the same with the voice of Qur'an and called the people to what is beyond the apparent in the face of materialism in the East in the 20th century. One interesting observation I have to point out, is that one common theme among these Western Philosophers; many were all influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, famous 18th century Swedish PhilosopherIn Heroes and Hero Worship Thomas Carlyle makes an attempt to draw a picture of the development of human intellect by using historical people as coordinates. There are people who has a perspective of history in terms of \\"environment\\" and \\"times\\" and \\"causes\\" while others like Carlyle has the view that human advancement was not continues but discrete and these jumps were mainly due to specific individuals he calls \\"Heroes\\". This is like the wave - particle duality of the \\"nature of light\\". In some phenomenon Light behaves like a wave in others like a particle. One can write a history based on ideas, cultures and mediums in which people lived, or the same history could be written by taking certain individuals and following them and their actions.Writings of many other authors of that time and Carlyle's of course are very perceptive. Carlyle does not really care to be objective on the matter. He has an idea and he wants to tell you that idea and when telling you what that idea is, he uses whatever his hands and mind get hold of. Being so passionate about what you are telling is probably a good thing. But if one overdoes it, one cannot help but show wild swings in appreciation of the historical person in question. If we use the drawing analogy, his historical person becomes no longer a point on the painting but a thread on the brush. But that should not prevent us from benefiting from his writings.Muhammad (PBUH) has a special place in the book under the chapter title \\"Hero as a Prophet\\". In the book Carlyle declares his admiration of Muhammad (PBUH). Carlyle's answers to pointed questions on Islam and Muhammad (PBUH) showed interesting similarities to Bediuzzaman's line of answers to similar questions. ......Considering the fact that while the West and East were at odds and the means of communications were quite inferior to our times, seeing Carlyle having such an open mind to the \\"other\\" puts him in a category of his own with others like Swedenborg, Emerson and Thoreau. I think when we are trying to build bridges between the peoples of the West and the East we should not overlook these early historical representatives of that dialogue, as Bediuzzaman foresees in his writings."},{"Title":"The Lewis and Clark Companion: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Voyage of Discovery","review":"Stephenie Ambrose Tubbs and Clay Jenkinson have joined forces to produce the definitive text for Lewis and Clark readers to keep in one hand while they read through the many books available on the epic expedition.

The myth of the lady is immense, but Bradford goes right to primary sources and does his best to correct our misapprehensions about her by pointing out that we know so little first hand about Cleopatra. Some dispute she existed. Bradford makes no such claim, and he is in a position to know, having spent many years immersed in the lore of the Ptolemies.Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolemy the XIIth, and I imagine now that I have read Bradford describing their relationship, that he, Ptolemy, was rather like Emma's father in the famous novel by Jane Austen. He was a garrulous old fool in love with the sound of his own voice, rather pathetic if you looked at him the wrong way, and his daughter probably learned a lot about diplomacy just trying to stay on his good side, just like Emma 1700 years later. And like Emma, part of her problem was that the tools she had used to deal with a difficult father were not as appropriate when it came time to deal with the adult men in her life. Emma had Mr. Knightley, but Cleopatra had real rulers to deal with: first Caesar, the playboy prince of the Western world, a man so civilized that he was said to have been bisexual, and then Antony, who was more of a man's man, sort of an Ernest Borgnine type according to Ernle Bradford's clever summing up of the man. Cleopatra had children by both of them, but neither of them could totally trust her, just as her father could not bring himself to be close to her, preferring to play merrily on his flute all day while slaves fanned him with ibis feathers.At eighteen she was already a queen, and as we know, her life was short, tragically short. Many who knew her from afar judged her harshly, but those who came close to her were enchanted by her beauty and the elegance of her speech. (Bradford reports that her verbal agility was high, and that she picked up languages with ease.) We know she had a sense of humor, for who else would have thought about rolling herself up in a carpet to be delivered to Caesar? So vividly does Bradford bring these movers and shakers to life that by book's end we forget they are not our own intimates. As Shakespeare said, \\"Precious friend, hid in death's dateless night.\\" And that's where she is now, hid in death's dateless night where she gains not in age nor loses a drop of her mortal beauty."},{"Title":"Success Strategies for African-Americans: A Guide to Personal and Professional Achievement","review":"I found the book dynamic, self-motivating, encouraging and the profiles interesting.

It includes some excellent essays on Chuang-tzu, a &quot;Taoist,&quot; and one of the greatest philosophers and literary stylists in Chinese history.Chuang-tzu is perhaps best known for his anecdote of how he dreamed that he was a butterfly and awoke from the dream, unsure of whether he was a man who had dreamed that he was a butterfly, or a butterfly who was now dreaming that he was a man. Also famous is his story of the butcher whose skillful dismembering of an ox is, surprisingly, a model for how we should lead our lives.Chuang-tzu is always a delight to read, but it is also a great challenge to try to figure out what he is trying to communicate to us (if anything!). The essays in this anthology are &quot;experimental&quot; in that they explore the writings of Chuang-tzu from a variety of perspectives. Especially worthy of note are the essays by A.C Graham, Chad Hansen, and Lee Yearley. Graham argues that Chuang-tzu gives us a way for dealing with the troubling gap between &quot;is&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; (between the way things are and the way they ought to be). Hansen argues that Chuang-tzu is a relativist, for whom there is no objective truth. Yearley suggests that we see two different images of the &quot;perfected person&quot; in Chuang-tzu. One is a person who is much like the rest of us, except that she takes less seriously the commitments that make most of us so prone to suffering. The more radical vision is that of a strange, alien sage, who could look on the death of his own wife as an interesting aspect of the great spectacle of change. The other essays in this collection offer many other interesting suggestions and perspectives.Good translations of the writings of Chuang-tzu (also written &quot;Chuang Tzu&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;) include those by Burton Watson (who wrote the Foreward to this anthology) and Victor Mair. Another excellent (and more recent) anthology of essays on Chuang-tzu was edited by Philip J. Ivanhoe and Paul Kjellberg."},{"Title":"Experimental Essays on Chuang-Tzu (Asian Studies at Hawaii)","review":"On Realities Too Mundane For CritiqueAs Mr. Van Norden has it, this is one of the finer anthologies available for an Asian thinker and actually gives us a quite radically different picture of the major Taoist, and the intellectual movement as a whole, than we are used to. A.C. Graham's book *Disputers of the Tao* offers a brisk history of ancient Chinese thought which presents it as by turns dynamic and agreeably skeptical; but here Hawaii treats us to a \\"present history\\" of Chuang-tzu which makes the gnomic aphorisms we are familiar with less than *idealites*. The early Taoists were less about endurance races and more about the already-crushing cultural *staseis* of the Middle Kingdom, and \\"the Chuang-tzu\\" (rather than its more famous counterpart) contains observations on epistemology and moral-psychology to rival Plato in their evident richness; and here we have interpretations matching contemporary work on Hellenic antiquity in their contemporaneity and philological scruple: nearly all of the contributors are rather serious Siniticists (and although editor Mair's inexpensive translation of the entire Chuang-tzu, including apocrypha, is recommended as well this is no mean distinction).Would that we had a greater variety of thinkers available in such a format, i.e. accessible to us as figures with an \\"unhistorical\\" bearing on the present."},{"Title":"The Design of Experiments","review":"All modern work in design and analysis of experiments traces its roots back to this 1920 classic.

Yes, as one reviewer said, it's not for the math-phobic, but this is the kind of book which makes it worth it to see your analyst or whatever it takes to get over your phobia. It's definitely worth the work, and even without the math, you'll get a lot out of it. I wish Amazon would find a photo of the original cover. It's a beautiful magic square, which figures heavily in the design of experiments. I'll try to find my copy and create a photo.An Introduction to General Systems Thinkingis a good supplement, and may help to overcome that math-phobia."},{"Title":"War in the modern world (Collier books)","review":"I read this book in 1970 and was astounded. I was teaching a course in military history to an advanced military officer course. Everyone was very appreciative of Ropp's work and even 34 years later it sticks in my mind as seminal."},{"Title":"War in the modern world (Collier books)","review":"The author tells us that this book is the result of 20 years of teaching naval and military history. It is written for both civilians and the military because the scope of the study covers both. Unlike traditional war books that are operational histories; that is, a blow by blow account of what happened on the battlefield, this is a broader look at war from a political, economic and societal point of view. The author states, \\"Campaigns and battles are used only to illustrate general trends.\\"The first 75 pages (in Collier paperback revised edition) surveys western land and naval warfare from 1415 to 1789. The remaining 300 plus pages is from the French Revolution to the end of the Second World War. The emphasis is on Anglo-American concepts of sea, land and air war. The footnotes are frequently bibliographic references to further studies, many of them military classics. This book stands on its own with original scholarship, yet also guides the reader to sources that inspired the author. A great teacher cannot do any more than that.To give one a sense of the book, let us look at the last chapter on the Second World War. Emphasis is on the larger strategic issues such as defeating Germany first and the plan to defeat Japan. The movement of the war is covered in broad strokes. Politicians and military leaders appear briefly in the context of the story, rather than being the story. The contents of the last chapter are:The Second World WarThe opening battlesBritain, the Mediterranean, and the AtlanticThe Russo-German WarAllied Deployment: Decision in Western EuropeThe East Asian and Pacific Wars:The Japanese raidThe Allied Counterattack in the PacificThe war for East Asia"},{"Title":"War in the modern world (Collier books)","review":"Ropp pretty much initiated the establishment of military history as an academic pursuit (even if to the chagrin of radicals). Although published in 1959, it has stood the test of time.

For those of you who aren't familiar with it, the CPA exam is one of the most gruling professional certification exams. I read Shanahan's book to motivate and inspire me to do all that I could to pass the exam before I begin to study.One phrase in his book sticks out in my mind:Preparation + Desire + Work Ethic = LuckI read this quote evey morning before work and every time I start my study. I have this on my review materials and I remember it as I prepare.I am a huge fan of the Denver Broncos and of Shanahan. Later this year when I pass the exam I will send him a letter thanking him for the motivation."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"I have bought many copies of this book, because if you let a teen read it, it does not come back. All the examples stem from Shanahan's football career, but the book is about building character.It has the great advantage of not being preachy, One kid summarized for me the influence of this book; he said: \\"I never understood before that it is not about winning the game on Sunday, it is about winning the whole year!\\""},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"This is a great book. I had originally bought it so I could write a term paper for a Coaching class I'm taking. But I had no idea Shanahan was so accomplished.

Watch out NFL! haha!"},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"This is a good and quick read.Shanahan is one of the few NFL coaches in history who has won 2 Superbowls straight - that is a massive achievement.In this book, he discusses how to succeed in life using simple but effective values.What is interesting is the dirt that he dishes on a couple of NFL personalities.A good read, interesting for what he says and something that you do learn from."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"Mike Shanahan shows how people can learn from mistakes, be flexible, and organize a team (business or sports).Much can be learned from this book and help one form good habits for success."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"In review of the autobiography I read, Think Like a Champion: Building Success One Victory at a Time by Mike Shanahan, I learned a great deal about succeeding on the football field. But more importantly, I learned about succeeding in life.The book begins with Shanahan in college at Eastern Illinois University. Shanahan played quarterback on the Eastern Illinois football team and was routinely tackled during games. However, after being fiercely tackled during one particular game, Shanahan was rushed to the emergency room. Within hours Shanahan had undergone surgery to remove a badly ruptured kidney, and was soon told he could never play football again.Wanting to remain close to the game he loved, Shanahan decided to try his hand at coaching. His first coaching stop was in Oklahoma as a part-time assistant coach for the University of Oklahoma Sooners. That year the Sooners won the National College Football Championship, and Shanahan was soon offered coaching jobs at other universities. He was an assistant coach at his alma mater, Eastern Illinois University, and at the University of Florida before moving to the professional ranks. As a professional football coach, Shanahan coached teams like the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos. Under Shanahan's direction, both of these teams won Super Bowl Championships.Throughout the book, Shanahan states that he has learned something from every step he has taken in his coaching career. He notes that coaching football was not what he had wanted to do with his life; he wanted to play the game. But he acknowledges that he would probably never have made the pros as a player and would never have had the opportunities he had experienced as a coach.In the book, Shanahan identifies a few key things he says are critical for success on and off the football field; preparing, sacrificing, competing, and persevering. Without any one of these items, success would not be possible. Shanahan also says that life may take you a direction you weren't planning to go, but that it is important to do your best, no matter what life has to offer.After reading this book, I have a new perspective on coaching, and a new outlook on life. Hearing that perspective shared by a future Hall of Fame candidate, like Mike Shanahan, makes it even more powerful. Think Like a Champion: Building Success One Victory at a Time was more than a book about coaching the game of football. It was about being in, and succeeding at the game of life."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"Straight-forward, crisply articulated and with practically no unnecessary fluff, Mike Shanahan's book, &quot;Think Like a Champion,&quot; compellingly argues that the game of life is basically won or lost before the &quot;players&quot; take the field. Shanahan asserts his point of view over sixteen easy-to-digest chapters (each about ten pages or less) on the diffent tenets of becoming the best at what you do.What I liked about this book is that while the author culls specific examples from his football career, the &quot;moral of the story&quot; is clearly applicable to ANYONE seeking to become the best in any endeavor. Offering an excellent, enjoyable read to both sports enthusiasts and non enthusiasts alike, the author's writing style is to neither excessively arm-wave nor make unsupported generalizations.In fact, part of the Shanahan's credibility here is in his willingness to name names when providing examples of people living up to a credo espoused in a given chapter or more dramatically, falling short.Written with humility, Shanahan's book leaves the reader feeling that there is nothing magical to becoming a huge success -- other than having a plan and putting in the blood, sweat and tears required to make that plan a success. Or as the author concludes, citing legendary coach Vince Lobardi, &quot;Your quality of life is in direct proportion to your commitment to excellence.&quot; So true."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"I have heard this advice before: If you want to be successfulat something, find the most successful person you can in that area, listen to what they say, and try to follow it. Well, its hard to imagine a football coach more sucessful than Mike Shanahan. Here's a guy who started with a dream: to be a head football coach, started as an unpaid volunteer for a college team, and worked his way to be one of the best, most respected, coaches in the NFL (winning 2 consecutive Superbowls) at a young age.The great thing is, he has written a book that is designed to help people win beyond football, in any area of life. Shanahan breaks it down for you: the way he prepares, some struggles he's had, some ways he motivates people (including the little things that we learn are so critical), very good wisdom concerning life, and a lot more. Also very critical is the fact that this book is very easy to read and understand.You even get a bonus section in each chapter written by some of the greatest people and minds in football: Paul Tagliabue, Jerry Rice, Bill Walsh, John Elway, Deion Sanders, Steve Young, George Seifert, Joe Montana, Marcus Allen, Al Michaels, and more. They give their own take on the subject being discussed in the chapter, which is not only informative, but like the book itself, filled with wisdom.The chapters consist of 16 basic areas to focus on to become successful, things like: Preparing (all of life is preparation, and not preparing is preparing to fail), Sacrificing (don't expect to get anything good done without sacrifice, if it was easy, everyone would do it), Learning (without learning, you will be hopelessly stuck where you are), Detailing (the devil is definitely in the details and that's where things often break down). This is just a taste of the wisdom in this book. Highly recommended for people looking to improve themselves."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"A die-hard Broncos fan from the days dying watching those ridiculous striped socks and watching Fran Tripuka get killed, what a job Shanahan did turning it around into two Super Bowls in a row.Learning of his background and his principles makes me now not only a more avid Bronco fan, but also a Shanahan fan as well. His perseverance from the days of his kidney injury to how he became part of Sooner coaching staff till today is truly one of principles of success through hard work, not gifts or who you know or any of the other myths most people who never get anywhere fall for and are unmotivated. Most of them just don't ever want to work hard at anything, but have it handed to them. Shanahan disproves all that bunk and shows how it came to be. Unbelievable that when given the Raiders head-job, didn't even have the downpayment for a house.This guy is very endearing to so many of us who never had the backgrounds for those connections, but wanting something bad enough, and always believing it, achieve it one goal at a time.Great advice, especially appreciate his concern for balance.Excellent read. Thanks, Mike, from a new fan and admirer."},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"I read the entire book in a matter of hours. It simply is a great handbook for looking at life, and realizing a plan for achieving success, no matter what your chosen field of endeavor. Whether or not you are a football fan, anyone who has had something to shoot for can benefit from reading this book. What he has to say certainly is nothing new, but the level of motivation and honesty that he brings to the table is what makes the book stand out. Through his personal anecdotes, you get to know and respect the man, and hence, his message. Highly recommended. My only regret is that Mike Shanahan was fired after only such a short time as head coach for my favorite team, the Oakland [then Los Angeles] Raiders!"},{"Title":"Think Like A Champion : Building Success One Victory at a Time","review":"I bought this book thinking it was going to be like every other coach's book I've read. I was wrong. This book provides powerful insight to winning and success that others have failed to deliver. I had the book in my hands for three hours total before I was done.

But this book is mainly written for the beginning undergraduate for stress and strain analyis. It is by far one of the handiest and most well written books on the subject that I have come across. If you want fatigue life buy a Shigley book. If you want the basic understanding, Timoshenko is wonderful."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Materials","review":"I know that this is considered THE mechanics of materials textbook. And paging through it, you can see that the text and figures are very well done, with every effort made to make the material clearly accessible. So in this respect, the book shines. My main objection with this text is its content. Every imaginable method of beam analysis is presented, and the tendency is to treat every stress problem as some sort of beam. Thus if you're a civil engineer designing beams, you'll probably like this book. But if you are a mechanical engineer, responsible for designing mating parts with complex geometries, you'll be sorrily disappointed. Mechanical parts in the real world are not prismatic beams, perfect cylinders, and other utopian forms. They have threads, fillets, holes and other discontinuities that produce stress concentrations -- stress concentrations that have devastating effects in fatigue if not properly accounted for. I know that some will say \\"Hey, if you want fatigue analysis, get a Machine Design text\\". But come on, let's be realistic. Many undergrad students will never go on to take such a course, and the fact that well over 90% of real world failures are fatigue failures necessitates that more than 10 pages out of 900 be dedicated to this subject. Also, there is little if any coverage on 3-dimensional stress, plate and shell theory, plasticity, tensors, and a ton of other stuff that is not overly complex, but is used everywhere in the real world. I don't care how \\"elementary\\" the book claims to be. If it's over 900 pages, it should cover these important topics. Maybe someday we'll have more practicing engineers writing textbooks -- textbooks that treat real life problems, rather than fictional, academic idealizations."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Materials","review":"Have used this book as a resource for many classes. All of my professors said this is \\"The Book\\" for basic Mechanics, and I would agree with them.Granted, Fatigue, Failure are Buckling analysis are fairly limited. Other advanced topics such as vibrations, FEM and plate theory are not covered. That's because this is a fundamental text, but don't let that fool you. The depth covered and the clarity of presentation is amazing for a Mechanics textbook.If your looking for more complex analysis, get one of Timoshenko's books (the father of modern mechanics). Really, this book is primarily Timoshenko's work, Gere helps make it understandable. For the FEM, a good book is a difficult find.This is the best selling Mechanics book for a reason. There has only been minor changes since the original Timoshenko-Gere 1972 version. If your professor does not use this book, he has not been teaching long enough."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Materials","review":"This is one of the best books for getting started on even tough concepts.

I found the book fairly easy to follow with good example problems. My main complaint is that the authors consistantly referred to diagrams and figures that were on different pages, causing the reader to flip back and forth. Sometimes the figures were 5 or 6 pages back. This interrupted the continuity of the text, making it more difficult to read. Otherwise, I feel the book is excellent.

I enjoy reading to my students and No Easy Answers proved to be one of the most powerful collections of short stories that I have ever read. My students loved it, and many of them chose to read it on their own. These stories are not only well written and representative of the diveristy of our country, but also pertinent to the tough issues--teenage pregnancy, first love, lonliness, parent-child relationships and homosexuality--that are confronting our children today. If you are a parent, teen, or teacher who is looking for a book that makes you think and confront these types of issues then this is definately the book for you. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"NO EASY ANSWERS","review":"Given the recent trend toward violence with teenagers, this book provides a powerful discussion piece in the middle school classroom. The stories in this collection all have characters who face difficult moral delimmas. This can spark many classroom activities where students determine the best course of action. This gets young adults talking about character, taking responsiblity, and choosing the right path. Furthermore, the high interest level of the stories hook even the most reluctant of readers! It was hard for anyone in the room to put down."},{"Title":"NO EASY ANSWERS","review":"This collection of short stories does indeed bring to light various moral dilemmas. However, the content is highly inappropriate for middle school students because of the graphic references to voyeurism, \\"penile enlargement\\", and other sexual content. There is no doubt that kids at this age may be exposed to some of this- but not to the extent of the descriptions in these stories. The stories will make students very uncomfortable and not because of the dilemmas so much as these references; parents will definitely oppose this as well. My suggestion is read the book first before selecting it for this age group."},{"Title":"NO EASY ANSWERS","review":"I read this book in less than a day. The stories were really realistic, and they're things that real teenagers face in everyday life. All the stories are by different authors, and I liked how they put a mini-bio after each of the stories to tell about that author's most famous books that had won the most prizes, etc. It helped, because if there was a story I really liked, then I could get the book with the longer version (most of the stories came from a book the author had written). It was an awesome book."},{"Title":"NO EASY ANSWERS","review":"This book is fantastic. OUr school library got it and I thought that I would give it a try. It was amazing.

Internet has altered the landscape, and time's they're always changin', but the heart of the hunt remains, at it's core, the same. Here a book-scout/dealer shares his insights, anecdotes, and tall-tales, to the delight of all of us bibliophile internet booksellers of the New Millenium! An extra bonus is that the writer is not only a knowledgeable bookman, but also a historical specialist in Americana - There's a little myth-debunking mixed into the recipe, to add a little flavor ala LIES MY TEACHER TOLD ME (by historian Loewen)! A classic that should be added to the Required Reading list for all new booksellers!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of a Treasure Hunter","review":"This book is an ode to an era as well as to an occupation. As it was written originally in the early 1950's it tells the stories of an age before you could look online to find rare books, back when a search might take months or years. Since this all takes place well before the Internet age much of the book talks about his dealings with the people as well as the books, and history.This book isn't like most books of this genre where the book starts early in the author's life and ends near the publishing time. With over 60 years in the book business he's got too much to talk about, to waste time building up his life history. He pretty much gives a quick summary of his first transaction and from there lets his mind wander.A marvelous book that ended all too soon for me."},{"Title":"The Adventures of a Treasure Hunter","review":"I love books about books and book dealers. And after the glowing reader reviews here, I had to order this book. But I practically had to force myself to finish it.It seems to be nothing more than a collection of unconnected war stories, most of them meant to show how much smarter Everitt was than the rest of humanity. It is very dated and his comments about minorities are jarring, even taking into consideration that he lived in a different time.Everitt clearly prided himself on being a cantankerous old grouch and after 265 pages, frankly I was glad to be rid of him."},{"Title":"The Adventures of a Treasure Hunter","review":"This is by far my favorite book about book collecting and bibliophiles!Written like my crotchety Grandpa Tony used to tell me war stories over a pot of coffee, I was captivated by the \\"good old days\\" of book scouting/dealing when a person could knock on a door and ask if they had old books for sale. Everitt used this and many other tactics to find treasures that otherwise may have been lost to history.Rather than a beginning to end story, it is a series of antic dotes in his buying and selling books, documents, and ephemera. Some of the treasures include an original pencil sketch of the Idaho state seal (that the State of Idaho was not interested in buying), Bay Psalm Book (first book published in North America), various Lincoln letters, and all types of obscure early Americana. As a person interested in Americana, the description of the countless treasures was half the joy and several of the items were added to my personal wish list.The book is a collection of stories within three topical sections: Americana - What and So What, The Customers, and The Trade. The stories, however, do not have the expected beginning, middle and end. Rather, they are the kind of ramblings that I had come to expect from Grandpa Tony where he begins talking about Joe, throws a few adventures in the middle, and ends the story talking about Henry as if the story had been about Henry the whole time. Far from a negative, it keeps the reader on the edge of their seat and afraid to get up for a second or third cup of coffee for fear of missing something. In fact, you certainly will."},{"Title":"Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature (Compendia Rerum Iudicarum Ad Novum Testamentum) (Vol 2)","review":"If you are interested in the origins of Jewish and Christian iconography, or in the way in which early Christians like Origen and Eusebius understood Jewish histories, then you will enjoy reading this richly illustrated book. I will quote from the jacket:\\"The Jewish ancestry of Christianity is not merely a matter of religious sentiment but the object of scholarly research. One of the aims of this series is to analyse how Jewish cultural elements were assimilated by and adopted to the needs of the arising new religion. The present volume contains two seperate studies. Schrekenberg shows how successive Christian authors turned Josephus's description of the fall of Jerusalem into a confirmation of Christian superiority. Next he demonstartes how this view of the Jewish historian and his works appears in medieval Christian illustrations. In another contribution, Schubert discusses the existence of a Jewish pictoral tradition and its influence on early Christian art. Such influence was all the more likely where Christian artists were unaware of potential conflicts of the Jewish iconography with Christian doctrine. This volume is richly illustrated with reproductions of the pertinent works of art.\\"You may also enjoy \\"The Resurrection and the Icon\\" by Quenot."},{"Title":"Ace's SSAT/ISEE Exambusters Study Cards (Ace's Exambusters Study Cards)","review":"This product seems to have been created in someone's garage in 1994. The voice says inane things (\\"uh-oh, better hit the books\\") and has an accent that doesn't inspire confidence in its level of education. This is only superficial, however. The CDROM installs itself clumsily on your PC (didn't install properly on one of mine), and once you open up this behemoth, what do you get? A poorly designed set of flashcards, reminiscent of PowerPoint circa 1997. The \\"test\\" mode (which only has three tests, not unlimited permutations as you would hope from a CDROM) merely shows you a flashcard, invites you to flip it over to check your own answer, and then requires you to click a button to say if you were thinking of the right answer. It's antediluvian. No middle school student could respect this product, nor should they. If these were merely paper flash cards, they would be all right - listing basic math facts so you don't have to write them out for yourself and can spend your time studying.

I was looking for a book that covered the development of ideas in ecology, and how the field advanced to what it is today. It does cover these ideas, but they are difficult to extract from the text. Most of the text goes back and forth on this person or that person, this habitat or that, and does little to synthesize the progress of ecological concepts. Instead of following a general trend of progress in ecology, the author takes the reader through a maze with no clear direction. It is divided into different levels of ecology (e.g., populations, communities, ecosystems) but with transending themes (e.g., dynamics, theoretical, application) and habitat and taxonomy(terrestrial plant ecology, terrestrial animal ecology, limnology, oceanography) discussed separately. So much for general principles that pervade all taxonomic groups and habitats. It would have been much more clear if it followed one pattern (e.g., time periods, major ecologists, conception and development of major ideas) instead of jumping back and forth on different methods of tracking history. In the end I have read a lot of text with very little learned about the history of ecology. I still don't understand how different concepts developed through empirical and theoretical support and refinement, in many cases who originally conceived the concept, and what impact these concepts had on the field of ecology in retrospect. Nor is it clear which of the older literature is still worth reading because of its continued relevance. I must say though, that I enjoyed hearing about concepts being credited to a particular author even though they were addressed in earlier texts. But this gave me the feeling that little has progressed in ecology, and old ideas are just being rediscovered and credited to someone else. The field of ecology still needs a clear, logically organized history of ideas, scientists, literature, and progress because this book will fall short in accessibility for most."},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"I have bought investiment and financial planning books throughout the years, but never got past the first chapter or two.

But it also educates...I am going to follow their investment strategies after speaking with others who have used it and prospered.

Tom and David write a beginner's guide to personal financial stability, regular financial planning, and PERSONAL control of one's investments. It is designed to prevent the professional financial world from exploiting the ignorance of the public by convincing them that investing and financial planning and the stock market are too complicated for &quot;outsiders.&quot; Though it is written in simple terms, is admittedly repetitive, and may be too basic for some, it is ideal for beginners. From consumer debt and credit card use to major family purchases to equity investing, it drives home the point that YOU CAN DO IT financially. I gave this as a gift to a couple of graduating high school senior honor students. They read it like a novel in a couple of days and said it was the best educational experience they ever had. Don't be fooled- though simply stated, the principles in this book are worth reviewing by money managers of ANY educational level. I have a business degree and a doctorate- I loved it!"},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"Investment books are rarely entertaining. The Gardners and Andy Tobias are the exceptions. If you can't bear to read about investing and know nothing, you should give this book a try. You may find it to your taste.The weakness of the book is a bias towards encouraging you to be out of debt and into common stocks, based on formulas and your professional knowledge. If the financial markets were at an average or below average price level, that would be all right. But the financial markets are at an all-time high, so future returns should be below par.There is a historical ratio between household wealth in stocks and housing that favors buying housing right now rather than stocks. Few will be able to buy a home without a mortgage.The most frequent path to major wealth in this country has been to found one's own business. Few can do this without incurring reasonable debt to finance receivables and other needed investments. The Gardners don't really address this investment opportunity.The formula the Gardners propose for buying high yield stocks in the Dow has had to be revised every few years to be a good way to invest. This formula probably won't work well in the future either, because too many people follow the formula. Markets are bested by only a small percentage of all investors over time, and this rule is no exception going forward.The advice about avoiding credit card debt, saving wherever you can, and so forth is quite good. You'd find it in any decent investment book.If you decide you want to go into the stock market, I suggest you also read John Bogle's book, Common Sense About Mutual Funds, to round out the perspective that the Gardners provide here before buying stocks. Be sure to consider first how much you want to do with housing and starting your own business. Good luck with your investing."},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"The reason I said that every woman should read this book is because women are so uneasy, uneducated and uninformed about HANDLING THEIR MONEY.

If you believe that your financial advisor is a real expert, or you have credit card debt, or you don't know how to get the best price on a car, this is a must read. I knew all the basic stuff until I got to stocks which I'm far from an expert in. What I like about the Fool books (besides the humor and light tone which is always appreciated) is that they explain in plain English the meaning behind the numbers. Want to know what a dividend percentage yield really MEANS? You get the idea. Their basic Dow 4 strategy seems a bit oversimplified, but the point is that we should all realize that WE have all the information we need to make well-informed decisions for ourselves and do not need to rely on others. That idea alone (and a common theme running through the books) is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"This book was one I felt I had to read - like medicine I had to have.

While I'm certain there are many books that &quot;might&quot; be capable of encouraging the same response, this is the first and ONLY book on finances (to date) that has shaken me deep enough to take intelligent action. The Fools don't ask you to do as they do, because their investment formula is THE ultimate. No, instead they tell you what works for them, what types of things to look for, and then they demand that you think for yourself. Now I realize that's a new approach in some circles, but that's really what it comes down too. They teach you how to dig deep, do the research, develop a strategy and invest within the parameters of that strategy. YOUR strategy!

However, the 288 pages of this book could have been condensed into 30 pages because the writing often gets off on a tangent. It seems like the authors were getting paid by the number of words.

Looks like they don't! The 1973-74 years saw companies deliver their best earnings in nearly a decade, and yet the stock-prices tumbled. For that matter, the entire 1970's saw increasing earnings and lowering stock-prices. Apparently, earnings and stock-prices don't march in lock-step at all. But don't ask the Motley Fools! They were born yesterday!Do the Motley Fools know that! buy-and-hold might not work if you buy stocks at extravagant prices? Or if you have a time-horizon of less than 10 years? It is likely to work (and even here, it is only a likelihood; no guarantees) only if you buy stocks at half-off prices AND are willing to hold them for at least a decade, if not longer.Do the Motley Fools know under what economic conditions (a) long-term bonds are better investments than stocks, (b) stocks are better than long-term bonds, (c) stocks and long-term bonds are equally good investments, and (d) stocks and long-term bonds are equally bad investments? Of course, they don't! For they were born yesterday!The Motley Fools haven't even seen a bear-claw, much less a grizzly on Wall Street. They don't even have a clue as to what a bear market is. Maybe they think that if the stocks closed lower this Friday when compared to last Friday, they have seen a bear market! And maybe that is why we see them exhorting people to invest in the &quot;F! ederal Bank of Coca-Cola&quot; (as if it is a sure thing at! its current extravagant levels). And maybe that is why they go about giving interviews saying that it is not unrealistic to expect 25% yearly returns, for a &quot;whole bunch of years&quot;!This is just another bull-market rag.

Thanks."},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"Usually after a hit movie or television series based on a previously written novel comes out, critics, moviegoers, and readers debate what was better: seeing it or reading it. Even though people generally spend more time in front of a screen than in front of the printed page, the book tends to win. Not in the case of this book, however. My recommendation, in short, is to stick with the exceptionally witty, informative, and savvy web site. The book does have value, though, as a case for what should be a no-brainer when it comes to personal finance (or, for that matter, to anything): think for yourself. Brokers tend to be more concerned with increasing their production than with providing prudent investment advice. Most mutual funds fail to outperform the market averages and, hence, must rely on lame advertisements during professional golf tournaments to keep the money flowing in. Don't buy stocks with money you might need soon. Be careful when buying a car and a house. Stocks are the best long-term investment. This is all sensible advice, but most of us have already heard it. At least in this regard, the book smacks of Eric Tyson, but with more generalities and less attitude (those reviewers who criticized the Gardners' earlier book because of its &quot;attitude&quot; will be pleased--the authors have toned it down a bit). This book, in brief, lacks the innovation of the MFInvestment Guide. On the other hand, there are worse things to do in a book than to provide generally good advice: some financial authors have written numerous books (in about, ahem, a year) and still have yet to say anything useful. Most of the book's weaknesses are so-called errors (&quot;sins&quot; is too strong of a word) of omission. For example, the statistic that the &quot;average adult&quot; (What exactly is meant in this example by &quot;average&quot;? How large was the survey? Who conducted it? Did I miss something?) is burdened by $4000 in credit card debt lacks perspective. $4000 means little (well, maybe not that little. Still a lot of money) without mentioning &quot;average&quot; income levels or net worth. Granted, it is true that those who held great consumer companies such as Coke have turned thousands (even A thousand) into millions. Nevertheless, most people would consider themselves fortunate to pick just one of those stocks just once in a lifetime. To paraphrase Descartes (why not? The book cites all kinds of early-modern figures. Why? I don't know. Sir Thomas More in a personal finance book?!), HOW DO WE KNOW when we have a loser on our hands? Not all stocks go to Pluto. HOW DO WE KNOW when a former high-flier is not just &quot;undervalued&quot; (amazing how so many stocks are considered &quot;undervalued&quot; all the way to the bottom) but on the contrary is in a crisis serious enough to sell (not just to &quot;hold&quot;) it? In addition, the appendix on Iomega was disappointing. I would have liked to have seen more on the trips and blunders of pundits such as Alan Abelson (he STILL has a job? There's gotta be someone else) who have been wrong about Iomega time and time again. What was perhaps the most annoying characteristic of the book, probably because it kept coming up, was the book's casual (frequent!) mentioning of the troubles of DJT (Donald Trump's debt-ridden company). Several times (I checked the index to verify this) the book points out Trump as an example of imprudence. Taken together, the snippets could just about stand alone as the short-sale report in the Fool Portfolio. Readers, as far as I can tell (I checked twice . If I goofed, sorry), would have no idea that the Gardners have actually shorted this stock in a real-money portfolio. While I would agree that DJT is almost hopelessly debt-ridden (as indebted as just about any company I've ever seen. Well, maybe the Ottawa Senators and San Fran Giants could give the Donald a run for his money), the fact that the Gardners (the Fool Portfolio) have a financial stake in DJT should have been mentioned in the book, especially because the book seems to have been written for those who may not know much about the Fool web site. Perhaps I've been a bit harsh. After all, the book's central point is right on: financial security and independence come through research, discipline, perseverance, hard work, and faith in one's own potential. Most everyone can do this. Sadly, however, a good first step for those who do want to get out of debt and to take control of their financial situation would be to consult the Fool's excellent web site, though not the book."},{"Title":"You Have More Than You Think","review":"I have been giving advice for several years on how to strengthen families and found that one of the biggest strains on a relationship is financial mis-management.

You won't believe the stuff they put into Part II about ways to make money (like teaching your dog tricks, so you can collect money in a hat on the street). Even the serious stuff can be a little funny. The key point is that it is possible to make money, even with very little (they use an example of saving and investing a dollar a day). I also enjoyed the references to when to use the Fool's web site. I think the authors are right in pointing out that having ideas checked on on the Internet can improve your investing. The best part of the book was that it showed you how bad thinking habits can cost you a bundle. If you also want to learn about bad habits that hurt you at work and how to boost your career as fast as the Motley Fool Model Portfolio, you should read &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; (1999) by Mitchell, Coles, and Metz.

All of these words do not describe Blood on the Reik. They do however apply to the world that we were told Blood on the Reik would reveal to us: the world of Warhammer Fantasy. Many of us who are aware of this setting with its rabid fans spread throughout Europe, its dozens of well written novels, its own miniature based fantastically popular war game, and its unique but recognizable world have long searched for a way to introduce our friends to the setting. We have searched for a way to grant them, with but a glance, the same fascination that we have.Blood on the Reik promised to give us this. It is surely cleverly conceived. It was pitched as a work that will give us the sweeping visuals that have so inspired fans of the Warhammer world, focused on the largest nation of humanity, the glorious Empire. Blood on the Reik is presented not as a work of fiction but as work that might be found within the world of Warhammer. Reik's exterior appears as if it was a folio produced in the halls of Altdorf, capital city of the Empire. Every facet of its exterior oozes the setting. From the exterior inscriptions, comments from the \\"author\\" and its claim of having \\"12 Color Plates and 260 Representations this work is, one the surface, an immersive experience.Presented as a work by Altdorf resident Tobias Helmgart, an author and traveler who compiled this book during his crossings and experiences throughout the Old World, Blood on the Reik fails to live up to its exterior. This is principally due to the artwork of John Blanche. The aforementioned color \\"plates\\" (an anachronistic term for full-color photo) are all his work and are truly vile to behold. The sketches are done, alternatively, by Blanche and long-time Games-Workshop artist David Gallagher. Where we have Gallagher (who to be fair comprises most of them) we have success, where we find Blanche's drawings we find little more than the etchings you might expect on a cave man's wall.The text, what little there is does pass muster and should be applauded save for the fact that there isn't enough of it.It's a shame that for many months this was the sole art-book for the Warhammer Fantasy world. Thankfully the recently released Darkness Rising: A Complete History of the Storm of Chaos learned from the mistakes of Blood on the Reik. It has the flavor, the immersive setting, detail, and beautiful artwork.

But here's what I found out when it arrived: (a) The CD that accompanies the book has almost no music on it. It is mostly a tutorial to help you with certain snarky technical issues in the individual pieces. Nothing wrong with that, but not helpful if you haven't heard the pieces and would like to know what you're working on in advance. (b) A couple of the pieces are written for use with a slide. (c) Most of the pieces require an unusual tuning. Dropped D tuning is not a big deal, but most of the others are more complicated than that. I wanted this music for performance purposes, and having to stop and tune extensively between pieces makes their use extremely inconvenient, unless you have two equivalent guitars and somebody to tune for you in between. If you know all this and still want the book, it's easy to read and contains both tablature and music notation. Gerhard's work is terrific. But if I had it to do over, I would have passed, based on the above limitations."},{"Title":"Ed Gerhard: The Guitar Songbook (Book & CD) (Acoustic Masterclass)","review":"Gerhard plays in many different tunes, if you think about it usually it's just a few strings you have to change.

I found the tabs to be quite accurate, which saved me lots of time trying to figure out what he was doing just by listening, even with it slowed down. I didn't care if it even came with a cd, but it is a nice extra. And please...before you post you playing one of his songs on Youtube, get an unbiased opinion of your playing by someone not afraid to hurt your feelings.

His many publications testify to his integrity and extensive scholarship. I did not read this book when it was first publishd in 1973, but have had the good fortune of having a good friend, the retired rector of an Episcopal church, donate me this book. Since I have read most of the lastest publications of Crossan, I find in this one the same sound interpretation of the parables of Jesus. This is not only a commentary, but a scholarly introduction to the literary genre that the historical Jesus employed to convey the core of his message, which is so often completely misunderstood. I recommend this book very highly to anyone who shares the new understanding of the historical Jesus, so well explored by the Westar Institute."},{"Title":"In Parables: The Challenge of the Historical Jesus (Eagle Books)","review":"I am a new-comer to Jesus scholarship and so what I say is not as an expert but merely as an appreciative reader. What I found especially valuable about this brief but excellent study was the interdisciplinary elements that Crossan brought to bear on his subject. In order to help us hear what Jesus is up to, Crossan brings in very useful insights from poets and philosophers. These, along with Crossan's very suggestive readings of Jesus' parables, make this a book one could ponder for quite a while. As with poems, the brevity of this book masks a lot of depth."},{"Title":"In Parables: The Challenge of the Historical Jesus (Eagle Books)","review":"Crossan's \\"In Parables\\" is a bit of a lift for readers new to theological questions but is well worth the effort in the end."},{"Title":"Philosophy of Mind","review":"PHILOSOPHY OF MIND is one of Routledge's &quot;Contemporary Introduction to Philosophy&quot; series.

Prof. Heil then discusses important philosophical and psychological approaches (Watson and Skinner, for example) to the philosophy of mind.The work discusses some of the questions that are often left out of introductory works on the topic, such as artificial intelligence and biological evolution. This book can be used by someone who is a beginner, or someone who is familiar with the basic issues in philosophy but wishes to get a better understanding of the issues.I've just finished reading Stanley Jaki's BRAIN, MIND AND COMPUTERS which discusses many of these issue from a broader theological and philosophical perspective.

These chapters will probably not interest the typical US parrot owner who has a pet parrot or two and is uninterested in breeding. The book has a large chapter on various &quot;breeds&quot; of parrots. I suppose that in the UK one refers to parrot breeds. In the US, however, you would be severely criticized for this. Parrots consist of different species, not breeds. The different parrots available are unrelated species with different scientific names. Cats and dogs, on the other hand, are the same exact species but are considered to have breeds to designate different varieties and traits humans have selectively bred. I just want to clarify this point so that a person new to the world of parrots is not labeled an ignoramus! The species descriptions are very brief and often limited to breeding habits or distribution in the wild. Most species descriptions are not accompanied by a photo, either. If one is looking for a parrot identifier with photos and lots of descriptive narrative, you'd be best to look elsewhere. However, the book has lots of gorgeous photos throughout and the chapter on parrot anatomy is quite good. Considering the steep discount, this book is overall not a bad purchase for parrot lovers."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Parrot","review":"I added this to my library, great book, easy to read, lots of great info.

These were guerrill-type bands sponsored by aristocrats, fighting to depose the new regime and reestablish the old one. In the plot, a Republican woman is sent to France to help with intelligence-gathering. But she falls in love with one of the chouan leaders. Another spy maneuvres to make her think her lover has betrayed her, and so she conspires against him. I don't share the other reviewers's opinion that it is a bad novel. It is just an average one by a great writer. I enjoyed it, though."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"\\"Les Chouans is Honor&eacute; de Balzac's first \\"real\\" novel; he had previously published \\"pot boilers\\" under pseudonyms. It was published in 1829, following his multi-month stay the previous year, gathering background material, in Fougeres, in eastern Brittany. The novel is set in 1799, 10 years after the commencement of the French Revolution. It was the year that France, exhausted from the violence and excesses of the Revolution, embraced a \\"strong-man\\" savior, named Napoleon. But there was still not peace in the Brittany region, which contained strong Catholic and Royalist sentiment. The Vend&eacute;e had been in revolt, and continued sporadic fighting since 1793. \\"Les Chouans\\" were followers of a rebel (i.e., anti-republican) leader, Jean Chouan, and they allied themselves with forces in the Vend&eacute;e.The two principal protagonists in this novel are Mlle. Marie de Verneuil and Marquis de Montauran, also known as \\"Le Gars.\\" She is devastatingly beautiful, and as we learn much later, the \\"natural\\" daughter of an aristocrat. She is working for the Republican Chief of Police, Joseph Fouch&eacute; (who would trump Machiavelli many fold in his devious and self-serving use of power), and has been sent to entrap Le Gars. In the process however - quelle suprise - she falls in (and out) of love with the man. There are a host of minor characters who plot and counterplot, cross, and double-cross each other, which seems to be the nature of war, particularly of the so-called \\"civil\\" variety, and also, alas, as the cynics would say, love too. Indeed, \\"hell hadth no fury like a woman scorned\\" is one of the themes also.The first section of the book is entitled \\"L'embuscade.\\" In it, Republican (Bleu) forces, who are leading a group of reluctant conscripts from Brittany to go fight in the wars against the other European countries which are trying to end the revolution, and are ambushed by Les Chouans, led by a youthful aristocrat. As an aside, I'd love to know if there is any evidence that Balzac inspired Faulkner, who commencedThe Unvanquished: The Corrected Textwith a chapter on an ambush, with similar themes of regional forces, in a losing game, trying to resist the stronger, central forces of the state. Comments are welcome.For me, the strongest portions of the book are Balzac's evocative descriptions of the Brittany countryside, often enveloped in fog and mist. The author describes some walks in the woods that I'd love to repeat. Indeed, he has placed the \\"off the beaten path\\" town of Fougeres on the map as a \\"must-see\\" destination. He also describes effectively why the hedgerows of Brittany are ideal for \\"guerilla warfare.\\" And by setting the novel in 1799 he helps illuminate a \\"cusp\\" period of French history, the transition from the Revolutionary period to the Napoleonic one. And Balzac had some \\"digs\\" at the political use of religion.But lawdy, the downside to the novel is immense. The action resembles a poorly written \\"soap opera.\\" The dialogue is all too often stilted and tedious. The characters seem to be made out of cardboard. Revealing the living conditions and attitudes of the Chouans, through the seemingly random wanderings of de Verneuil, during a time of insecurity in the countryside, was a mechanism riddled with implausibilites, particularly when she rescued the \\"miser,\\" by scaring his torturers by feigning to be a ghost. And the owl, as a harbinger of misfortune, was likewise overplayed. Equally, the motivation of other characters for particular actions was either poorly explained, or non-existent. It was hard for me to believe this was written by the same man who produced the excellentLe Pere Goriot (Petits Classiques Larousse Texte Integral) (French Edition)andEug&eacute;nie Grandet: Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de Province. (French Edition). Fortunately for Balzac, as well as ourselves, there were many tomorrows after today, unlike the untimely demise of the protagonists, and I'd advise concentrating on his \\"tomorrows.\\"As for his first real novel, I found the almost 500 pages a thinly rewarding slog. 3-stars."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"I don't find it dissapointing at all. I actually enjoyed reading it, although it started in a quite boring way. I love all books that reffer to the French Revolution or to the Napoleonic era, like War and Peace, Les Miserables etc. The style didn't look wonderful, but the plot was very interesting and the characters well drawn."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"This is Balzac's first Human Comedy novel, I believe, and it shows. I should probably give it 3.5 stars, but since it's Balzac, I'll say 4. I actually found the story captivating enough to pull me all the way through (the 2nd attempt...). There are dry, and lenghty parts (only three chapter breaks), but it's a unique novel. The Chouans takes place during the Napoleonic, post Revolutionary period when there are continuing civil battles between the new Rupublicans and the ancien regime, Royalists (which include the northen province Chouans). There is a lot of historical value to this novel in how Balzac displays the sentiments of the two sides, and various military personalities' views on the direction of government, and France in particular. As with most history, some modern parallels may even be drawn (i.e. conservative vs. liberal views on how a country should be run; conscription, and occupied peoples).I really liked how Balzac took this piece of French history, actually visited and lived in the locals used as background, and created an interesting (albeit a dated 19th century romance)story out of it all. It's all a matter of taste I suppose, but if you really want to get into Balzac (a worthy endeavor for any serious student of the novel, literature, and the history of the 19th century) than the Chouans is as good a starting point as any. It would've been interesting to see what other Scenes de la militaire Balzac might have come up with had he lived long enough.All in all, there are great (and mediocre) character portraits, and I think Mlle. Verneuil is well done, actually. It's fun (in a colorfully &quot;romantic&quot; kind of way), mysterious, historical, and . . . well, it's BALZAC."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"In places this novel reads as it were only a vulgar Romantic potboiler: the plot's chief-intrigue - the love affair between Mlle. Verneuil & the Royalist leader- is contrieved and somewhat mechanical. But one has to keep in mind this is the first time Balzac was trying his hand with serious novel-writing after a long spree of potboiler-writing under an assumed pen-name. And we still have already much of the future, serious - and at the same time ironic - Balzac in order to make the book enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"This book is relevant with the political issues of today. This is the first in Balzac's massive La Comdie humaine. It helps to learn how to read from someone who knows how to write."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"One of the images in the book was printed several times on one page not giving way for that part of the text. Several lines ruined on another page because of some black spot. Footnotes barely readable. I would recommend printing it straight off Google books. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"Les Chouans is one of Balzac's earlier works and is often referred to as the book that made him famous. Following the French Revolution of 1793, some of the citizens of Brittany, out of loyalty to the former monarchy and to their Catholic faith, refused to accept the secular Republican government and rose up in an attempt to overthrow it. These royalist rebels were known as the Chouans. This novel takes place in Brittany in 1799, mostly in the town of Foug&egrave;res and its environs. The handsome young leader of the rebellion meets a beautiful, mysterious young woman. Over the course of having lunch together, the two fall in love to the point of being willing to risk their lives for one another, even though neither is ever certain where the other's loyalties lie. If you can suspend enough disbelief to get past that, then this book is a great ride. It's got guerrilla warfare, political intrigue, espionage, and a romance worthy of Shakespeare, all set within beautiful descriptions of the Breton countryside. Balzac's writing combines Emile Zola's attention to descriptive detail and keen insight into human nature with Alexandre Dumas' ability to construct an intricate plot peopled with an interesting collection of disparate characters. The book crawls a little bit in the middle, but the beginning and the end are fast-paced and suspenseful. The third act in particular is very skillfully written with a lot of twists and turns. Balzac keeps the reader guessing every step of the way as to what's going to happen next, right up to the very end."},{"Title":"The Chouans","review":"The style is bad, the story is boring, the characters are unrealistic.

But this is the least interesting BFI book I've read. There is film writing that is enlivened with personal anecdote, and then there is film writing buried in it. Kennedy has produced a turgid, Proustian (not in the good way) essay that's so self-absorbed it defies an inlet for others. Kennedy introduces the film with a long, embroidered, meandering preamble about what was worn to school in the dark winters of her Scottish childhood. It is not illuminating, and frankly the tether to the movie was lost on me, except as an excuse to talk more about herself.One wants to grab her and say \\"It's a short book. We don't have time for two pages of personal memoirs to set up each item you'd like to discuss.\\" A good editor would have scrapped half of this, to make room for actual remarks about the movie. And then something scary occured to me; maybe he already did!"},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (BFI Film Classics)","review":"This is a disappointing and frustrating monograph. Disappointing in that it concerns one of the staggering masterpieces of the greatest filmmakers of all time, the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and manages to capture only their sadness and intelligence, with little of their madness or danger. This is because, as an author-screenwriter, Kennedy concentrates on Pressburger, the screenwriter. Now, Pressburger is a too often marginalised figure, and a crucial component of the Archers' magic, providing the bass-line spirit, wit and humanity of the films, but to reduce Powell's overwhelming contribution to a couple of patronising lines is to miss the essence and tensions of BLIMP (and surely, as a Scot, she might have found his Celtic roots interesting). A screenplay is not even a tenth of a film, it is the bricks with which the director builds a house. Kennedy's book is an analysis of the script, not the film; she betrays little meaningful knowledge of cinema, and so cannot explain the film as a visual experience, beyond a few platitudes. BLIMP contains arguably the greatest shot in all cinema - as Powell pulls back from the duelling scene - but Kennedy is unable to respond to it satisfactorily. Powell and Pressburger films are such an emotional experience that it is difficult to discuss them analytically. Kennedy offers a very personal, autobiographical response to the film which chimes very much with my own, but sometimes you want to shake her, and ask for something a lttle less comforting and vague. The book is frustrating, not only in its narrow focus, but in its nagging, repeated inaccuracies (Jack Cardiff did not photograph the film, he was a mere Technicolour cameraman - Powell liked his work, and asked him to shoot later Archers' films; the nurse and Barbara Wynne are the same character etc.), its lack of cinematic context or original research, its evasion of whole sequences at the expense of those that fit the thesis. It is extraordinary, though, that in a piece that discusses various notions of 'Home', Kennedy doesn't mention the play Clive attends, 'Ulysses'. So why three stars? Because just reading about one of my favourite films is such a pleasure. Because Kennedy is so nice, clear and familiar, and we share quite a lot in common. Because in between the reassuring padding, she comes up with the odd unique insight that startles you into rethinking old assumptions."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"This is a very helpful book if you want to know how slaves lived their lives.

Overall, it was a good book, and would be great for a report."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"I read this book for my history of American slavery class and I really enjoyed it. It is one of the books I did not sell back to the college when the semester ended. Blassingame focuses on the slave culture and uses such sources as folk songs, fugitive wanted posters, slave interviews and correspondence, diaries, and memoirs (from slaves and slave holders) to bring insight on life on the plantation. The author offers an extensive, well-organized bibliography which, alone, makes this book valuable.The chapters cover the topics of enslavement and acculturation, the Americanization of the slave and the Africanization of the South, slave culture, family, rebels and runaways, stereotypes and institutional roles (i.e. the \\"Sambo\\" role), plantation realities, and slave personality types. This work also includes appendixes on such subjects as African words, numerals, and sentences used by former slaves, and a comparative examination of total institutions. The book is well-written and also offers numerous illustrations."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"Blassingame succeeds in sheding light on the real-life culture of the black slave in the Antebellum South: his African heritage, culture, family, acculturation, behavior, religion, and personality. Rather than concentrating solely on the planter - the traditional way of approaching the subject - Blassingame attempts to clarify and distill the essence of slave life through the filter of three eyewitness accounts. Two of them, the planter and the slave, give an insider's view of the plantation while the third witness, the traveler, views the relation between slave and master from the perspective of an outsider. Blassingame then utilizes the raw material of these personal observations to construct a detailed account of the day-to-day life of a slave - providing the reader with an insightful glimpse into the Negro's African heritage, the development of an Americanized culture, the formation of families, acculturation and behavior patterns when not under white supervision, religious preferences and beliefs, and personality traits.The author makes the assertion that there were several types of slave personalities. Sambo - the submissive half-man, half-child - is the most well-known but was mostly a stereotypical manifestation of planter class racism and insecurity. Yet this caricature is the clearest portrait the southern planter has drawn of the slave, according to Blassingame. Sambo was actually but one of many variations, and was not even the most dominant slave personality. \\"Such stereotypes,\\" asserts Blassingame, \\"are so intimately related to the planters' projections, desires, and biases that they tell us little about slave behavior and even less about the slaves' inner life, his thoughts, actions, self-concepts, or personality.\\"Blassingame also asserts that, because masters were unable or unwilling to impose round-the-clock supervision, their system of control was open at certain points. These systemic \\"blind spots\\" presented opportunities for the development autonomous Negro behavior as the slave's quarters, religion, and family helped to foster self-sufficiency. Rather than identifying with and totally submitting to the master, the slaves tenaciously held on to many remnants of African culture while simultaneously gaining a sense of worth among fellow residents of the quarters. This resulting underworld society flourished in defiance of the burdens imposed by enslavement.In writing this treatise, the author attempted to tap into the feelings and attitudes of the entire plantation community. Since the thoughts and observations of slaves were seldom recorded (the teaching of reading and writing to slaves was illegal), Blassingale tends to lean heavily on observations by whites.Additionally, the book devotes a lengthy section attempting to determine the basis of the stereotypically feeble-minded, anxiously subservient \\"Sambo\\" image. To this end, Blassingame relies on data from Nazi concentration camps to test the hypothesis that, in a system as tightly closed as either the plantation or the concentration camp, the slave's (or prisoner's) position of absolute dependency virtually compels him to view the facility's authority-figure as somehow \\"good\\" despite the evil emanating from the master/commandant (because, so goes the theory, the master also supplies everything of value).There are also some enlightening discussions regarding the nature of slave marriage, family, religion, rebellion, and miscegenation. For example, the slave father was virtually without authority. Unable to protect his wife and children from discipline and abuse at the hands of the master, Negro fathers' resourcefulness in compensating for their institutionally-imposed weakness evokes simultaneous waves of sympathy at their plight and admiration for pluck.Blassingame has done an excellent job presenting and applying his research. His \\"holistic\\" approach to the subject effectively endows the reader with a keen sense of how masters and slaves interacted and provides a comprehensive picture of plantation life that effectively reveals the complexity of the institution - as contrasted with the distorted picture often emerging from those who rely solely on planter records.He successfully incorporates the primary accounts of plantation owners, slaves, and visitors in the Antebellum South to powerfully illustrate in straightforward manner what plantation life really felt like. He also makes effective use of social science disciplines like anthropology and psychology (especially when examining techniques the plantation owners utilized to maintain control and how the slaves resisted theses efforts). Furthermore, Blassingame resists the temptation to moralize about the living conditions and oftentimes barbarous exploitation of the slaves. Instead, he allows the reader to make up his own mind about the alien word of the antebellum Southern plantation and its \\"peculiar institution.\\""},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"A historical analysis of an institution is always a difficult thing to write. Extensive works must be read and analyzed, both primary and secondary in order to find trends within similar institutions. Furthermore, the longer the institution was in existance, the more documentation exists that must be sifted over in an effort to see how the institution has evolved over time.With the difficulty of the task in mind, John Blassingame has done an excellent presenting his research in &quot;The Slave Community.&quot; He successfully has used primary accounts of plantation owners, slaves and visitors of the Antebellum South to illustrate how plantation life really was. I use the term, &quot;illustrate&quot; as opposed to &quot;paint a picture&quot; because it more accurately describes what Blassingame has done in his book. He is straight forward in his approach. His attitude is &quot;this is how it is. Here is how I know.&quot;But more than explain how plantation life was for the slave, he shows how African-American culture assimilated to general European-American culture over the generations. He also makes extensive use of other social science disciplines including anthropology and psychology (especially when examining how plantation owners maintained order on their farms and how the slaves resisted the plantation owners). Furthermore, I admire how Blassingame has respect for his reader. In his forward style, he resists the temptation to moralize about the condition of the slaves and/or the barbarity of the whites. Instead, he has respect enough for his reader to let him make up his own mind about the various aspects of the &quot;peculiar institution.&quot; After reading this book, I have a hard time picturing anyone attempting to support the plantation owners."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"Blassingame wrote this book in the face of the insurmountable problem that a community can only be fully understood through tapping the thoughts and feelings of its members. Since slaves thoughts and feelings were so seldom recorded, the book tends to be based mostly on observations by whites. Nevertheless, even in observations of how slaves behaved, there is much that is not well understood. As a result, Blassingame devotes a lengthy section of the book trying to determine the degree of basis in fact of the stereotypical image of slave as demure and subservient. Ultimately Blassingame uses the example of Nazi-operated concentrated camps in World War II to reason through analogy to try to arrive at some kind of definitive conclusion.This portion is not the bulk of the text, but there are several other points of discussion in the book that seem equally inconclusive in this same way. Nevertheless, there are also some very enlightening discussions such as the structure of marriage and the family, religion, slave rebellions, and miscegenation.I found Blassingame's writing style very easy to read, and the material compelling. Despite my belly-aching on the inconclusiveness of many of the points in the Slave Community, I felt that this was a shortcoming imposed by the subject of the book, and not Blassingame's fault per se, and I still think it deserves four stars."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"In this revised and expanded edition, scholar John Blassingame describes not only what facts his researched uncovered, but also how he uncovered those facts. In particular, Blassingame's research emphasizes slave narratives and slave letters.He explains that both of these types of documentation allow the researcher to enter the inner world of the enslaved person through his or her eyes, rather than simply accepting the plantation owners' views about slave life. His discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of historical resources along with his explanation of how to use internal and external evidence to assess the credibility of such sources offers a fine lesson in historiography.In his choice of subject areas, Blassingame cuts a wide swath that overviews every core aspect of enslaved life. He begins with an intriguing examination of acculturation by comparing how enslaved Europeans in African, enslaved Africans in South America, and enslaved Africans in North America acculturated. He also explores the important but often neglected issue of the Africanization of the South--how southern Whites acculturated to African American culture.Having laid this foundation, two moving chapters ensue. Blassingame documents slave family life with all its harrowing, horrible obstacles. Yet he also demonstrates the resilience and love of enslaved African American families. Next Blassingame addresses the many obstacles to rebellion and escape, putting to rest the notion that the lack of runaways in any way suggested acceptance of enslavement.His final three chapters explore roles, realities, and personality types. At times his use of now-outdated sociological and psychological theory clouds the issues for modern readers. However, once sifted through and sorted out, these chapters continue to offer fresh information, if not always fresh insights.Overall no researcher can afford to ignore Blassingame's contribution. Though many have critiqued some of his conclusions, all seem to quote him repeatedly.Reviewer: Robert W.

This book provides a new perspective which complicates the familiar narrative of American slavery. His research is thorough and his languages is clear. It is difficult for anyone to read this book and not walk away feeling as though they've entered into a deeper understanding of years past. As far as I'm concerned, it's quintessential for anyone looking for a better understanding of early America and more generally, social history."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"I found this book to be very insightful for numerous reasons but the frequent comparisons between slavery practices in ancient times, the same times but in different reasons and how the US slavery practices knew no bounds for psychological and physical horrors over all as compared to others and unlike many others there was no way to ever \\"graduate\\" to being free. This is just the tip of the iceberg on this book. I also like that the author humanizes the people victimized by this practice with out making victimizing them so what i mean is the author doesn't just have pity on them but tells of courage strengh and heroism. This is just one of many books i have read on my quest to learn the true history of America as a white woman i grew up in a white area and our coverage in American History class about slavery that actually talked about the experience and slaves lives was a paragraph of 5-6 sentences. So, I decided in order to truly know our history as a nation i have to know the history of all of people not just white people...it might take me a bit but I am working my way through all races, cultures and ethnicities...."},{"Title":"The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South","review":"This book has helped me in my independent study of slavery and family research.
