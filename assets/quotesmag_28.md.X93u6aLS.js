An oil tanker captain manages to save an oceangoing tugboat and her tow from certain destruction after the tug loses power and flounders in heavy seas and gale force winds. At risk is not only the tug, barge and tanker, but also the Florida beaches which would have been spoiled with crude oil had the tanker captain's judgment been even a little off. The barge, as it turns out, is carrying a $50 million Space Shuttle fuel tank, so in the end, by maritime custom, the tanker's crew and owners are well paid for their efforts.

It's a factual chronical of a modern day high seas adventure and salvage operation, followed by a courtroom battle over salvage rights, which will keep any reader who enjoys maritime stories thoroughly engaged.

Orgeron, en route to NASA at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and towing a barge loaded with a 150-foot aluminum space-shuttle fuel cell. The value of the fairly lightweight but bulky cargo was more than$50 million.Both the Cherry Valley and the J.A. Orgeron had left the Gulf of Mexico and were navigating north in the Atlantic Ocean about 10 miles off Florida's east coast when they ran into Hurricane Gordon.In the midst of torrential, blinding rain and wind gusts of 40-60 knots, one of the tugboat's engines failed. The sea and wind pummeled the helpless tug and its valuable tow and pushed them toward the potentially deadly Bethel Shoal, off Fort Pierce.The tug's skipper broadcast a distress call, requesting assistance from any nearby ship.Only the Cherry Valley was close, but it was not a good candidate for offering aid. Being a tanker made the Cherry Valley unsuited for any type of salvage work. Also, it lacked thecables and winches needed for towing another vessel in a storm, and its crew of 25 had no training in rescue procedures.What's more, the Cherry Valley was a single-hull tanker built before the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 made double-hull construction mandatory. Therefore, to try a rescue operation with such a large and fairly unwieldy ship during a hurricane and near a lee shore was a risk its captain could easily have avoided.But Strong was not that sort of captain. Answering the centuries-old unwritten law demanding that sailors help each other in times of danger, he immediately set his course for the distressed tug and barge. The Cherry Valley was eventually able to take them in tow and move them from the shallow waters that endangered all three vessels.As a result of their action, Strong and his crew were awarded the American Merchant Marine Seamanship Trophy.In keeping with long-established practices, Keystone Shipping Co., owner of the Cherry Valley, applied for the salvage award. A dispute led to legal action, resutling in a judgment against NASA for almost $5 million_ the most in U.S. maritime history.\\"In Peril\\" offers illuminating details about merchant marine practices in the waters off theSoutheast, life aboard merchant ships and the highly specialized field of maritime law."},{"Title":"In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made History","review":"I first heard this story from the horse's mouth while on the homeward leg of a pilot run in Maine's Penobscot Bay.

Well told by people who've been there and know a thing or two about the briny depths and the ships that sail them. Other books claim to be great maritime narratives but are told by writers who couldn't tell a monkey fist from a monkey wrench. I highly recommend this book to professional mariners, maritime students, yachtsmen, airmchair seafarers, and anyone who wants to know about the movement of oil on the high seas, marine salvage, admiralty law, and what it's like to take a 668' tanker into the jaws of danger and the annals of nautical history."},{"Title":"In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made History","review":"This is one of those &quot;can't put down&quot; books we all look for and so infrequently find.

When failure would result in a major oil spill and destruction of the vessels, and when lives hang in the balance, failure is not an option. Captain Skip Strong proved that stormy morning to be a master mariner and inspiring leader of men.I was very happy to see where Twain Braden and Captain Strong described the pivotal roles played by the Mates, the Boatswain, and the deck crew - life at sea is the ultimate team effort, where the expertise and bravery of all is necessary to achieve results. The challenges faced by both the Deck and Engine crews and their heroic response is tautly described.The descriptions of life at sea and day to day operations of both a tankship and an oceangoing tug/barge unit were exceptionally true to life and give the reader a 'you-are-there' feeling.Even after the tug and barge are rescued, peril of a different sort looms - the rocks and shoals of the courtroom. The legal machinations and tortuous twists and turns of the case lead to a suprise ending - and history being made.Keystone Shipping Company has always had a sterling reputation in the industry - Captain Strong proved the reputation is well founded.

However, it speaks well for her that Taft is still a good read. It's a story primarily of fatherhood and loyalty - however misplaced. I've read all but one of Patchett's books, starting with the non-fiction Truth and Beauty, and think that Patchett is one of the best novelists writing today. Patchett has a gift for language and is poetic without being thick. She also knows how to weave a story and her characters, even those that aren't as well fleshed out, stay with you long after you've read the last page. If you've never read a book by Patchett, Bel Canto and The Magician's Assistant are better than Taft, but if you've read her other works and want an engaging page turner that's far better than average, Taft is a worthy read. In fact, even if a reader started with Taft, they'd get a good enough taste of Patchett's talents that they'd seek out her other works and be even more impressed with whatever Patchett book found its way into their hands next."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"One characteristic of Ann Patchett's work is her simplicity. All her works concentrate on the emotional interrelationships of a small group of people, often in an enclosed community and/or over a short space of time. This is seen most clearly in her masterpieceBEL CANTO, but TAFT also displays a similarly beguiling compression. There are scarcely a dozen character, and the whole action takes place within a few miles of the small Memphis bar managed by the narrator-hero John Nickel. In fact, very little actually happens until the very end, though the emotional turmoil of affections and loyalties is quite intense. What some other readers saw as a weakness, I treasure as one of the book's greatest strengths.Nickel, a former blues musician turned bar manager, yearns for his son whom his estranged lover, the child's mother, has taken out of state. In some kind of emotional compensation, he finds himself involved in the lives of a fatherless young waitress who comes to work in his bar and her younger brother. Nickel is not a wholly admirable character, though he strives to do the right thing. Patchett has caught especially well the manner in which emotional trauma can ricochet until a person no longer knows his true feelings or even his own best interest. Looking at her innocent girl-next-door face on her publicity photo, it is hard to imagine that she has been there, felt that, but this book must surely have been born out of experience.Presumably outside her experience, though, is the specific life of her African-American narrator, John Nickel. I was greatly impressed by her daring in writing about such a world from the inside, but I have to admit that some of the language seems borrowed from hard-boiled fiction rather from life, and I cannot judge whether she captures the particular world of the blues musician. I felt very confident, though, in her description of the work of the bar. And, where it really matters, in the workings of the human heart, Patchett is admirably color-blind and has close to perfect pitch.The most unusual technical aspect of this book, which gives it its title, is Nickel's imagined reconstructions of the relation between the two young people and their dead father, Taft. These episodes become increasingly detailed as the book goes on, and form a parallel strand in the narrative, almost as though Nickel were there himself, engaging in a form of time-traveling. It is clear that Nickel comes to identify with his imagined Taft, whom he uses as a sort of touchstone of fatherhood. Some readers may have been puzzled by this, but I liked it for its ability to reflect on the soul of the central character (Nickel, not Taft, who in a real sense does not exist). All Patchett's novels, with the partial exception of her first, seem to require some kind of artifice to bring out the feelings of her characters in their purest form. In TAFT, this artifice is perhaps too obvious, a mere authorial device. InTHE MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT, she uses literal but fantastic magic tricks for the same purpose, but the device is more seamlessly incorportated into the fabric of the novel. Surely one of the great reasons for her success with BEL CANTO is her ability to parlay a real-life event (the capture of a South American embassy by terrorists) into an almost magical suspension of time.But the real value of TAFT is its pay-off. The beauty of its ending--not too neat but deeply satisfying--kept me awake for most of the night after I finished it. The mainly internal action of the book culminates in a climactic event which at last reminds Nickel of his true priorities. In the last two chapters, Patchett's handling of the strand of magic reconstruction is particularly impressive, finally linking the two characters of Taft and Nickel, and bringing about another of those gentle miracles that one has come to associate with her work."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I just loved Ann Patchett's wonderful writing and story in her recent novel BEL CANTO, so decided to read her other three books, starting with the first one, so that I could see the progression. Although it wasn't on the same level as Bel Canto (my favorite), I really liked Patchett's first novel, THE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS. Wonderful characters and voice &amp; things to think about.But her second book, TAFT, was a real disappointment. The characters are flat and I couldn't connect with any of them, was particularly disgusted with the young Fay, and just couldn't understand the much older John Nickel's fascination with her, his compulsion to take her wherever she asks, do almost anything she wants, to the extent of always protecting her brother Carl. She just isn't likeable, is embarrassingly naive, a weak character (not that I liked Carl any better). Yes, we are told it's because she's needy and John wants to be protective. But 'telling' doesn't make it believable.I felt there was a hazy screen in front of me the whole time I was reading Taft--which by the way is yes, a real 'lightweight,' nothing much to think about in it--that there wasn't much story there, let alone feeling for any of the characters. For me, when a book is really well-written, I can't get enough of every detail, like to savor them, and that was certainly missing for me here (plus there is little detail in this novel anyway--it's pretty sparse). I did think that Patchett had an original idea in trying to incorporate John Nickel's imagined 'story' of Taft (Fay and Carl's deceased father), and it almost worked, but something seemed missing to weave these parts into the novel seamlessly--they felt choppy and often out of place.The book meanders until near the end (which I wouldn't mind if I had been immersed in its characters or story), and then it picks up--and then bam, ends pretty quickly. I did like the last couple of reminiscences of Taft woven in at the end and the fact that Patchett didn't end with his death, but went back to an earlier time--it did bring together some of the theme strands about protecting those we love. But it left me with little feeling or little to think about also. Nor did the book bring much closure with it, though I just didn't care, at that point.So, for me, this book just didn't jell, and I wouldn't recommend it. I haven't read Patchett's third book yet (MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT), but would certainly recommend her first and fourth over this novel. I'm hesitating between two stars--because I didn't find much to like in this novel--and three stars, because Patchett has such potential, is an intelligent, literary writer; so maybe I'll say two and a half."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"For me a fine author is one who takes me places I would not ordinarily have chosen to go. I have learned to trust Patchett in that way. When I have read the plot outlines for her books, it has taken a leap of faith to plunge into them, the situations have seemed too off-beat for my conservative imagination. But I have learned to trust Patchett and I will always go with her. Taft is this kind of book. The fanciful awarenesses are atmospheric for me, not weird, as in other books with such devices. Her characters have flaws, but often great nobility. She is a fine author, and we are fortunate if she continues to share her gift with us."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"Ann Patchett is an intelligent and gifted writer with a knack for making characters come to life. I've read all four of her novels and enjoyed each one, but this is my favorite. She establishes John Nickel from the first page as a credible and appealing narrator. If you met this guy in real life, you'd want to buy him a drink and listen to him talk. He makes mistakes but not excuses. There is a generosity of spirit in the narrator and the novel both that makes the book ultimately uplifting. Tragedy and betrayal occur, but healing and connection can follow. A lovely book."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"In a book that is set far away in place, character, and circumstance from her justly celebrated novel \\"Bel Canto,\\" Patchett has crafted a story that reveals once again that the extraordinary lies just beneath the surface in even the most \\"ordinary\\" of people. Nickel, the black manager of a Memphis bar and a former jazz musician struggling with his own losses, hires Fay, a white teenage girl, as a waitress. Against his better judgment he becomes increasingly involved in her life and that of her younger brother Carl, a troubled kid who spells trouble for Nickel. As the characters try to make sense of their own circumstances and find a way to move forward with their lives, dangerous collisions become inevitable and choices must be made. Hovering over everything is Taft, the dead father of Fay and Carl, whose life and experience could not be more different than that of Nickel, and who haunts both Nickel's and the reader's thoughts. The book is well-plotted, with enough suspense to keep the reader turning the pages, as Ms. Patchett performs her own magic, showing us that nothing, and no one, is simple."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I'll keep this very short since many of the other reviewers do a good job of summing this book up - Patchett can write, maybe better stylistically than anyone today, but it's not enough her to cover up a weak plot. The story about a black bar manager named Nickel who becomes involved with a brother and sister tandem that ultimately results with him shot in the shoulder seems to lack the kind of emotional intensity that Bel Canto and Patchett's other work has. The writing is clear and has a wonderful swaying quality to it, so it's easy to read, but caring about any of the characters takes a back seat to beautiful writing. Ayn Rand said that the problem with much of fiction is that it is so steeped only in description, to the point that none of it will be remembered in 50 years, and this may be the perfect example of that. Beautiful writing is not always enough to carry a book. The racial tension, although tangible, is hard-pressed to understand considering the lack of a firm time setting. I have no full understanding what year this is taking place. So, for Patchett fans like myself, I would say read this because it's written by a clearly gifted writer, and don't let this books shortcomings cause you to lose excitement for her next work."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"This story effortlessly unfolds, patiently, without pretension: young Fay, yearning for her father, falls in love with Nickel, a middle-age man yearning for his son. The more Fay asks of Nickel, the more Nickel is drawn into the destructive elements of Fay's family, until tragedy strikes. Nothing about the story feels artificial. Woven through the narrative is the story of Fay's father, a humble man with extraordinary empathy and inner strength who nevertheless suffers an early death. His spirit presides over the paths of the other characters as they struggle to find stability. This compelling story is beautifully wrought and evocative. A wakeful opiate."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I'm a big fan of Ann Patchett, so I stuck with this book and was happy I did. It wasn't as wonderful as some of her other books, but I enjoyed it and passed it on to someone else (which I don't do if I don't like the book). Certainly not a waste of time."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"It can if it reeks of \\"writers' workshop\\" as ripely as Ann Patchett's second novel 'Taft'. Every sentence tidy to the point of sterility, every phrase within the parameters of contemporary taste, neither over- nor under-written! Not quite overtly sentimental but patently an emotion-teaser! I despise this kind of writing. There's not a trace of Ann Patchett's sincerest personhood in it, neither of her own emotions nor of any deeper thoughts that have ever crossed her mind. It's simply words for the market, as taught in all the 'creative writing' lessons Patchett took at Sarah Lawrence, and again at the Iowa Writers' Workshop (that abysmal hack factory), and yet again at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown.Taft is purportedly the first-person narration and fantasy of \\"John Nickel, a black ex-musician who wanted nothing more than to be a good father. But his son is taken away from him and he is left with nothing but the Memphis bar he manages.\\" Unfortunately, Nickel's voice is utterly unconvincing. He might just as well be the white private detective from a Raymond Chandler novel. It was quite a hunk of chutzpah for the young and very white Ann patchett to assume the 'persona' of a 40-year-old African-American, and a discarded father at that. Had she succeeded, this might have been at least a literary triumph. But John Nickel is implausible both as a black man and as a human being. The most blatant example comes early in the novel, when the drug-dealing white boy Carl Taft hints that his dead father wasn't free of racism, and John Nickel fails to catch the hint. Carl, a \\"wasted\\" 18-year-old hill-country dropout -- wasted in both senses -- is in fact the most believable character in the novel. His sister is a fictive wraith. Nickel's non-wife Marion, mother of his son, is about as real as Lois Lane, and her black family are such caricatures that one might chide Patchett for 'racial profiling'.And then, to add insult to injury, the dumb story turns 'warm and fuzzy' in its final scenes ...."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I'm not certain why Ann Patchett considers this her favorite book, but I didn't feel that it was my favorite of her books. I'm a big fan of this author, and her talent definitely shows in this book. However, it has an unfinished or loose-string kind of feel to it, that isn't intentional. It is a good read, and I will always read Patchett's novels for her excellent writing."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"My edition of TAFT includes a note from Patchett in the back about \\"the curse\\" of second novels. (I love reading these little anecdotes, by the way, just as I loved her note about being on set at the movie in PATRON SAINT.) I like that she is loyal to this book, but I admit I think TAFT was \\"cursed\\" for a reason: it's not as strong as her others. There are parts of TAFT that are beautiful, engaging, and lovely, but overall I think it may be her weakest book. I do think, though, that she needed to write this novel in order to ultimately arrive at her brilliance in BEL CANTO and RUN.The main problem is that I just didn't buy it. I didn't believe that Fay would be so taken with Nickel. I didn't believe he would so passively be taken with her. Yes, I can understand a sexual attraction, but the way Fay is described doesn't seem to create much sexual desire (probably the point, but it still muddles his motivation). Was I supposed to be secretly hoping they'd sleep together? Because I wasn't...in fact, any scene where they were alone together just creeped me out and I wanted them to separate.I also had the problem of feeling I could see through to the writer's motivations as she attempts to make the plot/story work. I also felt this way at times in MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT, but that book overall was more engaging and believable. I felt like Patchett was trying so hard to show (or actually, tell) us how Nickel was feeling about Fay. Every time he outright said he wondered what he was thinking, I felt like it was really Patchett saying, \\"I know this is not very believable, so maybe if I have him address it that will help.\\" It didn't.Marion was a very interesting character, and by the end I was taken by her. In fact, the very end of the novel was the most captivating for me -- and not because of the dramatic gunshot, but rather the story was moving in other, larger directions instead of focusing on the Nickel-Fay relationship which just didn't work for me.The end was very nice, and the \\"scenes\\" with Taft were masterful as well. Even if I enjoyed this book less than others Patchett wrote, I still admire her writing and especially her masterful way of ending a novel. I can't wait to see what she writes next."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I was completely mezmorized by the first quarter of the book. Even though Anne Patchett is writing as a white woman, her characterizations of John, the black male ex-drummer and bar manager, and of the other bar employees ring true. The little details in the relationships between the characters, their idiosynchrocies and habits, are intriguing. The theme of loyalty and love surrounding John's longing for his son is equally compelling. BUT - when we get to the heart of the story, where John is pulled into alove-lust relationship with Fay, my stomach had a sinking \\"oh-no\\" feeling. And this instant reaction was correct. This plot line was flat and unbelievable, even repellant. So, too, are issues with Carl, Fay's drug-dealing brother. Anne Patchett is an incredibly talented author. I highly enourage you to read Bel Canto or The Magician's Assistnat instead."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I loved the author's other books - for some reason this one didn't resonate with me at all.

There are two big problems: 1) She's a teenager, and 2) She's white and he's black. The race difference wouldn't seem to be that big a deal these days, even in Memphis (my hometown). However, Fay, her troubled brother Carl, and Fay's mother are living with old-money relatives, and John knows that they would take a dim view of an older black boyfriend who runs a bar. These various issues seem only to intensify the attraction between the two, but in some ways John is also father figure to both Fay and Carl, whose father has recently died, leaving the family destitute and forced to move from the hills of East Tennessee to live with the aforementioned relatives. I couldn't quite grasp what it is about Fay and Carl that motivates John to protect them in ways that are not healthy for any of the parties involved. One possible clue is the fact that John himself is father to 9-year-old Franklin, who now lives in Miami with his mother, Marion, whom John never married. This is a sticking point with both parties, as she was ready to marry when he wasn't and vice versa. Now he has developed a friendly relationship with her parents, still in Memphis, and a possibly more-than-friendly relationship with her sister Ruth. Add to these Wallace, Cyndi, and Rose, who all work in the bar, and you have a nice ensemble of characters to keep the pot boiling. The author, from Nashville herself, nails the dichotomy, or trichotomy, really, that is the state of Tennessee, with the mountain people at one end and the delta people at the other, and the less extreme valley people in the middle. I've read that the author thinks that the title of this novel hurts its market potential, and I think she's right about that. It's a shame this novel hasn't come to the attention of more readers."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"I read Bel Canto years ago.

I was initially intrigued that a white woman was writing from a black males perspective and I wondered how believable it was going to be. Turns out, not very. I just never understood why the main character was making the decisions-radical and unorthodox-that he was making. I liked the main character and the themes he intended to embody, but nothing seemed to come together with the story. The reader knows a lot of personal details about the characters, but yet I never was able to relate to any of them. I was very conflicted with the presentation of John's loyalty, love, and protectiveness for his 8 year old son while at the same time he was longing sexually for a 17 year old girl. Just doesn't seem like two things that would so strongly be going on at the same time in one person. Maybe this was the point, but I didn't relate to it, and I didn't like reading about it. I would choose another one of this author's books to spend my time on."},{"Title":"TAFT.","review":"this novel is written in the voice of a black male blues musician. who speaks completely differently than any black male blues muscians I've ever met. its like reading a bad translation of a french novel or something.

Similarly, black men in 1995 are not so afraid of being seen with a white woman that they sweat and panic.

My children would never want me to do that to them.There must be a deep psychological reason why individuals like Brian Morris make careers out of studying circumcision to death.I already knew it does not make sense to cut off a healthy, pleasurable, fun(!) part of somebody else's body.Hopefully not too many parents will be dazzled by Brian Morris's fancy footnotes, and will trust their parental instincts instead."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"It is a shame Brian Morris missed an opportunity to analyze and expose the lack of unbias objectivity in almost all the papers written on the topic of circumcision. Almost every source referenced in his book is slanted somewhat by the authors of the study. Too many of his references have conclusions that are not supported by the data presented in the paper. It is a shame he didn't bring this to light in his narrative.

It is amazing that there are actually few books written who are pro-circumcision compared to anti-circumcision books which are about 4 out of 5. I am from Europe and we do not do this to our males. When I tell my family and friends all over Europe what is done here, they shake their heads. None of my family, friends, neighbors, etc. had to ever be circumcised for any reason. It would be beneficial to teach young doctors what the benefits and functions of the foreskin are and not how to chop it off. I have heard of several young interns who had to perform circumcisions but refused and were then denied their MD status and where not allowed to practice in this hospital. That tells me something about the medical profession in this country.Now, the circumcision nazis are pushing circumcision in Africa to prevent Aids instead of teaching them to use condoms or educate the people in Africa. One can see the charts with the highest Aids counts and they are higher in the U.S. than in Germany and Japan. When I talk to my japanese friends, they tell me that the Americans are crazy and why is the US so clinging to this? It should have been outlawed 50 years ago and it should never have become normal practice. And the silly excuses people make for it like, urinary tract infections.

If the foreskin was so hazardous to a mans health why has mankind thrived for the past 2 million years without circumcision? Because the foreskin is not deadly which is why I left my son intact. He has had no problems of any kind at all. Reading books like this only makes me feel better about leaving my son intact because this book marks a new low for the pro-circumcision camp and shows just how desperate they've become in the lack of medical evidence.Very sincerly from a circumcised dad who's just a bit envious of his intact son."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"Brian Morris is a circumfetishist who pushes his sexual preference on little boys.

Intact males all over the world stand as proof the penis is created to stay clean, self-lubricate, and protect itself from disease by the presence of the foreskin.

In a time which boys are still not protected by law against highly unnecessary, dangerous, and invasive procedures such as circumcision, I find it offensive that the author does not make an honest effort to portray this issue.I feel that this book is nothing more than another attempt to continue a tradition that has no basis in medical practice. The facts are all skewed to fit the author's personal viewpoints, and thus makes the book unfit for serious consideration."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"This book was reviewed (above) in &quot;glowing terms&quot; by a physician, who openly admits to having circumcised a large number of unconsenting minors (who happen to be boys). Consequently, he has a vested interest in promoting genital reduction surgery (erogenous foreskin amputation). Are physicians now to take their medical advice from obsessive genital cutters, rather than from recognized professional bodies? Not one national medical association anywhere in the world recommends unnecessary circumcision!This book selectively cites outdated studies many of which have been thoroughly discredited in the scientific medical literature for decades. For example, this book states that penile cancer is reduced by circumcision. Nothing could be further from the truth. Representatives of the American Cancer Society (Feb 16, 1996) stated that infant circumcision is not a valid or effective measure to prevent penile cancer which affects only one in 200,000 males.The Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons stated (April, 1996) that &quot;neonatal circumcision has no medical indication.&quot;The Queensland Law Reform Commission (Dec, 1993) stated that &quot;routine circumcision could be regarded as a criminal act.&quot;The primary dictum of ethical medical practice is &quot;First do no harm.&quot; Yet there is now overwhelming evidence that infant circumcision causes irreparable harm physically, sexually, and psychologically.Much of the life-long harm caused by imposed genital cutting (on unconsenting minors) is documented in the British Journal of Urology, 1999 (Vol 83, Supplement 1).

He has only used the facts that helps him and ignored the vast majority that does not. Very poor book."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"My main problem with this book is that it represents itself as this great, ultimate guide to the subject when in fact it is far from that. There are many faults in this book. One of which is that the sources sited in the book are not up to date, have nothing to do with real people's actual feelings on the matter, and are far from unbiased. The latest studies on this matter show that circumcision has always and will always carry numerous risks ranging from penile curvature to severe sensitivity loss to penile amputation, erectile dysfunction and even death. Yes, these are the facts. Yet this book fails to mention these facts. In its over 100 pages it fails to show the true side of circumcision's very damaging results. And yet the author just keeps going with his decree of righteousness and feigned truth.This book, even in its entire bulk, is extremely unconvincing and lacks credit. Anyone can refute ALL of its claims in one paragraph.Circumcision carries many severe risks. Sexual pleasure is GREATLY reduced from circumcision. 90% of the planet's entire population are AGAINST circumcision. Circumcision hurts, in many ways. Circumcision cannot and never will prevent or cure ANY diseases, and to think it could is totally asinine. Circumcision of an infant or child robs them of their right to a whole body, while submitting them to danger.When you put all of this into perspective, you have to wonder &quot;exactly who is in favor of circumcision?&quot; Not many people, and for very good reason. The circumcision rates worldwide have been sharply decreasing for many years. This book actually claims the opposite, yet shows no proof of such claims! This is one of many such examples of the book's incorrectness.To be in favor of circumcision because one claims it can magically &quot;cure&quot; something is absolutely absurd. It's like trying to say &quot;well, we're going to cut off your arm because you might get a hangnail&quot;. One of the founding arguments in this book is that circumcision can somehow cure something, when in fact, this has NEVER been shown to be true. The inconsistencies with reality go on and on in this book. It's as if the author has deluded himself that he is right no matter what everyone else has proven.I am most certainly not in favor of &quot;In Favour of Circumcision&quot;. Call me an anti-circ person or whatever, but the facts show that 90% of the world are with me!

Judging by the glowing reviews below, there are many people out there who have been sucked into the whole mythology of circumcision and this book doesn't help the situation.Many claims are made in this book about circumcision's wondrous capabilities to cure cancers, fight diseases, etc, without having any proof to back up the claims. The sources cited are all outdated.In the Victorian era, circumcision was purported to cure insanity, blindness, lameness, hysteria, among other things, and most importantly masturbation. These claims have all been disproven. The same can be said for all the modern claims in this book. Science has proven that nature gave man a foreskin to prevent, not cause, diseases, and provide a natural, protective layer for the glans, as well as many important sexual functions. The most honest, unbiased, thorough research has been proving this time after time since the vast influx of circumcision to the Western world 100 years ago.This book actually suggest that nature has been wrong all along. If so, mankind would have become extinct long ago. The &quot;logic&quot; behind circumcision keeps getting sillier and sillier the more you read into things like &quot;In Favour of Circumcision&quot;.Circumcision is like a punishment searching for a crime.The only reason I gave this book even one star is because I can't rate it any lower!"},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"Getting straight to the point, this book is terribly one-sided and not very well written. It does not show the whole truth of this matter. The real truth is that most doctors do not recommend circumcision, especially &quot;routine&quot; circumcision. All the top pediatricians in the world have found circumcision to be totally unnecessary and painful and carries many dangerous complications. Just in the same way one doesn't go about pulling out all one's teeth just to avoid brushing them, one does not go hacking off body parts to avoid washing them. That's what this book is about: silly excuses for an unneeded procedure. If you're into fiction, this is the book for you.

This is not good, and of course that's going to threated people because some people out there are going to believe this schtick and mutilate thier children.This book basically is in favour of mutilating someone else's body just because it looks good on paper. You're darn right I feel threatened by that, and every decent person I can think of feels threatened by that aspect.As I read it, I couldn't help but feel like the author must be some sort of sick sociopath.

I have found all of the claims of the book to be upholding after my review. It is important to point out, however, that something of significant benefit to the population may mean little in individual cases. Also, I do think that the author's treatment concerning some of the negative aspects (in particular the possible psychological impacts) may be too brief in his book, even though I agree with him that many of the claims that circumcision is harmful lacks strong scientific evidence.Overall, I believe the book is well written and well referenced - useful for anyone studying this highly controversial topic."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"It seems that with the contoversial topic of circumcision the facts are replaced with emotion.

Finally we have a well-written book for the public by a scientist who objectively and accurately presents an evidence-based picture of the medical value of newborn circumcision. In particular, Dr. Morris reviews the significant studies over the past 15 years, which give compelling evidence of the protective effect of newborn circumcision against severe kidney infections in the first year of life. In addition, references are cited from over 40 studies showing that uncircumcised men have about a three-fold increased risk of contracting heterosexual HIV infection, leading the World Health Organization to recognize the role of circumcision in preventing world-wide AIDS. In contrast to the scores of anti-circumcision books and web-sites filled with anecdotes, testimonials, and opinions, Dr. Morris concentrates on published evidence, backed by a reference section. A review in the Journal of Urology characterizes a recent anti-circumcision book by two leading opponents of circumcision as &quot;a biased presentation of poorly collected data.&quot; Dr. Morris, by contrast, has given us a documented, updated review of circumcision as a preventive health measure, which confirms the advantages, including prevention of penile cancer, foreskin infection, and improved genital hygiene. Methods for performing circumcision are included, reflecting the current feeling that local anesthesia should be used in newborns to avoid pain. As an aside to the medical studies, Morris includes a section devoted to personal testimonies of men whose lives were improved by circumcision, as a counterbalance to the anti-circumcision witnesses.If you want an emotional, biased presentation of testimonials, beliefs, and anecdotes, tune into the web-sites and literature of anti-circumcision groups with catchy acronyms such as NOCIRC (National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers), NOHARMM (National Organization to Halt the Abuse and Ritual Mutilation of Males), RECAP (Re-Cover a Penis), and BUFF (Brothers United for Future Foreskins).

As a scientist he is also able to judge the merits of the scientific works of others. The book is based on the research contained in many medical papers that have been published in various highly respected medical journals. What makes the book so worthwhile is the fact that it contains up-to-date information and facts. These are presented in a clear, easy to read and - unbiased - manner, which can unfortunately not be said of many of the publications distributed by people belonging to the anti-circumcision lobby.In addition to the medical information, the book also contains a very interesting and revealing chapter on the anti-circumcision movement, pointing out their tactics and tendency to often twist medical facts to suit their own needs. Another valuable chapter contains the personal testimonies of men around the world.To summarize: this is a very valuable book, and a must-read for anyone who is interested in unbiased scientifically based facts. The anti-circumcision lobby is probably not going to like it, since it refutes many of their claims!!

Here's an excerpt from that very sensible review:&quot;In those with a normal bladder and kidneys the argument for circumcision may be akin to suggesting prophylactic removal of the tonsils or the appendix; the latter are obviously as silly as taking seriously any study supposedly concluding that either version of the penis 'looks better'. Also, is the author really serious in suggesting that routine circumcision is needed to prevent zipper injury? ...Unfortunately, once again, a presentation on the subject of circumcision has not advanced the development of a scientific approach.&quot;My professional opinion is that this book will be very useful to men seeking to validate their circumcised condition, and to parents who fear non-conformity and are searching for a &quot;scientific&quot; excuse that will justify an emotional need to subject their child to this senseless surgery."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"As a medical researcher myself I know that \\"researching a subject\\" involves more than just collecting information and anecdotes. When doing research, one must gather (and present) information on both sides of the equation and then critically analyse said material.This book appears to be nothing but a collection of critically unevaluated information and a lot of unscientifically, and frankly silly anecdotes and facile assumptions.As a scientist, the author should know these simple scientific maxims:1A. Any study, conclusion, or opinion predicated on flawed or invalid data is inherently flawed and invalid.1B. Any conclusion or opinion predicated on any number of flawed studies with invalid data is inherently flawed and invalid..2. Any data, study, conclusion , or opinion contradicted by reality is inherently flawed and invalid.I frankly do not see any evidence to support that he is aware of/or follows these maxims.Every study given by the author fails the test of both of these principals. Every study cited has admitted flaws and is contradicted when one looks at the rartes of the disease circumcision is purported to cure or prevent--the rate of EVERYONE of these diseases in non-circumcising Europe is the same as, or lower than in the circumcising USA.Since the implicit prediction in all of the studies purporting a reduction and/or cure is that a circumcising country MUST have lower rates of these, these studies do no meet the criterion of satisfying their prediction.And as far the facile assertion about getting the foreskin caught in zippers, does the author seriously want us to think that a circumcised man does or cannot get his penis caught in a zipper--and that it would not be worse as the more sensitive inner tissue would be entrapped instead of the less sensitive OUTER foreskin of the intact penis?As for the \\"Seinfield\\".. please give me break--how is this silly made-up sequence from a sitcom relative to the subject..Myths, superstitions and many bogus studies--I hardly see how this book could in any way provide any valid information to anyone other than those who know nothing about the subject and who do want VALID and PROVEN information--- and who do not wish to critically analyze it."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"This terrible book reveals that the author, Brian Morris is the one in need of medical treatment, psychiatric that is. A reader with even a rudimentary knowledge of anatomy and medicine will see immediately the self serving and almost rabid zeal this man has for cutting children.No valid reason exits to justify cutting an infant's genitals but Morris seems to feel that if he lists every possible excuse they will all add up to something. They do add up to a very good case that the advocates for such wounding of children qualify as sexually disturbed. Morris' \\"logic\\" extends to the ludicrous and racist as when he advocates cutting children's genitals for \\"societal class distinction\\" because, \\"The US National Health and Lifestyle Survey saw higher circumcision rates among whites and the better educated.\\"Thanks to various organizations dedicated to protecting children from unnecessary surgery the public is far more educated now about the real issues behind \\"circumcision.\\" We have yet to fully understand the fetishizing of this form of child abuse, though the one value this book has is as evidence that such mental illness exits."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"I'd love to read a well-written, factual book on the positive aspects of circumcision. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be one. For scientific information, Morris relies on studies that are generally recognised to be outdated, flawed, or spurious. He bases much of his work on science that has been thoroughly repudiated.The anecdotal evidence is somewhat better -- but contains very obvious editorial bias. The author has blatantly cherry-picked information to fit his conclusion, and presented it in such a slanted, propagandist fashion that it's almost impossible to take seriously.For those who feel that the circumcision debate could use a well-reasoned 'in favor' argument, look elsewhere. I was very disappointed in that this book is so easily debunked."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"This book is unmitigated rubbish. Poorly written by a moron.

The procedure is horribly demeaning to males and should have been eradicated during the sexual revolution or as an off-shoot of the women's movement. Anyone with respect for their children would not even consider this procedure, excepting of course, religious ritual. Make an informed decision? How is that possible with this lopsided manifesto for a useless cultural fetish? An ethical decision on elective surgery should only be made by the male whose person is being altered, not by the sexual fetishes of the community or by tiny, invented benefits subsumed by the risks. Only if there is an immediate health threat and inability to consent should another be forced to confront this decision (that would exclude well over 99% of American circumcisions and pretty much all neonatal ones). Why is cultural opinion here traditionally in favor? Because there is no discussion of men's rights and ethics in the context and men are scared to admit something wrong was done to their genitals. Cultural anecdotes are too maliable and misguided to base research on. I cannot believe that parents would do this to their children in 2009; it nauseates me."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"Despite what Mr. Morris writes about the benefits of circumcision, it hasn't been so in my experience. I was hoping to be encouraged by what I read, but none of it rang true for me. I am a middle-aged Amercian, and have watched my penile sensitivity decrease over the last 10 years. Thankfully (to other books, not this one), I now know the cause, and through restoration efforts in just 5 months, I've already regained some sensitivity (Believe me, you know when you feel more.). Based on my experience, I cannot in any way, shape, or form, recommend circumcision to anyone. No amount of case studies or facts in any book can persuade or distract me from seeing the wisdom in nature's protective foreskin. I think it's ok to read this book. But it won't help circumcised men recover any of their lost sensitivity. And this is the real issue and the sad truth about circumcision."},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"The author has taken the position that utilitarianism is more important than freedom and human rights, the simple principle of \\"my body my choice\\". All his writing on circumcision proceeds from that, in my opinion, flawed premise.Because HIV and other potentially life threatening STDs are less likely to be spread or acquired by circumcised males, the consequence of less sensitivity, removed nerves, the fairly frequent too much skin removed, occasional cut into the corpus cavernosa, occasional skin bridge, occasional uneven skin removal, and the rare amputation or death are ok in this author's eyes.Because there are too many irresponsible people out there who won't put on a condom, we should all have to be circumcised in this author's eyes as it will save more lives.The author needs to let people take personal responsibility for their own lives. Doctors and others in the health profession often have issues of codependency and feel the need to take care of others and make decisions for them.Doctors are usually considered smart. If that's the case, how smart do you have to be to realize cutting off genital tissue is a bad idea? And cutting off genital tissue on a minor who can't even consent is an absolutely horrible inhumane idea?This author has made a deal with the devil (I don't actually believe in devils), saving one life at the expense of reduced (though still very good) pleasure of another without that other's consent.My body, my property, my choice. When are we gonna get that enshrined as a Constitutional Amendment?\\"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\\" --C.S. Lewis"},{"Title":"In Favour of Circumcision","review":"The author needs to be commended on finding the 160 or so medical references to support his position. In the process he needed to overlook or dismiss 10 or more medical articles that did not agree with his bias for each article he found that he agreed with. Like Fox New, any claim to being unbiased should be viewed with healthy skepticism. While the author should be allowed to advocate his bias, he should stick with the facts rather than resort to ad hominem attacks. Doing so makes him look desperate and unprofessional."},{"Title":"Poland: A Historical Atlas","review":"This book seems to be to be a mock-up that accidentally got bound and sold before it had a chance to be edited by either the author or the publisher.

I had wanted a biography on Audrey Hepburn, but I hadn't expected this one. It is an expanded and revised edition. It contains new information not known when the previous edition of this book went to print, about Fidelma, Audrey's Irish stepmother, and more information on Audrey's father. I originally had my eye on \`Enchantment: The Life of Audrey Hepburn' by Donald Spoto. What I found however after reading 'Audrey: Her Real Story' first, is I really couldn't do any better then this book. \`Audrey: Her Real Story' is an exceptional book that wonderfully recounts her film career and humanitarian efforts. It also has marvellous quotes from Audrey Hepburn herself and is approved by her and those who know her. I really believe this is one of the absolute best books on her life. I also watched a lot of her films thanks to this book and really enjoyed most of them. There really aren't many poor film choices for Audrey. A great deal of effort and care had been taken to keep Audrey's image pure, like a princess. You'll find if you study her films she stays in a close group of friends, Billy Wilder and William Wyler are two great talents. Audrey also stays usually in Paris, and wears some of the most beautiful clothes designed by friend and life-long confidant Hubert de Givenchy. I do love the fact that Audrey started off as a dancer, and her time during the war was very brave. Due to work around the time of her first film, and Award-winning role in \`Roman Holiday', Audrey could not commit to first prospective husband James (later Lord) Hanson. It is however during her film \`Sabrina' she meets Mel Ferrer, twelve years her senior. Together they decide only to appear on stage and screen together. \`War and Peace' is one of their films together, but really wasn't praised by film critics. Neither was 'Wait Until Dark' that Mel produced or 'Green Mansions', Mel took a directing credit. Audrey had one son with Mel Ferrer called Sean Ferrer and appears with Audrey in Peter Bogdanovich's \`They All Laughed', a film I thought would have been better. I usually enjoy director John Huston films but I hated \`The Unforgiven.' John Huston hated it too. I also didn't think much of \`Robin and Marian'. Audrey's second husband was an Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, who wanted to marry a movie star, and not let her be a mother and a wife. Audrey unfortunately, had a lot of miscarriages. I really love Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall films and her three autobiographies. When I read about Humphrey's behaviour during 'Sabrina' I was shocked. I believed Lauren Bacall when she said of Humphrey that he had a lot of time for actors but had very little time for stars. I would have thought Humphrey would have got on better with Audrey then he did. The films of Audrey Hepburn I really enjoyed are \`Breakfast At Tiffany's', a role perfect for Audrey Hepburn, however Truman Capote would have preferred and wrote it for Marilyn Monroe. I love Marilyn's films too but she would have been so wrong for this film. I also loved Audrey in \`How To Steal A Million.' I also love Stanley Donen's films \`Funny Face' (I wrote a poem about it), \`Charade', and \`Two for the Road'. I loved 'Sabrina' as well, the remake with Harrison Ford isn't really worth mentioning, neither is 'The Audrey Hepburn Story' with Jennifer Love Hewitt, which could have been much better, but it's nice of her to be a fan. Audrey was closest to her father who loved her in 'My Fair Lady' best but was almost non-existent in her life. I truly believe Audrey Hepburn would have loved me had she known me. Audrey Hepburn had a remarkable life. I absolutely love this book. I would love to be recognised as one of Audrey Hepburn's best and devoted fans and hope to hear from other fans of her. I am thrilled she lived during some of my time on this earth. I love reading about actors lives.

Not only handles the mechanics of her films, but also gets into her personal life the ups and downs (mostly downs). This is not a coffee table - pretty picture book (Although there are gorgeous pictures of her, as any and all pictures of Audrey are). This book is a serious read. If you are a new found fan of Audrey Hepburn, this may not be the best book for you to start with, she was a very wonderful - but lonely lady. It is a sad story, a complete chronicle of her very private life including her work with UNICEF. A life very much meant to be cherished and remembered.

However, this bio contains more conjecture and fewer direct quotes from Hepburn \\"insiders\\" than the Barry Paris book. It also goes into more detail about her early career, her parent's fascist connections, and her relationships with her costars and husbands. Curiously, her adult relationship with her mother is largely ignored by the author.It's entirely possible that Walker had less cooperation from Hepburn's friends, family and associates, because this book is somewhat less flattering than the Barry Paris bio. For example, Walker makes no bones (bad pun) about her alleged off and on battle with anorexia, while Paris blows the rumors off.The author makes one egregious ommission; he fails to note Hepburn's last work, the superb Gardens of the World series for PBS. He notes only a \\"coffee table book\\" by that title for which he says Hepburn wrote the text. As she did not write the script for the series, it's unlikely that she would have written the text for any companion book. Gardens of the World does not even appear in the book's index! For credibility's sake, Walker really should correct this error in any future editions.Nevertheless, all in all this is a satisfying read for any fan of Audrey Hepburn.I'd recommend reading both books to get a more balanced view of this great lady."},{"Title":"Audrey: Her Real Story","review":"From Audrey's facinating childhood and tragic war experience and her sad rejection in dance, to her fabulous movie career and multiple marriages, we find that stars always confuse us with the images that they portray on the screen.

The works dated roughly from the 1930s to the 1990s, with the majority from the 1990s. As is common with anthologies for this region, for most of the stories information was lacking on the year of first publication.Older writers included Mayy Ziyada, Suhayr al-Qalamawi and Ulfat al-Idilbi, born in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, while Nura Amin and Umayma al-Khamis, born in the 1950s/60s, were among the youngest. Others included Samira Azzam, Layla Baalabakki, Salwa Bakr, Ihsan Kamal, Buthayna al-Nasiri, Alifa Rifaat, Nawal al-Saadawi and Hanan al-Shaykh and more recent, less well-known authors. Many of the stories were quite short, averaging four pages.The pieces were grouped by the categories of growing up female, love and sexuality, male/female relations, marriage, childbearing, self-fulfillment, customs and values, and \\"winds of change.\\" The intention was to introduce the English-speaking reader to Arab women's ways of life, currents of thought, and creative expression.The editor/translator selected the stories based on their artistic merit, the desire to include a variety of viewpoints and a wide range of subject matter reflecting \\"current interests and concerns of Arab women, from feminist issues to social and political problems to cultural and moral dilemmas,\\" and her own personal preferences. The preferences reflected a feminist and apparently secular outlook. Most of the works presented women struggling against traditional social values, restrictions or double standards, or showed the effects on women of such values.Stories enjoyed included the ironic \\"International Women's Day\\" by Salwa Bakr, in which a male teacher spoke to elementary schoolchildren about the need to appreciate women, but had trouble following his own advice, while the headmistress stood by listening idly and considering her own problems. \\"The Closely Guarded Secret\\" by Sahar al-Muji, in which a woman guarded carefully an unnamed secret all her life from parents and husband, preserving a sense of self. And \\"A Successful Woman\\" by Suhayr al-Qalamawi, in which a woman from the countryside sought love and success in Cairo, gaining and losing something in the process.Also: \\"Homecoming\\" by Fadila al-Faruq, which showed a woman who returned to an unnamed Arabic country after living in London and experienced severe culture shock. \\"I Will Try Tomorrow\\" by Mona Ragab, in which a writer's attempts to work were interrupted continually by the demands of raising her children. And Samira Azzam's \\"Tears for Sale,\\" which showed the mask a person wore, and how death could strip it away. This was among the most affecting stories in the book, though in this case an even more sensitive rendering in English exists in another collection.If anything was missed in this anthology, it was more stories written from an explicitly positive and religious perspective. Or maybe, that explicitly involved distinctly religious values as opposed to social ones.Something that came close to being positive was Alifa Rifaat's \\"My Wedding Night,\\" in which a woman overcame her distress on the first night, comforted by a Biblical story and the memory of a pure love from her childhood, and found that she and her husband could talk to one another and move beyond their anxiety.Any serious collection that presents literature from this part of the world in English merits applause and attention. I'd certainly recommend this book.

In addition to Mr. Runte's arguments for a return to good, affordable passenger service, he carries readers across the decades with stops at Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Glacier National Parks.If you have been searching for an attractive tome containing compelling arguments for a return to reasonable American rail service, then ALLIES OF THE EARTH is for you.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Allies of the Earth: Railroads And the Soul of Preservation","review":"Runte, who has written extensively about national parks, applies the same reasoning that supports their existence and preservation to the case for passenger trains as common carriers and agents of preservation. A rail-based transportation network, he argues, is a key component to maintaining the American landscape and fostering sustainable development and historic preservation. Written with authority and clarity, as well as a touch of the poetic, Runte shows how the US has failed to learn the lessons of its own past and Europe's present. It is an easy but thought-provoking read that will turn any environmentalist into a passenger rail advocate."},{"Title":"Allies of the Earth: Railroads And the Soul of Preservation","review":"This well researched, wrtten and handsomely illustrated book makes the case that the environmental, historic preservation and even the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, missed the boat in not seeking to preserve the private passenger rail network."},{"Title":"Allies of the Earth: Railroads And the Soul of Preservation","review":"Allies of the Earth: Railroads and the Soul of Preservation challenges America to rethink why it has all but abandoned its railroad systems for fuel-devouring automobiles and air travel - while these other machines may be faster, their toll on the environment and fuel resources is also higher. There are also less tangible boons to rail travel, such as the opportunity to look out the train window, and the pleasure of absorbing the journey rather than simply hustling to the destination. Surveying both American and European rail history, author Alfred Runte makes a call for renewed interest in experiencing the beauty of the countryside, and restoration of the railroads that America has foolishly disregarded for too long. A thoughtful and thought-provoking account written from the soul, Allies of the Earth postulates some interesting ideas about the role railroads could play in promoting national conservation and economic sustainability."},{"Title":"A narrative of the voyages round the world performed by Captain James Cook: With an account of his life during the previous and intervening periods","review":"If you know a young whipper snaper who has yet to sail beyond the mouth of the harbor, place this book within his/her reach and let them absorb its' contents at their own pace.

Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been. Here you have charecters of honor and dignity who thought their honor was more important than life itself. Something modern society has lost."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"For anyone whose only expsure to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the Sherlock Holmes tales, this book will be an interesting read. It's a fantastic adventure book, featuring characters with depth set in a truly historical setting. Doyle did his research, and while the characters may be mostly fictional, the rest of the book is historically accurate."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"A romantic intperpretation of the 100 years war.

This book is clearly about HONOR, and our aspiring knight is on his walkabout trying to decide where he should spend the rest of his life. Our hero is educated and an asset to the company.

This book combines the best of the movie &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. There is humor and adventure here. But never forget, it's about Honor, even when the characters are less the honorable. This story would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I seriously doubt that this really should be read to infants and preschoolers. However, the story was great when I was a precocious nine-year-old, and still is good to read now that I'm thirty something. See Spot run it is not.

It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story. I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"This books is definitely the stuff of childhood dreams and imagination. Who among you can say they have never imagined themselves playing the part of the intrepid knight battling injustice or the damsel awaiting the return of his true love? The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale. It is gripping without being brutal but with the endearing quality of a bed time or fireside tale."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I loved this book as a kid, and found new depths to it when I came back to it as an adult. A must-read! The breadth of imagination and the color and vividness of the descriptions are hard to match, and the characters are memorable -- Samkin Aylward the master-archer is my favorite."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

If you are a kid or if you are one of those grown up kids like me you will love this book."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Doyle is best known for his Holmes intrigue creations, but he considered these novels of chivalry and adventure as among his finest achievements, though they are not well known or attributed to his fame.

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many. You must read it!Strongest Recommendation!"},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The plot in this story seems to be quite simple, therefore the story becomes as simple as its plot is.

I found it to be an absorbing description of feudal times in England and what we now call France. I can readily see why the French dislike the English, although 700 years seems a long time to hold a grudge! The book is a fine adventure, with lots of detail about combat in the 13th century. The style may be a little slow for those used to a modern pace."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"My parents had a series of books when I was a child. They a book-of-the-month collection that contained the collected works of many of the most famous western authors such as Shakespeare, Balzac, Wilde, etc. They had them mainly for show but being an avid reader, I went thru many of them.My first introduction to Sherlock Holmes and Watson were in Sir Conan Doyle's volume but the story that fascinated me more than any other was \\"the White Company.\\" I read that story dozens of times. When my parents moved and decided to give the books to the school library, I kept that volume. Somewhere in the last 35 years it disappeared. Thank goodness I found it and the previously unread companion piece, Sir Nigel."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"Each poetically descriptive sentence is as a brushstroke that paints a colorful, lively picture of the scenery, landscape, characters, and events. You can picture everything very vividly in your mind. The characaters were each unique and fascinating. The story unfolded quite differently than I would have expected for a book about a war. It was a beautifully constructed story; an education about chivalry and how wars used to be fought. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book, and hope to re-read it in the future."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"2 of the most wonderful stories EVER written in one volume! How could you go wrong. A must for lovers of chivalry and romance."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"This book is a companion to Sir Nigel. The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery. Hard to distill where romance begins and pure history ends, yet harder, still, to let the book down."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"I enjoyed reading both books, but _The White Company_ was definitely better, IMHO. There were some minor inconsistencies between the two books--which were probably occasioned by Sir A. C. Doyle's desire to re-use some of the popular characters from the first book in his _Sir Nigel_ 'pre-quel.' (I won't detail the discrepancies, so as not to diminish the reading enjoyment for those who missed them.) I was glad I purchased both books together, though, because they're both worth reading. However, TWC seems to have a fresher quality."},{"Title":"The White Company","review":"The White Company takes place in Hampshire during the fourteenth century, or the Middle Ages. The main character is a sensistive and enthusiastic monk, Alleyene Edricson. He leaves his monk-bred ways to enter the real world as his father wished him to do. His goal is to change the ruthless ways of his brother, The Socman of Minstead. He firsts finds his brother harassing a beautiful lady. Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father. Alleyene goes off to war and gets involved in battle. Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization.

This is about as far the book goes. For a modeler who is looking for more close-up details and always hungry for a lot of color photographs in all prespectives possible, the book falls short of expectations. Modelers would be more rewarded from specialty publications like Concord Publications, Squadron &quot;walk- around&quot; series or the excellent publications from Verlinden."},{"Title":"Challenger Main Battle Tank 1982-97 (New Vanguard)","review":"I enjoyed the history of the Challenger tank and the author's frankness about its shorcomings (you do have to read between the lines, though, afterall, the author is British). These New Vanguard books are a compromise between larger, more detailed histories and photo books aimed at modlers. As with many compromises, not all will be satisfied. Its a good buy, what soured me was the interior cutaway lacked complete detail &amp; is hard to see some of the drawing due to the way the drawing is cut out on the centerfold page.

Using the jurors' own stories makes this a very interesting book because you really hear their thoughts in their own words.

It is warm, witty, funny and a wonderful read. There's even a wee little murder mystery stirred in for good measure. It reminds me of the light romantic comedies that Doris Day and Rock Hudson used to star in...I'm surprised Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks haven't made this into a movie. It'd be a blockbuster.I read this book out on the deck, and I was laughing with every delightful new plot twist. A gifted humor writer, Sue Civil-Brown comes up with the zaniest, most lovable characters I've ever seen: a no-nonsense geologist who doesn't believe in superstitions falling in love with an adorable young psychic named Rainbow Moonglow.Rainbow, you see, was born in a commune in the 1970s; her mother was into free love and doesn't know who the father was, but is still strict with her grown daughters'morals. And its a tossup who has the craziest uncle, Rainbow or her beau.The minor characters are a scream: the red-haired psychic/mother who wears purple because her spirit guide told her to; the retired Colonel who believes his military training can handle anything, including ectoplasm; the flirty ex-CIA agent with his goofy T-shirts; minor league mobsters; grandmothers who are hell on wheels on their motorbikes; playful spooks who play tricks on the living; and an assortment of colorful, crazy retirees in the Florida condo community.Buy this book, it's a laugh a minute. You'll fall in love with Rainbow and her pals."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"Whatever caused Rachel Lee to metamorphose into Sue Civil-Brown was a BIG mistake! Her three contemporaries as S. C-B. have all lacked the intensity, sensuality and emotion which made many of her pre-Conard County and Conard County books outstanding. Perhaps because I treasure some of her older books so much, my disappointment in her new work is even greater. Although I did not find her Lee books consistently good, C-B's Avon books are less enjoyable even than the Lee misses. The characters are plastic and the story is thin. I will not buy any more Avons. I hope she gets back on track. I know she can write novels that are memorable."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"I was really disappointed in this one. I had heard such great things about it, but it was too wacky. Too many characters, and you didn't care a fig about any of them. It just went on and on. Rambled....and, didn't focus on anything. Not worth the time."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"I enjoyed this book.Rainbow is a believable characther who has a special talent for sensing the unknowing. And when she is called into look at a haunted building where many senior citizens live, she doesn't know what she is getting herself into.Jake Carpenter is too logical and scientific for words. When he is voted president of the association and 'stuck' with Rainbow and a haunted building, little does he know the fun is just beginning.With a little help from above and a lot of help from Mary Todd, this couple has a hard time finding time alone to get to know each other and yet they really don't stand a chance in the romance. They make such a great couple and are just the kind of people I'd like to know in real life.The book just moves along at a fast pace and with a touch of humor and a touch of the out of the ordinary, this is a great beach reading type of book.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"Perhaps it is the wackiness of Rainbow herself that drew me into the story, but this has to got be my favorite Sue Civil-Brown/Rachel Lee book to date.I found the characters funny but believable. And Rainbow's special way of knowing kept me wanting to know more.Okay, I'll admit I got out a map and looked to see if there could really be a place called Paradise Island off the coast of Florida...cause it's a place I'd like to visit.Very funny--the perfect gift for a friend who needs cheering, or to spend some hours on a gloomy day."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"This was the better of the three romantic/comedy novels I read by this author. I won't read another though. Her secondary characters were a little easier to laugh at in this book, but the ending was anti-climatic. Her heroine was unsure of herself and this seems to be the case in all Civil-Brown's heroines. The hero was pushed into his role as an alpha male as well. These characters are hard for me to enjoy. The plot was busy and the characters were shallow. I'd invest in another author's book for entertainment."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"I don't think that anyone who gave this book a bad rating actually read the book. It's a refreshing, fun and well-written novel by one of the best authors ever. As for writing classes, this author certainly doesn't need any!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"Chasing Rainbow is fresh comic romp. Written with verve and wit, it explores the outer fringes of New Age thought while deftly exposing the tender and ageless area of the human heart. The setting is wonderfully realized, and the characters resonate with life - especially the secondary geriatric crowd who act as a cheering squad for the antics of hero and heroine. I can't remember when I've had so much fun."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"This zany romance stands apart from the crowd with its cast of offbeat characters.

I hope Sue Civil Brown will keep on writing as I want to keep on reading her books."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"This is not the same type of book that Rachel Lee is acclaimed for. She is writing under the name of Sue Civil-Brown and, therefore, one expects a different type of writing and plot. In this book, she has created characters and situations which are lighter and more given to comedy than the most popular books she writes under the name of Rachel Lee. I found her characters to be engaging and very human. The &quot;ghost-busters&quot; with their dust buster ghost vacuums were pure whimsey and delightful. I, too, prefer this author's more serious books but I also understand that she fulfills the publisher's requirements and demands. Read her books under both her author names and you have variety and enjoyment. After all, she is recognized as one of the most popular writers in these fields today."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"After being very happy with most of AVON's other single title romances, I was astonished and outraged that they would publish such a book. There was no conflict between the characters, and the author tended to write things that are anatomically impossible, e.g. &quot;She growled disgustedly&quot; -- the physical muscles involved in both of those things work in OPPOSITE ways. Ms. Civil-Brown would do best to take some basic writing classes, and AVON would do best to stick to their usually high standards, set by such wonderful writers as Susan Elizabeth Phillips."},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"This book is a lot of fun and laughs, with some zany heartwarming characters I hope to see again.This is not a Rachel Lee book, which is why the author is using a different name.But if you need laughs and a lot of smiles, this is just what the doctor ordered!"},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"I have read all three of these books and this is the last one I will read.

All Jake wants is time to relax and work on a book. However, his rest ends almost when he arrives in Paradise Beach, Florida. An elderly neighbor informs him that the residents elected him president of the homeowners association whether he wants to be or not.The locals tell him that he needs to rid their building of the ghosts that haunt it, something the skeptical scientist scoffs at being untrue. He becomes irate when he learns that his fellow residents have hired a local psychic Rainbow Moonglow to provide them advice. Jake thinks she is a con artist, preying on senior citizens. She informs him that she is not being paid for her services. As the ghosts shake his very logical foundation, Jake finds his attraction to rainbow even more unnerving. Still as they work togetherto uncover the mystery behind the supernatural happenings, they fall in love.CHASING RAINBOW, the sequel to the amusing LETTING LOOSE, is another zany comedy from the wonderful Sue Civil-Brown. The jocular story line is a well-designed contemporary romance that includes supernatural and natural interference. The lead protagonists are as opposite as a duo can be except for their growing love to one another. The support cast, including several return engagements, adds much mirth to the terrific tale. Fans will plead with Ms. Brown to provide readers with a trifecta by returning us to this wacky condominium.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chasing Rainbow","review":"This book is fun and reminiscent of those early JAK stuff. However, problem lies in Ms Civil-Brown putting in too many characters - the hero, the heroine, the over-the-top mom, the plain sis, the eccentric tenants of the condo... there is little space for any emotional intensity, much less breathless passion.Also, the hero behaves like a jerk at the beginning of the book and I waited for a nice long begging-for-forgiveness session. Alas, it never came.This book is light, frothy, fun, but light in emotional intensity."},{"Title":"Dope Run","review":"\\"Dope Run is excellent writing, easy to follow and very interesting.\\"-Sheriff of Martin County, FL\\"I began reading it and couldn't put it down.\\"- Robert Flynn,Novelist in residence at Trinity University\\"I do not read much for pleasure, but I could not stop reading Dope Run until I had finished it.\\"- Mary Samuel\\"Great book!\\"- Thomas James LittmanDOPE RUN by Curt LittmanTerror filled flights over open water in an overloaded WW II surplus aircraft containing enough contraband to put the pilot and crew in jail for the next hundred years, running gun battles on the high seas with United States Customs agents, tenuous negotiations with cutthroat Colombian middlemen, and concerted efforts to stay a step ahead of numerous law enforcement agencies and zealous cops, all provide for stomach churning, nerve bending action in Dope Run. Two entrepreneurs conspire and then work to import more than a million dollars worth of illegal drugs onto the shores of Florida, expecting from their highly unlawful efforts an envious profit of a small fortune to be divided between them. Expecting momentarily, after a period of several months, a double cross, or a sellout to the cops, these two men, as different in personality as night and day, partner in their conspiracy to smuggle from Rio Hacha, Colombia, to a drug lord in Memphis, Tennessee, enough dope to sink a boat - or an airplane. The plans are well laid, but the contingencies are many. No one on either side knows who can be trusted. No one knows how much the cops know, or if they simply know nothing, which is much preferred. Alert at each step for a setup, a rip-off, a frame-up, ambush, or arrest, the plotters work through the myriad hazards of planning and executing the smuggling enterprise.

Peter Thompson. This time, however, there's a new alien in town who is even more heinous in appearance than Broxholm and with a strange new pet named Poot.In the first novel, an alien named Broxholm takes over one of the local middle-school classrooms as a substitute teacher, with the expressed intention of capturing five children (the smartest kid, the dumbest kid, and the three most average kids) to take back to his alien space ship for further study. In the first novel Broxholm is painted as quite the enemy, and it is with cheering we root for Susan to defeat this evil, kidnapping alien.As the first novel is a standalone book first and foremost (kind of like THE HOBBIT in that Coville had no real sequel in mind when he wrote it), it is very self-contained and can be read on its own without reading the other three. Starting with this sequel, Coville begins building a storyline that will not be fully resolved until the fourth installment in the series, MY TEACHER FLUNKED THE PLANET.For this installment, a new alien has come to town, but the name of Kreeblim. Unlike Broxholm, who is harsh and rather strict, Kreeblim has a much sweeter disposition, and in personality much the opposite to Broxholm. Her mission is similar to Broxholm; conduct teaching experiments on the human race, to study how we learn. Her mission was supposed to end when Broxholm's did, but due to his sudden departure with Peter Thompson at the end of the first book, she is left to her own devices for a while, and decides to conduct some further field research by unleashing one of her student's unrealised brain potential.Enter Duncan Dougal. The common dime-a-dozen school bully from the first novel, this installment is told totally from his POV. Coville gets into his head a lot, and helps young readers understand what made him the way he is through his home environment, and how his family life shapes his social interactions with the other characters. Duncan, the traditionally stupid bully, has a change of heart when Kreeblim uses a device in class that enables him to begin unlocking the full potential of his brain. Ultimately, this has unforeseen consequences which Kreeblim uses to contact her colleagues to send a ship to pick her up.There's quite a few more details along the way, including the introduction of Kreeblim's bet Poot, a gelatin like animal who can be split into several new pieces (asexual reproduction) and figures prominently in both this and the last book. There is also a skin glove that Duncan finds that helps him realise a new alien is in town. (Of course, you can't help but wonder why Duncan, who becomes a genius by the end of the book, couldn't put two and two together and realise who the identity of the alien is when it's pretty obvious to the reader for most of the book. Even Kreeblim comments on this oversight of Duncan). Coville's main focus throughout the book is the awesome unrealised potential of the human brain, which comes into prominent display in the last book as well.At the end of the novel, Peter Thompson arrives, telling Susan and Duncan there is the Earth is in serious intergalactic trouble, and is the cause of much turmoil. The three children are whisked off into outer space to be briefed by what is the rough equivalent of the United Nations for the Galaxy (though the more appropriate term would be United Planets or United Solar Systems or United Star Systems, something along those lines), and so the stage is set for the events in MY TEACHER FLUNKED THE PLANET.One of the biggest changes from the previous novel is the readers' and characters' perceptions of the aliens. In the previous book, Coville painted Broxholm as the villain and leaves it at that. It is only in the three sequels do we learn that Broxholm and Kreeblim (who is actually Broxholm's superior), are actually on an anthropological mission on earth to investigate what the Intergalactic League has labeled \\"The Earth Question.\\" And what is that question? Why are people so full of pain and rage and destroy themselves. Also, why do they have the most amazing brain in the entire known galaxy and use so little of it.Throughout the book, Coville is clearly addressing learning issues, and helps his target audience of children relate to learning as a positive experience, as well as address the \\"human condition\\" that is everybody's problem. He also helps children relate too and further understand what makes Duncan a bully, and with this character he allows the children to build sympathy with a previously unsympathetic character.Overall, this is a good novel for middle-schoolers, and an enjoyable story for adults as well. I read [(and reread)] the books when I was growing up numerous times, and have returned to them periodically in adulthood. The series is well-written enough that adults reading will find the books rather enjoyable, quick reads. But be warned. You can read the first one as a stand alone work. However, starting with this one, Coville leaves you hanging at the end, and you need to read the next two installments to get finish the full story arc. And the story arc is good enough that I encourage you to keep reading."},{"Title":"My Teacher Fried My Brains (A Minstrel Book)","review":"This sequel to Bruce Coville's popular My Teacher is an Alien reunites us with Susan Simmons, the protagonist and narrator of the first book, Peter Thompson, her brainy science fiction-loving friend, and Duncan Dougal, class bully and somewhat questionable ally in the previous adventure involving the kids' sixth grade teacher being replaced by a big green alien in disguise. Duncan was an important yet secondary character in the first book, but he takes center stage in My Teacher Fried My Brain. The story itself isn't as exciting as that of its predecessor, but I love the angle that Coville took in returning to this world of adventure. There is a definite psychological component to this story, one providing insight into why Duncan behaves in such a disruptive matter - there is a real, pretty nice person in there just dying to get out. Duncan now becomes a sympathetic character from the very first page, as we get a good look at his home life and see how this translates into his own behavior around other kids. It bothers Duncan to no end to be unable to control his mouth and (sometimes) fists; even when he is doing something stupid that will just get him into trouble, he is inwardly berating himself as he is doing it. The one thing that Duncan hates more than anything in the world is to be laughed at; this is a feeling all children as well as adults know a little something about, making Duncan a character that anyone can connect to in some way.The kids are now in seventh grade, and Duncan's first day in a new school building is a rough one; as always, he finds trouble, and this time trouble reaches back and finds him as well. He makes a startling discovery - a discarded human hand which, upon closer inspection, turns out to be a fake human hand. That can only mean one thing: there is another alien at the school. Like Susan in the first book, Duncan does not know what to do. He knows no one will believe him, not even his classmates; you would think the adults in town might be of some help, but they have all started pretending that the alien business of last spring didn't actually happen. Duncan soon thinks he has found the answer to his problems. After taking part in a demonstration of static electricity, one in which a machine zapped his brain, he began to feel smarter all of a sudden; he soon decides to sneak in to the lab and give himself additional brain-frying treatments. Despite all of his new-found intelligence, though, he has little success in figuring out who the other alien in school is. The ensuing action is not bad, plus we meet a memorable and mysterious alien pet called a poot, but a few aspects of this story resemble pretty closely the strange events chronicled in Coville's previous book, My Teacher is an Alien. The manner of Peter's \\"return\\" is especially weak, in my opinion.If you want to read this book, I definitely encourage you to buy all four books in the series. My Teacher Fried My Brain has a cliffhanger kind of ending that leaves a great deal unresolved. It's a fun ride with great friends, though, so most young people who read this book will surely want to dive right in to My Teacher Glows in the Dark to see what happens next."},{"Title":"My Teacher Fried My Brains (A Minstrel Book)","review":"As a 6th grade teacher, I liked this book and the first book, &quot;My Teacher is an Alien&quot;, because it got my students interested in my favorite genre of books, science fiction.

It was suspenseful and you didn't know what would happen next. The book was about a kid named Duncan. He is not too bright until his principal also called the Mancatcher volunteers him to go to the front of the class in science and put a big machine on his head. Then someone turned the crank and it felt like ants were walking around his brain. Then he realized it made him smarter. He went back at night to the classroom and used it again. But he used it too many times and now he has five senses. He can hear the radio and tv in his head. He goes to the home economics teacher which he thinks she is not the alien but boy he's in for a surprise. If you want to know what happens to Duncan, you sould read My Teacher Fried My Brains."},{"Title":"My Teacher Fried My Brains (A Minstrel Book)","review":"In this book Duncan, the main character, was actually quite dumb. He didn't really know much until, HE FRIED HIS BRAIN!!!!!!!!! After that he was the smartest kid in the sixth grade. After he got super smart, the alien wanted Duncan's brain.

When he is kidnapped by an alien teacher, he finds Peter Thompson, a kid who was kidnapped by aliens last year.My favorite part was when Duncan Dougal found the hand in the dumpster.

This story continues where MY TEACHER IS AN ALIEN left off, and lets you know the story behind Duncan Dougal (the class bully). His life is pretty rough, seventh grade is going pretty badly, and he only has one nice teacher--Miss Karpou. When he finds out that one of the teachers at the school IS an alien and no one believes him, Duncan feels that he has to prove there's a threat.He ends up getting his brain *fried* to increase its brain power--and meets the alien's pet, Poot. Poot has to be one of the most appealing sidekick-pets ever.

He seldom discusses the specifics of the book in question, rather, he just dismisses the whole field. Well as long as we're at that level, I'd remind him Kurt Godel showed that it is impossible using usual methods to be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not lead to contradictions. So I guess we should can anything based on arithmetic. I wonder if he also haunts the theology book review pages touting the lack of empircal proof for god's existence?

Professor Dr G Matheron was so pleased with Krige's convenient method to augment sparse data in large sample spaces that he himself conferred on Krige the honorific \\"krige\\" eponym. Krige, Matheron and scores of nascent geostatisticians did not know in those innovative days that every distance-weighted average has its own variance simply because one-to-one correspondence between weighted averages and variances is inviolable in mathematical statistics. On the contrary, statistically dysfunctional geostatistians decided to replace the true variance of the SINGLE distance-weighted average with the pseudo kriging variance of a SET of degrees-of-freedom and variance-deprived functionally dependent kriged estimates. It makes no scientific sense whatsoever to assume spatial dependence, interpolate by kriging, smooth pseudo kriging variances, and rig the rules of mathematical statistics. In time, nobody may remember when and why the distance-weighted average became a kriged estimate. And who said what's in a name?"},{"Title":"Because You're Mine","review":"Seduction at its best!

He is an unwitting innocent who falls head over heals for her heartless seduction. But they both lose their hearts and gain far more than they had hoped."},{"Title":"Leading Others, Managing Yourself","review":"McGinn has done a great job of doing something that good strategists do: seeing close things at a distance and distant things closely. Using a concise, understandable framework he reviews ten basic laws of leadership. He provides excellent overviews and these are shaped in ways which lead directly to useful action. This is not book of theory unachored by reality nor is it a tedious series of practical tips which fail to hang together.The book is a deceptively quick read because it not only provides immediate ideas for action it also gets below the surface. Some examples: \\"There Is No Right Way: The First Law of Management\\" \\"If Everyone Is Doing It, Either It Is the Wrong thing, Or It Is Too Late: The Second Law of Strategy\\" A number of chapters have useful summary tables such as \\"Figure 2. Knowing Versus Doing\\" which helps the reader to understand that doing what is right means that the leader needs to consider those things that are easy to do and hard to do and then to look and how they intersect with knowing what is right as a function of the things that are easy to know and hard to know.This book can be useful for first line supervisors preparing for greater responsibility, middle managers working to deal with day to day challenges and senior managers wanting a broader, more conceptual framework to use when evaluating their work and its impact in the context of the overall organization. It should be on a leader's bookshelf for repeated use and sharing with others in the organization. It is a gem."},{"Title":"Leading Others, Managing Yourself","review":"One of the best management helps I've ever read.

It opened up great new possibilities. Sure, your box of 8 had carried you a long way --but 64 . . . ah! . . . the possibilities.Most business books are a 'box of 8'. Peter McGinn's Leading Others, Managing Yourself is a 'box of 64'. Yes,it includes some tried-and-true colors (navy blue/Doing the Right Thing and forest green/If You Can't Measure It, You Can't Improve It) but it also has many unexpected and brilliant lessons (periwinkle/If Everyone Is Doing It, Either It Is the Wrong Thing or It Is Too Late; magenta/The Platnum Rule; even purple pizzazz/Seven 2X2 Think Tables.And, the book is laid out like a box of crayons -- with shades of the same color, or in this case, elements of the same basic law/principle, grouped together. That makes the book easy to read and easy to use.I give the book FIVE STARS -- gold stars that is."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"I had read &quot;Programming Python&quot; (Mark Lutz) befrie getting this book, and I expected a lot more on network programming than what this book provides. I would definitely call the title &quot;Internet Programming with Python&quot; false advertising.Aside from this (very annoying) shortcoming, the book might provide a good overview of the Python programming language. I didn't go over all the syntax, GUI and other topics as I already had covered them in the other book.I would recommend Programming Python over this book."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"Instead of giving this book an opportunity to become a best-seller, the publisher let it become out of print. An unfortunate effect is that my students could not buy the book, and have to share the library copies. This book is beautifully written, enormously useful and fun to read because of authors' good sense of humor. Chapter 7: &quot;Generating HTML&quot; gives one of the best introductions to object orientation and dynamic features of Python. I urge the authors and the publisher to work quickly to make the book available."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"This book is co-authored by the author of the Python language, and his style shows through -- to the benefit of the book. Just as in Pyhon, the book is clear, concise, and easy to read. It stresses just how enjoyable programming in Python can be. After having coded in Python for a while now, I can't agree more. I'm a MAJOR fan of C++, but now that I've found Python, my vote is split. For my work, which is cryptography, I use C++, but for everything else, I'm a Python man. The book is surprisingly light reading for a technical book. This does not mean that it is short on content. In fact, the author maintains the lightness by sticking to the sort of Python programming you will encounter when coding for the internet. It did feel a bit skimpy on writing server code (like an HTTP or finger server), sticking more with CGI scripts. For a complete understanding of Python in greater depth, make sure to also buy Mark Lutz's book. It makes for great expert-level Python learning. Buying the two books won't set you back much in the way of $$, but if read in order (first Watters and then Lutz) will make you very happy. Take a crack at Python. You'll learn the language in a day or two, and you'll find yourself using it more and more."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"The book's title probably has been chosen to attract attention. That said, it is an excellent book. The standard book, Programming Python by Mark Lutz, may bog neophytes down.The first half of the book is an introduction to the language and the second half applications loosely connected to the Internet.The language is worth knowing, but I'd have liked a book with exercises."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"This book does an excellent job explaining how to use Python in general, including internet programming. It also includes a CD that enables the buyer to set up Python on their own system, be it Win95, Dos, Unix, etc. Unfortunately, this CD does not include a setup program. It does include some instructions for setting it up, however, this is not a straightforward process. I would recommend this book only for someone who has at least little programming experience and knowledge of their operating system."},{"Title":"Internet Programming With Python","review":"Awesome book, I liked Chapter 3 which instantly gets you into useful programming stuff. The book also takes you from beginner-level to advanced stuff like extending and embedding python, sort of the python equivalent of the Perl camel book (programming perl) and panther book (advanced perl programming) rolled into one. I think there's enough stuff on net programming to justify the title. The CD-ROM in my copy of the book has python 1.3, the current version is 1.5 something. The book too might be dated, but I skimmed the latest ORA python book, Learning Python, and I think this is more my speed."},{"Title":"Sports Tourism: Participants, Policy and Providers","review":"I did my Masters dissertation on 'outdoor adventure' sport tourism and I got really fed up with the Noddy books that were available to me (eg Standeven and DeKnop \\"Sport Tourism\\", Hudson \\"Sport and Adventure Tourism\\"). Now I'm starting a part-time PhD on sport tourism this book has enabled me to really think theoretically and conceptually about the area, its the only book I've come across that doesn't treat the topic in a really basic manner. The book goes beyond the usual impacts and events material to develop an analysis of industry stakeholders and the pariticipants in the sport tourism industry. The model of sport tourism participants is particularly useful in thinking about different types of sport tourists. Throughout the book its clear that the authors are drawing on a wide range of empirical research, and their perspectives and arguments are coherent and consistent. In fact, the cohenrence of the book is one of its strengths and something that elevates it above many other books in the area, particularly those that are edited collections."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I expect I'm always going to compare all of Pat Conroy's works, every one, to \\"The Lords Of Discipline\\". At the same time, I expect I will always be comparing other works of fiction, any and all, to those of Pat Conroy.I'd hate to just say, \\"You can see where 'The Lords of Discipline' came from\\" because this novel is too good to just be summed up as forever standing in the shadow of Conroy's most famous book. That is true, however. This isn't, I feel, quite so good a book as \\"The Lords of Discipline\\", but it's darned close. It is a simple matter for me to understand how, four years after \\"The Great Santini\\", a book whose very name is legend followed. Such novels as that don't happen overnight. It took time for Conroy to get to that point. Perhaps the best way I could sum up how Conroy writes in this book, the overall flow and feel of it, would be to liken it and Conroy's next book to a batch of cookies. Sure, this one is maybe a little burnt here, maybe a little burnt there. But it's a real good cookie nonetheless. A cookie that happens to be sitting in the middle of an on-and-off bar fight.Anyway, the book's namesake is the boisterous, charismatic and flawed LTC \\"Bull\\" Meecham, head of a household not run, but commanded, by the self-proclaimed greatest fighter pilot of all time. A warrior without a war, Meecham runs his family as he runs his Marine fighter squadron, demanding much of his children, his wife, and his pilots.He is, by the end of the book, easy to love and hate at the same time. The Meecham children certainly take such an attitude towards Bull, wanting him to be their father while he insists on spending more of his time being their commander.Ben Meecham, who, like Will McLean, is no doubt a character based to a fair degree on Conroy himself, is the main character of the book, and his relationship with Bull, mostly bad but sometimes good, is the center of much of the book since, in addition to being the main character, Ben is also the oldest. Like some of Conroy's other books, this one has basketball featured prominently. Ben Meecham has a great love for that game, as surely does Conroy.Anyone who's grown up in a military family will surely identify with the way of life that the Meechams live. Their lives have been dominated from the very beginning by their father's career, and as often as not this leaves them with little love for the Corps to which Bull is so fully dedicated.I don't want to to into telling the entire plot, but the book, and its namesake, go a long way through its 440 pages. When you meet Bull Meecham, after crashing a Navy captain's dinner, he is cheerfully running turtles over on the highway at night as his family moves yet again. When he leaves us, and his family, you will likely still hate him, but you'll miss him, too. Bull is both deeply caring and horribly cruel, a magnificent man and a glaringly flawed one.This particular edition of \\"The Great Santini\\" is 440 pages long, paperback, published in December 1987 by Bantam Books. I particularly like this version of it, since the artwork and cover text is much the same as one edition of \\"The Lords of Discipline\\". The illustrations make little sense before you read the book. By the time you have finished, you'll know what all of them mean. Never fails, and it's a characteristic I've found unique to Conroy novels. So many others have illustrations, sure, but no other author has managed to find cover art quite like this. It tells a story, all by itself."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Love this book, well written, great story, funny, real people. Pat Conroy is one of the best authors of our time. Wrong airplane on the cover."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Loved this book and of course the author. Service was excellent and a great way to shop!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"As with all of Pat Conroy's works, this is a very \\"heavy\\" novel. It is sometimes painful to read and in general I did not like Bull, the main character, but loved Ben, the son. Just when you are ready to give up on Bull, he does something so good and out of character, that you realize he does indeed have some redeeming qualities. This is not casual, light reading but a profound work that will remain with you long after the close the book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I saw the movie many years ago, when I had never heard of Pat Conroy.. Robert Duvall played Bull and Jessica Lange played his smart southern wife, They were perfect playing the tough marine fighter pilot and his somewhat long suffering wife.The book was written beautifully. You knew those characters well. That's how Conroy writes.I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the book after going back in time and remembering the movie and my pure disgust for BULL/Duvall, being the awful bully he was to his family.I was wrong. It was an excellent read and a truly compelling story of a Marine family that, of course, had relocated many times and how that was for the family. Being that this took place in the 50's, times in the south were so different although sometimes I think they are not so different at all...just more politically correct. In short, read it.. I would read it again."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"As Advertized, did not note it was from UK, but that is fine. Nice book in great condition."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Ben Meechum is the 17-year-old son of Bull Meechum, a fierce Marine fighter pilot. But Bull is often an even fiercer father not afraid to hit his wife and children. The Meechum family have a love/hate relationship with their father - they want nothing but his approval and love yet often fear him more than respect him in the seemingly losing battle for affection. For Ben, this battle is that much harder as the oldest son of this very tough man. Ben believes in civility and respect, Bull in proving that you are the toughest son of a bitch around.In this coming of age story, we observe Ben as he struggles with his conscience all the while trying to earn his father's respect. This book contrasts family with friendship and addresses racial and social status issues set in early 1960s South Carolina. It is the story of a family that can do nothing right for their father and a father who cannot figure out how to convey his love for family without showing a crack in his tough Marine exterior.Very few authors capture a readers attention and emotion like Pat Conroy. You will connect with the characters and be devastated when the book is finished. I felt emotion at the end that I wouldn't have thought possible 100 pages previous. Pat Conroy used his own life as a basis for this story but took the characters in different directions. My only complaint is that I found out that some of this is Conroy's true story by reading My Losing Season first. Had I not read this later book I may have gotten into the characters even more. This is Conroy's first novel and I suggest you read it before his later memoir. But no matter what Conroy novel you read, you will find yourself in the middle of fantastic storytelling."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I love Pat Conroy, but I just don't feel this book. I've read it over the course of several months, with many other books in between. I didn't want to abandon it completely, so I kept reading, but wasn't taken by the charackters. I loved Prince of Tides, BEach Music, The Lords of Discipline, so I was very excited about this book. But it makes me feel better that it was his first book, not last, it means he became much better writer since that first book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Received book quickly and it was in very good condition, as stated. Highly recommend this seller. I hope to buy from them again."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Pat Conroy's The Great Santini is a truly a story of comming to age for Ben Meecham, Bull &quot;The Great Santini&quot; Meecham's son. Bull Meecham wants his family to run like the Marine Corps. which he so proudly loves. However, families dont work like this and is very apparent throughout the course of the book. Bull is also trying to relive his childhood through his oldest son, eventually driving him to do an outrageous event. However, through all the harsh things he does, you'll grow to love and appreciate him, just as his family did, and learn of a secret love between Bull and his son Ben under the fighting between the two.BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS:The Lords of Discipline - Pat Controy"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"\\"The Great Santini\\" is the story of Ben Meecham, a high-school senior, with interests in writing and basketball, who struggles with trying to please his sadistic marine father, Bull Meecham. The story is riveting as Ben attempts to adjust to a new school and cope with his father's disapproval. Bull is a character you won't forget. He is overly hard on his son, often calling him names and mentally abusing him. Ben's dad wants one thing for his son- to become a marine fighter pilot. He shows his affection for his son in enough suttle ways, that despite his many obvious short-comings, it is difficult to hate Bull. Ben is conflicted between following the wishes of his dad, or following his own heart. Much of the story is autobiographical based on Conroy's experience of growing up with a strict military father. I greatly enjoy all of Conroy's books, and this earlier work is no exception."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The Great Santini is absolutely beautiful to read. There's something about Conroy's characters that just draws one into the vortex of their lives. Each character is so individually unique and so real, that by the end of the novel, I feel as if I had grown up with the Meecham family! Conroy is incredibly skilled at creating totally engrossing characters who each have their own struggles and motivations... (all the major characters, even minor characters are very fully developed.)Bull Meecham and Ben Meecham of course are my favorite characters in this novel...but all of the supporting characters are not far behind. It amazes me how Conroy lets the reader so intimately into his own family history...sometimes I believe it is even more powerful than any autobiography could ever be.One of my favorite qualities of &quot;The Great Santini&quot; is the dialogue. Pat Conroy is hilarious --the wit and pace of the dialogue between the characters had me laughing out loud so many times. And in trademark Conroy style, a few pages later, I'll find myself tearing up!The Great Santini revolves around the family life of a family of a Marine Aviator Officer...the novel follows them as they are transplanted to a new South Carolina town. The story is told from the perspective of the son, Ben Meecham.I'm always so amazed by Conroy's ability to pen a love story...his love for his characters and storytelling shines through his writing and imagery. The Great Santini is an incredible (and disturbing) look into the love of a father-son, husband-wife, man-occupation, friend-friend. Conroy also does an excellent job at exploring racial tensions and the journey of a boy becoming a man. (I'd recommend reading &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; too! Many parallel ideas....)I absolutely love this book! I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who wants to be swept off their feet by one of the best authors of our time."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I loved this book and I hated this book. Especially Bull Meecham, who I despised at times as much as I could not help but love him. All of the characters, no matter how minor, are so integral to this book, that with out any one of them, this book would not have been such a fascinating and hard to put down read. Well written, although occasionally I found myself having to go back and re-read parts because it would get a little confusing. Other times I had to go back and re-read parts because I would get so involved that I would skip over words in my haste to read more. A somewhat gritty and harsh book about an egomaniac of man, his wife and their children growing up under the highs and lows of his mood swings, in their latest home in the South. As another reviewer mentioned, Bull's personality only made him more human, something that he and other characters, especially his children, had to deal with. He was aptly named."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This book was an excellent read- another classic Conroy novel with beautiful language and vivid desciptions. Though many people thought Bull Meecham was the best portrayed character in this novel, I thought Ben's younger sister stole the spot light with her dry sense of humor and hidden dark sides. I definately recommend this!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I loved this book. As the son of a fighter pilot (one who was very different than Bull Meacham, but who would have understood him ), I thought this book captured the life of a military family perfectly.Many readers will read this book and think Bull Meacham is not a honorable or likeable person. I disagree. His method of dealing with his family may leave much to be desired, but he is a hero and a man of honor and integrity.We should be thankful that men like Don Conroy, the author's father and role model for Bull Meacham, lived and fought to protect the freedom we so often take for granted.I recommend this book to everyone, and give it out frequently as a gift."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This book is great. In a way, I'm able to relate my own life to the characters. Bull started out to be a joker yet over the years... became a very ungrateful man. This definitely shows at the end of the book when Ben is very upset due to his fathers (Bull), expectations."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I found the book to give a different perspective on the &quot;american family&quot;. I was delighted to see the great detail that Pat Conroy used when describing the emotions of the characters. Great book to read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Those of you who have grown up with a military parent, or forthose who are in the military, this book will have special meaning foryou. One aspect of this book is its realism, some where in America there is some family being raised by a military parent that is dealing with the same issues this book deals with. This is a story about real life, which is why I liked it so much. Having military in my family I was able to have a special connection with the characters in the story."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I read this book at the suggestion of several friends, who thought it was Conroy's best. I'd just finished &quot;Beach Music,&quot; which I feel is much more developed and well-rounded. This book, with many similarities to &quot;Beach Music&quot; (both in characters and in setting), seems to be more of a rough draft of the book that Conroy later wrote.There were many scenes that were Big Scenes -- deaths, rape, violence -- and then the chapter would end and it was on to the next adventure, with little or nothing said later to tie the loose threads together.Perhaps it does take a military background to truly appreciate the book, and while the language is (as in all of Conroy's books) beautifully written, the overall story didn't hook me."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I decided to read this book on a bit of a whim. We were vacationing on Hilton Head, near Conroy's hometown, and I wanted to become better acquainted with this talented author's work while in his neck of the woods. I'd just finished reading &quot;The Prince of Tides,&quot; which was a little disappointing (not bad, mind you, just different than I'd expected.). Of the two, I actually preferred &quot;The Great Santini.&quot; This book, the tale of a Marine family temporarily based in South Carolina in the early 1960s, was both warm and bittersweet. The descriptions of the setting were dead on, just as one would expect it would be since it's situated in the author's home state. (BTW - the movie was filmed in Beaufort, S.C. - a real treat of a destination.) Be advised that there are troubling moments of family conflict, including domestic violence. But what is so compelling is the way that the reader becomes drawn to all of the family members -- even to bellicose Bull, the father. Particularly memorable is a chapter toward the end when Bull is flying through the night sky. It is one of the most moving and heartwrenching passages that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Even if you've already seen the movie, you'll find this a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"All of Pat Conroy's books have one foot in his childhood, and none is more autobiographical than The Great Santini. Colonel Bull Meecham is a legendary Marine fighter pilot whose military successes are almost as many as his personal excesses. Lillian Meecham is a Southern gentlewoman with a love of literature. After moving from base to base each year, the Meecham's finally settle down in fictional Ravenel, SC (Beaufort in real life).The Colonel rules his fighter squadron and his family with an iron first. While this technique is successful in motivating his pilots, it has disastrous effects on his wife and children. His cruelty (both mental and physical) is enough to crush even the strongest soul. While he chides Ben for being a sissy, he suppresses Ben's attempts to act like a man. Yet, the Colonel can do endearing things, like when he gives Ben his original flight jacket on his 18th birthday. No wonder Ben has a love-hate relationship with his old man.At a new school, Ben quickly establishes himself as a decent scholar and a talented basketball player. Several teachers and his principal see the potential in young Ben, and give him the love and mentoring he could never get from the Colonel. They teach him the importance of standing up for what he believes and to be his own man. When one of Ben's friends is threatened, Ben defies his dad and goes to his aid. In doing so, he becomes more of a man than his father will ever be.The Great Santini is a fabulous story, and nobody writes with as much passion and beauty as Pat Conroy. Conroy takes us through the emotional gamut from belly laughs to tears and back again. Although some parts of the story are fiction, there is enough truth in that when Conroy's mom filed for divorce from the real Colonel after 33 years of marriage, she handed a copy of The Great Santini to the judge as evidence of the Colonel's violent nature. Conroy is a definitely success story and despite many scars, he was able to overcome his tumultuous upbringing to become the very successful writer he is. But perhaps without that childhood, we would not know the Conroy we know today. Even he admits that \\"one of the greatest gifts you can get as a writer is to be born into an unhappy family.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This was an excellent book. I found this book personally very interesting, because I grew up in a Marine Family also. Many of Mr. Conroys general descriptions of Marine life were dead on. For example, Mr Conroys description of Col. Meecham loading his family in the car leaving for a new duty station before the sun comes up, reminded me so much of many of the moves we made, incredible but yet so true, it made me laugh. Col Meecham was an extreme character, but many of his phrases and philosophies were familiar to me through some of the people I met growing up Marine. Not only that, his descriptions of Beaufort South Carolina, were also excellent. It put you right back there. You could almost smell the southern sea air and the swamps as you read. The book not only confronted the issues of a family trying to meet the impossibly high standards of thier Marine father, it also confronted the issue of racism in the south. There were many complicated emotional issues in the book. A lot of them do not get resolved, but it was the kind of book that makes you think for a while after you have finished it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This was Pat Conroy's first novel and I believe this is his only book written in the third person.His writing is beautiful, and in my opinion, has grown even more so in the last 25 + years since he wrote this. I respect him because he has not flooded the market with his books like so many other best-selling authors.This is the story of the Meecham family: Bull, the father, a Marine jet-fighter pilot who refers to himself as &quot;the great Santini&quot;-- as in &quot;The great Santini has spoken&quot;--he is the *law* in the family; Lillian, the mother, a Southern belle who tries to soften her husband's pronouncements and shield her four children from his sometimes-violent wrath; Ben, their son, who is a senior in high school and has a love/hate relationship with Bull; Mary Anne, one year younger than Ben, smart-mouthed and unattractive; and the youngest children, Matt and Karen.I thought the characters were well-drawn and fully fleshed-out. By the end of this book, I felt that I really *knew* them well. The exploration of the father/son, father/children relationship was masterfully done.The locale was not as important to this novel as it was in his other books, especially &quot;Beach Music&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;. In this respect, the book could have taken place any where...whereas in the aforementioned books, the locales were almost characters in themselves.All in all, an outstanding book, one that made me sad and happy, made me laugh and cry."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Let me start out by saying that I think Pat Conroy is one of the best authors out there. He can paint a picture so vividly with is words you truly feel like you are there. I first read Beach Music and it rocked my world. Each of the stories told in that book were amazing. So, even though I'd seen the movie Prince of Tides, I decided to read the book. I loved it also. Now having a hunger for more of his amazing writing, I picked up The Great Santini. I must say, I was disappointed. I loved the characters and the general concept of the story. A tough Marine, a true southern belle and two of the four children with depth that you admire throughout the entire story. I just felt that there was no storyline. I get what Conroy was trying to portray by creating the characters, and the relationships between the characters were great, but I just felt as if something was missing from this story. I also didn't feel like a whole lot happened until half way through the book.There were also a couple of highly dramatic scenes(Sammy's girlfriend and Toomer and Red) that had you at the edge of your seat. However, once that chapter was over, no mention of it whatsoever. I would think these things happened for a reason (e.g. character growth, forming a bond between two characters)and would be explored through the eyes of the characters some more. This was a disappointment to me also.All in all, the book had a lot of good in it, but just didn't measure up to Beach Music and The Prince of Tides. I plan on reading Conroy's other books in hopes to feel the magic of his writing again."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This is a wonderful novel. Published in 1976 when Conroy was 30, The Great Santini marked the debut of a talented writer and born storyteller.To those who are well acquainted with Conroy, this novel (like all his others) is autobiographical in content. This is the story of Lt. Col. Bull Meecham, United States Marine Corps fighter pilot and his family. Meecham runs his family like a squadron. His word is law and he is the ultimate authority. Any family who dare dissents from Bull's view will suffer his wrath. The novel is, at the core, a family story. Bull, his lovely wife Lillian and their four children, Ben the oldest, Mary Ann, Karen and young Matt. Ben feels all the pressure as the Colonel pushes his son to be the best and will not tolerate any backtalk.The story moves along at a fine pace and the characters are fully developed whether they are the main characters or supporting ones.It is interesting to note that it is Conroy's only novel that was written in the third person, and, unlike other first novels, it does not suffer from the standard problems that usually go with debuts.The one thing that impresses me the most is that Conroy's Marine Corps scenes ring with absolute authority. A difficult achievment for a writer who didn't serve in the Corps. No doubt he had witnessed much Marine Corps activity when going to bases in the company of his father (Col. Don Conroy, USMC Ret. dec.).Pick this book up if you can. It's a genuine slice of life book that both entertains and enlarges your view of the world."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"From what Pat Conroy has said in numerous interviews, it is obvious that his novel The Great Santini is a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his own childhood as a Marine brat. High school senior Ben Meecham, Pat Conroy's fictional counterpart, is the son of a volatile Marine fighter pilot 'Bull' Meecham, whose nom de guerre is 'The Great Santini', which, by the way, was also Pat Conroy dad's nom de guerre in real life. Pat Conroy once said that his dad was Zeus and his mom was Hera, and that his first memory was of his dad laughing and hitting his mother in face while she tried to stab him with a knife. Boy, oh boy, if this novel is an accurate representation of what went on in the Conroy household, then he is right about the true identity of his parents! The Great Santini acts, according to his wife Lillian, like a living, breathing Marine recruitment poster. Santini is a man of contradictions, a man who loves his wife and his children more than anything else in the world, but you wouldn't know it from the brutal manner by which he occasionally treats them. By the way, if you saw the wonderful film adaptation of Conroy's novel, you were probably left with the impression that Santini is the only parent in this household that is screwed up. Unlike the movie version, in the novel Santini's wife Lillian, who means well, is in her own way just as screwed up as her husband. Like Santini, Lillian also loves her children more than anything in the world, but she often acts like a demented Scarlett O'Hara. (Indeed, part of the tension between Santini and his wife comes from the fact that she is a Southern Belle who loves her cultural roots, while Santini is a purposely uncouth Yankee from Chicago who despises everything Southern.) Lillian is especially dysfunctional when it comes to teaching gender roles to her daughters. Just as Santini is one extreme with his sons Ben and Matt, wanting them to grow up to be stoic, hard marines who can unmercifully kill America's enemies, Lillian Meecham puts her oldest daughter Mary Anne through hell basically because Mary Anne is a Plain Jane nonconformist who won't conform to her mother's dictum that a woman is like a flower, pretty but silent and modest, while Mary Anne's pretty younger sister Karen does accept her mother's vision of womanhood. Lillian's ideal vision of how a woman should act is ironic because under her soft Southern Belle persona, Santini's wife is woman of steel whose temper is often as fiery and violent as her husband's.A lot happens action wise in this novel, some of it horrifying, some of it hilarious, but The Great Santini doesn't have an overly obvious narrative drive per se. Instead, the questions that drive the plot of this amazing novel are more subtle: Will Santini be successful in his first command at the Marine base in Ravenel? Will Ben and Mary Anne be successful in their bid to fit in at their new high school? (Like Conroy's \\"The Lords of Discipline\\", the action of TGS takes place within the space of a school year.) Now that the Great Santini has come home from his year living overseas without his family, will the Meecham family have a better year together this time, or will their family situation become abusive again like in the past? I guess you could argue that The Great Santini is more character-driven than plot-driven, although it's not necessarily easy to make a distinction between the two since action often reveals character. The Great Santini is a fascinating portrayal of how even an extremely dysfunctional family can still love each other, and how a child can love a parent who occasionally causes them great pain. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I began reading this book with trepidation, because I worried that a book about the Marines and basketball might be a little too masculine and juvenile even for someone who tends to enjoy books with that character, but I was pleasantly mistaken. This is a great book--not just good, but great--about a career Marine who has established himself as a hero in war, leader within the Corps and one of the most bombastic, foul mouthed and party-hearty personalities anywhere, but a man who has no idea how to alter his personality at home. His family, which dutifully follows him around the South, admires his professional abilities and follows his orders almost without question also live in terror of the man who rules with an iron fist and absues them emotionally and physically. Bull Meecham is truly one of the great characters and personalities from any fiction I've read.The other members of the family, however, are also just as valuable and interesting in this book. Bull's son's attempts to be a man, his wife's attempts to rear her children with Southern charm and grace despite their father, the oldest daughter's attempts to be an independent woman despite both of her parents. The Great Santini goes further, however, and explores racism in the mid-century South, the power of sports in youth culture, the troubled existence of military families, etc.Pat Conroy is a beautiful writer who creates lifelike characters, produces huge laughs and equally large tragedies, and never lets a dull moment slip into this book. This is one of my favorite books I've ever read and will highly recommend it to anyone I meet."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This novel by Pat Conroy is an amazing contemporary novel that leads you through the life of a military family in the late 1950's. This book hits home having several family members, two being pilots and one a marine, that have served in the military, and it was a difficult book to put down. In many ways, the \\"Great Santini\\" reminded me of my father; a man that at times is both loved and hated by his family. Colonel Bull Meecham is a marine fighter pilot that demands respect as the \\"Great Santini\\" by both his family and his flight squadron. His oldest son Ben, a senior in high school, struggles with the relationship that he has with his father, who he hates very much but loves and respects. If not for Lillian Meecham, wife of the \\"Great Santini\\" and peacekeeper of the household, the harsh and sometimes abusive father would release his wrath without a second thought. From the witty remarks of Mary Anne to the competitiveness between Ben and his father, The Great Santini creates a family persona that many can relate. The Great Santini takes you through the difficulties of a year in the life of a southern marine family after the Korean War. I highly recommend entering the past and becoming a member of the Meecham family by reading The Great Santini. This non-stop novel reaches heights of laughter and tears and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Nobody has wrung more novels from a dysfunctional family than Pat Conroy. In The Great Santinti he opens a window which may give a new and unexpected view to many Americans, into the family life of a career military man. For those who have never lived within the military, this book may seem bizarre and contrived. For those of us who did, it hits a nerve - even for those of us whose father was not an abusive borderline alcoholic fighter pilot.The sense of rootlessness, of being disconnected from the rest of society is here. Military families live in a strange semisubmerged culture invisible to the mainstream, and with the ending of the draft we have a generation of Americans who have never served and thus the gap has widened. The only friendships we form are with other military people, for civilians, even in the towns outside the main gate, are partially alien and can never be part of the community. Conroy captures this, and superimposes upon it the additional strains imposed by the father's domineering, macho, iron willed personality. Face it, he's not Gerald McRaney from Major Dad. No trying to understand the fears and dreams of his family, we do it by the book, my way or no way, sir, yes sir!!! There is stress between Colonel Santini and his neurotic southern belle wife, who wants to ensure her children grow up with a gentle appreciation for life, with his son who wants desperately to please his father but to do it by following his own path, and with his intelligent but socially awkward daughter who being a mere girl is not qualified for the warrior life and thus doesn't count. The military life is hard enough, throwing in these problems on top of it makes you wonder at the limits we accept in everyday life.Hard edged, disorienting, sometimes ugly, this book is for all veterans of the Cold War, active duty or dependents, who lived with the possibility that the head of the family might be called upon to go off and die in someplace most of us couldn't locate on a globe (as an aside I find that former military brats are much better at geography than most others - for one thing we got letters from all those exotic locales)... Admiral Hyman Rickover once said military officers should be like a caste of warrior priests... this novel is about that caste and the acolytes who also served. Pat Conroy once wrote elsewhere to the effect that his father's job was to be a fighter pilot, and his family's job was to provide that fighter pilot whenever the govenrment called for him."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I have practically lived Conroy's books, being a child of the military (in my case the United States Navy)and professional nomad while still having deep roots in the Old South. This book in particular, spoke to my soul. It is about the unconditional love we have for our parents, who are themselves fallible human beings. Reading this book lead me to see my father as a human being for the first time, and in a large part was responsible for my deciding to forgive him for the scars of my childhood. in response to my reaching out as an adult to get to know him, he was finally able to become the friend and advisor he longed to be to me when I was growing up. Only through forgiveness and understanding are we capable of breaking the cycle of emotional and physical abuse so prevalent in the children of abusers."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This is the third book written by Pat Conroy and his first novel. Like all his books the themes are semi-autobiographical. In this book the author's childhood suffering at the brutal hands of \\"The Great Santini,\\" his father's nickname for himself, is described in sickening detail. But the reader is left with admiration for this boy who finally can fight back and is on his way to a new life at age 18.I am married to a fighter pilot(who calls himself the world's greatest fighter pilot)and in all the years of his service I never saw or heard of the kind of drunken and obscene behavior by the Marine pilots that is depicted here. I can only assume that Santini himself was often the instigator of these events and proud of himself for arranging them.As a new fan of Pat Conroy's work I intend to read all his books in chronological order. So you may see another review by me before long! In the meantime, why don't you join the club?"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I liked the book very much.

Theres no better author at writing gut wrenching, heart stomping, laughter filled family sagas rich with strong appealing characters that you love to detest. This is not my favorite Conroy masterpiece, but I do believe it is the best. The characters in this story are like no other you will ever read. You will learn to hate certain charecters, yet at the same time you cant help loving them. I am utterly jealous of anyone who gets to read this book for the first time. If only I could go back in time........ Its that good!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"a civilian, you aren't one. A fine coming of age story with special appeal for military brats of all persuasions. Conroy hits the low and the high points with painful accuracy. Especially worth a read in these troubled times, if your own experience has not let you peer into the closed world of the military and their families. A good, fast read, that stands up to a second inspection. Better than the film."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"As a military brat I have surprised myself by finding ways to avoid this book over the years. I have enjoyed Mr. Conroy's other novels but for some reason assumed that the life of a military family would not interest me because I had already lived that life. I could not have been more wrong. This book was amazing. The character development was intense, the action compelling and the flow wonderful. Please pick up this book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"i've just finished reading this highly impressive book and i find myself still spelbound by the great Santini. in COLONEL BULL MEECHAM, pat conroy has undoubtely created one of his most authentic, convincing, impossible-to-love but impossible-to-hate heroes. it is obvious that the guy is a bully but he inspires a lot of admiration and in my opinion embodies all traits of a typical fighter pilot. the end of the book clearly show us that after all, this fearsome tyrant is human beyond our imaginations. lilian meecham comes as a true southern heroine and she is as strong and powerful character as southern women come. no other kind of woman could have been a better match for the great santini. a book of intense emotions filled with powerful, larger-than-life and awe-inspiring characters (especially santini and lilian). i highly recommend it as a wonderful and immensely enjoyable read ! get ready for another conroy gem !!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This classic novel takes a look at a Marine family's life.

This is evident in the events that happen to his oldest son Ben. Ben is dealing with the conflicts of being a Marine like Col. Meechum's son. This book is a fine novel, which is meaningful not only to real Marine families,but to all families. One of Conroy's finest."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I read this book because I grew up in the Marine Corps. My mother was in for 20 years, and we moved at least 8 or 9 times that I can remember. I had to laugh at some of the descriptions because it was a lot like growing up with my mom. Except she was not quite so competitive. I have been to Beaufort South Carolina where the book takes place. I thought the story was very good and the descriptions were excellent."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This was the first Pat Conroy novel I ever had the privelege to read. I have recommended it over and over to numerous friends, relatives, and the like. Conroy tells us, sometimes in brutally honest terms, what it is to grow up trapped in a military family. From his own real-life experiences that he has woven into his novel, we are tormented, debating whether or not we love or hate Bull Meecham, the symbol of old-corps Marines that fought so hard for our country. Kudos to Conroy on this one! My favorite of all the novels. I have read this book over 15 times already and every time I reread it, I gather new insight and new appreciation for his mastery of the English language. Conroy's scenery alone is enough to buy this book! No one else can paint a picture of the American South like Pat Conroy!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and at first I hated Bull.

Watch the movie it was great!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"It made my trip to NY worth remembering."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Good intentions but the characters fall short. The book is full of important life lessons. The problem is the people learning them are unrealistic. First, the oldest, Ben, for a seventeen/eighteen year old he's very immature. When you read the book it'll be obvious to you, the reader, what I mean about Ben's immaturity. The second oldest, Mary Anne, is smarter but too cynical to pity. She gets herself and Ben in trouble so many times with her cynicism that the reader can't believe she wouldn't have learned her lesson after the 100th time. I don't have many gripes about the other kids because they acted their age while Ben and Mary Anne acted their age too."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The cover of this reprint of The Great Santini depicts a USAF fighter airplane. Santini flew the F-8 Crusader, one of the great fighter airplanes of its time and flown by the Navy and Marines only. I had to download a picture of the F-8 and tape it over the offending picture. Even suggesting that Santini was an Air Force pilot is a sacrilege! Where was the editor?"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The Great Santini was Pat Conroy's first novel, and it was the one that rocketed him to literary fame in America. It's easy to see why. Though troubled at times by identifiable rookie errors like over-repetition and unrealistic dialog, the book--and particularly the writing--possess an astonishing depth for a debut effort. By now readers have come to identify Conroy as one of the great literary voices of his generation, but when Santini was published, he was an unknown Southern writer trying to tell what was essentially a fictionalized account of his own childhood. Happily, he succeeded.Anyone who has read even one or two Pat Conroy books will recognize in this first novel patterns that will become familiar in later works. A loving but abusive father. A beautiful mother. The military. A family trying to make their way in the world despite many hardships and tragedy. And of course, the ever-present undercurrent of coastal South Carolina. These were all evidently ingredients of Conroy's own life, and he weaves them into his fiction with unusual skill. His work, though at times harsh, is a pleasure to read.What's great about The Great Santini is the way Conroy makes Bull Meecham such a sympathetic character. Even though he's abusive, stubborn, foul-mouthed, and often just simply unpleasant, he wants to do the right thing. He's intensely patriotic and utterly competitive, and he truly loves his family. Yet all too often, his demons get the best of him. When it happens, you feel terrible for his suffering family, but you feel bad for Bull, too.The audiobook version is surprisingly good. I wasn't sure Dick Hill, who provided a brilliant Harry Bosch in Michael Connelly's early books, would be right for Conroy's Southern narrative rhythms, but he was excellent. His loud, brash portrayal of Bull Meecham is perfect and really makes the character come alive.As in any Pat Conroy book, there's a lot of language and some very difficult scenes, including some graphic crimes. But there are also plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as of course page after page of simply beautiful writing. For a compelling and powerful picture of what life in the South was like for a military family in the 1960s, look no further. It's not Conroy's best--he was still finding himself as a writer--but it's still great and definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Pat Conroy is an incredible storyteller, and having read all of his other novels, it was interesting to go back three decades, prior to his most successful epics like Prince of Tides and South of Broad. His writing is not as refined, and even the dialogue lacks finesse, but he still delivers the story of the Meecham family with authority. Another interesting feature is the structure of the book - the chapters seem more like anecdotes of the Meecham's live over the course of the year than a continuous narrative. One chapter might be a day in the life of patriarch Marine Fighter Pilot Bull Meecham, the next would be oldest son Ben's basketball game, then a CCD class, an introduction of Ben's English teacher, then a family conversation. It wasn't necessarily disjointed, but it left a few scenarios open-ended or unresolved. The most successful aspects of the book were two multi-chapter portions toward the end. The ordeal with Sammy and his girlfriend evolves into a racial confrontation between Red and Toomer that is saturated in suspense and tragedy. Also, the very conclusion is delivered perfectly, heavy with emotion and purpose, effectively tying together everything the Meecham family has been through with a devastating finality.Overall, this book is true to Pat Conroy. It is infused with the South, rich in language, and brings aspects of his own life to the page. It demonstrates the conflict between Ben and his difficult father, and the duality of both respecting and loathing a man and the institution that made him a tyrant."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"you can never go wrong reading Conroy! The ultimate wordsmith! This book is at times sad, funny, tragic, suspensful, sometimes all of these rolled into one. Read it and you will become a Pat Conroy fanatic too!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The Great Santini is Colonel Bull Meecham, husband to his lovely Southern enabling wife Lillian, father to Ben, Mary Anne, Matt, and Karen, Marine, fighter pilot, bully, creep, alcoholic, and all around jerk. Bull rules his family as he does the marines that serve under him. A bad drunk, Bull experiences violent mood swings, which send his family into chilling bouts of fear, hatred, and battles with the brute. Ben, most of all, the oldest, is most challenged by Bull, most humiliated, and most deeply touched, although his sister Mary Anne is a very close second. Ben is a very transparent stand-in for Conroy, although how much of this work is autobiographical is hard to know, but I suspect most of it is. Conroy could not write with such depth of feeling if he didn't experience this material firsthand. All I can say is that experiencing Bull Meecham is like experiencing brutality and hell in order to discover kindness, heaven, and love.Clearly written, brilliant, scintillating, this work sharply etches an unhappy family and the inner life of a boy and his love/hate relationship with his father. It also presents life in the racist south of the early 1960s, its beauties, and its nightmares. I was deeply moved by this work in spite of the ugliness of Bull Meecham and the marines he loved. This is a genuine work, an American novel, and a major achievement."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The Great Santini is the story of a Marine family, the Meechams, during the late 1950s. The father, Bull Meecham is the typical military father: crude, tough, conceited, and prone to bouts of drunkenness and violence. His son, Ben, is a senior in high school looking to college as a way to escape his father's control and abuse. The other members of the family are exhausted with Bull's mistreatment of them, though they each love him and are familiar with his rantings. The story follows the family to their new assignment in South Carolina, the last in an endless series of moves from base to base. Over the course of the novel, we see tension escalate between father and son, culminating in episodes of violence and, eventually forgiveness. The book is funny, sharply written, and filled with smart dialogue. The characters are richly conceived, especially Bull, Ben, and Lilian, the mother. The story moves quickly, despite some digressions (the prom scene, the Sammy scenes, etc.), and one is left with a memory of a strong, complex, and ultimately self-destructive man in Bull Meecham. Anyone who has struggled with their own father will be able to relate to Ben and Bull. Likewise anyone with an affinity for the south, for the military, or for witty, sarcastic characters would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I judge books by their ability to draw me in and want more each time I sit down to read them.

I know this one is older, but I just never picked it up, but I am glad I did. There is not a ton of action, but the character development is top notch, just awesome."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"It's not all that common for this reader to get fully absorbed into a world populated by completely fictional characters, but Pat Conroy's classic The Great Santini quickly proved to be an exception. It's a book as brutally honest and unvarnished as its titular character, Marine pilot Colonel Wilbur \\"Bull\\" Meecham (aka the Great Santini), in whom Conroy has created one of the most fascinating, believable, and flat-out hilarious characters in literary history. First seen moving with his family to the military town of Ravenel, South Carolina (a stand-in for the actual military town of Beaufort), Bull Meachem is a figure both larger than life and utterly human, a warrior with no off switch and consummate alpha male who seems most in his element when pounding beers with his men or pounding on some local toughs who attack his eldest child on the street. He's also a walking contradiction, beholden to the prejudices and enmities of his time but still gripped with a profound sense of fairness, and a seemingly loving father who only rarely manages to show his children any genuine affection. Depending on your particular viewpoint, he could represent either everything that's wrong with this country or everything that's great about it, but in Conroy's hands Bull's always more of a character than a caricature of an archetype. Even while finding a large share of Bull's actions and pronouncements objectionable, I always read just a little faster when he was the focus, which is a testament to just how sharply drawn a character he is. Whatever your societal views, it's hard not to like an unapologetically masculine guy like Bull, who lives for male camaraderie and the thrill of unfettered flight and, yes, the chance to kill a few Commies that the Marine Corps offers.Despite its title, though, The Great Santini is far from a one-man show. While he remains the dominant figure, Bull shares the spotlight with the other members of his family (those older than 12, anyway): his oldest, Ben, a brilliant basketball player whose feelings toward his father range from ambivalence to outright hostility; Ben's younger sister Mary Anne, a self-described weirdo and social misfit with literary aspirations whose biting sense of humor serves as an ever-present defense mechanism; and Bull's wife Lillian, a product of the Southern gentry who tries tirelessly to preserve at least the appearance of peace in her house. The story eventually comes to encompass a whole universe of minor characters as well, from educators to clergy to poor blacks, who make up the fabric of a pre-integration Southern military town, but in the end the focus remains squarely on the Meechams and their frequently stormy existences. To say that Bull isn't in touch with his inner child or his feminine side would be an understatement: he tends to run the family in much the same way he runs his Marine unit, with a constant focus on discipline and a push to succeed at the expense of all other considerations. Naturally, this approach can sometimes grate on the rest of the family, especially Ben, whose conflicting drives to please and defy his father should be familiar to just about anyone who remembers being a teenager. Ben's struggles to find his own way and deal with the overwhelming shadow cast by his father's influence eventually come to form the center of the book, making it equal parts coming-of-age story, family drama, and slice-of-life comedy.Although his pen can run over a bit, especially in the book's later going, it's still beyond disputing that Conroy is an enormously skilled writer, who brings the same level of insight and precision to his description of an inconsequential high-school basketball game that he does to a beer-soaked Marine gathering. Conroy shows a keen insight for the twisted humor and atavistic rituals that make up male bonding, as well as for the dynamics of a mismatched family held together at least in part by intimidation and relentless discipline. He's also deeply plugged into the devices people use to get by in daily life, from Bull's macho bluster to Maryanne's biting humor to Lillian's relentless emphasis on manners. Of course, it also helps that The Great Santini boasts great dialogue laden with cutting and frequently off-color humor, a (mostly) affectionate portrayal of small-town southern living, and characters who are almost frighteningly real. The book doesn't rely on any contrived plot devices, or even much of a plot at all, to keep pages turning, instead getting by on Conroy's significant ability to draw readers into a different time and place (different for me anyway), capturing the rhythms and events large and small that make up both military and family life. Even those who don't consider themselves military types would be well advised to give The Great Santini a read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"If you enjoyed the book, as I did, you will like the movie as it is faithful to the book. Some things were left out such as Bulls relationship with the townies but you can't include everything I guess."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"i never saw the movie, so had no preconceived ideas. I understand the movie eliminated the friendship with the Jewish kid in town. So, not sure how they develop the story line without the episode he played a critical role in. Like missing an important piece. So, in same vein, only a couple of violent acts occur during the story, tho many previous are alluded to. Still, a simmering sense of foreboding throughout. Santini is truly a bully. But, Mr. conroy writes as if we were in on all the previous events, and that is why we would relate to the boy's dread and certain knowledge of impending violence. But without that foreknowledge, i missed why he knows.I read this book because i recently encounterd a family where threats of dad on son violence were commonly expressed in mixed company. I didn't get it. But, I guess that is a parenting style that is out there. Makes for a complicated relationship. Good book developing that aspect."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The novel Great Santini by Pat Conroy has been one of the most enjoyable books to read. Although I have read a couple other books by him, but nothing can withstand the important and vivid details someone gets from reading this book. Pat Conroy shows so much depth in his writing. He talks about the characters in the book like Lillian Meechem the mom he describes her as a dainty, ladylike military mom, Karen, Mathew, Mary Ann, and Ben are some of the other characters. Bull Meechem the main character also referred to as the (Great Santini),he is the best goddamn pilot there ever was. In the novel, treats his children with disrespect and is ungrateful towards the children. He raises his children to be marine fighters and disciplines his children with strict rules they have to follow. Conroy shows great development through the way he talks about the characters in the book, the characters are vivid and seem to come to life as you grow further in the book.I would recommend this book to mostly teens, because it has a lot of action and humor. In between parts that I was reading there were a lot of funny parts that made me keep reading because it is that good. Although it's a lengthy book, it has a great story plot, you will not be disappointed when you pick this book up to start reading it. This book will keep you wanting to read more you won't be able to stop. Conroys book represents everything that a good book should have: humor, love/relationship, and hatred that Bull Meechum shows towards his children. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would rate it a 9. This book is also been a best seller and has sold over a million copies."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I love anything by Pat Conroy. This is a great read (still reading it) but enjoying it so far. The book arrived on time and was affordable"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Pat Conroy is one of my favorite authors because he writes about severe childhood abuse and pulls no punches, literally. His books are full of rage, anger, and injustice and this is how children should feel when maltreated. There is no quarter given for the abusers and the reader is not left wanting any (at least, that is how I feel when reading them). I read a biography of Conroy and it would seem that, later in his life, he did forgive his father, but this occurrence does not mar the power of his early works. I have read all of his novels except South of Broad, several (like Prince of Tides) twice. I intend to go back and reread some of them again and again."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"His words reach into my very soul and touch me.

It replaces Prince Of Tides, which is a book I love and am currently rereading just because I enjoyed it so much.Conroy does an excellent job of relating love for a parent who abuses his children, and how, even though that love is mingled with hate and fear, it does overcome in the end. Would be of interest for anybody raised in a military family, or Marine specifically, as well, or anybody who moved a lot as a child. Conroy has a deep love for the South and for the Carolinas specific, as you notice when you read any of his books.Highly recommended! A great read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Anyone who says this book isn't as good as his other books is right... but The Prince of Tides is one of my two favorites of all time.... (A Prayer for Owen Meany) And I'll fight anyone who says otherwise... (just kidding, but I will) No shame not living up to the best.I just finished re-reading this... at least 15 years after reading it the first time. I think the Bull Meachem story resonates with a lot of families with military influences. There are many Great Santini's out there. Like all of Pat Conroy's books, he captures the emotional highs and lows better than anyone else and he does it in a way that makes the English language seem beautiful. He rewards a strong vocabulary, or at least someone willing to keep a dictionary handy.There were parts that were hard to re-read a second time... hard to get through... because I knew the gut-wrenching journey ahead. The basketball scene (not the one-on-one with his dad - don't want to be a spoiler) was so hard to read again because I knew the consequences, I knew!

And even after a rousing discussion with the ladies, I am still not sure how I exactly stand with this one.Upon beginning the book, I completely despised Bull Meecham - his presence, his attitude and basically just him. I kept telling the boy that I would NEVER live with this man, let alone have four children with him. As the book went on, my feelings for him kept moving to the dark side along with the book. Somewhere just before the end, I decided that I didn't hate the book due to the plot being acceptable - BUT I still hated him.Then came book club. One of the ladies stands by Pat Conroy and loves everyone of his books. Intrigued, she advised us that this book was autobiographical and the overbearing father that made my feelings boil was in fact based on his own father. Crazy. It is said that because of this book, his family has disbanded and a lot of controversary was made of it.A book that I would put into the male audience's hands much quicker than the females. A story with a family at the center, women would be intrigued, but beware the man at the center of this family is not one you will fall in love with."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"The Great Santini was a very humorous book. This was the first Pat Conroy novel I had read, and I found his writing style quite refreshing. His story about the gung-ho Marine living up to an image larger than life with the back drop of a typical military family makes for an enjoyable combination. The \`Great Santini' is a fighter pilot, and this identity permeates his entire existence, within and outside the aircraft. His two older children Ben and Mary Anne are creatively portrayed as two teenagers coping with all the drama of a new high school and fitting in, under the shadow of a sometimes over-bearing father. Their humor back and forth alone will leave you smiling, if not occasionally laughing aloud as they shed their views on the world around them. Conroy's definitive portrayal of the Catholic family in the early 60's is also masterfully done, and lightly dressed with the tongue-in-cheek wit and humor that flows smoothly throughout the story. The overall plot and story line of the book seemed at times to be drifting along heading no where in particular, but in the end it concludes with a swift dose of reality that lies waiting in the wings of all who are part of the military life. All in all an enjoyable book that is very well written that ends in a somewhat sad, but dramatic conclusion. The story is about growing up in a Marine family from all angles. It was quite enjoyable and eye opening."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Although I am quite taken with Pat Conroy, I was not particularly fond of this book. The characters were not believable enough to develop feelings for and Bull Meecham was not a likeable character at all. I love the descriptive &quot;poetry&quot; he uses in his novels, though. Many other readers seem to love this book- maybe it's a military family thing."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Pat Conroy's novel The Great Santini tells of the coming of age of Ben Meechan. Ben, the oldest son of Bull and Lillian Meechan, is a clean cut, smart athlete. Bull, the Great Santini, is a macho marine fighter pilot who is trying to relive his youth through his son Ben. Lillian is a naive southern belle who is very passionate toward her children. Ben is scared of his father and he tries to protect the rest of his family from him.Ben moves to Ravenel, South Carolina during his junior year of high school. He makes a few friends and becomes the star basketball player. This causes a conflict with his father who is never satisfied with his son's achievements. Bull is called to go on a routine flying mission to Florida. His plane crashes and Bull is killed. At the conclusion of the novel, Ben assumes the family responsibilities formerly held by Bull.The theme in this book is that people show their love in different ways. Bull constantly nags the children and is overly intense because he is always trying to make them better. Lillian babies the children and wants the boys to be southern gentleman because she does not want them to be like Bull. Ben and his sister, Mary Anne, argue constantly as many siblings do. After their father's death, they show their love for each other by coming together as a family. Mr. Dacus, Ben's principal and basketball coach, is aware of Ben's situation at home. He becomes protective of Ben and later has to tell Ben about his father's death.The main strength in this book is the great amount of detail. An example of this is,\\"...sleeping as the car rolled through vast wilderness and untransmissible lights.\\" The characterization was also a strength. It is obvious that Bull is very stern when the author says, \\"His voice could quiet a bar full of drunks during a fight.\\" Sammy, Ben's best friend, showed his insecurity by usually telling his dates a false name. There were so many strengths in this book that any weaknesses would go unnoticed.The novel The Great Santini, by Pat Conroy, depicts the adolescent life of Ben Meechan as though the reader were part of the story. It is easy to understand the life that a Marine family must endure; the constant moving, having to always make new friends and the fear of your father never returning from a mission. Ben's emotions could be felt in the excitement on the court and the fear of his father. Ben's internal conflict is accurately depicted in the manner in which he deals with his father's death.Conroy is able to write this story so well because it is based on a part of his life. He actually moved to Beaufort (Ravenel), South Carolina during his junior year of high school. He was very upset at having to move one more time. His mother, whom he loved dearly, told him, \\"Go out and make this town your town.\\" Conroy has lived and traveled all over the world, but he still calls Beaufort home.Conroy was the star basketball player for his high school and attended The Citadel on a basketball scholarship. His father would never let him take a typing class because he thought that typing classes were only for girls. Conroy says that this has proven to be the most expensive thing his father has ever done to him. To this day he still cannot type. He writes his manuscripts in longhand and must pay to have them typed."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"If the contents are as autobiographical as has been suggested in author interviews and other forums, it's extremely fortunate that one or more of the abused children in this family didn't grow up to become a serial killer."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I am surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Conroy paints a picture of a violent husband/father, children who relentlessly spew vile hateful speech at each other and their parents, a mother who is a caricature of a weak and stupid woman (as are most of the female characters), all the while beating a dead horse about the supposed camaraderie of Marines who need to get drunk, speak vilely about women, and beat each other up constantly out of a sense of duty and a grotesque sense of \\"honor.\\" The one scene of the drunken stupidity of the Marines that opens the book would have been enough to drive this point home; instead, Conroy takes us back over and over to such scenes. O.K., we get it. The father is supposedly a violent man who controls the family through fear; yet, the children provoke him with their nonstop hateful remarks and behavior. If they are so afraid of him, how can they constantly provoke him? Other novels treat the effects of abusive parents/fathers more convincingly as children in such households would never knowingly try to wake the sleeping dragon who is the abusive parent. The children's hatred towards each other becomes tiresome and ridiculous. In fact, one would expect that they would bond in some ways out of the difficult experience of their upbringing, but instead, they are bratty and hateful towards each other.The characters are inconsistently developed and plot threads are laid out and then forgotten. For example, we meet some characters in the local diner who are described in detail as if they will somehow be important to the plot, and then we never hear about them again. The black woman who becomes the family maid has potential to add depth to the story, but she is given scant treatment. Her son, Toomer, has formed a supposedly impossible bond of friendship with the white boy in the family, Ben, yet their \\"deep\\" friendship is not explained except for one brief moment the two spend together catching and eating clams. That's it. We are supposed to believe 250 pages later that they are such good buddies and have overcome the constant racism of the town, of the South in general and of Ben's father in particular that Ben would risk his life to try to save Toomer. No development of Toomer as a character, or that of his mother, warrants this scene. In fact, so much of this story is predictable and the stuff of many a Southern novel/movie, such as the rape of the white girl and the death of the innocent black man in retaliation. The girl who is raped is the kindest and most intelligent girl in the class. To select her for the brutal rape and beating seems like sadistic punishment on the author's part for any female who oversteps the norm by trying to be anything but a shrinking, empty-headed violet. How cruel. In fact, this is pegged as a novel for adolescents, but there is nothing but cruelty, no redeeming qualities, no chance for redemption, no acknowledgement of the world's evil but with a chance for transcendence. It is unfortunate that kids in my local high school must read this. There are far better-written books that treat the same themes of parent/child rivalry, bullying, etc. I would suggest \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" which also takes place in the deep South and which also deals with a child of an abusive parent. The writing is far more beautiful and while the book does not shy away from life's cruelty, it offers the adolescent reader another view of the goodness in many people.A disappointing and tiresome read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Pat Conroy brings his characters from some world in which nobody can possibly be in the right situation. A military father, married to a gentle lady with weak children; a southern lady who has a vulgar family; a cynical girl with optimistic siblings; and a boy who just can't cut it being tough.Ben has the typical abusive military father. Ben draws some sense of false motivation from his father's insults and threats, so he never can truly grow by himself. Ben fears his father, yet at the same time, has some sense of loyalty that holds them together.Ben as a person is too weak to challenge his father's cruel treatments. He needs to conform to the expectations of his parents, as well as society, even though he is an outcast. Near the end of the book, when Ben assumes the role as family leader, although he has shown some growth, he hasn't avoided conforming to his father's expectations. Mary Anne still flicks tears at the back of his neck in the car, as she did to her father in the beginning.Conroy has the ability to place characters in seemingly impossible situations, and yet somehow their struggle makes a good story."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Though this is Pat Conroy's first novel, he certainly has promise as an author. His descriptions of locations and appearances are vivid and engaging. Unfortunately, one cannot say the same for his characters.Ben Meecham, a high-school senior, is coping with the physical and mental abuse of his Marine pilot father, Bull. His mother, a Southern Belle named Lilian, is sweet and kind, but not without faults of her own. The daughter, Mary Anne, only one year younger than Ben, is ugly and quite cynical. Yet they live together, in an uncertain harmony, with younger children Matt and Karen.The problem with these characters is not Mr. Conroy's ability to create them as living, breathing beings. It is, rather, the lack of depth he has given them. After reading the novel, one does not really care about what happens to the central characters, and that is a definate problem.Likewise, the events that surround them seem to be self-serving and only present to cause the desired outcome. Being in a military family, the Meechams are used to moving throughout the South at a moment's notice, leaving friends and family behind. Mr. Conroy introduces a rape, without ever resolving the cause or effect on the community, purely with the purpose of creating an ironic twist in the plot: Ben's best friend leaves him instead of the other way around.Bull Meecham's eventual death, likewise, seems to serve no purpose but to justify Ben's ascent to manhood. The effect on the rest of the family is rattled off with a mere few pages, most of which describe funeral arrangements.Nonetheless, Mr. Conroy's ability to create a living, breathing world that certainly engages the reader is more than enough to warrant reading this novel. Despite its obvious faults, it is quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I was thrilled with the price of the book, it didn't ship as quickly as I would have liked, but for the price, it couldn't be beat."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Just fabulous. No one can write realism like Conroy writes it.This coming of age story involving a young man and his overbearing and probably neurotic father combines nerve shattering angst with Conroy's trademark humor.The contest between Bull and Ben reflects not just that specific relationship but the challenge each of us faces when our very nature wars between our selfish controlling tendencies and our more rational compassionate side. Depending on any specific instance, one never knows where honor lies.Hard lesson for Ben to learn but learn it he did.Amazing storyline. Amazing writing. Amazing book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"A rare instance when the movie is more enjoyable than the book. The constant sibling rivalry was humorous until around page 75, then it became too much to bear. You won't miss anything by skipping the back and forth teen dialogue. Can't imagine that the conversations as written hadn't already occurred several times in their past. Thought the old saying, \\"and so's your old man\\" would have been better. Same for Santini and the constant barrage of over the top manliness. Sophomoric at best. See the movie and forget the book."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Years ago I read PRINCE OF TIDES and have always rated it as one of my favorite books. But I never got around to reading another Pat Conroy work until my son, who is in the Marines, gave me a copy of THE GREAT SANTINI.Written in 1976 but set in the American South on the early 1960's it describes a hard drinking brutal side of the Marine Corp air division, that is hopefully a thing of the past. With current pilots limited on their consumption of alcohol prior to flying and an entirely different attitude about drinking in the contemporary world, the descriptios of the binge drinking by Bull Meechum and his pilots was alarming and often disgusting. The brutality among the Marines and the crude insults and language among them were not comical to me, but I'm judging them from a 21st century female perspective.The descriptions of the spousal and child abuse by Bull were hopefully a thing of the past, along with the horrible racial sterotypes and racial abuse. We can only hope and pray that that generation of Americans no longer exist.If Ben Meechum were a real person, he would be in his early 60's as would his sister Mary Ann. Did Ben go in to the Marine Corp? One wonders what happened to Lillian Meechum after Bull's death and Karen and Matt. Was Lillian ever able to regain her own self respect and identity. Throughout the book I wondered how she ever stayed with this abusive and crude man who abused her and her children, but considered in the context of the time, maybe she did not have a choice.The Meechums were a totally disfunctional family. One would like to speculate on how this effected the Meechum children and their children.It's a good read, but hopefully a part of America that no longer exist."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Just like the title character of this book, the novel itself is powerful but flawed. While I was caught up in the maelstrom of family relations and spellbound by the character of Bull Meecham, there were too many times where events where whipped up and then cut off, leaving the reader with no resolution. It was ridiculous the way Conroy skipped describing the after effects of traumatic events on the family dynamics, which is the reason we're all reading the book in the first place.Also, while the descriptions of Bull's experience while flying and his thoughts of what a fighter pilot is were poetic, they really didn't add to the story and became repetitive by the end of the book.I would recommend this book if you haven't read a real powerful novel before (and Sheldon and Steel don't count) but if you've read about real family dysfunction in other good novels, this one doesn't really go all the way."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewThe Great Santini is a pretty good coming of age story. It is not bad as an embracing-your-southern-heritage story. But it shines when it humanizes a monster of a Dad and shows how families of dysfunction operate and compensate.Conroy blends humor and morbidity in this somewhat autobiographical look at growing up as a marine kid in the South.I prefer Ordinary People when it comes to dysfunction, and A Walk To Remember when it comes to southern coming of age but this is still a good and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"He died of oxygen deficiency the same way a 1956 Graduate of The Citadel Frederick G. Schenkel, My cousin, Died in a 1962 F-4 Phantom accident off the coast of South Carolina."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I discovered Pay Conroy as a young adult many years ago and in short order read everything he ever wrote. In my youthful, relatively uneducated mind, I couldn't help but think he was one of the greatest writers of all time. I distinctly remember the unmitigated joy of reading The Lords of Discipline for the first time, unable to tear myself away from the thing, staying up some nights until 4am with it. It was and maybe still is the most engrossing book I have ever read.Well, many years have passed and many more books are under the belt and I guess I've come to the conclusion that maybe Pat Conroy isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread after all, but, all the melodrama notwithstanding, he still has to rank up there somewhere. This one, The Great Santini, is a fine example of Conroy in his prime.We are introduced to the Great Santini--aka Bull Meacham, Marine fighter pilot--at a wild, drunken, hilarious going-away party in his honor in the first scene of the novel. We see immediately that he is a brash, loud, cocky and arrogant; traits that serve him more or less to good effect with his Marine subordinates, but traits that serve him far less effectively with his wife and four children.The story, of course, is truly about them, and especially Ben, the oldest of the siblings. The relationship with his father is of the classic love/hate variety. He is proud of his father: his exaggerated toughness, his extraordinary discipline, his status in the world as a true warrior. But he loathes him as well: his bullying, brutal, unbending tactics are too often unnecessarily thoughtless and cruel.There are so many fine scenes. One of the most famous is the one-on-one basketball game between the maturing seventeen-year old Ben and his insanely competitive father. Ben beats him, finally--a great moment in his life--but instead of getting the congratulations he deserves and has strived for since childhood, his father instead humiliates him, calling him a girl and systematically bouncing the basketball off of his head as he walks into the house.But as brutish as Ben's father is, his mother in contrast is filled with Southern charm and grace, and loves her children unconditionally. There is a wonderful scene that I had forgotten about, in which the family is walking to midnight mass on Christmas Eve. The mother is suddenly so overcome with joy that she begins to dance on the way, a gentle, graceful waltz, thrilling the children with her loveliness. Even old Bull expresses a growl of appreciation.The novel is loaded with scenes like this, both big and small. All of the characters are sharply defined and painfully human. And as with Conroy's other novels, there is a strong sense of the South, with its swamps and its backwoods, slow-paced charm. Conroy is also a very witty fellow, particularly the dialogue between his characters which is always hilariously dead-pan.However, by the end you realize that he's tried just a little bit too hard. The novel encompasses a little less than a year in Ben's life, yet his friend's date is victimized by a brutal rapist, another friend is murdered, he is threatened by a deputy sheriff, and finally he must come to terms with the death of a significant character. It is a bit much.But don't be dissuaded. It's nevertheless a fine novel, filled with wit, wisdom and painful honestly. As are all of his first four novels--The Water is Wide, this one, The Lords of Discipline, and The Prince of Tides--which are each and every one a terrific read."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I love all of Mr. Conroy's novels, but as a wife of a Marine, and a Catholic to boot, I found this one is my personal favorite. His descriptions, and snippets of dialog are so right on you almost wonder if he's been in your car during a move, or in your home during cleaning day. As far as all military men being abusive, that is a typical generalized statement that fills me with rage, as it is what one of the reviewers featured here remark. However, one almost feels a kinship with the Swaggering Marine pilot, as well as the beaten backs of his wife and children. You want to love him, but you cannot, due to his violence. By the way, the revised Marines' Hymn and Hail Mary cracked me up so much my husband demanded to know why I was laughing, and he managed a smile when I told him. Of course Catholic upbringing makes it a guilty pleasure! Pat Conroy knows how to keep his readers enthralled. Write something new soon!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"With &quot;The Great Santini&quot;, Conroy has somehow made Bull Meecham, a most abusive and tyrranical father, almost lovable by the end of the family's chronicle. Focusing mainly on Bull's stressing relationship with his eldest son, Ben, who will never be good enough, the story is funny, crude, but most of all,authentic."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"It's arguable that Pat Conroy is the Faulkner of the 'Boomer generation, and this story is a good argument for the opinion that some warriors should not raise families. The syndrome of &quot;bringing the job home&quot; can really get out of hand. Bull Meecham (a.k.a. &quot;the Great Santini&quot;) has only his Southern Belle--Philosophical Version wife to counteract his attempts to turn his household into a boot camp and his children into grunts (until I read this book, I thought my own WWII generation Dad was the poster child for vets who never really became civilians again--at least my old man wasn't still serving). &quot;Santini&quot; is without a doubt an asset to his jet fighter wing, but he's managed to father a son who's got an identity crisis from trying to emulate the old man without being enough of a hardcase to bring it off. There's also a daughter whose above-average intelligence, combined with the household invironment, has made her into an aggressive cynic. Then there's a baby sister who's still young enough for naiivite, but you can't help but speculate about what kind of person she'll turn out to be later in life. &quot;Santini&quot; is a curious mixture of a superlative fighthing man and a lousy parent."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Annie Dillard once wrote in Living By Fiction that \\"An honest work generates its own power.\\" Conroy is nothing if not honest, especially in Santini, modeled after his own father. In The Courage To Write: How Writers Transcend Fear, Ralph Keyes tells how after Conroy wrote The Great Santini, Conroy's dad called him at the end of each chapter, sobbing, asking Pat \\"Why do you hate me so much?\\"I can understand that knowing I would most likely react the same way if one of my children did the same to me, but as a reader I felt Conroy's love and respect for his dad. Conroy's characterizations were so real and so very honest, his prose so believable, that I wanted to hate Santini, but it wasn't possible; Conroy simply would not allow it.That is how I knew Conroy didn't hate his dad. He loved him, and despite the vacillations of our own emotions toward our own fathers, or maybe because of them, we know that even when we want to hate our dads we can't, not really.Rare indeed is the author who can present a character so complexly, so multi-dimensionally, without a trace of caricature. Conroy, in the truest traditions of Southern writers, does in almost all of his books. This is a wonderful book full of believable characters, lyrical prose and honest relationships.Like Potok's The Chosen, this story of a boy's clinging to and pulling away from his father leaves the reader more attuned to the harmony that can only truly be found deep in the wells of conflict."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This is the second book of Pat Conroy's that I have read (the first was &quot;The Water is Wide&quot;, which was his first book, I believe). It was gripping, disturbing, uplifting, all the more so, because he based it on his own relationship with his father. I especially found it admirable that he was able to be so brutally honest about his feelings towards his father, mother and institutions like the Catholic church.This all hit home with me, having been raised by a mother who was a devout Catholic as a child (and carrying all the attendant guilt that goes with it) and also having a husband who, after 17 years in the Army, can tend towards being a bit heavy-handed with my (and his) children and unable to express his feelings. I can see parallels in this book with the experiences my sons must have gone through trying to relate to their step-dad.This is a well-written book which I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"Conroy is the best of the best. Theres no better author at writing gut wrenching, heart stomping, laughter filled family sagas rich with strong appealing characters that you love to detest. This is not my favorite Conroy masterpiece, but I do believe it is the best. The characters in this story are like no other you will ever read. You will learn to hate certain charecters, yet at the same time you cant help loving them. I am utterly jealous of anyone who gets to read this book for the first time. If only I could go back in time........ Its that good!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"After re-reading The Prince of Tides (a classic), I went to my &quot;To Be Read&quot; pile and grabbed The Great Santini. Although, it did not 'capture' me in the way The Prince of Tides did, it is definitely a great read. Pat Conroy once again, through his lyrical words, proves what a great writer and story-teller he is. The Great Santini is a powerful story about military life and a very complex father/son relationship. I both loved and hated Colonel Bull Meecham (who is the Great Santini). I have spent over 20 years as a military wife and Conroy really &quot;knows his stuff&quot; as he tells the story of the complexities of a military family. Bull is a typical military officer who finds it difficult to separate the way he behaves on duty from the way he behaves as a husband and father. He wants and tries to run his family life in the disciplined, hard-fashioned way he commands his &quot;troops.&quot; Lillian is his devoted wife who plays the &quot;role&quot; of a military wife perfectly (I found her relationship with her son very touching--the letter she wrote him on his 16th birthday is a tear-jerker). Ben is Santini's son who is coming to terms with life as an adolescent and his feelings about his father; he is an extremely well written character who I grew to feel sorry for and admire at the same time. Maryann as Santini's sarcastic, wise-cracking daughter was my favorite character who has her own unique way of dealing with her father that makes the reader laugh out loud but, at the same time, realize how much she is hurting and craving his love and attention. It is a great story of the very good and also the very, very bad times of the Meecham family. It is funny, touching, emotional, sad--it has everything!! I highly recommend The Great Santini or any of Pat Conroy's books. He is the best!!"},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I recently read the Lords of Discipline and wanted to read more of Pat Conroy. I was not disappointed with the Great Santini. It is a coming of age story as seen through the eyes of the son of a disciplined Marine pilot and Lt. Colonel. The father gives himself the nickname, &quot;The Great Santini&quot; though Conroy never explains the origin of that nickname. But the main point is that the father tries to run his family the way a Marine drill instructor would run a platoon of recruits. The message of the book is that blind senseless discipline can be as damaging as no discipline at all. The novel has many facets. It covers the insecurities of &quot;military brats&quot; who are new kids in school each year, fathers who drive their sons too much, the relationship between the military and the civilian townspeople that surround tha base, and family reationships and alliances against a father who is both friend and foe. His relationship with his family is at times abusive. It also touches on race relations in the Deep South in the early 1960s, adolescence, and peer groups in school. Conroy writes from personal experience. I heard him say on a radio program that his father shut him out to some extent after The Great Santini was published. I guess it hit too close to home."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"This was the first of Pat Conroy's books I ever read and it has since become my favorite of all time. He is a wonderful author who brings his characters to life with a grace, humanity and humor rarely seen in modern literature. I would recommend any of his books, and have read them all myself many times."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"I purchased this book so that I would have a hard copy of each book I had/could read by Pat Conroy."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"\\"The Great Santini\\" makes for a strong debut when it comes to establishing the distinctive literary voice of a fine prose stylist, Pat Conroy. In terms of storycraft, dialogue, length, and especially resolution, what you get is a rather flawed package, but a book that contains such a variety of engaging vignettes, occasionally heartrending descriptions, and a gloriously crude and vital main character deserves a look.The title character, Bull Meecham, is a lieutenant colonel in the air wing of the U. S. Marine Corps, who we meet just after he has received his orders to return Stateside and assume command of a squadron for the first time. Also awaiting his command back home is the Family Meecham, in particular eldest son Ben, who both admires and fears his tough father as he counts down the days before becoming a man.Knowing this novel just from reading many of these reviews, or in my case, seeing bits and pieces on cable TV of Robert Duvall hollering at his cringing clan in the popular screen adaptation, is to be surprised. Meecham is tough and hard, but not nasty at all unless he's been drinking, which admittedly does happen a good deal given this takes place in 1962-63 when drinking was seen as a cornerstone of manliness for Americans both civilian and military. For the most part, Meecham is a big kid, who encourages his kids to act up and even attack him some mornings as a way of letting off steam. They can insult him with impunity as long as they are doing what he wants them to. His problem isn't unremitting cruelty, but the lack of a softer side.Meecham then is a character that is hard to hate, because you aren't supposed to. He talks rough, uses the N-word, treats subordinates harshly, but all of this is packaged in ebullient humor which, however lewd or physically dangerous, gives him a likability I found lacking in the rest of the book.Especially when Bull is in the background, which he often is, \\"Great Santini\\" plays less as a novel and more like a series of short stories with big build-ups and weak endings. Written as a coming-of-age story about Ben Meecham, who is a thinly disguised Conroy, we witness his encounters with bullies, his friendship with a stuttering black and picked-upon Jew, his Catholic guilt about sexual \\"self-abuse,\\" a sister who pushes his buttons as ruthlessly as his father, and his relationships with more nurturing male characters like the school's gutsy principal and an inspiring English teacher.All of this feels like typical nostalgia-novel stuff circa 1976, the year \\"Great Santini\\" was published. The dialogue, particularly between Ben and his sister Mary Anne, is clever Neil Simon-type wisecracking banter that amuses for a while but then gets tired and strained, and feels wrong for the novel. Conroy even throws in sudden violence, including an odd rape episode that like much of the book is left hanging. Much of this seems shoehorned into a second draft, after some editor asked Conroy to \\"Mockingbird\\" up his Southern-set story a bit.\\"Great Santini\\" also weighs in too long at 440 pages, problematic especially given the lack of a driving plot. Conroy can write, though, if more in the micro than the macro sense. Whether its watching Bull play a sick-but-hilarious joke on an indignant Navy officer and his wife in the book's opening chapter, or a description of savage death lurking under a placid marsh near the novel's end, my flagging interest found cause to rally. \\"Great Santini\\" is not a great novel, but it does contain a memorably multi-dimensional title character and some terrific writing."},{"Title":"The Great Santini","review":"When I saw the author's name, I knew the book would be great.

It would have made a refreshing end to an otherwise depressing family situation. Redemption is simply about hope."},{"Title":"Palladian","review":"Elizabeth Taylor's Palladian is this wonderful mid-century English writer's second novel, from 1946. (Perhaps needless to say, she was not the actress.) I'd previously read and enjoyed her first novel, At Mrs. Lippincote's as well as two late novels, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (one of the great old age novels), and The Wedding Group. Taylor was one of the great run of social comic writers in England at that time. (Along with Kingsley Amis, Barbara Pym, Muriel Spark among others.)The nominal protagonist of Palladian is Cassandra Dashwood, who becomes governess to Sophy, daughter of a rather ineffectual widower, Marion Vanbrugh, who lives in a decayed manor house with his drunk cousin Tom, Tom's pregnant sister Margaret, a couple of not very respectful servants, and Tom and Margaret's somewhat dotty mother. Cassandra is a romantical young woman who determines in advance to fall in love with Marion. And so she does. But that is a small part of the story. More important, perhaps, is Tom's tawdry relationship with the local publican's wife, and Tom's secret past involving Marion's dead wife. There are also telling tidbits from the POV of the two servants. Margaret's rather bossy and excessively bracing nature. Sophy is depicted as a pretty normal girl of her age, not at all a prodigy, desperate about her failure to be the beauty her mother was.The novel turns on a shocking event with about 40 pages to go. I admit I put the book down for a day or so at that point -- it seemed unearned, unfair. But -- though I am still unsure that that plot development works -- Taylor still brings home the novel quite effectively. It's by no means her best novel, but it's fine work. Delicately funny, acute, honest about its characters' failings but still fair to them. Taylor was a fan of Jane Austen, which is fairly clear in all her work, but perhaps never more so than here, as indicated by her protagonist's name, by the reference to the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier vehicle PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, which is shown at the local theater, and by a couple further overt references to Austen."},{"Title":"Palladian","review":"Elizabeth Taylor is a real writer's writer, which can be a term of disparagement as well as one of high praise. Taylor's novels always show amazing intelligence and care and devotion to craft, and at their best they can be moving and obsorbing; at their worst, however, they can seem a bit inhuman and cold. PALLADIAN, her second novel, falls into the latter category. This is truly a metanarrative, as its clever-clever title would indicate, suggesting not only the Palladian architecture of the estate on which most of the action takes place but also the realms of the intellectual, of Pallas Athena. The Austenian-named heroine Cassandra Dashwood goes to work at the estate as a governess, and dreams from the first of falling in love with her charge's widowed and mysterious father; Taylor acts immediately to deconstruct any such Brontsque narrative expectations by showing quickly that the true locus of interest should lie not with Cassandra and her employer but rather with her employer's dislikeable drunken cousin, who is sleeping with a pubkeeper in the nearby town. Characters are coldly sacrificed for the sake of narrative surprises and moral points; you end up admiring Taylor's skill and fine mind but not caring a bit for anyone in the novel at all."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"It has been many years since I first read this book and I found it very informative. I am sure there are bound to be some errors but on the most part it is historically accurate. It is not only about ending Bonnie and Clyde's murderous spree but about the man that did it and how he became a Texas Police Officer and came up through the ranks to become one of the greatest Texas Rangers who ever lived. The review written by anomie@mail.com, is total bull written buy someone who evidently prefers to believe the glamorized version of the Bonnie &amp; Clyde movie. I have been a Texas State Police officer for 23 years and have read some of the actual reports of Bonnie and Clydes exploits and to contradict anomie@mail.com, Bonnie and Clyde deserve no respect as stated by anomie. Anomie needs to be better informed of the facts before making reviews. Sorry for the rant but I hate for anyone to bad mouth a great man and take up for a couple of cold blooded illiterate killers who were glamorized by Hollywood as a cute loving couple out for a Sunday drive."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"This is an excellent biography of one of the greatest lawmen in U.S. history. I've heard a lot of rants from misguided Bonnie and Clyde fans about the book's alleged inaccuracies. Well, there hasn't been a book on Bonnie and Clyde or Depression outlaws published to date (including my own!) that hasn't had some drastic errors in it, one reason being that most of the books, including I'm Frank Hamer, draw heavily from the Fugitives, the ghosted 1934 memoirs of Bonnie's mother and Clyde's sister. I'm not one of these people who presume to know who killed the two highway patrolmen at Grapevine. It may have been Henry Methvin, Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, or all three for that matter (ballistics evidence indicated three guns were fired). Nor am I one of those misguided worshippers of Bonnie and Clyde, who were really nothing more than a pair of two-bit, scatter-brained, trigger-happy psychos. But all that is neither here nor there, as this is not simply a \\"Bonnie & Clyde book.\\" This is a biography, and a damn good one, of the man who tracked them down--Frank Hamer, who captured or killed dozens of other criminals and carried with him the scars, and much of the lead, from many gunfights with maggots of the Clyde Barrow sort. Hamer came out of retirement to run down the Barrow gang. The ambush of Clyde and Bonnie was the perfect closing of Hamer's career and a great service to America as well. It was the job he was made to do and one that had to be done. Forget Hollywood. The real Bonnie and Clyde were murderous criminals who deserved just what they got. And Frank Hamer was just the man to give it to them."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"Ill start with I read this book because I have a interest in turn of the century-depression era law enforcement, that I have heard of the legend of CPT. Hamer, and have enormous respect for him. This is the only book I have found dedicated to his career. If only a quarter of the book is true, Ranger Hamer must have been a brave, skilled, and most importantly, smart lawman.That being said, the book does lead to a bit of \\"larger than life\\" description of his exploits. I wouldnt go as far as to use Mr. Sprunks assessment of \\"hero worship\\", but a liberal dose of added drama seems to be a better term, to me. I dont doubt that the incidents occurred, and its obvious who won, but the writer does tend to almost glamorizing the engagements. I doubt CPT. Hamer enjoyed or relished the incidents. I would think he, as the true professional he was, did what needed to be done in a manner consistant with his era. He used the force necessary to accomplish the task at hand. I dont feel todays standards of use of force issues can be applied to the times in question. Judging from some of the photos of the stacks of dead Mexican bootleggers, I dont doubt CPT Hamer had to use surprise, stealth and superior firepower just to survive. I defy anyone, in the same set of circumstances, not to use the same tactics...and not just survive, but win. Lets see anyone else face down 30 plus armed, violent criminals, intent only on their goal, with only a handful of men and get them to just surrender. Add in being miles from any friendly assests, medical aid, communications, transport/detention facilities, etc., in an unforgiving, hostile climate. More power to you if you do.I will never understand the obsession our society has with Bonnie and Clyde, but who am I to say? Suffice to say, they were psychotic, cold blooded murderers who dont deserve the underground following they have. What I can say is the right man was picked for the job to take them out. Standard attempts to take them into custody failed, with dead law enforcement officers in the wake. They were dumped exactly as the deserved. Too bad for their victims it didnt happen sooner. The saddest part is if the same situation happened today, the officers would probably be prosecuted themselves. Maybe thats one of the problems this country has today in dealing with violent, degenerate killers.In an era where every public figures dirty laundry, failings and shortcomings are daily news, we may mistake that this is just another attempt to make a hero out of someone who didnt deserve it. This book was written in a time where writers went out of their way to make a hero. I dont feel CPT. Hamers story needs any assistance in telling of his heroic career, but look at almost any other like bio of the times. I feel he was a brave and honest man, a hell of a lawman and a true hero. I think the book is more of a sign of the times it was written in. Did it all happen just like this? Doubtfull, but is everything written about Daniel Boone, George Washington, and other great American heroes always 100% accurate? Enjoy a great read, and a probably fairly accurate story. Just take it with a small grain of salt."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"ITS BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS SINCE I INITIALY READ THIS BOOK.

Hamer refused all offers to memorialize him in print and on film until after his death in 1955. He was an unassuming leader in his law enforcement era of the turn of the century. Starting out as a fresh faced young man who pinned on a badge and went out to face insurmountable odds with true bad guys in the waning part of the 1800's and early 1900's in rural Texas. From an innocent youthful lawman, he earned his chops quickly facing down and shooting it out with literally dozens of desperados of the day. He carried the lead in his over six foot frame from being wounded nearly two dozen times in gun fights. I don't remember exactly, and maybe he didn't either, know how many men he shot, and it was certainly nothing he would have bragged about. He was fearless, cunning, stealthful and accurate in his dealings with people and sizing up his adversaries and situations. That's why they called upon him to come out of retirement to put an end to the scourge of Bonnie and Clyde. Despite the ridiculous hero worship of that couple, their gang, and death dealing exploits, Frank Hamer was their worst nightmare and tirelessly out foxed them into oblivion on a lonely, country, dirt road one morning in Louisiana. I have the original hardback book about him, somewhere in my stuff. One day I'll locate it, reread and perhaps shop the story to some of my old Hollywood contacts. We need a top quality western movie made about Frank Hamer's life and times, although I can't imagine who would be well cast in his role, perhaps Tom Selleck would be well chosen and do the part justice. Hamer is folk hero of the finest order not to be forgotten for the contribution he made and the role model he was for so many who came after him to a fine profession of true dedication and leadership. Though there had to be discrepancies in the totality of accuracy, Mr. Frost, Jenkins and Harrison should be applauded for dedicating their efforts at memorializing the man and his lifetime of accomplishments. A fine read about an exceptional life of an original lawman."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"I can't say on other portions of Frank's life, but with respect to the Bonnie and Clyde material this book is full of inaccuracies. The authors make the dire mistake of reprinting contemporary newspaper accounts as fact. For example, Bonnie had nothing to do with the grapevine killings, but this book states she kicked one officer over and shot him in the head, as was misreported at the time.Other items also make one wonder if they know what they are talking about -- the book identifies a very clear picture of W.D. Jones as Clyde Barrow! This is unforgivable and makes everything else in the book highly suspect. This book might make a good drink coaster but it's a little large."},{"Title":"I'm Frank Hamer;: The life of a Texas peace officer,","review":"I don't believe I've ever seen anybody read so much that simply is not there into such a small amount of text. I'm referring to some of the responses to my &quot;Frankly Lamer&quot; review that makes a few negative observations about the accuracy of the book with regard to Bonnie and Clyde (B&amp;C). For my brief comments I am accused of being amongst the &quot;misguided worshippers of Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and of attacking Frank Hamer himself. What nonsense. Read my VERY brief comments yourself. You'll see that some of these reviewers could read into my review that I support worldwide communist domination. For example, the June 24th 2000 reviewer stated that I said B&amp;C deserve respect. Where did that come from? Got me.Let me make a few points clear as air to some of my less-than-friendly fellow reviewers:1) Before attacking someone's opinion and character, ensure that you are indeed attacking his or her opinion and not something you concocted.2) Read my review of the movie &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; for a better feel on my opinion on B&amp;C. You'll find it somewhat different than your assumptions.3) Critiquing a book is not the same as attacking the subject of a book. Do I REALLY need to elaborate on this? True, all histories have errors. It's equally true that each and every one of those errors taints the authority of a book. This book had a few too many for my taste. I found myself questioning the authors in non-B&amp;C sections because of B&amp;C errors.4) Frank did America a lot of great services, including whacking B&amp;C. However, he is not a god -- brave and fascinating but not a god. Hero worship is for children. By the way, I suspect ambushing booze runners without trying to apprehend them first (if that indeed happened) takes one out of the &quot;great&quot; category. Prohibition was highly controversial at the time and hardly warranted denying someone, even a Mexican, due process or his life. However, if he starts shooting first, kill 'em.5) As an important part of America's great history, Frank deserves a history with a little more quality control.In short, I stand by my original review with the exception that I should have stated that Bonnie was &quot;most likely&quot; not at the Grapevine killing, rather than stating my opinion as fact.

In A Plain Account of Christian Perfection, Wesley provides an account of the development of his understanding of the doctrine of Christian Perfection. This short work contains a lucid explanation of the doctrine with special attention not only to the Biblical promises and commands that are the basis of the doctrine but also the practical way that \\"perfect love\\" works in the life of the believer. While this work was certainly intended to instruct those who were seeking \\"perfect love,\\" it also attempts to answer those who would deny the doctrine.The essence of Christian Perfection, for Wesley, was clearly defined by Christ when an expert in the law asked him, \\"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?\\" He said to him, \\"\`You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: \`You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\\" (Matthew 23.36-40 NRSV)Here one sees that, for Wesley, the main point of Christian Perfection is \\"perfect love.\\" \\"Perfect love\\" thus defines our relationship to God and others.This book is essential for those in the Wesleyan tradition and a worthwhile read for those from other Christian perspectives that wish to understand what Wesley thinks Christian Perfection is and is not."},{"Title":"A plain account of Christian perfection","review":"Wesley's brief treatise on the important yet overlooked Christian doctrine of perfection is a &quot;must read&quot; for all Christians interested in growing in Christ.

The text adequately surveys the law, but suffers from terrible proofing and editing; it also needs an update, because the 1994 edition obviously was not written any later than early 1993, based on the omission of certain important U.S. Supreme Court cases from 1994 and since. The book also suffers from an extremely strong pro-management tone; a more balanced approach would serve the untutored reader better. There are better books, such as the ABA Guide, which I commend to potential readers of this book."},{"Title":"Personnel Law (4th Edition)","review":"This book by Kenneth Sovereign is a very readable book on personnel or Human Resource Management law.The Human Resource Manager, manager, supervisor or others conderned with managing and supervising people should have a book such as this at their fingertips.

I purchased this book as a text for an Employment Law class and it was terrible; I quit using it halfway through the course and recommended the instructor find another text. The author seems to think he's the most credible person in the world but, as someone who is also a human resources practitioner, I can assert from experience that many of his opinions (several of which are presented as &quot;facts&quot;) are wrong. He clearly doesn't even understand what the field of human resources IS, and in many cases I found his tone very offensive.In addition to using more current information, Sovereign would be well-advised to better consider his audience and to research the field of human resources in general. I would suggest he start with professional organizations such as SHRM or ASTD; the advice and information on their web sites is far superior to anything in this text."},{"Title":"Personnel Law (4th Edition)","review":"Sovereign seems to skip around often in a half-hearted effort at being comprehensive.

It is basically about Mayo, a Japanese hitman who charges only $5.00 per whack because \\"that's all we're worth\\" he says. It follows his adventure through Maylasyia and other parts of Asia where he combats and eludes the Mob, paramilitary forces, and the local law enforcement.As for the art......BEAUTIFUL! Ryoichi Ikegami's drawings of people look exactly how an Asian person should look. None of that big eyes, big head crap. And the wonderful detail! I am one who greatly appreciates detail in comics and Mr. Ikegami delivers. The automobiles and firearms are almost photorealistic-looking at times! A caution, this is a very mature story filled with gangland killings and graphic depictions of sex, and other adult material. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the squeamish. But if you can handle the subject matter, then I highly recommend this comic book."},{"Title":"Access to Health (with Interactive Companion CD-ROM)","review":"Arrived on time in great condition (older edition, but couldn't find any wear!)

As near as I can figure, those reviews were written by the authors' entire circle of friends.What you get instead is a barely-sorted list of surrealist nonsense that tries way, WAY too hard to be funny and fails nearly every time.

Even if you decided you don't want to be exiled from polite society and thereby refrain from doing any suggested activity in the book, it's lots of fun to *imagine* yourself doing them."},{"Title":"Do Unto Others: 1000 Hilarious Ways to Screw with People's Heads","review":"Nonsense, though usually an annoyance, has proven itself to be quite useful. Nonsense breaks the monotony and stale routine of day to day life. It makes things interesting. It's only an annoyance when you are on the receiving end. When delivering, nonsense is a powerful tool for humor, manipulation, and self-entertainment. And that's where this book finds its place in the world.Everyday (and not-so-everyday) situations can be turned into memorble events with a little help from this book. Learn the most innapropriate yet humorous gobbledygook to spout when things take a turn into Dullsville. For example- Things to Do to Annoy Alex Trebek if You're on Jeopardy: 1.)Phrase answers in unconventional question forms: \\"Is it...\\"; \\"Would it happen to be...\\"; \\"Do you suppose maybe it is...\\"; \\"What in the Sam Hill is...\\" 3.)

This book far surpasses Amityville Horror. Don't take my word on it. You read it and give it your own review. I got it because I am from Cincinnati, Ohio, just across the river from where this all took place. By the way, I went there. It really is haunted. I put a review on The Amityville Horror page telling others to buy this book because it will keep you on edge and then believe me you will have to go to Bobby Mackeys nightclub and see this place for yourself. This is one book you should buy if you are into the occult and want to see if ghosts really exists"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"compared to Amityville Horror Hell's Gate is the real deal.

I know of what goes on in there and have visited the place a few times. While nothing has ever happened to me, I do know people who have had &quot;encounters&quot;. I read the book and read about places that I know exist and people who I either know or know of. This book tells the truth from what I have heard from first hand accounts. Of course, when you get a couple drinks in a bunch of urban cowboys, you never know what might happen."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"While down with the flu, I saw some pretty bad show about this place on the telly. Because Janet herself was interviewed on the show, I was intrigued enough to learn more about it, and I ordered the Kindle version of the book. From the first paragraph, I found the writing amateur and devoid of any primary source evidence. Where are the newspaper articles about the murders? Where are the oral interviews with people that inhabited the place back in the day, who could verify the hauntings or the actual events that \\"allegedly\\" took place? Did Carl or the exorcists or anyone EVER decide a camera or tape recorder might be a good thing to have around? I mean, come on!About the writing. As a historian that does oral interviews as part of my profession, the interviews were devoid of structure and some important questions, such as the times of day, days the events occurred, the emotional state of the persons before the occurrences, if they had shared their experience with any other persons,etc. etc. were never asked. Follow up research was never done either.What is quite funny to me, is the statement in the intro, where the author claims that all the people interviewed WOULD HAVE signed a sworn affidavit if they had to. Well...why didn't they? It is this kind of thing that makes the book completely without true value.I would like to add that I myself have seen a ghost and do believe in this phenomena. I truly want to believe in this type of story, but I do know that many many people have let their imaginations either supplant valid hauntings, or embellish them to the point of being unrecognizable. I am not even claiming there is no credible truth to the information in the book, my objection is that for people who want credible evidence, before they leap to conclusions, they will be sorely disappointed with this book. It might be that some of the events did occur, but have been embellished over time, this tends to be the case when cases like this grow into legendary proportions. And this is not at all to disrespect the Mackeys, but this kind of p.r. doesn't hurt biz, whether they encouraged it or not. T.v. shows, book deals, movies (which I hear one is being made) doesn't exactly hurt one's business. Someone around them might have had that in mind. Hey - it happens.One last comment, I worked at a historical site and went to a college that were both allegedly filled to the brim with ghosts. After doing a lot of research, none of the legends that caused the hauntings ever occurred.

YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"First off, there is no known connection between the site of Bobby Mackey's in Wilder, Kentucky, and the murder of Pearl Bryan a century ago. None. The connection is a tall tale/urban legend that has grown in the telling over the years until it has been somehow sucked into the realm of fact. Secondly, let's not forget this much trumpeted lawsuit against Mr. Mackey \\"arising from an attack on a customer, by a spirit\\" was quite rightly booted out of Campbell County Court, with popular opinion pegging the lawsuit as what it almost certainly was: an extortion attempt. Third, this book is passable as a modestly spooky tale and I do give it credit as that, but as far as its research and authenticity goes, this is nothing more than a collection of hearsay and anecdotes, invention and \\"reports\\" sewn together and marketed as an expose. No scientific investigation whatsoever. Bobby Mackey's is a nightclub, folks. People go there and get drunk. Doesn't that in itself sort of explain away 9/10ths of the \\"paranormal\\" claims of the place? The others I would put down to the fact that people like to make things up. I've been by the site of Mackey's before, and except for the fact it's a country-western bar in the Kentucky highlands, it doesn't seem all that interesting. I guess read this book for fun, but use your head and realize these accounts of demonic activity and \\"possessed wells\\" olfactory manifestations and disconnected jukeboxes playing \\"the Anniversary Waltz\\" it's all fabrications compiled atop of exaggerated ghost stories. And not very creative ones at that."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"This book is poorly written,edited, and at time reads worse than an R.L. Stine Goosbumps novel.I feel sorry for people who buy into these ghost stories without doing any research.The Pearl Bryan legend is just that, a legend. I am researching the subject as a history major at the University of Cincinnati. There is absolutely no primary documentation or evidence in general to support the satanic cult theory suggested by Hensley. None. In fact, every website that posts the Pearl Bryan murder legend fails to accept the simple historical facts. People just can't seem to accept that the two mile proximity of the murder to what is now Bobby Mackey's is just a coincedence.GET OVER IT!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"This is a must read. I had to check out this book after hearing everything about the haunting of Bobby Mackey's. At first I was skeptic, but as I was nearing the end and hearing others tell their stories, it made me believe. The author does a superb job of telling the facts. He ties everything in a chronogical order and I liked that a lot. I don't think I will be visiting Bobby Mackey's alone or drive by it at night after reading this book. I had trouble sleeping nights after reading this book. I kept thinking about the story. This book keeps you thinking long after you put it down. There was another book at the Kenton County Library in Covington titled just Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World. It was a different version of this one and wasn't published by a publishing firm. None of the chapters matched up with this book. I think it was written by the author before getting it published. It looks like it is handmade.

I recommend this book for good entertainment, and for a good chill up the spine."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I'm gonna come right out in the beginning and state that I did originally did get the idea of reading this book from the television series \\"Ghost Adventures\\" but unlike some of the other reviewers on Amazon I read it because I am a man whom appreciates history, not because I'm a \\"Ghost Adventures\\" fan. Historical research is my passion and because so many tales weave themselves into the historical past of the Bobby Mackey's Music World establishment I felt I had to check it out in order to explain to myself some of the strange happenings which seem to go on daily at the music hall.The science and study of the paranormal also has a stake in the historical past as present-day haunting's usually have their start through a traumatic event in the past. Only studying the records and notes related to the haunted site or location will yield answers for those seeking them.Mr. Hensley does a fantastic job describing and reinterpreting each ghost story told to him by eyewitnesses, although some seem to fantastic to have any basis in truth. The person reading the book has to have an open mind about what he/she is reading and not rush to quickly to judgement for it took seeing a ghost myself so many years ago before I came to realize and admit the existence of ghosts. The author creates a setting within the storyline stretching from the Mackey's purchasing of the property in 1978 to the early 1990's that reveals the true terror, suspense and at times ridicule that man must face in the eye of his fellow creatures when confronted with things which he cannot explain. The writing style of Mr. Hensley is top notch and I could barely force myself to put the book down until it was finished less than a day after I started reading it. Along with the eyewitness accounts Mr. Hensley provides some quite detailed and extensive history of the building both in the beginning and end of the book including information that I had not heard of until the reading of this book. In the end I enjoyed the book greatly and if Mr Hensley decides to write another investigative paranormal book I will be sure to read it."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I read this book in the 90's because my mother left it in her room and I happen to pick it up. The cover was appealing so well, .....I thought I'd check a few pages out. I was hooked. Couldn't put the book down.Since I lived in Kentucky at the time, I felt I had to drive up there one night, (late) and visit. Driving late kicked the suspense for sure. As we approached the building we were both freaked out. It was dark and the only illumination was a single street light showing the front door. Bugs were flying around, it was muggy outside. I was petrified. Probably all because of the book. It was almost 2 am. . Didn't see a thing. No activity or wierdness. But I tell you, I was scared out of my mind. The place seemed as if it were alive and evil itself. That's all I can say about that 1st night. It was closed, of course. I wanted to see things. I WAS pretty scared and too much of a Wimp to venture behind it were the river was etc etc..The next time I visited was in the day because I wanted to see if maybe someone was there. I was less scared of course. A guy with somewhat long hair and a large build walked out of the front door. He was pretty nice. He said hello. I said, \\"Oh, hey, we read that book and HAD to come by and see for ourselves.\\".He actually said we could COME IN!!! Nothing was going on and no one was there so he said, \\"I'll show you around if you want.\\". Maybe it's because we were 2 girls in mid 20's. We toured the whole place.As far as the book goes....it was hard to put down. When I saw that well in the basement and stairs that led to nowhere I felt strange. The well looked like it had been charred with flames 20 ft high. It had a few boards across it. But not enough to cover the whole thing. That was the creepiest part.The other time I visited was when the place was open for business. It was kindof fun even though I don't like country music much.Here are the experiences I had which were not realy much:~Was freezing cold when others seemed find. Janet Mackey herself asked me if I was cold.~Mechanical bull malfunctioned several times and sparked~Bobby Macky sat at the end of the bar and said to us that he STILL has never seen a thing happnen there.~The stereo system set up on the stage burnt out and smoke came out of it. Someone (don't remember) said that happens all of the timeOther than that....the people there seemed to be having a lot of fun and seemed to LOVE in-line dancing. Music was pretty good.I'm not sure if this story is a hoax or not but the book is dam good.Visiting the place added to the excitement. I'm glad I did and will again.KathyPortland, Oregon"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"This was a great book to read if your just looking for information on Bobby Mackey's! It wasn't written in the best way, but still a good read. The story is true and I've been there and experienced the paranormal myself. We go down there for a bowling tournament every year and heard about Bobby Mackey's from one of the locals. I've always wanted to ride the mechanical bull and I love to dance, so this was the place for us! Other reviews have discounted the claims of things that have happened at Bobby Mackey's and summed it up to claims by drunks, well I don't drink! What makes my experience even better, was the fact that I wasn't sure if something was happening or not until I finished the book. I was in the bathroom and the toilet kept continuing to flush. Being that I'm a maintenance worker by trade, I thought I would take a look at it. I couldn't find any reason why it would be doing that. After playing with the handle a couple times it would just stop. This happened more than once. After finishing the book, it said that this was one of the things the ghosts would do. Also, we went there on a Thursday night not knowing that Bobby Mackey's is only open Friday and Saturday nights. I pulled the car up on the sidewalk to shine the lights on the door looking for some hours and I could feel a sense of evil. I most certainly would not want to be there alone in the dark for very long! We had a great time at Bobby Mackey's and we will be back again this year. I did look around and think the place could use some fixing up, but after reading the book, I now know why it looks like that!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"this guy either has a bunch of freinds juking his reveiws or he has carved a very specific niche in writing for auto salesmen who are also horror fans the same people who have doubled their sales also have read every horror book by this hack and gave them raving reveiws. you people should be ashamed of yourselves this man dose not belong in the same sentence as Stephen King. spend your money on real writers and not this hick. you maybe able to fool your hillbillie neighbors but not everyone. p.s. my xbox360 broke yesterday and yes i do have time to research and did and you guys are juking your stats anyone else interested it takes 2 seconds to see."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I am putting a review on here for anyone who loves true ghost stories. I am the author of Hell's Gate - Terror At Bobby Mackey's Music World. I spent two years researching this story prior to writing it. I promise you that this is the most investigated and documented case of poltergeist attacks, multiple hauntings and demon possession that you will probably ever read. I did not believe what I was hearing when I decided to investigate this story but as I spent months investigating stories from over 30 people, including employees, Police Officers, patrons, and even the Clergy I realized that I had stumbled onto a real case of demon and poltergeist attacks. During my research and investigation I was present for a six hour exorcism where a Pentecostal Minister tried to rid this place and the caretaker of these unclean spirits. Well. It semed that this worked but some time later people began reporting more encounters with ghosts and unseen spirits.The reports continue still today. Inside the book I have added the exorcism word for word as it happened and I described what went on as the walls shook and tables flew across the room and much more so anyone reading this book will feel some of the effect of what I experienced.After writing this book I have appeared on many TV and radio Talk Shows such as Geraldo, Sally Jessee Raphael, sightings, Encounters, Real Ghosts, The Other Side and many more. Many of these TV shows sent in their own psychics and paranormal investigators and they all concluded that this is America's most documented case of a haunting they have ever witnessed. They all said that Bobby Mackey's Nightclub was filled with unseen spirits, some very evil. I am not putting this review on here simply to sell books. I want everyone who reads this to realize that there really are ghosts, unseen spirits and demons walking amongst us. I myself, was a non-believer in ghosts until I stumbled across this story by accident. If you read this book I hope that you will want to make yourself right with God because we all need his protection from the evil that surrounds us. Thank you for taking the time to read this and God Bless."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I just read a bunch of bad reviews on this book. I find it funny that all of a sudden this book has gotten bad reviews after receiving hundreds of top reviews. Someone is slamming this book and having others help do the same for some unknown reason. This is absolutely one of the most terrifying books on paranormal activity that has ever been written. If the book is so bad why has it been the topic of TV shows such as Geraldo, Sally Jessee Rapheal, Sightings, Encounters, Real Ghosts, Discovery TV, National Geographic, The Other Side, A Current Affair and many many more? Sounds like someone either has a grudge against the author or Bobby Mackey. If you want to be scared read this book alone at night and then you be the judge- Amityville would take a back seat to this book becasue this story is true."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS AND EVIL SPIRITS YOU WILL AFTER READING THIS BOOK. NEVER IN ALL MY YEARS HAVE I HAD A BOOK CAPTIVATE ME UNTIL NOW. MY ONLY QUESTIONS IS WHY IN THE HECK HASN'T HOLLYWOOD MADE A MOVIE OF THIS ONE? THIS STORY, WITH ALL THE DOCUMENTATION AND ADDED PROOF, MAKES OTHER STORIES LIKE AMITYVILLE HORROR SEEM LIKE SOME CARTOON. THIS ONE SHOULD BE A BEST SELLER.

I felt like something was breathing down my neck when I entered and I remember driving by one night in November and smelling the strong scent of roses comming from the building... so scary... I recommend this book to anyone and everyone! When I told others about this book and the story they had their own stories to tell from being there! My hubby's father can't ride the machanical bull when he goes there because it immediately speeds up to full power when it's set on the slowest speed! This book is very scary and, best of all, it's TRUE!Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!Always, ~Tara~"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"The story is a fairly good one if you're interested in supernatural phenomenon. Parts of the book are truly scary in spite of Mr. Hensley's inability to write. Mr. Hensley's writing skills are abysmal at best. The fact that I actually finished the book is testament to the fact that the book can be chilling at times. It's unfortunate that the book wasn't authored by an actual writer...that might have made for a really good book. It doesn't appear that the book was proof read for errors. There are repetitions and word errors. The book is definitely not worth the listed purchase price but if you can pick up a second hand copy for less you'll probably get some thrills and not regret your purchase."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"Is this for real?Parts of this book seemed to have been made up.I first saw this story on TV on a show about ghost so I was really looking forward to reading the book. And the book starts off really good and parts I think are true but the more you read it just seems as if people are adding on to the story and it starts to make you wonder if these things really happaned as these people say.Things fly across the room'ghost talk to people'Not a bad read for someone who wants to read a ghost story.But is it true or false you be the judge."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I read about this book on the internet and couldn't wait to get it. I did and was really disappointed. The author uses way, way, too many unnecessary adjectives. I expected at any time the narrative to become \\"he went and then she went and then he went...\\" I think the book needs to be edited. Some better pictures would have been nice too."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"I live near Bobby Mackey's and have visited on occasion. The eerie feeling, and the numerous people in the book whom I either know or know of made me afraid to drive down the road in the dark. After telling people I know about the book many came forward with similair stories and or personal recounts of the events in the book. Its chilling retelling is both horrific and spell binding-the autheor has done a wonderful job of compiling and recounting the many terrific stories that come out of &quot;Hell's Gate&quot;. For Ghost story lovers this is a must read-I bet you sleep witht he lights on for awhile too- or come visit Bobby Mackey's and hear and see for yourself. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"My friend wanted this book for years. We never could find it at the book stores. Someone told her to try Amazon and we found it on the first try. She says it is the best book ever."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"The author begins with the true story of the murder of Pearl Bryan of Greencastle, Indiana (Scott Jackson and Alonzo Walling were hanged in 1897 for that crime) and amasses an interesting folklore collection surrounding the tragedy. The epicenter of these ghastly goings-on is a country-western bar and nightclub in Wilder, Kentucky called \\"Bobby Mackey's Music World.\\" As Douglas Hensley boldly claims, this is the site of \\"America's most documented haunting.\\"I promised that folklorists would savor this book, or portions therein. Here is but one passage that teases the palate like a single shrimp. Carl, an employee, is cursed with a case of hemorrhoids (dare I say of biblical proportions?) as a punishment from Satan for bringing in a minister to perform an exorcism. The plot (among other things) thickens as Carl's bathwater turns to blood and the ghost of Alonzo Walling appears to him and commands him to \\"Tell that preacher to p*** off!\\" Carl cries \\"God help me!\\" but Alonzo's ghost proceeds to hold Carl's head under the bloody bathwater. Submerged, Carl hears another command from Alonzo: \\"Bow to Satan or die now!\\" Poor Carl, wedged between a violent ghost and his throbbing hemorrhoids, says \\"I bow!\\" Then, \\"As suddenly as it had begun, the attack ended\\" writes Hensley.As if the traditional legends were not enough, Hensely collects and reports connections to a Satanic cult and the Mafia. There's even a runaway Chevy Nova anecdote connected to one who dared to disbelieve. And you thought cautionary tales were waning, didn't you? Anyway, this is an amusing collection for anyone interested in supernatural folklore, Indiana or Kentucky folklore, or just plain entertainment."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"After reading some reviews on this book, I shelled out the $23 bucks and waited anxiously for the delivery so I could read what many have deemed this incredible book of true horror. I have soon come to realized that any good reviews had to have been written by friends and relatives of the author. Shame.Not only couldn't I make it through the first half of the book but it feels like it was written by a 4th grader. The only horror that this book contained for me was the price I paid for the book. Bad, bad book!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World","review":"This book was great. I have always been fascinated by ghosts and especially the haunting of this local bar. At first the story seemed unreal. But, the author thought so to at first. He did a great job of research. He lists everything in a chronilogical order, which helped me keep track as the events unfolded. There is also a nice appendix of affidavits, pictures, references to support the history, and a bar layout map. This book kept me thinking about it long after I put it down. I had trouble sleeping the first night after replaying it in my mind. There is another version of this book at the Kenton County Library, Covington. It appears to be a homemade copy and wasn't published. I believe the author wrote it before finding a publisher. It isn't the same as this book. It is the same story but the chapters don't match up to this book. I plan on checking it out next. It is titled &quot;Terror at Music World&quot;"},{"Title":"Run in circles (Marine Corps sea-stories)","review":"The book is an add to my book collection of books that are on my CMC Reading list.

If you are into the \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel mystery this is a \\"must read\\" book. It also has some great historical insight to the political running of Los Angeles in the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Family Secret is also interesting as it intertwines with the life of Howard Hughes as represented in the movie The Aviator. Double thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"Family Secret","review":"When I heard Family Secret was a story that claimed to solve the Siegel murder mystery my first impression was one of skepticism. After reading this story however I am now convinced that the Author's have solved the Siegel killing with one of the few theories that makes sense. Wealth, power and political influence were just as strong in 1947 as they are today and this is an accounting of Siegel's demise fit for Hollywood. A very good story, well written and an unexpected treat."},{"Title":"Family Secret","review":"I liked several things about Family Secret. The Author does an excellent job of providing a fascinating and very believable story of how and why Benjamin Siegel's murder was never solved. I always felt Siegel's murder was never solved due to something amazing and this story llives up to that expectation. A very good read. I hope to see this one on the big screen one day. It's a great book, let's hope the film version does it justice!"},{"Title":"Family Secret","review":"What a great book! If it wasn't for life's interruptions, I wouldn't have put it down. It caught me from the beginning. I don't know much about Bugsy Siegel or the mystery of his murder, but the Author did a wonderful job weaving the tale. Given this information, I wonder if the investigation shouldn't be reopened. I hope this comes out as a movie. I think it would make a great one."},{"Title":"Family Secret","review":"This book is heartbreaking as it tells of a family torn apart and destroyed by violence. It is also an amazing look into the real story and given facts of the murder of mobster Benjamin Siegel."},{"Title":"Family Secret","review":"WOWThis was the best book I have read in a long time. I simply could not put it down.

I checked out this book because I have read the author's other novels (\\"Don't Pay the Ferryman\\" and \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\"). First of all, I must admit that I am not a huge fan of poetry. I have a difficult time \\"getting excited\\" about reading poetry because of the various different styles (most of which I just don't care for). That being said, I DID enjoy this book because a lot of the author's poems were straight-forward and told an interesting story. I especially liked his version of \\"The Raven\\" as well as the poem he dedicated to his nephew. I was also happy to see he included the poems from his first two novels. I didn't give it 5 stars....but it was still an enjoyable book to read. And the cover design was truly fantastic!!!"},{"Title":"The Christmas pageant","review":"I got this book from the library for my 3 year old.

From her cousin getting hung up on a tree and her father dying in the revolutionary war, it kind of sucked.

I prefer more interesting books than this."},{"Title":"The Hollow Tree","review":"Phoebe Olcott's mother died when she was young and she had to look after herself and her father. He was a teacher in New Hampshire and in 1775 he went to war to fight for independence from England. He died and young Phoebe went to live with her relatives who were Loyalists. She is a timid girl but determined as she finds herself trying to complete a mission for her cousin who was caught and hung for being a Loyalist spy. She wants no part of this war that separates families and drives neighbours out of their homes with very little to survive on.This well researched historical fiction tells the story of how one girl found the courage and strength to do what she believed was right unbeknown to the people that she joined as they traveled towards Canada where they would be safe. On the way, she proves herself useful by taking care of other young children that no one seems to want. She also finds a special love with Jem Morrisey.Some people just have to grow up fast and in strange and difficult circumstances. Phoebe is a girl who puts many of the other characters in the story to shame as she rises through all her challenges to be a shining star.I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Hollow Tree","review":"it was so interseting!! you never know whats going to happen next!! there is so much going on you really have to pay attion!!

Also, the story of Pheobe and her journey was wonderfully written. It had adventure and self discovery all together."},{"Title":"The Hollow Tree","review":"Very good book! I have never read a book on where the point of view was from a Loyalist. I think that this is very important, to show that they are human beings too!

The towns in the book are typical small towns that many people have never heard of, even if they live in the South. Bonnie Ramsey does a great job of finding many distinct and interesting facts about these towns and their culture, while Dennis O'Kain does a fine job of portraying some of the prettiest houses in the South in his photos. This book is for anyone who enjoys the beauty and culture that is associated with the South, even if you think you are competent in Southern culture and towns. This book will surely be a welcome addition to anyone's library.

This was a huge let down. It took what should have been a magical book and turned it into \\"Wanna See Average Pictures of Average People's houses?\\"It failed to capture the essence of the south. Interesting looks at intimate areas, the towns and flavor. It had basically nothing but, pictures of houses.It had none of the charm of the European series. None of the culture or flavor of the region like the New England one.It caught a few towns but, you could not tell because it featured nothing about the town.This book does a great disservice to the series."},{"Title":"Gardens of Persia","review":"This book comes close to being all things to all readers. And if you don't feel like reading, you can simply enjoy the generous spread of illustrations -- maps, drawings and diagrams, beautifully reproduced Persian miniatures and above all the superb photographs by Jerry Harpur, a longtime specialist in capturing gardens and plants all over the world on film.This is much more than a picture book: the name guarantees a literate and enlightening read. This book is not about gardening in the usual sense of how to grow certain plants in particular places at specific seasons: it covers the role of gardens in the social history of thousands of years of culture. But if you have a bare terrace or balcony, you will still find more than a little incidental inspiration in these pages. This book is a vast work of research, but it remains on a human level.Armchair travelers will enjoy the rare opportunity to learn more about what is perhaps one of today's least known cultural regions. Even philosophers will find food for thought in some of the quotations from Persian and Western writers: \\"The real gardens and flowers are within, they are in man's heart, not outside.\\" (Rumi The Masnavi Book IV)"},{"Title":"Gardens of Persia","review":"Once again Penelope Hobhouse combines her peerless practical knowledge of plants with a passion for research and a love of garden history. In Gardens of Persia, she follows their evolution, from attempts to embody a vision of paradise to contemporary expressions of wealth and power. In all these spaces, with their distinctive template combining subtropical plants, buildings, and water, she finds that initial and powerful spiritual impulse always present, even where the imperatives of the world seem, on the surface, to be the motivation. The book is a beautiful production, with 150 specially commissioned photographs by Jerry Harpur, and a wealth of archival images and plans."},{"Title":"Gardens of Persia","review":"fast service, nice reading book every gardener would love this book. would reccommend this to everyone who loves to garden"},{"Title":"Gardens of Persia","review":"As I am certainly not a gardening enthusiast, I was positively surprised by this amazing book. It is setting its topic into the (long Persian) historical background, draws interesting conclusion between Persian and Western gardens, and is simply a good read.A special mention should be given to the nice photos and, in particular, the engravings, which give an impression of how the sites developped in the last centuries."},{"Title":"Gardens of Persia","review":"What a disappointment. Beautiful pictures of archaeological sites, architectural elements, desert scenery; pretty Persian miniatures, nice diagrams and drawings BUT where are the gardens? Oh, maybe after page 100 or so we start to see photos that actually look like the garden was the main focus of the picture. That's what I get for ordering books sight unseen, huh.

Janda to be technical, dry and boring. Well, was I surprised to find it engaging, very readable but also, very alarming.While doing his residency in orthopedic surgery, Dr. Janda discovered that the majority of baseball and softball injuries came about by players sliding into bases. Most of these injuries were caused by stationary bases. He researched various breakaway bases, and found a set that he thought would prove to be much safer. He convinced the University of Michigan to replace six of their fields with stationary bases, and the other six with the new breakaway bases. He had a group of volunteers record the injuries due to sliding over a two year period. At the end, the results were amazing! Injuries were reduced by 96% and cost of treatment reduced 99% with the breakaway bases. This helped lead to his founding The Institute for Preventative Sports Medicine. It is one of the very few independent research groups that focus solely on prevention and is not funded by sporting good companies.What I find alarming is Janda's conviction that nobody is much interested in preventing sports injuries--from sporting good companies to insurance companies to schools and communities. Surprisingly, most baseball and softball leagues (from professions to amateurs) refused to start using the breakaway bases despite Janda's research. Many times there's a conflict of interest. \\"The National Operating Committee for the Safety in Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE), [is] an organization funded by the sporting goods manufacturers.\\" Of course they're not going to rule against equipment manufactured by their sponsors. Janda ponders that unsafe and defective automobiles are required to be recalled, but \\"Why aren't sporting goods manufactures subject to the same standards?\\"Janda also provides lots of autobiographical information about his childhood, his schooling, his family, and how he became interested in medicine. He also spends much time discussing his efforts in the area of prevention. There are also a number of appendices at the end that are helpful to parents by covering such topics as Preventing Soccer Injuries, Playground Safety, Dehydration, Swimming and Water Safety, Preventing Baseball and Softball Injuries, and a Prevention Checklist--just to name a few.As a physical education teacher of 31 years and someone who coached varsity sports for 24 of those years, I can't recommend The Awakening of a Surgeon enough."},{"Title":"The Awakening of a Surgeon","review":"From Dave Janda's spiritual awakening as he holds the limp body of his daughter in his arms, Janda makes a deal with higher powers to pursue preventative sports medicine in exchange for the recovery of his daughter. The Awakening of a Surgeon details the evolution of Janda's vow to research and promote sports injury prevention, reports his studies, and provides an inspirational and witty chronicle of this dedicated physician's endeavors to spread his prevention message to policy makers: politicians, educators, sports equipment manufacturers, health care providers, insurance executives, and most importantly, the common man and soccer moms. Janda reveals the astounding problem of convincing the establishment to adopt preventative measures based on the independent research and data from scientific studies developed by his institute. From studies of the incredibly effective break-away bases, moderately effective helmets and face guards, and the harmful heading practices in children's soccer, to the actually dangerous soft baseballs and chest protectors, Janda's information and recommended solutions are invaluable knowledge for every responsible parent with a child interested in sports. Janda's encounters with public figures and his humorous anecdotes, which reveal both the character and support of his close knit family and provide an insight to this dedicated surgeon's drive to benefit mankind, illuminate the data he reveals in his studies. Countering the frustration Janda faces in his advocacy and dealing with HMO's, Janda proposes an 8 point national health care reform highlighted by his radical proposal of medical savings accounts.

It is also a good mystery: why haven't the recommendations of Dr. Janda and the Institute for Preventative Sports Medicine been widely implemented nationally? It seems like a no brainer: the recommendations don't seem to interfere with the enjoyment of the sports, they have been proven to dramatically reduce injuries, and they greatly reduce health care costs. The recommendations seem to make everybody happy. What's the problem? Read the book to find out. I may be prejudiced because Dr. Janda saved my arm, but I loved this book and so has everyone to whom I have given it.

Your anger will then form through his dealings with sporting goods manufactures and insurance companies to implement preventative measures.

He's an incredibly talented and caring individual who's extremely passionate about helping others by preventing sports injuries. His book is easy to read, incredibly interesting and insightful into big issues in health care, and is 100% from the heart.The story of Roger Hall (inventor of the Lego type breakaway baseball / softball base) is amazing for both his challenges and persistence. Roger lost a friend after a freak sliding injury resulted in death (due to complications). Roger spent the next eight years working to create a breakaway base that would reduce the chance of injury. When he finally had a working design, he found he could not manufacture and market the base himself. He teamed up with a manufactuer who then did not promote the product. He then broke ties with this manufacturer and tried to have the bases made overseas, but the original manufacturer blocked the tooling to create the bases. The book dives into the reasons why a major sports equipment maker would neglect to produce a safer baseball base, why the insurance industry doesn't get involved to reduce its medical expenses, and why professional and college teams do not demand safer equipment.

During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops and all the events seem to be going nowhere.

Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me. Read at your own risk of being completely disappointed with Faulkner's A Fable."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"A Fable: Another very difficult read by William Faulkner. As in his other novels, I feel as a member of an extraterrestrial race trying to understand the language of humanity. Or maybe it's the other way around, Faulkner is from another (better) planet. Faulkner speaks for all of us, about all of us, but uses a language that has not yet been invented. Think about people living in Vienna in the 1820's who happened to listen to Beethoven's last quartets or piano sonatas. It took over a hundred years for these pieces to become routine pieces to play or record. Same here. We have to struggle with his writing because it comes from another place, space, world. But it does show profound knowledge of man's affairs and struggles.The most amazing feature of his writing, to me, is the lack of time parameters. He reached the peak of artistic use of this technique with the beginning of Sound & Fury, but the Fable is a good example as well. What happens happens many times, in different parts of the book, and in the same sentence often one finds links to three or even more threads, episodes with a three-legged horse in Kansas are knitted together with a woman in France, 1918, a piece of bread, a minister and the FBI! Of course you will not get it, this is the whole point, this is a real BOOK not a story. There is a hidden universe in almost every sub-section, and to add to the universal message of this work, the names of those involved are rarely used. To give an example on how broad the scope of this work is, let's try to make a movie out of this parable:it will last 1/2 hour and suck for the most part. Instead, read Faulkner as you would read a book in a foreign language, with a pencil and paper on your bedside table, take notes, reread often. There is no rush, quite the opposite, the more you save for tomorrow the better your week will be!"},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"I'll start this review by saying that I don't pretend to be a literary critic but am simply an avid reader. This is my second Faulkner novel having read The Sound and The Fury twice many years ago. This won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize which has been done only a few other times. I had high expectations as I think so highly of The Sound and The Fury and Faulkner is clearly one of the great twentieth century authors.I was also fascinated by the topic of the Christ analogy in World War I. Finally, Faulkner considers A Fable to be his masterpiece.I was prepared to reread where necessary and I was prepared for a difficult book.Despite all this, I truly hated this novel. It is an extremely dense novel where absolutely nothing is spoon fed to the reader. Every day that I read this I found to be an immense chore. I love reading but could only stand to read A Fable at a pace of around 20 pages per day. While reading it, I described it to friends as sapping my will to read.In the end, I consider it a noble failure. Perhaps only a great writer like Faulkner is ambitious enough to fail so completely. Despite reading the entire book and even rereading large chunks of it, I found it completely unenjoyable.As far as describing the plot, I'll simply quote the Wikipedia entry which is a good summary. POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING: Though the ending is no surprise, it is described in the following entry.---A Fable is a novel written in 1954 by the American author William Faulkner, which won him both the Pulitzer prize and the National Book Award in 1955. Despite these recognitions, however, the novel received mixed critical reviews and a reputation as one of Faulkner's lesser works.[1] The author, on the other hand, spent over a decade and tremendous effort on A Fable, and considered it his masterpiece when it was completed.Historically, it can be seen as a precursor to Joseph Heller's Catch-22.The book takes place in France during World War I and stretches through the course of one week. It tells the stories of \\"Corporal Zsettslani\\", who is representative of Jesus. The Corporal orders 3,000 troops to disobey orders to attack in the brutally repetitive trench warfare. In return, the Germans do not attack, and the war is simply stopped when the soldiers realize that it takes two sides to fight a war. The Generalissimo has the corporal arrested and executed; he is representative of leaders who use war solely to make themselves stronger (he invites the German general over to discuss how to start the war again). Before he has him shot, the Generalissimo tries to convince the Corporal that war can never be stopped because it is the essence of humanity.----Obviously several people consider this to be a masterpiece and I certainly don't see that as a ridiculous opinion. I simply couldn't warm to it at all and I assure you that I enjoy difficult but rewarding fiction.I read a blog entry by someone who read all the Pulitzer winners in a five year period. I'm paraphrasing but they described A Fable as the one that almost sunk them.Masterpiece to some but noble failure to me."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"I've read some other novels by Faulkner, and this is the first away from Yoknapatawpha. Personally, I like most of the time difficult reading, with which I can struggle to understand it, even when sometimes (like this) I don't get it at all. I find that is brave in an author, to write whatever his head produces, without caring if the reader is going to get it. I think Faulkner wrote a great part of this novel without caring. The story is captivating in its resemblance to jesus life not quite accurately, but in the exact level to find it believable. And it shows how a single life is important for the rest of us."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"I must agree that, at times, the experience of reading _A Fable_ is much like feeling one's way through a very dark tunnel. However, there is indeed a light at the end of that tunnel; as with many of Faulkner's works, the individual stories that make up the novel dont come together until the last hundred or so pages. It takes a very patient reader to glean the important details from the beginning and middle of the novel, and to remember those details when they emerge again later in the book. One must also be fairly well-acquainted with Christ's passion in order for a true understanding of the correlation to reveal itself (which, in many places, it didn't for me). Contrary to the book's selling-points, Faulkner is not merely retyping the Christ story in _A Fable_. He's updating a myth (or &quot;fable,&quot; if you will), and using his narration to describe humanity's condition in mid-century (cf. many paragraphs w/ 1950 Nobel Prize speech). This is a long, tedious, and fanatically detailled narrative, but a great novel that pays off with a terrific closing 50 pages for the patient reader. Both the new and the acquainted should be prepared for Faulkner at his most brilliant and difficult."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself). Faulkner's attempt may be second only to Hemingway's &quot;A Farwell to Arms.&quot; &quot;A Fable&quot; is classic, which won the pulitzer prize,has long been overlooked simply because it represents a change from Faulkner'susual subject matter. In reality though, it may be his second greatest work behind &quot;the sound and the fury.&quot; THis work is a brillian anti-war novel that looks at wars affects both on soldiers and civilians, and even on religion. A must read for any fan of Faulkner or modernism."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"I am not entirely sure why this book recieved some of the lousy reviews it did. This book is brilliant, it requires more from the reader than passive reading, so if you are looking for a story you don't have to think about look elsewhere. Anyone familiar with post-Great War literature will find this book to be par for the course. Dos Passos's \\"Three Soldiers\\", comes easily to mind. Don't pay attention to the other reviews, this book won awards for a good reason. If you read the book and find yourself frustrated go back and reread sections. Literature is not always meant to be read in a passive state. This book requires active reading and should not be taken lightly. This book does carry a message about the horrors of war, but also our own individual responsibilty in allowing those horrors to go forward."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"At nine o'clock one morning in the spring of 1918, a regiment of the French army - every man below the rank of sergeant - refuses to take part in a futile assault on the German position. Strangely, the German line opposite fails to take advantage of the situation with a counter-attack, and by noon that day no shots are fired along the entire French line. By three o'clock in the afternoon, the entire western front has fallen silent. It emerges that a saintly French corporal, together with his twelve apostles, has been making the rounds of the Allied forces (and apparently the German forces too) spreading by word and deed a gospel of non-violence and universal brotherhood. The troops, it seems, have understood that they can stop the killing simply by laying down their arms. Naturally, this is anathema to the military hierarchies on both sides, who (tipped off by the Judas among the disciples) are already making covert plans to resume hostilities. The generals, after all, have a living to make and a war to run.\\"A Fable\\" is an allegorical novel about the conflicting impulses that exist within each one of us. The French corporal represents man's impulse towards unconditional love and brotherhood; or, to put it another way, he's the \\"champion of an esoteric realm of man's baseless hopes and his infinite capacity - no: passion - for unfact\\". Like Jesus, the corporal holds out the light of selfless love to humanity, but he's doomed to suffer the consequences. For within every man, too, lives the desire to get on in the world, an egotism which produces conflict, wars and armies. This impulse - represented in the novel by supreme Allied general, who is the corporal's father and the author of the quote above - will always conquer in the world of brute facts, will always prevail, but the example that Christ and Faulkner's corporal offer to humanity can never be extinguished. \\"I'm not going to die,\\" says one of the corporal's disciples at the end of the book. \\"Never.\\"\\"A Fable\\" is a difficult, audacious and profound book. If complex meditations on the human condition are your idea of a good time, give this one a try."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"You don't read Faulkner as much as you work your way through Faulkner; at least that's my experience. The sentences are often over a page long, the punctuation is highly arbitrary, the spelling is suspect, the words are frequently archaic or unfamiliar (sometimes almost unheard of), the concepts are convoluted, the stories are never straight-forward, and it is often hard to know who he is even talking about at various points. He makes references to literature, myths, the Bible and other things without attempting to hint what he is talking about. This book is Faulkner at his most obtuse and bizarre, and best!. All of this can be very off-putting, but this is just Faulkner being Faulkner!Why in the world should anyone even read this book? Good question! If you love Faulkner, by all means read it. If you are unfamiliar with Faulkner, give it a shot, but beware! He did win a Pulitzer Prize for the book in 1954, so it is supposed to be good - maybe that's one reason. You're curious about one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, a Nobel Prize winner for literature - that's another good reason.I really like Faulkner. I've read 6 or 7 of his major works over my lifetime and am never failed to be fascinated by him. (My Faulkner favorite is 'A Light in August', which is also one of my all-time favorites of any book by any author.) I have no idea how his mind can generate the kind moods and slants on things that it does, and I actually like not knowing where he is going. I am fascinated by his use of the language, the crackling dialogue, his exquisitely passionate and elongated style, as well as his brilliant dry humor. Although I am NOT in love with his existentialist outlook, I confess it can make for great stories, some of which are very tall stories as well.'A Fable' is about WWI, instead of his usual subject, the Old South. Surprisingly, it takes place in France for the most part instead of Mississippi, although an intriguing flash-back takes place in the South. It is about a heroic individual attempt to bring WWI to end by peaceful means. There is a lot of potent Christian symbolism embedded in the story. (Faulkner, I believe, was very familiar with the Bible even though he probably was not a believer.)Bottom line is that I thought this was a great book, but cannot vouch for its readability. I can only say that, in my opinion, Faulkner being Faulkner is worth the considerable effort if you are willing to go there."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"This is what I would say to people considering purchasing his novel, it is not a short review (nor a short novel!) but I hope it is helpful to some of you. Note, I wrote this review prior to reading other folk's reviews, as not to be biased. Note II, please excuse my poor grahmer and spelling, if I could write as well as I could read well...I've spent the last 5 years studying all of Faulkner's written works, an experience that has been very rewarding personally. For me A Fable was as rewarding a read as any of WCF's other works... but then again I purposely left this novel to the very end of my list of his major novels & short stories and feel that this choice made a big difference in my ability to extract the most from it. I can crank through a \\"regular\\" novel in a day or two and most of WCF's novels in twice that time, but it took me well over a year to \\"read\\" a Fable (I took a few breaks here and there too. A Fable can be read in a week, but not read well), almost a third of the total time I dedicated to studying his oeurve. I believe that comprehension of Faulkner's unique talents increases geometrically with each of his works read, with 3 or 4 novels representing the point along the learning \\"S\\"-shaped curve that is closest to vertical. What to the beginner would seem an incomprehensible and exceedingly challenging read, eventually becomes smooth and extremely rewarding as you get comfortable with WCF's unconventional style and recurring themes. Without having read them, I can guess that the reviews on this page will be mixed or negative... I hope you will consider my experience with this novel as context for these reviews. Had I just happened upon this novel I would not have finished or enjoyed it. It is a rich work but also requires a commitment of time, energy and focus... the plot, time & place, setting, and even narration can change in an instant leading to a tangled and haphazard appearance. There are plenty of WCF fan's that are smarter than I who consider A Fable one of his lesser works, but then again there are other smart folks that place it among his best. It was clearly an important novel for Faulkner personally and I conclude that in the end it was something he looked on with pride.While all of WCF's works are studies of the human heart, like many authors Faulkner's literary efforts vacillated between commercial enterprises aimed at satisfying his ambitions for financial security and and some degree of fame or recognition, and, at the opposite pole novels he wrote purely out of his need to express himself without much, if any expectation of publication. After all he got a taste of the work-a-day life in his role as postmaster at Ole Miss and despite the need to support a small family his decision to pursue a literary career was sealed the day he left the Oxford post office to discover the artistic community in New Orleans, if not then, for sure a few weeks later when he met Sherwood Anderson and was encouraged to pursue writing. I believe that A Fable was not primarily intended as a commercial endeavor. For example, early in his career he poured his heart and soul into the production of Sartoris (an early novel that would take another 4+ years to be hacked up and later hesitantly released as The Unvanquished by his editors, only to be published in it's original format after his death), a novel that was a commercial disaster and what must have felt like a personal repudiation of his talent (sadly, WCF never received the notoriety or [secondarily] financial success that he deserved while alive... in my view he was a man that was sensitive to the views of others, although no so much as to allow others to stifle his creative expression). Out of the period of intense introspection and frustration that followed this professional tragedy, two of his more celebrated novels, The Sound and The Fury & As I Lay Dying were written in only a few months... obviously not written for mass appeal.Before you buy this book, think about this; Many of the author's most complex and celebrated works were completed in months. Faulkner took 10 years to write, re-write and perfect A Fable. Many aspects of its production, and additionally the setting and tone of the novel are outliers. Sure, he took a break now and then to, for example, finish off the Snopes trilogy and spent a lot of time in Hollywood during that decade. But if you look at a timeline of his productive career, it is clear that this novel had tremendous meaning and relevance to him... it was a special project. Everyone should ask themselves what they want out of this novel before getting started. If you are looking for just a entertaining book to get lost in, I think you will be very disappointed and probably will not make it through more than a few \\"chapters.\\" In my opinion, this is a book where each page should be read twice, slowly, and with meticulous attention. Make it easy on yourself and take notes on the characters, narrators, times and places... you will to refer back to them later. Then you should read it again. Taken for what it is, I believe it is one of Faulkner's more touching and meaningful works and one of the most thought provoking novels on the nature of war. I agree with the professional critics that this novel is more dry than many of his other novels (ranging from light, easy reads to very dark novels), such as The Reivers (Faulkner's sense of humor was never a big draw for me, but certain novels like Reivers are a pleasure to breeze through while others are a very dense. Note that the Reivers was published after A Fable), but A Fable has all of the intensity of Absalom, Absalom! (maybe less than Go Down, Moses in my view, but let's just say it is intense). The story of the three-legged race horse is classic Faulkner, and gives you a taste of Yoknapatawpha as well as some lighter reading in an otherwise very foreign setting and dense work. It may also help for readers to understand a bit of Faulkner's personal history before they take this on. War left an indelible mark on his psyche. During the first World War he was not found fit for service with the branch of the US armed forces to which he applied, and joined the Canadian Air Force instead, but never saw combat. I can't help but feel that his development into adulthood during WWI contributed to his desire to tackle this subject. In many, if not the majority of his works, most notably Soldier's Pay, he deals with the subject of war and often with young men's ambition for glory... this novel is no different being set in WWI. In fact, A Fable is rife with themes that run through his other works... themes that and are quickly sniffed out by readers familiar with his works. What makes A Fable special - aside from it's very allegorical/symbolical plot (which may make it one of WCF's most interesting works for literary scholars to dissect, but does not add tremendously in its appeal for me)- is that Faulkner attempts/struggles to distill earlier themes dealing with the human condition to their absolute core then confront his audience with hem... I believe this is a departure from some of his other works in the degree to which he demands his audience to look inward. He crosses a new boundary by challenging our views on courage, human suffering, compassion, the absence of love/compassion, religion, leadership, conflict, social status, and on and on. This is one of the factors that makes the novel great. One weakness, is that some of the characters (especially many military figures) do not feel as real, tangible or human versus those in his other works, although many of them will immediately feel familiar to the reader and pop out of the pages with the same quality of characters in his other works.In summary, I would recommend taking on a few other WCF novels (The Wild Palms is Faulkner's most under-rated novel, and among his most touching works. It is an easy read, and can be read and enjoyed by WCF novices with ease, especially since -much like A Fable- it is not a part of the Yoknapatawpha series) before diving into A Fable. If you chose to go for it, understand that this is a rich, dense and at times confusing novel that most people will not finish... so take the time to soak in all the richness and remember it is natural to feel lost in the plot in your first read, just keep moving forward a let go of the need to feel centered in the plot the first time around. Then you can decide for yourself if it was worth the decade of effort he sunk into its production.*****- CW"},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me. Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with &quot;A Fable&quot; I simply couldn't do it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; and Proust's &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.) I may have a Master's Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say. It's amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get through this thing, much less give it an award. I haven't given up on Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've given up on a book. It took &quot;A Fable&quot; to bring me to my knees."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"For some reason, this book gets slogged off as \\"unreadable\\" and even irrelevant in the Faulkner canon. I don't get it. Faulkner is almost ALWAYS difficult, his novels usually closer to puzzles than straight narratives. Why has this book been singled out as the height of his obtuseness? If anything, it's an even MORE lucid book than some of the agreed upon Faulkner classics. It's also a brilliant, provocative, dense, and haunting meditation on war and religion and duty and ethics and whatever else W.F. could cram into 500 pages. It's not a perfect book - there are perhaps some too-abstract and off-putting sections (particularly the long background summary of the Old General). But this book is mostly filled with some of the greatest writing of this great writer's career. Another thing: this is NOT a \\"re-telling of the Christ story in WWI.\\" To think of the book in such terms would be an absurd oversimplification. Yes, that ancient tale plays a major part in this one, and there are parallels drawn throughout, but the Christ story is only one element of this epic fever-dream. This totally unique novel is more like a supernatural/philosophical detective story than a religious parable. If you love Faulkner for more than just the trappings of his Southern landscapes, you MUST read this book. It goes without saying that anybody interested in simple and fluid prose need not bother with Faulkner in the first place - criticizing Faulkner for being \\"confusing\\" is like accusing Homer for being \\"poetic.\\" I don't care how smart you are: you will be confused by Faulkner. But confusion can be beautiful, and human, and even transform into the best kind of enlightenment."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"A Fable is Faulkner's thinly disguised allegory of Christ's story in the guise of a mutiny on the Western Front in World War One. In this sense the novel mirrors some of Faulkner's short stories about the Great War. His writing about that conflict had a great deal of grounded verisimilitude. But A Fable contains much of extraneous matter, is a difficult and dense read, and comes in very long 437 pages. This is Faulkner doing all of his tricks. The long, long sentence, the page long paragraph, the dense and tedious plot all but submerged in an ocean of language. Faulkner's work is never for everyone. For A Fable this may be doubly true."},{"Title":"A Fable","review":"William Faulkner considers A Fable his masterpiece. It won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1955 (one of only a handful of books to win both in the same year). These accolades, however, have not led to widespread acclaim or longevity for the novel, and for years it was relegated to afterthought status, deemed \\"minor\\" Faulkner, and available only as a cheap, hard to read paperback or as a part of an expensive anthology.As Faulkner is my favorite writer, and as I am, by nature, a completist, I read A Fable (a library copy that was easier to read than the pulp paperback) a few years back, despite the warnings that it was difficult - even impossible -to read, despite the cautions that slogging through it was not worth the effort...and I loved it.Now that Vintage International has re-released it (along with most of Faulkner's other novels) in a beautiful new paperback edition, I decided to reread it, apprehensive that I might have overestimated the novel's strengths, having been 26 when I first read it - but I had not. If anything, I found the novel even more brilliant and illuminating on second reading.This is not your typical Faulkner (as another reviewer pointed out) but it is far from \\"minor\\" Faulkner. This book is, at times, difficult, but what Faulkner isn't? - and who would even consider reading any Faulkner if they didn't want to be challenged? And, when compared to some of his other masterworks (The Sound and the Fury or Absalom, Absalom! for example) it is actually a quick, surprisingly easy read.A Fable has much in common with the aforementioned Absalom, Absalom! in that it focuses more on the human condition and the various aspects of human nature than on character-driven narrative. The characters here, as in Absalom, Absalom! are allegorical representations of diverse facets of humanity, playing out, in their myriad interactions, the eternal struggles we have faced for millennia (the endeavoring for peace in uncertain times, the concepts of forgiveness, and bravery, and heroism, and love, the striving to find meaning and redemption in the world). The lack of traditional characterization in no way undermines A Fable's emotional impact, for we can see, as a result, expressions of ourselves - and our world and history - within these characters.While A Fable essentially tells (allegorically) the story of Christ and his Apostles, culminating in his \\"crucifixion\\" and eventual \\"resurrection\\" in the French trenches of World War I, it is not really a religious novel; it never gets bogged down in religious theology, never seems heavy-handed, never becomes either preachy or blasphemous. So too with its anti-war themes: it makes its case by focusing on war as a curse of mankind (and a product of our species' ongoing internal conflict), not by politicizing it or proselytizing upon it. As a result, A Fable achieves a universality found only in the best works of literature, speaking to that that is good - and not so good - in all of us.The rewards of reading this book cannot be overstated: this is vast, inspired, passionate and virtuosic writing. (Consider the following description: \\"Her face [was] quite empty for the moment but with something incipient and tranquilly promising about it like a clean though not-yet-lighted lamp on the kitchen bureau.\\") A Fable is Faulkner at his best, and that is really saying something. Hopefully, now that Vintage International has brought it out in an edition worthy of its merits, it will continue to receive, on a larger and larger scale, the attention and commendation that is deserves. For A Fable is not just a Faulkner masterpiece; it is a literary masterpiece, a masterpiece of all time."},{"Title":"Delta Force RPG [BOX SET]","review":"This game has fun scenarios to play.

This RPG is easily played without using figures so that keeps the cost down, but if gamers prefer to use figures--who doesn't have some GI Joes laying around?

Pearson explains the Hero and the Heroic Archetypes (Warrior, Wanderer, etc.) in a clear and down-to-earth way. This is the easiest, most straightfoward, introduction I have found to Jungian and archetypal psychology. It presents powerful life-altering ideas in a readily accessible format. This book is an excellent introduction to Jungian thought. It is excellent for anyone who feels &quot;stuck&quot; in life.

The sixties manta, &quot;the family of man on the spaceship earth,&quot; could aptly be used to subtitle this work."},{"Title":"The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live by","review":"\\"The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live By,\\" by Carol S. Pearson, Ph.D., continues to have a significant message for all adults undergoing personal development. This is an excellent, and should be a primary, resource for persons engaged in their own life-journey, for students of archetypal pathways, and for counselors, teachers (of adults), coaches, and guides. This book should in particular be part of the select handful of books that life coaches, success gurus, and other facilitators for adult personal growth reference and recommend on a regular basis.The great value of this book is its combined accessibility and compact, useful presentation of each early archetypal stage. Many current works present various archetypal modes as being more-or-less on a par with each other. Pearson's diagrams of growth from Innocent through Orphan to Wanderer, then through Warrior and Martyr, up to the culminating Magician, show an intuitively logical yet practical pattern. Her discussion of the \\"Magician\\" is perhaps one of the best in the field, and because it is placed as a culminating state towards which these other archetypal modes evolve, it has a special resonance. Later works, positing the \\"Magician\\" amidst other archetypes (e.g., \\"Empress/Queen\\" or \\"Hedonist/Love-Goddess/Courtesan\\"), give the \\"Magician\\" role its due - but miss the significance of reaching the \\"Magician\\" state in a person's overall evolution.Pearson's identification of the strengths and values of the \\"Martyr\\" role help many - particularly women, who are often \\"Martyrs\\" when sacrificing for their families while the children are young - to see the significance of this stage, and to cherish the time spent in the \\"Martyr\\" mode. This stage is not unique to women; many men who work diligently at their jobs and then give abundantly to their children, church, and community also share this \\"Martyr\\" archetype. Through Pearson's attention, we see the nobility of self-sacrifice - and yet are encouraged to go beyond this.The way in which Pearson addresses the \\"Warrior\\" archetype is especially important. She notes the value of this stage for all persons - women as well as men. Nevertheless, she also notes (correctly) that many men become so identified with their \\"Warrior\\" archetype that they become trapped in this stage, and never move beyond. Instead, they regard the \\"Warrior\\" as a culminating stage. It is easy to understand why some people - especially men - can become \\"hooked\\" on this stage. The clarity of ego-definition, the feeling of inclusion within an elite group (the \\"brotherhood of war\\"), the adrenaline rush, and even the rewards themselves - all of these contribute to a mistaken assumption that the \\"Warrior\\" is a desirable end-state rather than a transition mode. This is evident in books such as Moore and Gillette's \\"King, Warrior, Magician, Lover.\\" Further, the \\"Warrior\\" mode (and the means by which a young man becomes a successful warrior) is the essential story of many of our heroic myths. (Campbell's \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\\" certainly comes to mind.)Nevertheless, as Pearson so succinctly points out, the \\"Warrior\\" is not an end-state. It is valuable - sometimes essential - but not a culminating life-experience, and if someone persists too long in that state, that person stultifies his or her own growth.Pearson beautifully illustrates her points with characters and vignettes drawn from literature. This gives the reader a much richer and more vibrant context for understanding various archetypes, dynamics, and progressions/evolutions. While the vignettes that she presents are complete enough for the reader to fully encompass a character's relevance, someone who has read the novel or play in its entirety will gain a much deeper appreciation. Those who keep her points in mind and read a book (e.g., \\"The Color Purple\\") for the first time will appreciate the book's message in a much deeper and more multi-faceted manner.In sum, this book is well-thought-out, well-written, and is easy enough to read - given the complexity and substance of its subject matter. It presents a valuable and useful framework for understanding a person's emergence into his or her adult life-journey. While Pearson has written many other works since this was originally published in 1986, it is still fresh, vibrant, and holds its own essential place in the realm of many works on archetypes today. I highly recommend this not only to individuals engaged in their life-journey, but also to their coaches, mentors, and guides - as a valuable road map which they can share with those whom they are coaching."},{"Title":"The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live by","review":"I had to read this book for a class, otherwise I likely would never had chosen it.

The theory upon which it is based is so poetically woven together that it goes down much more easily than it has any theoretical right to do. Given its strong and convincing introduction, one can easily imagine it to be a cut above others fashioned from the same Jungian mold, but which have since been disparagingly referred to as \\"pop psychology.\\" And here I refer specifically to Helen Palmer's \\"Enneagram\\" and Otto Kroeger's \\"Myers-Briggs Type Indicator\\" among a handful of others. As is the present one, they all used psychological typologies based loosely on Jungian theory of universal archetypes. The question is: is this one any different or better than the others?I took great pains to read this book carefully as readers may note that I have also reviewed books on heroism by Otto Rank, Joseph Campbell and Bruno Bettelhiem (and have read, but have not yet reviewed, books on this topic by Rene Dubois, Thomas Bulfinch, Robert Bly, Dixon Wecter, and Joseph R. Novello, who was once my tennis partner at the Regency health club in McLean, Va. where we discussed these very issues at length.) The point being that all discussions of cultural heroism, must be taken seriously, for they go to the core of what the national drama is all about:To wit, cultures are nothing if not sanctioned stories and narratives about their own self-constructed, self-reported and self-validated heroes and the respective images and exploits of those heroes. The abiding fear of course with any psychological theory is that it will simply reduce to an alternative way of explaining, reifying and reinforcing (but shedding no light on) existing cultural norms, ideas and rules, which more often than not (even in so-called \\"free societies\\") are at the very least disrespectful of individual freedoms, pursuit of self-awareness and self-development, if often not down right oppressive towards them. As a result one has to be careful when spinning theories about heroic archetypes. I do not believe this author has been careful at doing so.Although I believe this author's theory has merit, her justification for why it is a \\"conscious theory\\" rather than \\"just another theory dealing with the unconscious\\" was unconvincing to the point of raising red flags. Her claim is that our culture is so enlightened that there is no need to continue plumbing the unconscious as a modality of self-discovery? (Really, now?) That is indeed a curious stance even if it were true, and I don't for a moment believe that it is true in the least. And although this is far from a minor theoretical side issue, I nevertheless gave the author a pass on it, the benefit of the doubt and her just due:And here she gives us six archetypes, or models of heroism gleaned from Jungian developmental psychology. These are put forth as new more enlightened ways of seeing and entering the world, which we might adopt for our own journey towards self-discovery and self-development. Each is represented and delineated along the lines of the metaphor of a journey along life's path in which an individual is seen to go through various phases and stages as he matures and develops.It begins with the complete trust of the INNOCENT, moves on to the longing for safety of the ORPHAN, the self-sacrifice of the MARTYR, the exploring of the WANDERER, the competition and triumph of the WARRIOR, and then ends with the authenticity and wholeness of the MAGICIAN. These archetypes are seen as paradigmatic guides to help us understand why we choose the world we live in. Implicit in this paradigm and journey is that the individual is mature enough to take full responsibility for his own existence (and lives in a society where he is allowed to do so), arguably both questionable assumptions at best, at least up to all but the very last stage of development.The goal of course is to follow this progression through each stage until sufficient self-mastery (through increased self-discovery and self-awareness) is achieved. Each stage thus must be completed before the next one is attempted. And only the successful completion of one stage makes possible movement on to the next. And although the progression is not necessarily linear, the results are always cumulative. And although people of different races and genders and cultural experiences are likely to experience the stages in different orders with different impacts, whatever may be their backgrounds, embedded in each stage is a developmental task that must be mastered: In short, one does not get to be a hero without paying the price of ascending the ladder of self-discovery, self-awareness and self-development. As you grow and change you get to add themes that will further deepen your awareness and make your life richer and fuller. Each individual has, and may bring, his own truths to his journey, and thus may shape and define his own image of heroism (and presumably also change the society?).But the external world, in this author's formulation is a \\"neutral\\" black-box. It is seen as passively reflecting and reinforcing our beliefs about it and about ourselves. [It seems to me that in order to have a viable theory with any real psychological import, we need to know a great deal more about the passive black-box called culture and society? How can the two (our hero and society) be so casually and arbitrarily disconnected? And how can society not be seen as the primary actor that it is?]When the world (meaning our culture) does not reflect our desires and aims, we can see only as far as the existing cultural scripts allow us. According to the author, it is at this point that the developmental awareness of the hero kicks in. It is the hero within us that provides the motive force to break out of the stereotypical role, \\"place\\" or \\"strait-jacket of conformity\\" that society has prepared for us to assume. It is only our heroism that proves that society's control over our being is not total -- that is, unless we lack the courage to resist its control and as a result allow it to be maintained. It is thus one thing to muster the courage to take full responsibility for our lives and quite another to submit to being \\"socially adjusted\\" into a conformist role reserved for us for the rest of our lives. T.S. Eliot has framed our hero's dilemma perfectly in a poem called the \\"The Confidential Clerk,\\" in which one character says to another: \\"If you lack the courage to impose your terms on life, then you must accept the terms it offers you.\\"Yet, according to this author's formulation, both the subconscious and the society in which we operate (our world) are treated as if they are twin black-boxes. [Why?] This is especially debilitating today, as we are learning that much of Freud's map of the subconscious conforms to what the physical scientists are finding out about the mind. And especially when individuals, even in \\"so called free societies\\" are discovering that individual awareness, vigilance and action are needed on a constant basis just to function as normal every citizens -- not to mention as societal heroes. The author's heroic level of awareness today is a minimum requirement just to keep our freedoms intact. Self-awareness and self-discovery in so-called \\"free societies\\" are no longer to be taken for granted as perhaps they were in 1989 when this book went to print. They are no longer just discretionary activities reserved only for cultural heroes, but are an imperative of our everyday existence for every freedom-loving citizen: an imperative against, plutocrats, terrorists, lobbyists, militarists, racists, neo-Fascists, anti-Semites, anarchists, and other anti-democratic forces. Otherwise, with or without heroes, we end up with the likes of GW Bush and Sarah Palin, the \\"Tea Party,\\" Wall Street Casino Capitalists, the Vampire Lobbyists, etc. calling the shots and writing the scripts for the cultural drama and defining who and what our heroes are.The truth is exactly as the author notes that many of our socialization patterns are based on limiting stereotypes. She argues that stereotypes assigned to us by society are \\"domesticated and safe versions of her archetypes\\" and that by bringing the archetypes out into the open we discover the real source of their power. According to her, it is the archetype behind the stereotypes that is full of life and power and that the real power to the individual is his being able to bring the archetypes behind the stereotype out into the light of day, making the meanings that govern our lives explicit. When we fail to name them we remain hostages to them and can do nothing else but live out their plots. [Boy, what's in a name?]According to this formulation, society itself is just a backboard against which we bounce our heads like basketballs. As far as anyone can tell this backboard can either be brittle, malleable, or it can be impenetrable, no one really knows? It remains a passive actor in this formulation. Yet it is the most important hidden variable in the theory. [Speaking of bringing things out in the open?]According to this theory, the hero never knows what he is up against. Yet society is not nearly as inscrutable as this. It plays a dominant role in defining, not just the roles of stereotypes for the individuals, but also in writing the scripts for the entire societal drama. [Look at the horrible movie Avatar for instance, so far the highest grossing film ever?] To ignore the role that culture plays in writing the script is to render the role of hero to that of an unwitting functionary of the state.As we have seen, heroes too can be defined as the \\"unwanted\\" of society. And the ones who step out of line like JFK, RFK, Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, did are summarily shot, even in our so called \\"free society.\\" It is true that they are all martyrs and thus posthumously made heroes of our free society. But is that really the kind of hero the theory had in mind?Five stars"},{"Title":"The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live by","review":"An easy way to understand archetypes and how they play out in your life.Tom Youngholm , author of The Celesital Bar and In the Shadow of the Sphere"},{"Title":"The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live by","review":"Excellent book quality - like brand new and was delivered speedily.

But this is certainly some of Harrison's best poetry in years. A few years ago, Harrison gave a reading at Michigan State University (his alma mater, but he's not that fond of the place) and mentioned to an interviewer beforehand that he considers himself an &quot;unreconstructed Buddhist.&quot; Perhaps something of the same could be said for Ikkyu, the 15th century Zen priest and poet, who was somewhat unconventional himself. That Harrison should identify with and base these poems on Ikkyu's unconventional style seems, to this reviewer, natural. These poems are small wonders, seemingly effortless in the way that they work on the reader--tho I imagine Harrison would not say that these were effortless to write. Life, death, the moon, the stripper in some bar out west, the friends (two and four-legged), riding a horse, watching the moon... Too many years gone, and not many left. That's a recurring theme. But also another: living means learning lessons, every day. Shut up and listen. An old Zen instruction, but it comes across here as fresh as Ikkyu's work must have been 4 centuries ago. In short - a pretty damn good collection of poems, from a writer whose poetry should be appreciated more."},{"Title":"The Last Year of the German Army May 1944-May 1945 (Last year of the Luftwaffe/Kreigsmarine)","review":"If you are looking for 1st hand accounts of the battles fought by the Wehrmacht between May1944-May1945 this is not the best book for that purpose. This book deals mainly with the German efforts to stave off defeat by numericaly superior foes through technology. There are chapters dealing with the East Front, the Western Front, Party Militias (the post war Wehrwolf movement is described here), Opposition to Hitler, Military Organization and most of all Weapons and Devices. I am sure many would argue the point but the fact is almost any weapon in the inventory of today's modern military can be traced to Germany in one way or another...they either invented it or refined it into a lethal weapon of war. In this book you will find alot of information about the German efforts to develop weapons that could change the course of events that the German military found themselves in during the last year of the war, some had been in research and development for a long time, others were products of desperation. For example, an anti-aircraft wind gun designed to flip a bomber over with a plug of compressed air, a sound gun which consisted of two large parabolic projector discs designed to kill through amplified sound, the V-3 cannon/rocket launcher which would hit London with a rain of high explosives (Iraq tried to copy this weapon in the late 80's). These may sound like fantasy but they were real and this book contains the pictures and documentation to prove it! On a more convetional note there are sections and photos which deal with the development of aurguably the worlds 1st assault rifle the Sturmgewehr 44, the gun todays M-60 is based on the MG-34/42, even the curved barrel &quot;shot around the corner&quot; urban sturmgewehr with a mirror on the tip of the barrel that has become some what of an urban legend(it's real)is here. A portable one man 88mm anti tank weapon called the Puppchen is explained and shown in a photo. Several heavy mortar weapons (you have to see the pictures to apppreciate the size) are explained, several of these mortars were used on the Eastern Front in Warsaw and Sevestapol of note. Although the V2 rocket is associated with the Luftwaffe it fell under the command of the Artillery General and those who launched it were Wehrmacht gunners, it is described and photographed here. Armoured vehicles are examined in depth, from light recon, flak/anti-aircraft, assualt guns, anti-tank (Jagdpanther and Tiger), self propelled artillery, rocket launcher(Panzerwerfer), mine clearing (Minenraumpanzer),armoured personel carrier to heavy battle tanks like the King Tiger(Koingtiger) and up to the Super Heavy Battle Tank Maus (more like a land battleship which never saw combat)are on display in this book, the Maus photos are hard to believe when you compare the U.S. soldiers next to it for scale. There are some neat stories about the exploits of Sturmbannfurhers Otto Skorzeny, Jochen Peiper, and especially about the German efforts to battle partisans on all fronts, but the strength of this book is it's illumination of German technologic efforts to tilt the scales, there is no mention of german efforts to build an A-bomb. A great book with alot of great photos. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Year of the German Army May 1944-May 1945 (Last year of the Luftwaffe/Kreigsmarine)","review":"This is the second book of James Lucas I have read, and I have no plans to read any more of his books. The other book of his I read was \\"Das Reich\\" and it also received low ratings. This book is no improvement.While the title would have you believe it deals with the last year of WWII, it's really only an excuse to cover a wide range of topics in poor detail. There is some good info in this book but it is buried under lots of fluff. That's why this review gets 2 stars instead of one.There is another side of Lucas' writing and that deals with his attitude toward the Nazis. He is definitely pro Nazi, and this issue has been raised in other reviews of his books. I would describe him as a Wehrmacht Wannabee, where his main concern is the honor and duty in the German Army. You read how the wonderful German army never collapsed and always maintained high discipline and ahem, its honor. Seriously, by '44 the German army was backed in a corner where it couldn't stop fighting and its honor was long buried on the Russian Steppes during the previous 3 years.This type of writing and slant might suit you, but for me, I'm sick and tired of this dribble."},{"Title":"Black Cowboy, Wild Horses","review":"This book is based on a true story about Bob Lemmons, a African American Cowboy.

The story involves an ex-slave enslaving wild horses while wishing he himself could leave this life and let his horse ride free into the distant horizon. In the midst of the book we are introduced to a lively wild colt only to have this colt immmediatly bit by a snake and die. It is this tragity that unsettles the herd of horses so that the mounted cowboy can take over as alpha horse and lead them to a waiting corral to be broken by the cheering white cowboys to whom he never speaks.On the plus side the illustration's muddly watercolors are pleasing to the eye."},{"Title":"Black Cowboy, Wild Horses","review":"My 6 year old son almost was in tears when we had to return this to the library, so I decided to buy it.

Although not the most scintillating read I have ever perused, it provides a thorough, workmanlike walk-through of every issue needed to consider to provide client-centered services using the unbundled model. If you are undecided about expanding your practice to include unbundling, this book is very helpful in making that decision by discussing the drawbacks as well as the advantages. If you have already done it and want practical tips on a more systematic approach, this book is also very helpful.I think it is a tad expensive for the amount of content. (...) The verdict? Useful to its specialized audience, but overpriced."},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"I checked my mailbox one day and I received a package from the Fatima Center. I started receiving materials from them ever since I ordered a documentary from them a year ago called, Heaven's Key to Peace. I wondered why the package was thicker than usual this time around. When I opened it, I discovered a new book, this book. The title immediately grabbed my attention: EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong. \\"Hold the phone, I love EWTN\\", I thought to myself. What sort of propaganda is this? I had my doubts and debated on whether I should read it. I even wrote Dr. Robert Sungenis, an apologist and Scripture scholar I trust, and his response is attached below. After five sittings, I finished it.I will not go into detail because I would desire all who read this article to pick up this book for yourselves and read it. I could describe it in depth but it would only make the skeptics more skeptical. It outlines and documents all of its resources and quotations as Mr. Ferrera is making his case, and what a case it is!Recently, I read the Syllabus Condemning the Errors of the Modernists, Lamentabilii Sane (1907). I think I must have highlighted no less than 26 out of the 65 doctrines it condemns, as some teaching I have heard taught in some place or other, be it in the pulpit or in a textbook. This is shocking enough as it is. But, the question remains, if the local \\"teachers\\" of the faith don't have it exactly right, then who does?Those who have been \\"faithfully\\" keeping up with my blogs for the last few years will know, if possible, when a question arises for me or from me, I leave no stone un-turned. And this book is an instrument, I think, for God's illumination of the Catholic mind. Whether we like it or not, admit it or not, sometimes we compromise. We may even willingly and consciously choose the lesser of two evils, as opposed to rejecting all evils outright, and embracing the good.In Ferrera's 19 chapters, he outlines what he sees wrong with the presentation of EWTN, as it supposedly presents to us the fullness of the orthodox Catholic faith. He has to add, as I would, first of all, a disclaimer, that not all if EWTN's programming is \\"heretical\\". Lot's of it is good, in fact. But, as Ferrera defines in chapter 5, this is the core of what the Modernist heresy is all about. That is, a presentation of novelty, heterodox doctrines unheard of to the sum of 2000 years of Catholic Tradition, is mixed in with \\"solid\\" orthodox Catholic doctrine. In other words, the good and the bad are presented together as truth. In this case, an honest, and perhaps ill educated Catholic novice may approach this \\"teacher\\" and under the assumption that the resource is \\"sound\\" and \\"orthodox\\" will accept all messages with little discretion. And voila, we have the Modernist heresy. This is the very thing Fr. Shannon Collins, who had a show on EWTN, Does the Church Still Teach That?, mentioned on his program: \\"The Devil would be happy to give you 99% of truth, so that he can slip in that 1% of lies.\\" This is the very criticism I had for Cardinal Mahoney's Religious Education Congress. Though I will admit, perhaps even a majority of his speakers were okay, but throw in a couple of bad eggs, and the faithful are blind sheep left to the slaughter. Why ever support such a mixed bag?EWTN promotes the \\"destruction of liturgy\\", Ferrera points out. When Mother Angelica was at the helm of her ship, they managed to televise one Catholic Tridentine Mass. That was short lived. Now we have this hybrid Mass where the faithful no longer kneel for the reception of Communion as they did for a while on EWTN. It defended the pagan tainted Pontifical Mass that PJPII celebrated when he visited Mexico where his guests took a bowl with smoke escaping from it as the women took some leaves and placed it in the smoke and later shaking the leaves all around the pope's body and on his arm. This was explained to be a \\"once\\" PAGAN ritual of EXORCISM!!! The list goes on.All I have left to say is that this book is well researched and well documented. To prove the claims of this book, which is filled with quotations from \\"advice\\" from supposedly \\"orthodox\\" Catholic-defenders like Fr. Groeschel, Fr. Serpa, Fr. Levis, et al. giving commentary which I would think a non-Catholic would give, we can always follow the links in the footnotes and listen or read to the source materials ourselves. As vigilant as I know my fellow Catholic-listers and Catholic-bloggers to be, I know this book is a presentation which I think most of us thought in the backs of our mind over the years, but never wanted to admit or articulate... perhaps because we see EWTN and Catholic Answers as our \\"best bet\\" and \\"highest hope\\". I think it still has a lot of good to offer, but I wonder if they are compromising with the world too much. Sometimes I was not sure about what I heard or watched. Before, I usually turned a blind eye when I viewed the disturbing content of some programming.I highly recommend this book, even for the traditional-skeptic who loves EWTN. The Catholic faith must always supercede any celebrity we ascribe to the big names as Scott Hahn et. Al. I think that is what Mr. Ferrera is trying to preserve. And, in my opinion, he succeeds. Although, since none of us are the pope, we are all fallible. Thus, I do not agree with all of Mr. Ferrera's beliefs. But as far as the main focus of the book, I think he triumphs.My personal philosophy, let's just keep it real. Real Catholicism needs no confetti and silly string. It needs no bells and whistles and fireworks. The pure and simple faith was good enough for the early Christians to die for, why is it not good enough for us? Again, the Church never has, should not, and cannot ever lower itself down to the level of the penitent. We must rise above the filth of our own sinfulness, and the darkness of this world, and meet Christ and His Church where they stand, and contemplate the Truth for what it's worth- and where it stands. The Saints all held this uncompromising position, and if we are truly \\"saints in training\\", then we should to.By the Grace of Almighty God, the Church will be restored...God Bless,Laurence"},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"Who knows what to make of the EWTN-phenomenon as an historical cultural artifact ultimately. Super traditionalists think one thing, and liberals think another. What is the \\"objective\\" observer to make of it all? I dare not say, for I am hardly ultimately objective on the matter. But I will tell you this. That the best summary of the contradictions of the phenomenon may have been uttered by Msgr. Stuart Swetland on the program \\"Catholcism on Campus\\". In discussing some topic he announced one of the best, and funniest religious malapropsims ever: \\"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, what lies in wait for us..\\" Indeed, God is lying in wait for you.

Even though I am a great fan of EWTN. I only watch certain programs, such as when they have programs on any of the saints and history of the Church.After reading this book, I truly believe Mother Angelica was forced off of the EWTN network, because of her belief that the Pope has not Consecrated Russia to the Virgin Mary's Immaculate Heart. Yes, the Pope has consecrated the world but he needs to actually say the word \\"Russia\\" in order for Jesus and Mary's requests to be fullfulled.In the year of 1917, 70,000 people of Portugal witnessed the Miracle of the Sun. The message that was bought to the people of Porturgal is that Russia would spread it's errors throughout the world. God has chosen the country Russia as a chasetisment for sins. War is a punushment for sin. If the Pope, along with the Bishops, Priests etc. do not consecrate Russia to the Virgin Mary's Immaculate heart, there is going to be a great chastisement from God."},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"For years, EWTN strengthened my with some wonderful programs. It still airs some of them, too. Unfortunately, it's sometimes best to ignore the good programs because they can help us be too trusting. Mr. Ferrara has convinced me that although many love EWTN, everyone should boycott it.Many of Mr. Ferrara's statements may be hard to believe. But now that I've checked some sources he cites in the book, a book I've read three times, I hope and pray EWTN will abandon novelty and neo-Catholicism for Traditional Catholicism that Catholics had practiced before Vatican II. Buy the book, prepare for a shock, read the book, pray for EWTN, its staff, and its viewers, because EWTN is truly a network gone wrong."},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"This book explains good. Now, I understand that mother angelinca is somewhat evil and has two faces since the smoke of Satan broke in Vatican in 1960.

The programs he objects to existed when Mother Angelica ran the network. On The Rock, The Journey Home, Web Of Faith and many others. Christopher Ferrara is one of those conspiracy fanatics that devote their life to hate. They are great at telling you who they hate, what they hate and I surmize that all their relationships are based on shared hate. They are looking for a Super Hero they hate the Pope and wish Spider Man or Popeye etc would come and save them. In-short they are all the same, foppish little men who I suspect are angry at something beyond EWTN, The Catholic Church, Vatican II Pope JPII and lets not forget THE LATIN MASS etc. They use \\"The Church\\" and anything connected with her as a scapegoat for there own psychological deformities. It is also glaringly obvious that Mr. Ferrara does not, and never watched EWTN. The book is filled with errors and down right lies. EWTN has some very fine programming. I have seen a lot of very great music Bach, Beethoven, Cherubini Mass, Mozart, Great Music from the Vatican. Christ in The City with Father George Rutler (who is a real writer unlike Ferrara) The Church Through The Ages with Father Connor who is perhaps one of the greatest Church Historians. I believe this book was written for an agenda. To use Mother Angelica's name to sell his book and promote some conspiracy theory. What I really object to is the arrogance of this person, and his tone about certain Priest on EWTN. I am very glad that there are Priest on Television and the majority of Priest I have encountered are truly great, intelligent, and humble.Mr. Ferrara needs to grow up, or buy a BIG CAR."},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"Don't waste your money.

The CCC has all the answers to your questions. Yes, there are many people who claim to be Catholic but you can use the CCC which has all the social and other teachings of the church laid out in easy to read fashion About 70% of the book is scripture which helps put the Bible in context.

Within a few pages, you will quickly discern the prejudicial perspective of the author: the Society of St Pius X. Google it if you're not familiar -- but here's a hint . . . do you remember when Mel Gibson's father was recorded ranting about the apocalypse and the nefarious 'Judaizing' of the Catholic church? THat's SSPX, a conspiratorial like society whose obsession with recreating some idealized 'lost' Catholicism borders on cultism.It gets one star at least for the amusing level of hysteria contained herein. It's like H. P. Lovecraft intermingled with the Tridentine mass.And this is the kind of product they produce. Libelous, accusatory tracts about how corrupt Benedict XVI and his minions are . . . how there're unrevealed components to the Third fatima secret . . . how demonic echelons have penetrated the Vatican . . . etc, etc. Hilarious, if only you have a Dan Brown bent of mind. These people promote a kind of hostile interpretation of Rome that outdoes anything found in 'The Da Vinci Code'.But let's talk about the media for a moment, since the author feels EWTN represents such a villainous viewpoint. A key member associated with Ferrara, one 'Fr' Nicholas Gruner, appears on the radio programme 'Coast To Coast' -- a talk show habitually preoccupied with UFOs, alien abductions, occultic practices, witchcraft -- you name a form of New Age spellbinding, and they're into it. For such individuals to launch a critique against EWTN is cheeky in the extreme. I'll take Fr Corapi's lectures on the catechism, a highlight on EWTN, over Ferrara/Gunner's clairvoyant interpretations of the BVM any day.Thankfully, this book has gone out of print. Therefore you can spend your money on something worthwhile: Arroyo's insightful biography of M. Angelica and the formation of EWTN.

I live near one of the centers of the Chrismatic Movement,and personally know many of the celebrities of EWTN, on a personal basis.The author gives only the truth about them, and not his personal opinion.There are people in the Catholic Church that make the choice to remain uninformed and to accept all the \\"touchy-feely\\" changes that have come down the pike since Vatican II; they are living in a delusional, manmade religiousity, not living as a true Roman Catholic.The fact is that since Mother Angelica was forced to resign, the network is a manmade-version, pedaling a false understanding of Catholic Doctrine."},{"Title":"EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong","review":"Mr. Ferrara's book is well-written, well-researched, and well-documented, showing a deep, incisive, meticulous attention to research, a strong ability to follow trails of evidence, and the unfortunate, unhappy conclusions which could not be avoided.

By reading Halls other works, one will gather he has a solid understanding of human psychology. But this book does not venture too far into the psychological world, and for the most part remains an astrology book more than a psychology book. The book is laid out typically, with each sign getting its own chapter, and in groups according to their class (i.e. cardinal, fixed, common). I feel that the descriptions for each zodiac is not too far from what you would find in other well written (and understood) astrology books. This book is concise and to the point and makes no claims of right/wrong, better/worse. The use of this book is more for those who are practicing nativities and the like and who are, perhaps, looking for an alternate means of assimilating information. The zodiacal descriptions are all based on the Sun sign which must be considered when making an accurate reading of a horoscope. While the information in the book is probably just as accurate as most other authorities, I would not say this book is a neccessity."},{"Title":"The Last Days of the Sioux Nation.","review":"Although it has been many years since I read this book, I have continued to reference it. The books relating to Wounded Knee that have come along since LAST DAYS was published in the 1960s don't measure up in terms of dispassionate and balanced analysis, nor in exploring the sources to the extent that Mr. Utley does. In fact, this book could be used in Historiography classes as an examples of how to write objective history and shown to students in all fields of history as a stellar example of such.Utley explores the underlying causes that gave rise to the Ghose Dance religion, from the Dawes Act to the actions of an immoral Congress that reneged on food allotments for the Lakota and then turned an indifferent eye to their plight. He examines the military build up at Pine Ridge and the Lakota response, detailing especially the Seventh Cavalry which I found most useful. All of this culminates with the tragedy at Wounded Knee. It is especially noteworthy that he then includes an entire chapter on the Drexel Mission battle that happened the day after Wounded Knee and is generally overlooked in other treatments of the Pine Ridge campaign. The early 1891 death of Lt. Casey is also covered.

Having trained and been experienced as a fully qualified librarian and armed with her mother's eternal faith and support, Abigail knew she would persevere in the lowly position given to her of \`cataloguing acquisitions' in the British Museum. Here she would stumble upon the journals of a noted scholar that would compel her to leave England and venture forth to the remote city of Timbuktu in order to complete said scholar's quest in locating the Great Library of Alexandria.Along the way, her path crossed that of the arrogant and insufferable \`Son of Satan' (SOS) Apollo Smith. Handsome in a swarthy pirate kind of way, complete with eye-patch, he was not her idea of hero material, although his somewhat tender care of her seasickness on the ocean crossing did garner him some points. Once she was well enough to notice - he certainly inspired and aroused some very annoying and unladylike feelings. As her un-appointed but necessary guide they battled the Sahara desert, nomad tribesmen, and some merciless French Foreign Legionnaires in their quest for the hidden treasures of the fabled Great Library of Alexandria, and discover an ancient scroll that would change their lives - The Book of Seven Delights.*** This was an exciting romance filled with a suspenseful adventure as the protagonists battled one another as well as the dangers found in the Sahara desert. Initially bound to each other out of necessity, both Abigail and Apollo soon came to discover that some of the traits that infuriated them the most were those in the end they came to admire and embrace as they fell in love with each other. Krahn does an admirable job of inserting enough detail to keep the pace briskly moving from one harrowing escape to another as the two managed to keep one step ahead of the dangers that dogged their every move. In Abigail, the author has created a character with credible issues and feelings that the reader can relate to and Apollo was well drawn out as well, though I would have liked to discover what the inheritance was that his Uncle was willing to murder for. Otherwise, for those looking for a marvelous adventure set in the exotic locales of Casablanca and Timbuktu then this is the ticket. --- Marilyn, for www.historicromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"The Book of the Seven Delights (Jove Historical Romance)","review":"Think The Mummy.

This book is the first in her Library of Alexandria/High Victorian Romantic Adventures duology. (THE BOOK OF TRUE DESIRES is the second and it won the RITA in 2007.) I can see why.In this first one, set in the late 19th century, we meet librarian Abigail Merchant (\\"Educated, opinionated, respectable, headstrong and too caught up in her high-minded pursuits to recognize, much less respond to the lust she inspired\\"), who is traveling to Marrakech to find what she believes will be some lost volumes from the famed Library of Alexandria. On her way, she encounters Apollo Smith, who due to treachery, was forced to serve 5 years in the French Foreign Legion and, having escaped, has returned for some mysterious \\"family matter.\\" He agrees to help Abigail reach her goal for half the prize she uncovers.Krahn does a superb job of bringing the Moroccan desert to life, the Berber tribes, the Legionnaires, and the hazards of travel at the end of the 19th century in such parts of the world. Very cleverly she has also helped us experience the mind of a librarian, who catalogs everything she thinks of under various numbered library categories. Then there is Apollo.

I loved the hard hitting hero but the female character was dreary and not very smart, he deserved better."},{"Title":"The Book of the Seven Delights (Jove Historical Romance)","review":"After being relegated to the basement of the British Museum, Abigail Merchant is determined to prove she is worth more than being an employee whose presence is merely on sufferance. Finding a clue to a treasure, she sets off to find a lost library of hte ancient world. Her quest begins on rocky footing, as Abigail is promptly seasick. The only one willing to tend her in her distress is the most annoying and handsome Apollo Smith. He assumes the role of protector/ thorn in her side across exotic locales, barely a step ahead of danger. Mutual hate turns to lust and something deeper as they journey, and Abigail learns that the true treasure is love.*** If Indiana Jones landed in a Regency Romance, then this would be the result. Fast paced adventure will sweep you along until the dramatic end. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"The Book of the Seven Delights (Jove Historical Romance)","review":"This romance is an historical - which is a genre I usually deplore. It's Victorian, though, so it's palatable, I suppose.The heroine IS Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) from the hit movie, the Mummy.The hero? Well, hmm. A bit more than Brendan Fraser's character, but then again, a pretty close call.The big difference is that the treasure not in Egypt, and that there's a nice little feminist twist to this book.I enjoyed the story, both the main plot, and the characters getting to know you sessions.I almost put the book down because the Heroine was such an annoying pest in the beginning - but she got better.

The Wood and Nisbet edition in the &quot;Cambridge Texts in the History of Social Though&quot; is noticeably superior to the Knox edition. The Cambridge edition is a somewhat more accurate and readable translation, is much better organized, and has an excellent introduction by Wood; all the Knox edition has going for it is a nicer cover."},{"Title":"Hegel's Philosophy of right","review":"This is an excellent 1967 translation of the classic 1821 book written by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The book is unabridged and offers the reader a view into the monumental system developed by Hegel in the 19th Century.Although the &quot;continental philosophy&quot; of Hegel is now out of fashion in scholastic/philosophical circles in the United States, (abandoned, in large part, for the &quot;analytic philosophy&quot; of Rudolf Carnap), this book offers the reader a chance to see Hegel applying his most important concept--the dialectics--to law, rights, morality, the family, economic life and the state.Universal right is defined as the synthesis of the conflict and struggle between the thesis of a person acting in accordance with the law and the (sometimes) antithesis of the person's desire to act in accordance with thier own convictions. The State is must mold itself to allow individuals to satisfy the demands of both, in order to bring about harmony and prosperity in human society--the perfect synthesis."},{"Title":"Hegel's Philosophy of right","review":"This version looks like a pdf scanned by someone who doesn't know how to operate a photocopier.

But they all add to the fascination of reading the book.Unfortunatelly Knox's translation does make it very difficult to comprehend some crucial passages, especially where Hegel's deals with the concept of Right in refined speculative terms.

Robbins appeared to have had a better editor this time around, but more than that, the tone is more even and the narrative more coherent than before.I've always appreciated the fact that Robbins didn't \\"dumb down\\" or spell everything out. The reader is asked to fill in a missing blank now and then. The plot of THE DREAM MERCHANTS is quite complicated, but with complexity comes variety and action, and Robbins was a master at keeping things moving.THE DREAM MERCHANTS deals with the early Hollywood moguls, the deals they negotiated, the swindles they perpetrated. It treats of movie stars and directors, technicians and PR spokespeople only insofar as they relate directly to the moguls. There is a fairly long subplot involving a spider woman of an actress with whom the protagonist, Johnny Edge, becomes involved. Aside from that, the plot revolves mostly around the Hollywood bigwigs' business deals. But having already read quite a bit about the making of movies from the technical end, I was interested in glimpsing Hollywood from a different perspective this time around.Bubba"},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"In 1949, Harold Robbins followed up his first novel, Never Love a Stranger, with what would prove to be the first of a loose trilogy he would write on the history of the American film industry. The Dream Merchants covers the pioneer days of the motion picture, depicting the rise of a primarily Jewish owned and operated Independent company that would take on the WASP led motion picture patents combine and rise to become one of the major studios of the 1920's and 30's. Though the studio is called Magnum and headed by Peter Kessler and Johnny Edge, Robbins draws upon the history of Universal Pictures (where he was an executive in the 1940's) and its founder Carl Laemmle and his successor and long time associate Robert Cochrane.The book is structured between short passages set in 1938 narrated in the first person by Johnny Edge, who has just become the new President of Magnum, but must already contend with a board room power struggle as well as the news that his old friend Peter has suffered a massive stroke, and longer sections flashing back over various time points between 1908 and 1938 depicting the rise of Magnum Studio and the ups and downs of the friendship between Johnny and the members of the Kessler family. In these flashbacks, Johnny and the Kesslers work hard to raise what started out as a simple nickoledon business and transform their venture into a major producer and distributor of movies throughout the world. Over the 30 years, Kessler's children grow up, one of whom, Doris, falls in love with Johnny, and Mark, who becomes a spoiled adult child of Hollywood . A section of the book is also devoted to Johnny's experiences as a soldier in World War I where he suffers an injury that will change his life forever. There also a heaping slice of steamy melodrama in which Johnny becomes involved with an ambitious actress who unbeknownst to him is incestuously involved with a family member, a character that has more than a passing resemblance to \\"the Great Profile\\" of American theater and film, John Barrymore.The Dream Merchants is especially strong in evoking a sense of family and friendship that exists between Johnny, the Kesslers and other people who come into their orbit. You really feel these characters care for each other. Likewise, thanks to his background as a film executive, Robbins realistically evokes the business side of the industry with a number of scenes depicting bargaining, deal making, and executive maneuvering both within a company and between rival studios. Though tame in comparison to some of his later, more sexually explicit books, The Dream Merchants is still an entertaining read. It may not rank up there with What Makes Sammy Run as a Hollywood literary novel, it more than does the job as a good entertainment with plenty of heat, humor, humanity and heart."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"What could have been a great epic about the earlier days of filmaking has turned out to be a dreadful, overlong, uninteresting mishmash that even die hard fans will hate.

It shows how they get involved in the movie business, build a studio and fight to keep it going. Through the years various characters and situations pop up to challenge them.This was OK but nothing new. Robbins has done this already with \\"The Carpetbaggers\\" a MUCH better book. Like most of his books this is long (I have the 1961 version and its 517 pages with small type). It's not completely uninteresting but some of it is VERY slow and puzzling. When they get incolved with the business, percentages and stocks I got bored and confused. Also the construction of this book is haphazard. It starts out in 1938 then keeps backtracking through the years to explain things. You have to keep track of quite a few characters and situations and it gets annoying. However the various stories DO move pretty rapidly and some of the situations are pretty ridiculous (but amusing). Since this was originally published in 1949 there's no explicit sex but it makes it pretty clear what's going on. It all ends up with a happy ending that I didn't buy for one second. Still it's a quick silly read. Good for summer or vacation time reading...but Robbins has done MUCH better."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"The Dream Merchants, are, of course, the lords of Hollywood.

That doesn't mean that the book goes out of the main story but at least I don't like to read twice the same story in a book, no matter if it is written in two lines or in two pages.The story has ups and downs, is not a bad book but you will take some time reading it, so if you see it at your parents house take it, and before you read it get prepare for a heavy book to read."},{"Title":"West Against the Wind","review":"This is an excellent book.

It is short (about 150 pages) and clear. Davies investigates three reformation figures on the authority to exegete Scripture for the formulation of doctrine: Luther, Zwingli and Calvin. Davies is a sympathetic investigator and gives the reformers a charitable read. He finds that for Luther, the criteria of what amounted to doctrine was if it measured up with his Law/Gospel distinction. Davies finds that this proposal is inadequate since it is either grounded in Luther's subjective experience or is question begging. (How does one know what the proper relation is between Law and Gospel prior to exegeting Scripture?) He moves on to Zwingli who's proposal is simple and elegant but highly implausible. Zwingli knows what is or is not the the proper exegesis of Scripture and thus what is doctrine by God audibly telling him so. Lastly, Davies examines Calvin's appeal to the inner witness of the Scriptures and the claim of Scripture's self authentication. He argues rightly that such claims ultimately reduce to appeals to private and internal psychological states, rather than public, normative, objective processes by which claims are adjudicated.While this is a small book its worth should not be seen as low because of that fact. It is a most valuable work and is completely ignored in numerous Protestant works (even though the author was a Protestant)on Sola Scriptura. For example, in the entire three volume work of King and Webster (Holy Scripture) there isn't a single reference anywhere to Davies' work. The same can be said for numerous other Protestant works on the subject. And this fact alone makes them inadequate as a comparison between the two works will make apparent. Davies book is a necessary work for sorting out debates on Sola Scriptura and Church Authority."},{"Title":"101 Ways To Grow A Healthy Sunday School","review":"Maybe it's because the book isn't what I was expecting, but I felt a little let down. It's a lot like those Life's Little Instruction Booklet type books--just a bunch of pithy one-liners &amp; suggestions. A few of the quotes were lame, for example, &quot;if the Sunday School is to improve, it must change; if it is to grow, it must plan for growth.&quot; Duh. Most of the suggestions were great, but they didn't give any details on how to actually do what it suggests, for example, &quot;plan an annual teacher training event to improve and develop the skills of all teachers.&quot; Good advice! However it doesn't tell you how to structure the event, what to teach the teachers, or any of the other information you might need to actually run a teacher training event.

While I'm not so determined that I want to do this using purely Japanese traditional tools and techniques, I believe it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms if one wants a product that is more than a tedious, and cheap imitation.Mesirow and Herman's book is a very straightforward and practical presentation of the tools of the Japanese carpenters trade. Straightforward, is a relative term. The authors freely admit that &quot;Japanese saws, chisels, planes, knives, axes, and adzes are complicated beyond belief, difficult to use, and hard to maintain.&quot; But following that off-putting statement they do their best to bridge the knowledge and experience gap with sections on saws, planes, chisels, marking gauges, and stones, heavily illustrated with pen and ink drawings.Planes get the most attention, but every subject is presented with enough information to separate the dilettantes from the committed. To a modern Westerner like me, used to exotic machinery that costs only slightly less than the best Japanese traditional tools the idea of tools that take years to learn to use is both awe inspiring and frightening. Yet these very tools are capable of end products that are an order of magnitude finer than precision machinery can deliver.One can wish that 'The Care and Use of Japanese Woodworking Tools' was a bit more expansive on the qualities and ranges of the various tools. More photographs would have been nice as well as some anecdotes and examples. But as a 'simple,' inexpensive first tour the book does exactly what it is supposed to do, teach and guide.

Chicago was shocked in 1955 when the naked bodies of three young boys were found in a ditch in a forest preserve. An incredible effort on the part of police and investigative authorities for years was unable to solve this horrible crime. It took two outstanding agents, John Rotunno and Jim Grady, through intensive investigation to crack this \\"cold case.\\" O'Shea has detailed a most interesting summary of just how these agressive agents turned up enough evidence to convict horseman Kenneth Hansen. His book is a fascinating read. This worthy story would make a top-notch movie..."},{"Title":"Unbridled Rage","review":"This is a sad brutal story 40 years in the making. O'Shea brings the outfit, Chicago Horse syndicate and the infamous Jayne gang uncomfortably close to the reader--especially parents. The author masterfully weaves the past and present into a well written, easily understood history of the brutal crimes committed against three innocent young boys in 1955. The ATF agents who cracked this cold case deserve the gratitude of every parent. They never gave up. Thanks."},{"Title":"Unbridled Rage","review":"It's a good book. It is truly amazing that this type of case could slide to obscurity. It sheds light on just how elusive solving high profile crimes can be and how they can connect to other crimes. Instead of becoming completely tangled in that web, it keeps its emphasis on the right area, the case of these children. It is good to know that even after forty years, some kind of justice was served while there were still those alive to witness it.Anyone who is enamored with mobster types and stories should refer to this one as the flipside of the reality on how inherently sick and cruel these individuals really were."},{"Title":"Unbridled Rage","review":"If you grew up in metropolitan Chicago you are aware of the events covered in this story.

Along the way, the author, Gene O'Shea, touches on a number of other murders connected to the notorious Silas Jayne gang in Chicago. The story is fascinating and the writing is just excellent. For example there are courtroom scenes where necessary to advance the story, but these scenes which in the hands or lesser writers can be numbingly boring, are brief and relevant. O'Shea writes as a reporter presenting a clear narrative, rather than as a cheerleader, which unfortunately is an all too common phenonmenon in true crime writing. He remains as non-judgemental as anyone could, given the nauseating nature of the crime, and of the personal make-up, which O'Shea explores in interesting depth, of the murderer. The time frames of this book range from 1955 to the early 21st century.

ATF Rotunno is an expert at deception to support his theories. Before ATF Rotunno leaked the Plemmons lies to the media he was heavily promoted as a great man in a book called Unbridled Rage by Gene O'Shea.(I want to make it clear that all I say about Gene O'Shea and his book are just my and a few others opinions.)I feel that this was part of Rotunno's plan to win public opinion of what great work he had done of getting people convicted for murders. Then his new fabricated story would carry more weight. In Unbridled Rage a lot of stories about Silas Jayne and his family are told by Rottunno and other law enforcement agents. After all the lies I have pointed out about ATF Rotunno's disregard for the law and lying, do you believe his stories?Rottuno paints a picture to support his con. Gene O'Shea appears to be his P.R. man. Not once throughout this book does he say anything negative about Rotunno. It appears to me and a few others that O'Shea has a hidden agenda in writing this book!He really sucks up to Rotunno a lot. I and some others are very, very suspicious of Gene O'Shea becoming Illinois Gaming Commissioner. Did Rotunno or his ATF buddies have something to do with Govenor Blagoavich appointing him to be Illinois Gaming Commissioner?He was a reporter at the Daily Southtown newspaper in suburban Chicago while working very close to Rotunno then he becomes Illinois Gaming Commissioner. Very, very interesting! I think this should be investigated! What do you think?In the 1995 Ken Hansen murder trial, Hansen's defense attorney O'Donnell says as Gene O'Shea writes in O'Donnell's opening statement, \\"The state's case was nothing more than fabrication, woven from lies and stories of paid witnesses who were working hand in hand with federal agents to rebuild the tarnished reputation of the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol and Firearms, O'Donnell said.\\"\\"An unholy alliance was created a few years ago, that alliance was between William Wemette, a man who has to please people who pay him money, provide him housing, give him free telephone service, and a unit of government called ATF,\\" O'Donnell said. \\"The ATF in 1993 was probably the most discredited law enforcement agency on the face of the earth after the Waco disaster and Ruby Ridge. They desperately needed to seek to rehabilitate their image before the public.\\"William Wemette was and FBI informant from 1971-1989. Then the ATF gets new information from him in the 90's about a murder that happened in the 50's. Very, very suspicious looking! Maybe another ATF setup! What do you think?O'Shea writes about the 1995 Bailey trial, \\"Judge Shadur found that Bailey had conspired to murder Helen Brach based on a \\"preponderance of evidence.\\"This is just from Joe Plemmons testimony! Bailey was convicted of stealing from rich woman. But to sentence him for conspiring to kill Helen Brach on Joe Plemmons word alone looks real weird to me!O'Shea writes, \\"On a moment's notice Rotunno would find himself switching gears from a suburban family man with a wife and three daughters to his undercover persona as a ruthless drug dealer who \\"moved\\" truckloads of marijuana. Gang members came to admire Rotunno, nick naming him \\"Red\\" because of the government-issued undercover hot rod he drove, a fully loaded red Mustang.\\"So Rotunno is a trained liar. I bet he is so good at lying that he could look you in the eyes and make you believe his lie. He can probably lie constantly to a lie detector and pass the test!O'Shea writes, \\"Rotunno, with all of his years of undercover work, had honed his instincts, and trusted them. His intuition had gotten him out of a jam on more than one occasion; sometimes he just knew he was right about a suspect or theory.\\" \\"Like many lawmen, Rotunno was very good at reading personalities. He often relied on his internal lie detector when sizing up witnesses and informants. Rotunno was also a guarded individual. He rarely shared his opinions or true emotions, and when he did, it was only around those he trusted. Rotunno's guarded demeanor would pigeonhole him as \\"bad cop\\" in an interrogation situation.\\"So once Rotunno creates a theory he will do whatever it takes to support his theory. In the Helen Brach murder investigation, he has lied and fabricated evidence to support his theory. He thinks he is above the law. He has broken the law over and over. Why should Rotunno be able to break the law and not be fired and prosecuted?Remember ATF Bob Hauffman saying on Jan 10, 2005 on \\"60 Minutes\\" that he could substantiate one of the three ATF woman agent's claims that ATF agents sexually harassed them. He went on to say that all the criminals that he has put away in his career, all of them have more honor than the top official in the ATF! He said I know this is a sad commentary but that is my experience as an ATF agent! How can we blame ATF Rotunno?

One of the most interesting things I learned about European imperialism is that the europeans taught their colonial subjects about their own struggles for independence, rights and representative government, inadvertantly planting and watering the seeds of colonial independence. They even have a section where a native of the dutch colony of indonesia (who was interested in Indonesian independence) wrote to and lectured the Dutch colonial authorities about this very thing.Seeing Lenin's view of imperialism was interesting, although it was easy to see how misguided the man was thinking there would be a transition from european imperialism to world-wide communism. It was also interesting to read Ghandi's view on imperialism (he thought european imperialism was successful in great measure because the people of Indian wanted the wealth, goods and technology the British had to offer and would be independent as soon as India as a nation wanted independence... and then there were Ghandi's own luddite views on technology and independence.All and all this book is work buying and going over repeatedly."},{"Title":"European Imperialism: 1830 to 1930 (Problems in European Civilization Series)","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase.

On every other page of the book, McKinnon heroically battles racism. Somehow, with the institutional racism rampant in the Detroit Police Department, McKinnon manages to work as a patrol officer for only about 2 years. As a matter of fact, only about 20 pages of the book are dedicated to his patrol career.One telling story involved McKinnon chasing a man who ran away from a stolen car. McKinnon chases the man into an apartment building, and through the door of an apartment. The next thing he knows, he's staring down the barrels of automatic weapons being wielded by a nest of Black Panthers. McKinnon grabs his prisoner and backs out of this Mexican standoff to admonitions of \\"Be cool man..\\" from the leader of the Panthers. When he gets outside, a bunch of neighbors come out of their houses and form a protective circle around McKinnon and the prisoner to escort them out of harm's way. Touching. However, what the book doesn't address is what McKinnon did about the group of dangerous men armed with automatic weapons who just pointed them at a police officer! He probably had no case on the guy who ran away from the stolen car (he wasn't driving) but it looks like he chose to take THAT guy to jail rather than call in reinforcements to arrest a bunch of armed and dangerous felony suspects! Later in the book, McKinnon talks about a cop who was killed by the Black Panthers. I had to wonder if the Panther who killed him was one of the guys McKinnon let go.Within 2 years of being hired, McKinnon is assigned to a \\"gravy\\" job at Recruiting. Shortly after that, he's working directly for the mayor. Thus begins his meteoric rise to the top. \\"Stand Tall\\" is a cream-puff of a book that offers a detailed look at every positive aspect of McKinnon's career. It doesn't even pay lip service to any of the negative aspects that could conceivably cause him to be viewed in a negative light. For instance; why did McKinnon quit as chief of police in the middle of his friend and \\"homey\\" (his words, not mine) Dennis Archer's term as mayor? Did he just wake up one day and decide \\"Well, it's time for me to do something else. I think I'll bail out on Homey in the middle of his term.\\" Or was there another reason? I guess we'll have to wait for someone else's biography to learn the answer to that one.The Detroit Police Department has a long-standing practice of arresting witnesses to crimes, especially homicides, with no probable cause that they did anything wrong, in order to intimidate them into providing information that they would not otherwise provide. Earlier in his career, McKinnon takes a dim view of arresting people in the absence of probable cause. However, as Chief, he lets the practice continue. Could it be that he's willing to sanction the violation of citizens' constitutional rights if it would help raise the DPD's dismally low clearance rate for homicides? I don't know, he never addresses the issue.McKinnon takes credit for everything he possibly can with virtually no mention of the efforts of his subordinates. The local media plays a bigger part in the book than the people who back him up as chief.McKinnon appears to take credit for personally solving the Nancy Kerrigan case. After the figure skater is bopped on the knee, Ike eventually asks her father where she is. He valiantly checks the pool in case the bad guys try to drown her, and the outside of the Westin Hotel in case someone tries to push her off a steep incline. He finally finds her in the last place he looks (her hotel room). McKinnon refers to the Kerrigan case as \\"an international story, the likes of which Detroit has never seen\\". Detroit had the Collingwood massacre of Purple Gang members, a nationally televised beating of suburban women by Detroit residents at the International Fireworks downtown, a former police chief who embezzled millions, status as \\"murder capitol\\" for several years, but a figure skater who gets assaulted is a story the likes of which the city has never seen? Sure.McKinnon leaves no truth unadulterated in his quest for hyperbole and melodrama. He describes the Rodney King beating as a case where police officers beat King while he was on the ground with a chain around his neck. A chain around his neck? He describes Detroit's own \\"Rodney King\\" incident as a situation where Malice Green was beaten by police officers and died right there in the street. Also not true. It's a point of pride with him that he saw to it that his officers were issued pepper spray after the Malice Green incident. Pretty proactive of Dr. McKinnon to wait until someone dies to equip his officers with something that other officers all over the state have had for years. I eagerly await \\"Stand Tall Part Deux\\" to read \\"the rest of the story\\"."},{"Title":"Stand Tall","review":"I recommend this wonderful book for anybody who wants to become a police officer, especially African Americans and other minorities interested in this field. Dr. McKinnon does an excellent job with expressing his feelings about his experiences with the Detroit Police Department, racism, and why it was important for him to join the Detroit Police Department. Dr. McKinnon's book is a true defition of the American dream (especially for minorities) and I guarantee this book will inspire you to follow your dreams regardless of how tough it gets! I've met Dr. McKinnon once and I hope to meet him again so he can autograph my book. Get your copy today!"},{"Title":"Stand Tall","review":"This book was recommended to me by friends in Michigan and it should be on everyone's bookshelf. Ike McKinnon's story is one of perseverence, dedication, and an incredible ability to remain above the fray and disease of society. It's pure inspiration to read about his life and how he rose above everything, not letting himself become tainted, to help people, help clean up the city of Detroit, and help straighten out its police department. It's motivational, inspiring, and Oprah should know about it!"},{"Title":"The builders;: A story and study of masonry","review":"I finished reading this book between my E.A. and F.C. confirmations and want to read it again (as a M.M.), but it is on loan to one of my brothers.

Sugisaki's artwork of course in here is really beautiful and has a unique look from her other series. However, one of the most disappointing thing I found (I own the first printing) was that the lineart were very pixelated, due printing error, instead of crisp line you would commonly find in the original tanks.

This would not be an \\"easy\\" read (and maybe not even useful for) undergraduates. I read this book in the context of a seminar on \\"Power and Empowerment\\" led by Dr. M. Feldman at the University of California in Irvine, with 20+ students to think about the ideas.I'm reviewing this book because I was shocked to see it only had three stars!On to the the review:Power is a rich theoretical concept.Lukes does an masterful job by providing us (the readers) with a rich historical trajectory of the intellectual understanding of the term, \\"Power\\". Like anything else, terms and ideas have historical and sociomaterial birthplaces, and by reading Luke's editorial the reader is exposed to 10-15 different nuanced perspectives of the term power. [I don't have the book with me so I can't double check the exact number of entries]. Additionally, the reader is given a synthesized introduction to the arguments of power, and how those arguments have shifted and developed over time.If a reader is looking to deeply and critically understand notions of power, this book is such a great starting place as Lukes has synthesized and produced a fine anthology of the notions of power, and with his introduction gives us (the reader) a road map to understand it! Now, if your interested in more of the \\"newer\\" concepts of power, such as ANT, Structuration Theory, Sociomateriality, and so on, then no this book isn't for you, dear reader, maybe. Unless, you want to understand where their *new and shiny* arguments are coming from, then perhaps this book is worth your read.Also, no matter what your theoretical persuasion, Luke's got something that will be relevant for you. You like Russell's Pragmatism, Marxism, Foucault, Socialism? Good, he's got those plus other theories covered.Now to be honest, I haven't read every single chapter, but to any new readers of power theories, I *highly* recommend reading Luke's introduction, this will give you a sense for what is and is not relevant to your and your research/understanding of the term power.Now, in summary, you've gotta know where the field has been intellectually, to better understand where the intellectual field is going.For whatever it's worth, I'm a second year PhD student who highly recommends this book."},{"Title":"Power","review":"This book is too old and archaic.

After reading it, you want David Breskin to go around interviewing every director, immersing himself in their work beforehand, leading them into intimate and challenging conversations in which they sometimes get mad at him (even the laid-back David Cronenberg gets a little prickly at one point) but develop a grudging respect for him at the same time. INNER VIEWS collects eight interviews Breskin conducted for ROLLING STONE -- yes, children, there was a time when that magazine was worth reading -- though the pieces were significantly shortened for publication in RS, and thankfully restored to full sprawl here. I have no idea why we haven't seen more from Breskin; is he dead or retired? An interviewer this penetrating and eloquent shouldn't be allowed to ride off into the sunset.I would be duty-bound to cherish this book simply because Breskin sits down with two of my gods, David Cronenberg and David Lynch; between their interviews here and the respective books about them edited by Chris Rodley, you will discover all you could ever want to know about these fascinating directors. But Breskin also interviews six other greats: Robert Altman, Oliver Stone, Francis Ford Coppola, Spike Lee, Tim Burton, and (in the expanded 1997 edition) Clint Eastwood. He parries amusingly with a few of them, as when Oliver Stone -- intellectual macho man that he is -- smugly breaks out a quote from Aeschylus, only to be informed by the unimpressed Breskin that Coppola had already related that same quote to him. (Stone is described as &quot;surprised, his thunder stolen.&quot;) Breskin also gets yelled at a few times by accomplished shouter Spike Lee (this was before he became a father and mellowed) but admirably, calmly stands his ground -- yet Lee comes off not as a hothead throwing a diva tantrum but as an impassioned man who isn't used to being challenged by an interviewer from ROLLING STONE. Lee, and everyone else in the hot seat here, would discover that Breskin was much more than that."},{"Title":"Inner Views: Filmmakers In Conversation","review":"Breskin plainly admires the filmmakers at their best, at work and as people. He wins them into describing, with greater articulation than most, what they were thinking when they made their films and how they see art in general.But what makes the book so worthwhile is that Breskin makes his subjects pay the piper, when they would almost certainly rather dismiss at least some of his questions with a one-liner. He is not inclined, as more \\"fannish\\" journalists would be and have been, to let them off the hook for mistakes or evasive answers.(Revealing as well to note which of those interviewed arguably still had their best work ahead of them and which did not. The two Davids, Cronenberg and Lynch, are especially useful for this)"},{"Title":"Inner Views: Filmmakers In Conversation","review":"It's so very rare to be able to predict that a book, were it a publicly traded stock, is an investment certain to become more valuable over time, the antithesis of a kitten. Breskin has honed his ability to ingratiate ephemerally, and in this process, you will get a rare glimpse of these great directors actually moving outside of soundbite to let you in on some part of process. Very worth...worth."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I watched \\"The Hours\\" on video which is based on the Virginia Woolf novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The book I am assigned to read in English class and write a paper on modernism. Mrs. Dalloway is at first a slow read but each day of reading the book helps the reader to know what events and thoughts are taking place among each character. England was breaking slowing from Victorian morals creating a society that would not be based on a person's rank in class and gender. It also is recouperating from World War One. The climate was changing and not everyone could keep up the pace. Septimus suffered a nervous breakdown after witnessing the death of his friend Evans. Miss Kilman, a German patriot and born-again Christian, disdainfully looked down on Clarissa for putting on a show. And Elizabeth, Mrs. Dalloway's daughter, was her own person rather than a copy of her mother. Just to name a few supporting characters that intricately make the book a good read.I did find the book tedious to read but it was a very interesting and insightful story of how the upper class lead daily lives giving them human characteristics rather than a shallow appearance of diamonds and pearls."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is almost a story without a story. At first sight the plot of this book seems almost banal. After all, who wants to know how Clarissa Dalloway spends her day?. Isn't she merely a shallow woman who leds a boring life?.Of course, we should remember that first impressions are often misleading... and in this case, they certainly are. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is nothing less that a ground-breaking novel in which Virginia Woolf pioneers a style that would later be called \\"stream of consciousness\\". Thanks to that style the reader can, literally, read the thoughts of the characters without any kind of censorship. Even though that makes the book somewhat unclear at times, it is nonetheless strangely attractive, and compelling.\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is the story of a day in Clarissa's life, but it is at the same time the story of the people who know her, or that are somehow connected to her, and the story of her/their dreams and thoughts. Virginia Woolf's goal in this book was ambitious, but she managed to achive it: she allows the reader to look right into the mind of the different characters...As I previously mentioned, the story of Mrs. Dalloway is at the same time the story of many more, as the story of each of us is also the story of the people we know/love/hate/like/dislike. There are many people who help us to understand Clarissa, thanks to their interactions with her. However, we also see her under a different light thanks to characters that don't know her, or are merely distantly connected to her through one of her many acquaintances. For example, Septimus Warren Smith, an ex-soldier who battles madness, and whose gloomy life provides a stark contrast to the artificial cheerfulness of Clarissa's own life. The two never meet, but it is impossible to try to understand one without the other...On the whole, I think you will enjoy this book. It is quite original, and gives the reader food for thought. It makes us realize that there is often more to people than what meets the eye.

However, this work while still containing all of the truly fascinating psychological intricancies that a good book of this style does, it does not lose the reader. The way to go about reading this book is to just give yourself over to the free-fall that you will experience. You will be very richly rewarded by it"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Though there are some passing resemblances to Jane Austen, the comedy of manners, and Victorian narrative satire, this is a modernist novel and a fairly accessible introduction to Woolf, unless the reader is overly impatient or tone-deaf. Woolf creates a character's interior life through a virtuosic, highly mobile third-person narrator, who might be thought of as the character's \\"persona,\\" not merely \\"expressing\\" the character's thoughts but \\"mirroring\\" how the character perceives him or herself as seen by others. Moreover, the indefinite pronouns can shift unexpectedly or occur in too close proximity to make identification easy or even definite. As a result, the reader has to work overtime to achieve entrance into the mind of the \\"right\\" character while simultaneously sensing the liquid, interpenetrating and shared qualities of human identity itself. And finally there's that tone, now soft, now loud, and rarely without irony.Woolf makes it fairly easy on the reader with the broad, sardonic strokes she uses to paint the practically villainous Sir William Bradshaw, the eminent psychiatrist viewed by many (especially himself) as the scientific high priest of this cross-section of deluded London luminaries; and she's equally nasty to her other \\"villain,\\" Miss Kilman, a repressed and embittered born-again Christian who, like Sir William, lives by the code of \\"conversion,\\" Woolf's euphemism for those powerful personalities who are bent upon breaking, controlling and dominating the will of anyone not strong enough to resist them. The other portraits are more subtle, requiring the reader either to hear the soft, nuanced ironical tones or risk missing both the social satire and the character. Woolf's targets range, perhaps not surprisingly, from the pretense, pride, and hypocrisy of an out-of-touch social stratum that clings to the \\"orderly\\" past; to the arrogance of modern medical \\"science\\"; to, more surprisingly, the suffocating alternatives offered by both religion and love. She uses the term \\"Human Nature\\" ironically, making it refer to those individuals who cannot see with understanding, empathy or vision, substituting for \\"life\\" the ego's own conventional, reductive and limited sense of a world that's all surface and order.Readers lured to this novel because of Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" (novel or film) may be disappointed or quickly frustrated. Moving from Cunningham to Woolf is a bit like going from Fitzgerald to Faulkner, or from Austen to Shakespeare. What you immediately notice is the far greater range and more inclusive thematic focus and, most importantly, the sheer power and vitality of the prose (from fluid motion to dynamic rush). Woolf--like Joyce, Faulkner, and Shakespeare--employs a syntax that can cause the head to spin and the earth: she's a writer who represents not merely individual characters but captures a microcosm of life not to mention the life of language itself.The greatest challenge \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" presents to a first-time reader is never to let up. It's essential to stay with Clarissa throughout her entire day, finally becoming a fully engaged participant in the party itself--the final thirty pages of the novel, which contain some of Woolf's best writing. Especially critical is the extended moment, almost 20 pages into the party scene, when Clarissa, like Septimus, walks to the window and has her epiphany. It's a moment highly reminiscent of Gabriel Conroy's singular internal struggle and ultimate attainment of vision in the closing paragraphs of \\"The Dead\\" (Woolf was not especially fond of Joyce, but it's hard to believe she was not influenced by him). At that moment, Clarissa sees her affinity and even oneness with Septimus, a character who suffers internally but is capable of resisting the worse alternative of the \\"cures\\" offered by Dr. Bradshaw, one of the guests at Clarissa's own party. The insight produces action: one character chooses death; the other, life. But Woolf enables us to see these apparently opposite choices as existential cognates: both characters make choices that enable them to save their souls. (The \\"Death of the Soul\\" is a theme introduced early in the novel by the insightful Peter, a \\"failure\\" by society's standards and his own admission and someone who cannot get the better of his fixations--on the irretrievable past and his own youth. By the story's end, it is not Peter but Clarissa who presents a whole and integrated self, capable of separating the illusory from the real, of the once dependent \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" from the newly enlightened \\"Clarissa.\\"Cunningham is a first-rate stylist and craftsman who can tell a story that's moving and evocative, a narrative, moreover, that connects with today's readers by affirming the choices available to the self. But it feels like a mechanical assembly next to the vibrant novel that is its source and inspiration. Ms. Woolf, like her character Clarissa, knows how to throw a party."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This modern classic novel is not an easy read but it hides a multitude of reasons to keep reading between its cumbersome lines.Mrs. Dalloway leaves her upper crust English home one bright morning to buy flowers for her party.

Against the backdrop of a ticking Big Ben Clarissa Dalloway remembers her youth, her exuberance and her dislike for societies norms but interestingly finds herself to be all that she distasted as a vibrant young woman filled with a sense of freedom. In her world is the ever moody, Peter Walsh, a man who never quite left his love behind as he watched Clarissa walk away with Richard Dalloway so many years ago and Sally (her long lost best friend) who once contributed to Clarissa's immature whims. Unknowingly Septimus Warren Smith lurks behind the day in his war-torn madness and he becomes a factor in Mrs. Dalloway's delightful day.Virginia Woolf wrote this novel in 1925 many years prior to her own mental illness and suicide, but within the lines of this novel I sensed a tortured soul and a scattered but calculated mind at work. I admit I struggled with Woolf's writing style and never quite found a fit that felt right. She writes with such stops and starts that one must almost be a literary professor to keep up with her thoughts as they are strung out into extraordinarily long sentences laced with a multitude of punctuations. I found that I was often lost on what character she was delving into and had to go back and re-read entire paragraphs to figure out where I had lost her thought. She is certainly demanding of one's attention! Interestingly enough there are many references to water in this novel and I felt the beginnings of a connection between Woolf's characters and her own suicide method. Don't expect simplicity in Woolf she believed that her style of calculated impressionism would open up the art of the novel. Certainly in one day Mrs. Dalloway experiences what most people search a lifetime for and I found Woolf's explanation of aging quite moving, \\"But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves. There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now....\\"I recommend watching the film, \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" with Vanessa Redgrave after reading this book once or twice because somehow bringing Woolf's characters to life gives them a less elite meaning and allows for a bit of commonness and intimacy. But to grasp the meaning wrapped in Woolf's prose this novel must be read over and over again. For so fragile a creature as Woolf ended up being she is by far one of the strongest writers to have graced this world and her work is something to spend hours pondering over."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This Virginia Woolf book is not so much a novel as it is a snapshot of life. By viewing this snapshot, we appreciate the time that we do have in life.The narrative of the book takes place in the span of a day. There is no consistent narrator here. Instead, Woolf has us go from character to character to see the world from the mind and eyes of each. This can be a little disorienting, but the reader senses the cohesion of all people and their effects on one another.Most of the time, we are seeing things from the perspective of Clarissa Dalloway on the day of a party she is giving. The other characters we see are in some way connected to her. Some are related, some are friends, some are associates, and some are just people she sees in the park. Seeing this connection should get us to pause and notice what goes on around us.I would recommend reading this book. I would especially recommend it if you are reading the Michael Cunningham book, \\"The Hours.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf goes beyond merely describing the attitudes of a woman planning a party. Through social interactions and chance meetings, we meet a broad range of interesting characters struggling with the aftermath of not only life's decisions, but also the consequences of such societal ills as the Great War. The close of the book was an exceptional way to persuade readers to read more of Woolf's work, not becuase we will ever know what became of Clarissa and her lost love, but because we are intrigued by the life Woolf gives her characters in our own imaginations."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"A friend of mine recently said that Virginia Woolf was too difficult for her. I think my mouthfell open. My friend's not dumb, anything but. I quoted the line (in the title of this review)and told her it came from Mrs. Dalloway. I told her Mrs. Dalloway was one of the best books Ihave ever read. It isn't easy. It demands attention. If you give it yours, you will \\"shout, embrace,swing, be up at dawn; carry sugar to ponies; kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows; andthen all tingling and streaming, plunge and swim.\\" And then you will know that \\"life itself,every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant, now, in the sun, in Regent's Park,was [is] enough.\\"Don't miss out."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I began the book having never read anything by Virginia Woolf, but had heard she was great. I also had only heard of Mrs. Dalloway but did not know the story line. So, going into it blind I am certain handicapped my apppreciation for the work. Virginia Woolf uses eloquent words in Mrs. Dalloway. Unfortunately I found that it was a bit difficult to follow. There were several passages I had to read twice to understand where she jumped from one idea/topic/person to another. Half way in the frustration overtook me and I stopped reading. Having since seen the movie I understand the story much better and may give the book another go. If you do not already understand what is going to happen and are unfamiliar with this style of writing I suggest viewing the movie first."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"What inspired me to read this book was the movie \\"The Hours,\\" which is a story of three women in three different eras, whose lives are connected by Virginia Woolf's book, Mrs. Dalloway. The movie portrays Virginia Woolf as she is writing this book. She did seem to have a perfect life. She had connections; a loving husband, that entire one could wish for, but she was not happy, and her quite depressed way of life was reflected in this book.It all begins with that one sentence: \\"Mrs. Dalloway decided that she would buy the flowers herself.\\" And that is the first sentence in a capturing series of sentences that make you want to read the book all in one go. Follow the life of Clarissa Dalloway and surrounding persons as they go through one day of their lives, in utmost emotion and thoughts. Experience madness, arrogance, jealousy, and doubts, and how a gauzy veil of poise and grace covers up these feelings. The story is of Mrs. Dalloway, who is holding a party. As she is mending her dress, preparing the silver, and making sure that all the guests know about the party, she thinks about life. She thinks about Peter Walsh, her teenage lover and about her husband, Richard. She thinks that she was right not to marry Peter, who is back from India for the divorce of the woman whom he loves. She thinks of Lady Bruton, who has invited Richard to lunch, but not her. While she is thinking this, Mr. Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran, is avoiding the great brute with the red nostrils, or in other words, the doctor who is putting him in a mental institution. An institution where his madness could be cured. Watching this scene is Septimus' wife, Lucrezia, who worries about her husband, and is scared of his insane words. In the end, he ultimately kills himself. All of these lives, entwined together into one whole web of insecurity and uncertainty.This book definitely isn't very easy to read, as it is written in \\"stream of thought,\\" but once you, the reader, is wrapped up in its pages, it's quite hard to put the book down, because it reflects the deepest and darkest emotions that we feel, and it proves that we are not alone in those feelings. And thus, the book ends with the reader still entranced by its ironic truth."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf is a literary master and this is one of her greatest works. It is the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway. We are allowed to see various aspects of her life as she plans for a party. Woolf makes wonderful social comments about society in a subtle and moving way. The side story in the novel of Septimus Warren and his death is very touching and moving. It is a sad reminder of war and the people involved in the war and its effect on them and their society as they attempt to return to a \\"normal\\" life. Woolf allows us to see how people we don't actually know touch our lives in unexpected ways. I believe this novel still applies to today's society. This is a wonderful read which will stay with you for a long time to come. If you take your time and read deeply, Woolf will touch you in a way that you won't soon be able to forget. She is truly unique and wonderful!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Although somewhat hard to get into, Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf ended up being a great novel. Getting into the book was tough because Woolf's syntax is very complex and different from any author I have ever read. The points of view often change without warning and can be somewhat confusing, but once I caught on to Woolf\`s style, I began to like it a lot. The entire novel takes place during one day as the protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway, prepares for a party she is throwing that evening. Other characters are brought into the plot that upon first glance may seem as though they have nothing to do with the story, but Woolf does a marvelous job intertwining the characters and making parallels between each of them. I wouldn't recommend this book if you have no patience or don't want a possible struggle. The novel, however, is beautifully written and worth your time if you are willing to give it."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I'd tried Virginia Woolf several times, but bogged down (I'm not alone in this, I suspect).

The story takes place mid-June in the city of London. As the young socialite prepares for a party she is holding that evening, we as readers are allowed an inside look at her innermost thoughts. A series of unexpected events, including the arrival of an old friend, evoke a series of memories from Clarissa's past. As we live through these memories once again with Mrs. Dalloway, we are exposed to her worries and fears of the future and what lies ahead. Clarissa begins to revaluate the choices she has made throughout her life, and how these choices have effected who she is today.Wolfe writes in a talented and descriptive manner which allows for readers to truly enter the story themselves. Because of her strong ability to illustrate and portray characters, you feel like you've personally met and understand each one. The complexity of each character gives each one their own expression in the novel.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the dynamics of human relationships. What I enjoyed most was that the ending is not conventional, however its simplicity is what makes it beautiful. The challenge in this read is to find the hidden feelings that emerge behind what appear to be simplistic, daily events. Virginia Wolfe is an exquisite writer whose abilities to create such vivid images in one's mind is what makes this novel so captivating."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I decided to read this before \\"The Hours\\" by Michael Cunningham, since his book was heavily based off of \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Later I found that it was not necessary, but it certainly was helpful; plus, I read a great book on the way.Firstly, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is not for everybody. I could see where people would get really frustrated, but I didn't find it all too troublesome for myself, half because I knew well what I was getting into, and also because it was for an assignment in school (electively). Virginia Woolf has an amazing talent for making enormous sentences, pages spanning sentences... but as I said, I found these quite entertaining.Though the book is rather short, the print is fairly small, and with the writing style, which is likely to cost a few pages to be reread, it will take a little bit of a time investment. Not being the quickest reader, I was able to get thought it and write a fair analysis of it in about two weeks.If you are to read this for school, I would definitely take the time to read it twice, which I did not allow myself to do.Should you be questioning whether or not to read this for \\"The Hours,\\" I would highly recommend it, but should you decide to skip \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" you'll do just fine, perhaps not understand the references, but you should still enjoy Cunningham's piece.Basically, to enjoy this, you'll need patience, otherwise you may want to go onto something else... but if you are interested and have a little time to spare, got for it!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is a book very much like James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; which I can say makes it a hard recommendation. The point of view flows from one character to the next without any warning and many readers may be easily lost. I would not reccmond this as a first venture into the horridly confusing technique of Stream of Consciousness. Frankly, a knowing book editor would have helped this book a lot.On the upside, there are some very serious Sapphic undertones to the rambling of the book which make it more interesting than James Joyce whining about how he got beaten by the other boys in boarding school. But there are similiar themes of repression in the two books.The side plot involving Septimus Warren Smith and his wife Rezia was more interesting than Clarissa Dalloway and her silly party and repressed lesbian leanings"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Having abandoned this novel only half-read years ago, I went back to it hoping that maturity and experience might make a difference in my view of the work.

The concepts for the novels are similar, but the styles are polar opposites. I recommend becoming familiar with both works in order to appreciate the different ways that character studies can be developed during a day by relying extensively on thought life. Both are brilliant, but in much different ways.Mrs. Dalloway is English, delicate, fussy, ornate, and feminine. Ulysses is Irish, crude, unrestrained, common, and masculine.What stands out the most about Mrs. Dalloway are the many original descriptive sentences and phrases that look as though they went through 200 rewritings to be so polished and complete. Their expressions overwhelm the story at time because the reader is left gasping at a stunning turn of phrase or an idea. In writing, you can sit and admire and forget to read on.A blessing of listening to the excellent reading by Virginia Leishman is that the brilliant writing is better integrated into the story by forcing you to keep going. I enjoyed the experience. I don't want to discourage you from reading the book first, but I believe you will appreciate the overall craft more if you listen before reading. It's the same advice I provide for William Faulkner's books. There's a beauty in the oral expression that is otherwise lost.I found the story to feel a little dated. I also found myself not being terribly engaged by Mrs. Dalloway or her husband. That's a pretty big problem to have when listening to or reading a novel. Someone today who wrote historical fiction about this period would do it differently.Naturally, if I were only rating the marvelous ornate writing, this would be five stars. Most writers can only sit back in awe of such writing.

I enjoyed the book a lot, which is very un-common, and I am looking forward to reading some of the others by Ms.Woolf.

Possibly conceived as a rebuttal to James Joyce's Ulysses, Mrs. Dalloway is readable in comparison and much shorter in length. However, it uses a \\"stream of consciousness\\" style and takes place over the course of one day. It's a day in which Mrs. Dalloway, a privileged housewife, is hosting a party, and the action follows her from her errand in the morning for the flowers until the guests leave at night.The stream-of-consciousness style makes the book hard to get into. Mrs. Dalloway is not an educated woman and her thought process is more random than most. As her errands take her through the streets of London, the point of view floats from bystander to bystander and it's not clear whether these are characters or just random people.Whether it's just on this day or every day, Mrs. Dalloway is thinking about her young adulthood, her close friend Sally and Peter, the man she might have married. She's distressed because her daughter Elizabeth is in the thrall of her history tutor, Miss Killman. Miss Killman is an unattractive, bitter university graduate who has embraced religion as an outlet for her emotions. Peter, the man from Mrs. Dalloway's past, has just returned from India and drops in on her during her party preparations. Meanwhile, a shell-shocked (that's WWI-speak for post-traumatic stress disorder, though this guy is mentally ill) soldier is visiting a specialist in nervous complaints. While Mrs. Dalloway is milling around London running her errands, taking pleasure in the hustle and bustle of London, the soldier and his wife are walking the same streets, and he is overwhelmed and assaulted by it all.Mrs. Dalloway is a \\"classic\\", by which I think they mean \\"period piece\\", not \\"a book that will always be enjoyed\\".

This is an intriguing but terrible perspective. Life often offers up obstacles that appear insurmountable, yet these obstacles are only ever truly insurmountable if we choose not to climb them, if we turn away from the promise of the future, our prior experiences or neuroses filling us with bilious dread of what could pass, allowing the siren song of death's quiet to lull into the dreariest of complicacy.Life is a vivid array of opportunities, each hour of each day could offer a wonderful moment, or it could just be enjoyed for what it is. 5pm on a Tuesday in October may not offer a moment in which everything will make sense and be good, but it may offer a phone call from a friend you haven't seen in a while, or a red tailed hawk swooping down in the brush by the road as you drive home to grab a vole, or anything small but meaningful that tells you, that your life, all life, has purpose.The quality of the book is unimpeachable, but the quality of the message can be called into question.\\"...fear no more the heat of the sun.

It is not a book for that airplane trip, nor is it a book for the beach. It is a book to be read amid quiet with no distractions, and only a few of us have managed to fashion such a place in our lives. If one has not, perhaps a different choice would be better.Having said that, the stream-of-consciousness narrative is very accessible. Ms. Woolf has a knack for capturing the essence of many minor characters in very quick, brief sketches, giving the book a great deapth.Clarissa is a more complex person than her passion for parties would indicate, complex in her sensibility and love of the beautiful, complex in those aspects of life that she has rejected. Septimus is a vivid study in madness, something which Ms. Woolf knew a great deal about. Then there is third principle character, Peter Walsh, about whom little has been said here. He is in his early fifties, was radical in his youth, a &quot;failure&quot; in middle life according to the estimate of the &quot;successful,&quot; and plagued with women problems for a lifetime probably attributable to his constant love for the frigid Clarissa. Peter Walsh is a brilliant character study from the point of view of one similarly situated. Sally Seton, the only person whom Clarissa ever truly loved, is a vividly portrayed secondary character whom one runs into every day today--the aging hippie.

The pain and anguish Ms. Woolf manages to portray are vivid, and proof of her genuis as a writer. If you're looking for a book with a substantial plot or even minimal action, this is not for you. &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; instead relies on dialogue and inner thoughts of the characters to carry it along. I can see why it has been referred to as a classic."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Marcel Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" and James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" stand, to this day, as the two great classics of modern literature. In Proust, the stunning use of memory and sense perception, as well as the stream of consciousness narrative of the great \\"roman fleuve\\", marked the auspicious beginnings of a modern sensibility and technique in fiction. Similarly, Joyce's difficult, blasphemous and similarly streaming novel, set in the course of a single day and emanating from the perceiving mind of its narrator, carried forward this sensibility and technique. It is not surprising, then, that Virginia Woolf, while writing her brilliant and innovative \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", was reading these two authors at the time, for Woolf's novel stands as yet another masterful work of modern sensibility and technique, a classic in its own right.\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is set entirely during a single bright beautiful day in June, when Clarissa Dalloway is occupied by last minute preparations for a party she is having that evening. The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party. But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative. Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict. It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychological darkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings. But it is worth the effort, for \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is truly one of the great works of Twentieth century English literature, a modern novel that can stand comfortably, albeit diminuitively, next to The Great Marcel and the creator of Bloom's Day."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is not your conventional novel. It is uniquely and purposely so different from the novel that if you try to read it lazily in a by-the-beach summer mindset, you will likely A) not understand the \\"plot\\" (though admittedly the novel has very little conventional plot) B) the characters and C) the brilliance of it. Fortunately, all it takes is a splash of research before beginning and you should be well on your way to devouring one of literature's most delicious stories.The most important starting place is the characters. Feel free to cheat. Look at sparknotes or wikipedia and read the mini bios over each one. It's very helpful, for instance, in knowing that Septimus Smith is a shell-shocked WWI veteran. While it's no real secret in the story--characters refer to it, he thinks crazy things, etc.--some of his thoughts really aren't so crazy sounding since Mrs. Dalloway and other characters also think in odd metaphors and view the world in curious manners. The blending of crazy and noncrazy characters is also what makes the novel so interesting.Step 1: Pre-know characters. Septimus Smith, Mrs. Dalloway, Peter Walsh, and Sallly Seton being key. Note that Septimus and his wife are not actually friends or relatives of Mrs. Dalloway, they have never met, they do not know each other at all.Step 2: Expect point of view changes. The first time I read Mrs. Dalloway this threw me off the most. Throughout the novel there will be many instances when the point of view will be passed on to the perspective of some other character, often without warning, but not unrecognizably so. Woolf usually adds a single sentence or two to set minds apart so you know the switch is occurring, but it's still easy to get lost in the consciousnesses as every character thinks in lengthy sentences. Keep in mind that this is not a flaw in Woolf's writing, if you expect point of view switches to float about you will not be surprised by them. It is also very poetic how Woolf accomplishes this, as if all minds were connected and could be dived into in the way a falling leaf can travel in blowing wind.Step 3: Understand that plot is minimal. To say that \\"nothing happens\\" in this novel would be both correct and misleading. As far as actual events go, there are very very very few. Mrs. Dalloway buys flowers, A car passes by, a plane writes letters in the sky, a party is planned and held. These are some of the major plot elements that occur in a typical sense. The overwhelming majority of this novel occurs in the mind. Memories hold some events, but even then actual physical scenes are minimal. What you should expect while reading Mrs. Dalloway is to enter a realm of thoughts. It sounds very difficult if you've never encountered stream-of-consciousness writing, but it is surprisingly easy to get the hang of, especially since Virginia Woolf writes it better than anybody.Step 4: Keep an eye out for themes. This is the kind of novel that should be read with a highlighter in hand. There are just so many beautiful sentences that deserve to be marked for future reference. Also, highlighting can keep track of some of the great themes this novel possesses. Look at how frequently the word \\"Moment\\" is used in various contexts. Look at how often flowers and trees are references to and given life-like qualities. \\"Failure\\" is another key word along with so many more, but I don't want to narrow your thinking. Mrs. Dalloway is the kind of novel that speaks of everyone in a different way and what you take away from it will no doubt be very different than what I or literary critics have noted over time. Researching a few scholarly critiques might help, too, though.For me, at least, that's all I needed. The first time I read this book I thought it was pretty and well written, but I had no understanding of the plot or how the narrative flow was working. I don't even think I realized that the point of view switched several times. If you're having trouble, just put a tiny bit of effort into it and start over. You will be sooo happy you did because this is literature at its ground-breaking best.~Once You've Finished The Novel~And once you've finished and are so amazed and enlightened, you'll no doubt want to experience more Mrs. Dalloway brilliance. Fortunately, Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize winning novelThe Hoursuses biographical information about Virginia Woolf along with many themes and ideas from the novel and turns it into a modern masterpiece. It is a must-must-must-must-must read, but I would definitely wait until you read Mrs. Dalloway first.If you have any other questions while reading Mrs. Dalloway feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to help out as much as I can!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"MRS. DALLOWAY isn't a very easy book to read, but it's ultimately well worth the time and effort you'll spend wading through its almost primordial verbiage.Virginia Woolf was attempting something that hadn't really been done before when she wrote this vastly internal day-in-the-life study of a sickly, changeable woman whose preeminent skills are throwing parties and being \`Mrs. Dalloway.' Woolf wasn't overly fond of how James Joyce had executed his day-in-the-life tour de force, ULYSSES, so she decided to write her own, carving out in MRS. DALLOWAY a new paradigm for writing about the inner workings of mind and heart. For the most part, Woolf succeeds admirably in her journey through this literary terra nova.MRS. DALLOWAY can be confounding and at times overtiring (it'll definitely make you want to read something \\"light\\" next) but it does cause you to have a genuine and unique human experience, which is really the reason we bother reading in the first place.And if this one leaves you hungry for more, make sure to read Michael Cunningham's beautifully written but considerably-easier-to-read sequel/remake, THE HOURS (after spending some well earned-time poolside with your favorite summer page-turner)."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This book is fabulous. The way it portrays time passing is incredible, you feel as if you are experiencing a day in London after the first World War. The way Woolf shifts the narrative from one person to the next is done very well. The book is very short in length, and is easier to read than Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and is much shorter than Remembrances of Things Past, so thus would be a nice introduction to stream of consciousness writing."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I just finished this one, and I *think* I know what Woolf was getting at. It's about life and death, getting older, and the invisible threads that connect all of us. It's about wondering what the meaning of one's life is, trying to carve out meaning for yourself. It's about conversion v. rebellion, and which leads to the ultimate happiness. I enjoyed certain passages, but found this book more difficult than any of her others that I have read. I much prefer TO THE LIGHTHOUSE to MRS. DALLOWAY. But I gave it four stars out of respect for Woolf's beautiful prose and sheer genius."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"like many people i got to this book after seeing and later on reading &quot;the hours&quot;. i was pretty indimedated at first, knowing that this is almost a mythologicly difficult book to read, but i have to say that once opening this book, i could barely put it down, it draws you in from the first second and stays with you trough, as it leads you through a soul search and revelation.this is a story of several charecter throughout one day, which tend to be a day in which all either have importent disocveries or life changes events. it talks about a lot of big issues, such as the world war, classes in england, madness, womanhood and masculinty and how we iteract with those turms, the obligation to oneself Vs. the obligation to societly, old age and growing up and so on. it's amazing to see how all dilemas those are delt with without loosing the tread of the story and the events of the day.personaly, the most interesting parts for me were the one duelt with spesimus, a young PTSD soldier who's gettingmore and more ill as the day advance, verginia woolf's own experience with deppression and madness deffenetly shows in this book, it made me realate to the book very emotionaly from that angle.stream of consciusness type of writing's offen very confusing and demanding, and while in other books i couln't quite relate to it, in this book, i think i finelly got the idea behind it. it's a very deep book, one of the greatest books of modern times for sure."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I first read Mrs. Dalloway in high school. It was the first Woolf that I ever attempted to read. I have a very clear memory of literally wrestling with the text one night while I was babysitting. I made notes in the margins and kept lists and tried all kinds of ways to figure out what Woolf was doing and what she was saying. It was frustrating, because she is such a beautiful writer that I really wanted to understand it more than I did.Over the years since that time, I have read a number of other Woolf novels, and loved them. I have always been a little bit nervous about going back to Mrs. Dalloway. I had some time recently, so I finally decided to give it a go.I am not sure if the difference is age, or familiarity with her prose, but I had no trace of the same difficulty that I had experienced 20 years ago. If you let go and simply enjoy the writing, then the book is just lovely and stunningly clear.Some people kill themselves. Other people survive and give parties. Both choices carry with them their own moral consequences. The world is beautiful, and full of flowers, but also and impossibly full of separation and isolation. I think that part of the difference in understanding is truly age. At 16 I could (dimly) understand Septimus and the young Sally. But I had no perspective to understand Clarissa Dalloway herself. It had not occurred to me yet that living to give parties is also a choice, and one as awful in its own way as the option Septimus takes.It has been suggested that this book makes a good companion to reading or screening The Hours. I second that notion. I actually think that it particularly illuminates the film, but it goes well with both if you have not read it. I suppose that it goes without saying that this is not the place that I would recommend beginning with Virginia Woolf. But then again, you never know. It is such a lovely work and there are bound to be people who are more successful than I was reading it the first time around."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I first read Mrs. Dalloway in 1961. Over the years I have re-read this classic novel more than a dozen times, always with intense pleasure. After her first two less successful attempts at fiction writing, Virginia Woolf surpises us here with a masterful display of her genius.There is barely a story, or a plot here. Even characterization is minimal. Yet the powerful description of the tumult in a human soul during the course of a single day leaves the reader begging for more. Woolf unlike Marcel Proust did not attempt to resurrect the past. Unlike Joyce, she did not try to push tbe use of the stream of consciousnes technique to its limits. Her technique is her own. It allows her to give her readers insightful glimpses into Clarisa's joys and fears, her constant expectation of ecstasy and awareness of the abysses that surround her.It is a masterpiece that should be enjoyed at the right time and when you are in the right mood."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I suppose there are two types of people in this world: those who appreciate VW's work and those who feel her words were best left within her own mind. I fall into the second category.I bought and read this book as a precursor to &quot;The Hours.&quot; While I would highly recommend reading this book before &quot;The Hours&quot; I will also admit that I found it difficult to get through and dull as old rain water.I think what bothered me the most was the stream of consciousness writing. It's hard to really follow where VW was taking this story, and well, exactly WHY. Also, there are no chapters, and I personally find that a more difficult read. On top of these things, VW switches from one character's perception to another, leaving the reader wondering just who is doing what and necessitating a re-read to figure out just what happened to the character one was reading about and who this new character is.The weird thing to me was, it seemed as though one could almost feel/read the disorganization and distortion that was perhaps VW's mental illness.I know there are many books which have been deemed &quot;classic&quot; by some literary force but which people in modern day can't figure out exactly why. This is one of those books. It's reputation does not live up to its actuality. If you plan on reading &quot;The Hours&quot; this book should precede it. Otherwise, find something more engaging."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Like James Joyce's Ulysses, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway cuts out one day, June 13, 1923, from lives of London upper-class housewife Clarissa Dalloway and her family members, friends, and acquaintances. With detailed descriptions of incidents, memories, and streams of consciousness, readers go through the characters' almost lifelong experiences. Woolf's writing, which appears to be improvised in the automatic writing, freely jumps from one person's perspective to another's, or from a description of an incident's surface to a description of a person's subconscious thought. These components organically form a mosaic of various people's lives.Most characters are in their fifties, cling to their memories, and have some form of anxieties to feel that their lives have failed in one way or another. Because of that, the novel may be more appreciated by readers who have a certain amount of life experiences, or who are aware of how their lives ahead will look like and what they can do in order to make them better. Closing without a clear conclusion, the novel suggests continuation of life; also the readers may feel that they can take what they learn from the reading into their own lives."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is a great edition for anyone who has never read Virginia Woolf before. There is enough biographical information included at the beginning of the book to give any reader a good idea of Woolf's background before they proceed to the actual novel. It was very helpful for me as it was my first exposure to Woolf.The novel itself is very interesting and the notations were quite helpful to keep the events and places throughout the novel straight."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is a spellweaver of a book, slipping lucidly from minute to minute over the course of a perfect London summer's day, its gossamer threads forming an expanding web as complex and interconnected as a symphony. I came to it after readingTO THE LIGHTHOUSE, written two years later (1925 and 1927). Both books are set in summer, and both are confined to a single physical setting. But whereas the house and garden in TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, nominally in Scotland, might almost be anywhere, London is a real and precise presence in MRS DALLOWAY, lovingly described over a range of several miles. The later book, though concentrating on two specific days, has a span of almost a decade; MRS DALLOWAY follows the classical unity of time, starting in the early morning and continuing until night in a single unbroken span (a precedent perhaps imitated by Ian McEwan in hisSATURDAY). Conversely, while TO THE LIGHTHOUSE confines itself to about a dozen characters, MRS DALLOWAY moves in ever-expanding ripples, adding more and more people as guests arrive for Clarissa Dalloway's party in the book's concluding scene.The hours of the day are marked by the sound of Big Ben: \\"First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air.\\" The image of expanding and dissipating circles is central; as in TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, Woolf is preoccupied with the passage of time; both books are a memento mori. But neither one is grim; there is a summer freshness here, a feeling for the charm of society life in a great city, that fits the preliminary musical chimes of the great clock -- but the irrevocable toll of time is not forgotten. We see Clarissa Dalloway, a little over fifty, wife of a respected politician with an assured place in society. Like the sound of the clock, like ripples on the water, her circles have also expanded since her marriage, but have they also dissipated, dissolved in the air? Near the beginning of the book, she is visited by Peter Walsh, a former suitor whom she refused some thirty years before, now back home after many years in India. Both of them have changed, but the memories take her back and force her to weigh and reweigh her concepts of success and happiness.All the characters in the novel are known personally to Clarissa Dalloway, with the exception of only two: Septimus Warren Smith and his Italian wife Lucrezia, whose story, weaving in and out of the main one, takes up about a fifth of the whole. Septimus, a clerk by profession but something of a poet and aesthete, has returned from the war unable to feel. When his best friend is killed in the last days of the war, he congratulates himself on surviving without cracking up, but soon begins to recognize his lack of emotion for the curse that it is; he married Lucrezia largely in an attempt to overcome this. He must be one of the first victims of shell-shock to appear in literature (but not the last: see Pat Barker's magnificentREGENERATIONand, in a lighter vein, all of Jacqueline Winspear'sMAISIE DOBBSseries). Virtually everything in Woolf's mature novels is connected primarily by thought rather than through action, but this takes the principle even farther, linking Septimus to Clarissa in theme only, as her Doppelg&auml;nger; the author admitted as much in a later preface. In some ways they are opposites: Clarissa so full of life, a society hostess married to an establishment figure; and Septimus, potentially suicidal (like Woolf herself), a provincial nobody married to the daughter of a foreign innkeeper. And yet, for all his inability to feel, there is an immediacy to the scenes between Septimus and Lucrezia, whose lives are played out in emotional primary colors, whereas Clarissa's world, for all its brilliance, is in iridescent shimmers and half-tones.And what of Mr. Richard Dalloway, MP? We see surprisingly little of him, but what we do see only emphasizes the theme of lost feeling that runs through the book. Something makes him realize that it has been years since he has told his wife of his love. So he buys a great bunch of flowers and we see him \\"walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words that he loved her.\\" The phrase is repeated again and again. When he does get home, the scene does not go quite like that, but it is a touching one all the same. For Richard is one of those Englishmen who can only show their feelings obliquely. Poor Peter Walsh, on the other hand, who weeps openly and is an emotional wreck, is considered a failure, \\"not quite the thing.\\" And Clarissa, still precariously aware of both sides of her nature, must steer her way between the two. And we rejoice that she can."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I re-read this novel that I remembered enjoying when I read it in high school because a quote from it (\\"roses were the only flower she could bear to see cut\\") was pivotal in Gregoire Bouillier's fascinating short memoir THE MYSTERY GUEST. Bouillier's debt to Woolf is broader and deeper than just a stolen phrase. Both books center around the anticipation of a party in contrast with the reality of its experience as it unfolds; and both share themes of the cruelty and triviality of human nature. Compared to other stream of conscious masterpieces (Joyce's ULYSSES or Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY), Dalloway is relatively easy to follow. I found it's structure and execution to be rather cinematice. The story is bookended with sections focusing on the title character. In the large middle section the narrative passes seamlessly from one secondary character to another like a baton in a (leisurely) relay race. The trick is to anticipate that the baton will be passed and that the point of view and pronominal references are going to shift. I put an \\"x\\" in the margin each time I observed the baton being passed (these would probably be chapter breaks in more conventional novels). I found this to be helpful when I needed to reread a section to refresh my memory on a detail. What is amazing is that Woolfe employs an objective third person narration throughout, and yet each section strongly projects the obsessions and interests of the character that has been brought into the foreground. The prose is fluid, beautiful, and free of gimmickry. The author, like Clarissa Dalloway, is in complete control of all she surveys, a master manipulator. In the end, this seems to me to be a novel about accepting (or resisting) at middle age the compromises one has made in life. And \\"the ladies,\\" indeed, \\"come and go, speaking of Michelangelo.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I just finished reading Mrs. Dalloway for the second time. The first time I read it years ago (as so many seem to have done) when The Hours came out. At that time, I found it interesting, though not easy-going reading. Now I read it for a class and enjoyed it even more having learned a bit more about Woolf and her life and her theories of literature.Mrs. Dalloway is Woolf's attempt to get beneath the surfaces of human beings, to show all the emotions and thoughts that go one in peoples' minds even on the most ordinary of days and while they are involved in the most mundane of tasks. Each life becomes a complex, beautiful thing when examined in this life.Woolf also said she was trying to show the sane and the insane side by side in this novel which, comparing the characters of Mrs. Dalloway and the shell-shocked Septimus Smith--the two have much in common despite the great differences in their lives and ways.The book is worth reading for the insight Woolf provides into the human condition and for the poetry of language with which she expresses it. Having read Jacob's Room just prior to this book (and which she wrote just prior to this one) it's possible to see how Woolf progressed as a writer and as a stylist. Next on the list is \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" which, I'm told, shows Woolf even more at the top of her form. Can't wait."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"If any book has made more an impact on my life, it is this one. That it is short and modern takes nothing away from its gravity. That its subject is a middle-aged, upperclass woman planning a party on one June day says nothing about its universality. It is the transcendence of the individual that makes this novel stand out and timeless.The book is more than the sum of its parts, but it is surely the particular parts that are worth relishing. Woolf weaves her narrative through multiple characters, each well-crafted and authentic: the housewife imprisoned by her expectations and nostalgia; the former lover who justifies life in pursuing the unattainable; the idealistic writer who declaims injustice in the dark corners of his apartment and mind. What is more amazing than these characters is that they are all connected. Despite their differences, you have a growing recognition of how similar they are to each other, and in a subconscious way, they do themselves. The beauty of individual transcendence is captured in many of the fleeting moments, such as a falling leaf as seen by multiple people, where the thought at times cannot be attributed to any one person.Ultimately, this is a book of survival and triumph, although in the mundane and quiet. There are no heroes or rascals but complex, multi-dimensional figures that we can identify with--and in that sense it is one of the most realistic novels that exist."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is perhaps my favorite novel.

Her characters reveal how the world really is for so many..we have so many thoughts but are unable to fully communicate it all.

I didn't expect this book to be such a difficult read and contemplated stopping many times. However, i pressed on and am glad i did.Virginia Woolf writes about several different characters; all on the same day which leads to Clarissa Dalloway's party that evening. What made this such a hard read for me was that Woolf would jump from one character to another and I wouldn't know who she was speaking of.This story talks of the customs of these character who live in England, and also has some flashbacks into their past. There was one total shock in this book, which was when Woolf wrote of Clarissa and her friend Sally share a pretty passionate kiss.Although it was a difficult read, Woolf was right on track, and some of her themes in this book hold true in today's society!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read this book for it is a required text.

I kept losing track of which character was musing about nothing. The book just does not make any sense. After 65 pages I still could not discern the point of anything I'd read.I suppose Woolf is considered a genius since she was apparently a cavalier writer of her generation, but I'm grateful that contemporary writers can at least string together 2 sentences that follow one another in a logical sequence.I tried, I really did; My suggestion: just watch The Hours - you'll get all the beauty and none of the confusion."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"The only good thing to say about this \\"literary\\" drivel is that the person responsible, Virginia Wolf, has been dead for quite some time now.

But once I finally got into it -- I had to have NO distractions to read this book -- I found it interesting and poignant. I found the characters fascinating, even in their shallowness, or perhaps because of their shallowness. I was particularly struck by Richard Dalloway's resolve to tell his wife that he loved her, then his failure to do so, but they both understood the feelings were there. It seemed this was a scene played out over and over again, a sad but true fact of their domestic life together. Miss Kilman was also a pitiable but interesting character. I do wish the daughter, Elizabeth, could have been fleshed out more, and the connection between Mrs. Dalloway and Septimus made stronger.

I came to this book after reading Michael Cunningham's, &quot;The Hours,&quot; which I really loved, and then found Woolf's to be a real disappointment. I find it a challenge to follow Woolf's stream-of-consciousness prose and because her plots are rather mundane (about average people in fairly average circumstances) She bores me. I recognize the 'greatness' that is Virginia Woolf, and perhaps others would think me a philistine because I cannot wax eloquent about her ability to capture whatever it is about people that reviewers find so captivating. Perhaps I find that I simply can't identify with any of the characters in her books and therefore have a hard time getting excited about what they are thinking and feeling, let alone doing. Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa, is presented in this book as the protagonist in the description of one day (in her life). The secondary characters, her husband, her sister and nieces and nephews, an old flame, and a horribly mad young man and his confused wife, are of limited interest as well. In any case, Woolf just is not for me...

There are a few stories within Mrs. Dalloway, but there is not a great story. A problem for me with stream of consciousness is that it is an effort to express in language that which is often not expressed in words, i.e., thoughts and feelings as they stream through consciousness. Music may be the best, and painting may be a better, medium for representing transitory feelings.I liked this style of writing much better when I was in my teens and twenties. Now, I would prefer a good story with intellectual & psychological depth. I haven't done the research to do more than speculate, but I do speculate that stream of consciousness writing was so popular post WWI because so much of traditional values was cast to the winds and psychology had arisen as a source of wisdom and answers in a world which intellectuals, writers & artists had lost faith in tradition.Bringing Progress to Paradise: What I Got from Giving to a Mountain Village in NepalNepal Himalayas -- In the MomentIslands in My Dreams"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is not quite what I was expecting. It was so short and beautiful, and yes it was very stream of conscious, and it definitely helped that I had read and seen The Hours, which is based on Mrs. Dalloway. There are some things that I probably would have missed if I hadn't had a basic knowledge of the plot, because many things are carefully veiled beneath Woolf's beautiful language. There were times when I got lost in the prose, but at the very least it was always beautiful to read. She had such a wonderful eye for things and her descriptions are really unlike anything I've ever read before. I loved this novel and I'm sure that I will be reading it again one day."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"It is only a single London day in June, 1923, after World War I, and Mrs. Dalloway is out shopping for flowers for her big party to be given that evening. Even the Prime Minister will be coming because Clarissa Dalloway's husband, Richard, is a minor cog in the government. Virginia Woolf was originally going to call her breakthrough novel The Hours, a title Michael Cunningham used in his tribute novel to Mrs. Dalloway. The pealing of Big Ben and other chimes striking the hours segue this chapterless novel into different character spheres, different memories or thoughts. Big Ben's leaden circles of sound move out, widen, and wrap other characters into the narrative.Using James Joyce's then-new technique of stream of consciousness, Woolf explores the minds of a number of her characters. Clarissa's character is probed in great detail, not only as she sees herself but also as many other characters see her.Septimus Smith is wandering around London that June day, a veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, what was then called being shell-shocked. Though they pass close by each other, Septimus and Clarissa never meet. When she hears word of this stranger's suicide through a famous doctor at the party, it has a profound effect upon her. Septimus is probably closer in his mental state to Virginia Woolf herself than to Clarissa Dalloway, but the ripples of meaning, like the reverberations of the chiming, caused by his death make her neglect her party. Clarissa, who seemed so unfeeling and superficial, turns out to have too much feeling.This is not easy reading. Woolf wrote many essays and portions of this book are more essayistic than fictional narrative.The story has a fluidity as one character's life and mind blends and segues into another. One character after another takes center stage in the narrative. Peter Walsh, Clarissa's old beau, passes Septimus in Regents Park, and the narrative passes from Septimus to Peter in the way that a baton would be passed in a relay race.In the party scene I was reminded of Joyce's \\"The Dead\\" in Dubliners. Mrs. Dalloway is a richly textured book that can be reread many times. At different stages of the reader's life it will take on new meanings. Clarissa Dalloway is like a chameleon that you can never truly pin down."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway was the first peice of modernist literature I had ever read. The overall book, as most modernism novels are, was some-what confusing. Many times I would sit reading the book and know someone was narrating, then a second later someone else was narrating without me noticing the switch. At first this annoyed me, but then I realized that this was what made Virginia Woolfe such a magnificent writer. Her talent to switch from one persons thoughts to another's seamlessly is reamrkable. Though, the swithching of the plot and people's thoughts so seamlessly also leads to confusing moments in the book where you aren't quite sure where you are."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Such a beautiful book.

The delightful style encompasses something I never encountered before in literature. Virginia Woolf exibits two distinct voices: one almost flippant, and one rich, plunging into the depths of a woman's soul. Woolf allows Mrs. Dalloway (the clever title says it all about her identity) to portray the societal role that an early twentieth century Mrs. must fulfill, and the inner voice of strength that Clarissa Dalloway must have.

Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Septimus Smith sees it too and believes the message, whatever it is, meant for him. He is shell shocked from the war and suffers from mental problems and at times experiences a mystical ecstasy. He receives messages from the dead and writes them down on pieces of paper like \\"Universal love: the meaning of the world\\" Septimus hears sparrows singing in the trees in greek and everything has meaning for him. \\"Sounds made harmonies with premeditation; the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds. A child cried. Rightly far away a horn sounded. All taken together meant the birth of a new religion.'' Clarissa who is a kind of doppelganger to Septimus feels and sees beauty deeply and has the ability to live very intensely in the present moment appreciating whatever life brings. \\"What she loved was this, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab.'' \\"she loved; life; London; this moment of June.\\" As the plane loops inditing an unknown message and Big Ben strikes the hours other lives brush against Clarissa on this day in June. Peter Walsh who she had spurned years ago is back from India and her friend Sally Seton shows up at her party as the past bleeds into the present. Miss Kilman is Clarissa's daughter's angry teacher and Sir William Bradshaw is a renowned London psychiatrist who sees Septimus Smith. Miss Kilman dreams of felling Clarissa in the name of religion, and Sir William would like to subdue all those who challenge his conception of the world. Both wish to convert the world to their belief systems in order to gain power and dominate others. In fact as the pressures of mental conformity close in on Septimus he decides on suicide even though he thought \\"Every power poured its treasures on his head\\" and that \\"Life was good\\" he could not fit in the mental box of societal expectations. Clarissa at the party in her silver-green mermaid's dress hears news of this and thinks of the brevity of life and can see death at the end of it all \\"even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is one of the great novels of the twentieth century; truly innovative and heart-breaking.

It seems that everyone loves Virginia Woolf at my school and Mrs. Dalloway was assigned reading in one of our classes. I really enjoyed some of Woolf's use of language and imagery, but a lot of her writing also seems forced, contrived, and boring -- all of which negate the point of reading it in the first place (other than avoiding an 'F' on the test). I guess what I'm trying to say is, you'll love Woolf if she's your style, and you'll probably hate her writing if you can't (or don't want to) follow her extended, cumbersome metaphors. I suppose she's a groundbreaking writer, but I also think I've turned into one of those people who secretly find Woolf a total bore but don't express this opinion aloud because a lot of supposedly smart people will tell you something is wrong with you.

The novel is so complex and challenging that although I enjoyed it immesly the first time- the second and third I was able to associate the deeper meanings and appreciate the artistic, innovative writting style.The first book I had read by this author (To the Lighthouse) left me much dissapointed with Ms. Woolfe. But I started to read 'The Hours' (which you must read if you have read this!) and found to best appreciate that book, I had to read this one first. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a unique and touching novel. I related to it on so many different levels; to so many different characters. Being a woman, I empathized with the struggle of Clarissa in her day of preparation and understood the insecurities she may have felt with her life choices but never would display to others.The authors clever writting style and literary genius was evident in this novel. I know there may be many that don't appreciate Ms. Woolfe's talent= but if nothing else one must ascede that her manipulation of language is extraordinary. Ms. Dalloway is almost sung off the pages of the book, I felt like I was getting a buetiful renoir painted before my eyes when reading. I admit, that it is a book best enjoyed upon re-reading but it is so worth the investment! After this, I am excited to go back and read the dreaded 'To the Lighthouse' and maybe find somethings with in that I may have missed.

After reading 6 of her novels (Jacob's Room, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, Between the Acts, The Years, and Orlando) and two essays (A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas) I decided to try one of her most celebrated novels (if it weren't celebrated, then why write a parallel novel or direct a movie based on the aforementioned novel or even attempt at making a cinematic adaptation of Mrs. Dalloway in the first place?), and needless to say, her most celebrated work added one more book to the list of books I will never read again. I had heard from a great number of \\"literate\\" people that she is an acquired taste; that reader's will need an ear for poetry to have a richer appreciation for her prose. I sadly do not have an ear for poetry, and I, obviously, have the foul taste of Woolf in my mouth. Her prose is difficult- and that's putting it mildly. Mrs. Dalloway is no exception. At times I had no idea who was narrating, sentences can go on for paragraphs at a stretch with little meaning to them.I must say this edition (the latest from Hartcourt; the annotated edition) is particularly fine. The notes aide readers- both scholarly and passive- how to acquire a better taste from Virginia Woolf. It details a number of Wollf's allusions, places the novel in a historical timeframe, and provides insight into Woolf's psyche. I recommend getting this edition over any other editions based on the extensive notes."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read this novel as a prelude to Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot; knowing it was homage to Virginia Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Reading Woolf took me back to my high school days when reading classic literature was a requirement. I am certainly glad I did not have to take an exam on this book. Call me a contemporary book snob, but I found Woolf's stream of consciousness writing style (some sentences often take up nearly a page) unbearable at times. Perhaps I am just a victim of a poor attention span as well. I think I would be &quot;getting it&quot; as I began reading a passage from &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; only to scratch my head wondering what was going on and even who was narrating as I put down the book for the evening.Nevertheless, I do realize and respect this novel's place in literature. It certainly has literary merit as Woolf's use of language is quite beautiful and stunning at times. Likewise, it must have been groundbreaking back in the 1920s in regards to its concept (a single day in the life of a London wife) and themes (the mental anguish of the title character, particularly her lingering love for a girl she shared a single kiss with in her youth).Am I sorry I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;? No, it certainly made &quot;The Hours&quot; a much richer reading experience. For those who plan on reading Cunningham's contemporty spin, I would cautiously recommend a stab at &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Overall, though, I have to say Woolf was just simply not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Clarissa Dalloway plans a party for her high society friends in London just after the First World War. Some friends attend and Clarissa may or may not have gained some self-insight. That basically is the plot of CLARISSA DALLOWAY. But Virginia Woolf took this marginal sequence of events and created not just one but two separate and overlapping universes with it. To do this, Woolf avoided the conventional linear approach to fiction that had characterized novel writing until the jangling horrors of the War caused a number of very intellectual minds to suddenly pay some serious attention to the pioneering books of Freud and Jung with the result that the inner recesses of the mind opened up a brand new way to think, to perceive, and as a result to write. Woolf, of course, was not the first fiction writer to do this. James Joyce did much the same with his ULYSSES, but Woolf in her more controlled way of keeping straight in the reader's mind who was doing what improved on this free associational way to write so that readers could follow the Byzantine labyrinth of Clarissa's synaptic pathways and experience in real time what she does.Clarissa is a middle-aged woman who obsesses over the past. When a passionate lover offered her marriage years ago, she turned him down for the predictable dullness of another. When Clarissa had the opportunity to have a lesbian affair when she was a teenager, she turned that down too. Her life has been pretty much the same, and now at fifty-two, she pauses to wonder--perhaps not too deeply--whether the fault may be hers. Is she inherently sterile? Clarissa does not possess the needed objectivity to get too close but the reader certainly does. Clarissa has spent a lifetime perfecting the fine art of erecting insurmountable walls around herself that no one even knows are there. Perhaps part of the reason is that she has bought into the pre-Victorian world life of servants, massive formal parties, and a life spent in a hurry going nowhere. Clarissa is not an evil woman, nor does she maliciously plot against others, but she is lacking the emotional spark of life that might infuse her soul with meaning. At her parties, which she plans with a vengeance, she is articulate and vivacious, both qualities which hide her essential internal fears rather than emphasize her non-existent external charm. Connection is beyond her.While Clarissa occupies her universe of stasis, Woolf creates an adjacent universe of angst, separated from each other by a spatial and temporal bag of literary tricks that Woolf uses with masterly skill. Occupying this other world is Septimus Warren Smith, a survivor of the War but only in a physical sense. Inside he is a wreck, emptied of human feeling, unable to communicate with his new wife, and crying out loudly and plainly that he wants only to die. He never meets Clarissa though he is invited to her party. What they share are their private worlds of pain that connect to the reader if not to each other. They both hear the tolling of Big Ben, and they link, not solid as in a chain but metaphorically as in a dream. His death by suicide does not close his universe totally; a bit of it remains within Clarissa as she hears ever so briefly of it, almost as if in passing. His death lets her know that her life was very nearly as sterile as his was; at least it would if she were more perceptive, but she is not and that is the true tragedy of Clarissa. Sometimes one has to die just to give another a chance at life. Virginia Woolf says this better than anyone else has."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Many of the reviewers here have said that this is a difficult book to read. I will not argue with them, because at first the book can be hard to get into. But when you do, it doesn't matter how convoluted, how brisk, how vague the sentence or page may be, you know it matters. There is a connection that Woolf achieves between her characters that is ultimately and beautifully real.

When I visited my local book exchange in search of a second-hand copy, I was chided by the proprietor for succumbing to popular culture. The book was no longer in stock, but I was assured that prior to the release of \\"The Hours\\", Mrs Dalloway had long sat unloved and forgotten on the shelf. Now, having read it, I know why Mrs Dalloway is so unpopular most of the time.This book is a challenging, and at times confusing read!But is \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" an historical curiosity, or a timeless masterpiece? My vote goes with \\"timeless masterpiece\\" (and that's having perservered with the book through several episodes of wanting to put it down and forget about it).I believe that Woolf exhibited ground-breaking style in \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". But I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling relief that her style isn't widely emulated today. I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I opened \\"Mrs Dalloway\\", so the style (multiple streams of consciousness) came as something of a shock to me. Creating social commentary out of streams of consciousness must be the *ultimate* form of \\"showing, not telling\\". Woolf doesn't tell us how it is ... she lets us take a peek and see for ourselves. This book is dense with insight.Indeed, I found Woolf's social commentary, expressed by a somewhat bewildering array of characters, to be painfully accurate and timeless, but certainly not heart-warming.The story itself is dated as a direct result of rich detail (we encounter glove shops, parisols, painful formality, and colonialism - the Indians, for example, are \\"coolies\\").I can't resist adding that, in light of all that painful formality, I was more than a little bit surprised to find a homosexual encounter described as \\"the most exquisite moment of [Clarissa's] whole life\\" (p.34).Woolf beat Madonna onto the lesbian pop-culture bandwagon by several decades! (Although I suspect Woolf's motives were somewhat more sincere than Madonna's).Nevertheless, it took me a long time to warm to \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". It wasn't until I got to the description of the \\"ugly, clumsy, odious\\" Doris Kilman (\\"whom Heaven knows Clarissa would have liked to help\\") on p.127 that Woolf totally won me over. Woolf depicts the life of an unloved woman with devastating acidity.

Meanwhile, she and other characters, like her rejected suitor, Peter Walsh, her well-meaning husband, Richard, her emotionally-distant daughter, Elizabeth, a mentally ill war veteran, Septimus Warren Smith, and many others go about their life while reflecting on the past, the present, the future, and how they all perpetually connect.Mrs. Dalloway is a wonderfully intricate book, full of so many symbols and underlying meanings that it becomes obvious from the very beginning that this is more than a story about a dinner party. Of course, in a sense, it really is just a story about a dinner party, and such in-depth feelings and events that are unfolding around and within the characters are to be expected whenever so many different people are brought together, both physically and, in some cases, emotionally. Woolf just draws specific attention to these universal and timeless events and relationships, and then leaves it up to the reader to further dwell on their significance. These characters may be living in a different time than us, as is evident to some degree by their strict formality and unique social customs, but beneath the surface, the sensations they feel, like loneliness, jealousy, and passion, show that they are really no different than us.However, as with any book by Virginia Woolf, I would not recommend it to someone looking for an easy read who isn't willing to spend time reflecting on its themes and complexities. Her stream-of-consciousness writing, which I loved because of how it immersed me in the immediate personal thoughts of the characters, could also be confusing to follow at times as Woolf weaves her way back and forth across her detailed timeline.

But the absence of any plot structure leaves the reader not particularly caring how the party turns out, or what these generally boring people are thinking about.I feel stupid for admitting this, but my honest reaction to this book was: &quot;Huh?&quot;"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read this book several years ago on a whim. Now, a junior in college, I've just finished reading it for a Virginia Woolf seminar course. It's much better the second time around; the deft characterization and swiftly moving prose transport one into the different mindsets presented throughout. This is almost &quot;Ulysses&quot; light; Woolf's stream-of-consciousness in a day is much more palatable than Joyce's monstrosity. Which is not to say that &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is simplistic; it is one of the more challenging--and worthwhile--novels I've read in some time.Woolf's use of Septimus as her alter ego is a very bold literary move; most would assume that Clarissa is, in fact, a representation of Woolf. Instead, it is the shellshocked, suicidal, conflicted Septimus, a victim of World War I, who spends a good portion of his page time seeing his dead friend Evans. Septimus shoulders the blame for Evans' death, and Septimus imagines that he is on trial, oftentimes muttering about his &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;guilt.&quot; His only escape is suicide. He is the only character whom Clarissa does not meet; this furthers the story and will perhaps muddle the novel for some.Clarissa herself goes through her day in the life preparing for a party, running into old friends and remembering old ghosts. The fact that she is an unhappy housewife questioning her choices makes the novel and the ultimate resolution all that more emotional and impactful.This is one of the most overlooked books in America today; it is a work of genius from an author whose talent is terribly underrated. This is the American, feminine, and more realistic &quot;Ulysses;&quot; a treasure that has gone unnoticed for too long.

While some people may feel like they are drowning in all the detail, for me it was like pulling a blanket over my head with a flashlight and tucking myself away from the world for a total &quot;immersion&quot; reading experience. The way in which the lives mirror and oppose each other was an intricate balancing act that holds your attention until the end, when they touch each other, yet never collide.I was also interested in the frequent mentioning and comparisons using flowers, and researched Victorian Flower symbolism and was surprised at the interesting interpretations this posed.This is a classic look at the talent and abilities of Virginia Woolf."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Ahh... Mrs. Dalloway. Such a compelling title for what must certainly be a compelling book. I mean, how can a book averaging four stars, and written by the incomparable Virginia Woolf, be anything but spectacular? I'll tell you how. Because it's a mind-numbingly depressing piece that feels like it was written by a schizophrenic monkey on valium.Yes, that's right folks - a Virginia Woolf novel filled with boringly depressing characters who do little but sit around and think about death and lost moments of life (*audience gasps in disbelief*). I know. Shocking. Praise the book all you want, but it's a typical Woolf novel that feels like the angst-filled poetry of today's emo teenagers.So what happens in the book? Well, the \\"action\\" (heavy on the sarcasm) focuses on Clarissa Dalloway, who spends most of her time sitting on benches, looking at planes, and trying to commit suicide by sawing through her wrists with a comb... No wait, that last one was me, after reading about half of this novel. Sadly, I failed, but I did succeed in giving myself a mild concussion after banging my head against the back of my chair for half an hour. Anyways, Clarissa decides to throw a party, and that's when the action really takes off! Either that, or all the characters stand in corners staring at a wall and thinking about how they should've loved their puppy more when they were 6... I really don't remember (see above mentioned concussion).In general, Virigina Woolf is a ridiculously over-rated author. It drives me nuts to hear elitist snobs approach literary orgasm whenever she is brought up in conversation. And anyone who does not like Woolf's writing is immediately decried as either too stupid to understand it, too lazy to spend the time deciphering her inane babble, or a punk college kid who just didn't want to read his assignment. A rather narrow view, indeed. There is room for disagreement here, folks.So why the two stars? Well, I rated \\"To the Lighthouse\\" 1 star, and it just didn't seem fair to place this one on the same level as that disaster.In closing, Virginia Woolf sucks. No, seriously. She's awful. Don't feel bad if you didn't like her books. It doesn't mean you're stupid. Many readers just ascribe to the Woolf camp to make themselves sound more intelligent. Even Woolf lovers don't understand what she was talking about, because really, it makes no sense. Take a look at the 5 star reviews here. Try to find one that doesn't use one of the following overly-used, meaningless cliches: \\"beautiful; timeless classic; stood the test of time; tortured artist; masterpiece of modernists prose; intimate look at life; you're shallow if you didn't like it\\". Now, if you look at the 1-stars, you'll see phrases like: \\"insane; meaningless; like eating gravel; overly-preachy; makes me want to bash myself in the head with a rock; glad she's dead\\". Which group do I find myself akin to? I think my review speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I would give the book 4 or 5 stars, but this Kindle edition barely rates 2.

It will not be the last. It's a &quot;small&quot; work by today's standards, a bit under 200 pages. Don't be deceived. Every page, every phrase evokes shimmering mental images of post-war England, and the people who live there. The use of language and of stream-of-consciousness narration is splendid.For readers new to stream-of-consciousness narration, a word of advice. Don't try to fit each sentence into a regular subject-verb-object mold. Just relax and drift along with the words. You're following a person's thoughts. It all makes sense in the end.A truly rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This complex book can be read on many levels, but it is enjoyable on all. On the surface, Clarissa Dalloway, the main character, comes off as a shallow, upper-class Londoner. However, Clarissa has an inner life rich with thought. She and the novel's other figures refuse to be classified or labelled. Like real people, they all have innner contradictions such as the outwardly Conservative Richard who has strangely Liberal views, or Septimus, the World War I &quot;hero&quot; who suffers from &quot;cowardly&quot; fits of tears and madness. Whether the reader sees Woolf primarily examining gender roles, politics, the effects of World War I and the British Empire on the English psyche, or the multiple complexities of human thought, this book will definitely satisfy connoissuers of the English novel."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I enjoyed some of the concepts that Virginia Woolf brought forth in her plot. I also her selection of word choices in conveying her message, that's what made it a powerful read. However, this was one of my least favorite books because of her chronic use of run-on sentences and poor transitions from one character to another. I realize that this is what makes Woolf unique (aka the \\"woolfian\\" sentence in modern literature derives its title from this structure), but it was confusing. While the story itself took place in one day, I think it took me one full day of reading and assistance from Sparknotes to interpret. Much more work than it was worth. If you need or want to read anything from Virginia Woolf, do not start with this book. Some of her other works would be suitable for the novice Woolf reader."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway doesn't make sense.

It was a struggle for these people to live and Mrs. Dalloway's life seems so empty. It is a classica novel. Although, it tends to talk more about one subject, and focuses on just one subject, it is still a good book to read. It is a short novel, but yet it has its hard parts to understand. Mrs. Dalloway could never do anything for herself until she has this party. She decides that she will buy everything necessary for the party, and here you start seeing a change in her life.

Unless your idea of excitement is attempting to immerse yourself in pretentious 20th century drivel about party planning, stay far away from this book. Far, far away.

Filled with run-on sentences and paced slower than a tortoise, this book is truly a chore to read. There is no point to this novel; it is simply an account of a day in the life of an airheaded wench and those who have been unfortunate enough to know her. There is no closure at the end, for there is no plot for which closure is needed. The characters are varied, but I really never became interested in any of them.

They say that Seinfeld was a tv show about nothing - well this book is full of sentences that are too long, characters that are never developed, and truly about nothing.

Since I have learned of Woolf's diagnosis of manic depression, I realize her style of writing proves that out. At times, you want to beg for periods,and finished thoughts. The characters are rich, though somewhat trite, with Septimus being the exception. I would recommend reading this and then the brilliant tribute novel, &quot;The Hours.&quot; Neither is quite complete without the other."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"If you read &quot;Mrs.Dalloway&quot; with an eye to plot it will be slow and its greatness will remain obscure.However, if a reader relaxes and lets herself enjoy the tender prose, and the emotional storm suffered by many characters(especially Septimus and his wife), Mrs. Dalloway will haunt the mind with its insights.Furthermore, reading &quot;Mrs.Dalloway&quot; is great preparation for its inspired (and there I say superior) contemporary sequel,&quot;The Hours.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I like the era it was set in.

Although the story plot doesn't lead to any big, dramatic revelations it's a great read for the ponderous individual."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"There is no doubt that Virginia Woolf was one of the most gifted writers of the twentieth century. Her novels, whether short or long, manage to examine some of the more hidden areas of humanity. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is no exception, even when the story is not just about its title character.The novel literally takes place over the course of one day, as Clarissa Dalloway prepares for and gives a dinner party; she is the perfect hostess, her mind driven more by social opinion than by her own thoughts. Yet as the story unfolds through an unseen narrator, readers can enter Clarissa's thoughts abuot the present and the past, as well as those of other characters, major and minor. Readers follow a young couple, Septimus and Rezia Smith, around London as the pair search for a doctor to heal Septimus, a war veteran with an off-kilter mindset. Thrown into the mix for short periods are Clarissa's husband, Richard, who tries to tell his wife how he really feels about her, and their daughter, Elizabeth, who couldn't be more unlike her mother if she tried. The other major player is Peter Walsh, Clarissa's old flame, who ran off to India when she turned him down, but is back now hoping for a job, for comfort, for...something he's not quite sure about.Woolf used an almost stream of consciousness style for this telling as the narrative shifts almost seamlessly between different characters and their thoughts. This helps to push the story onward but it can also make it difficult at times to tell which character is talking. Even though it all takes place in one day, Woolf manages to draw the reader back and forth through time, building up the characters' backgrounds in their remembrances. For such a short novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is a dense book, commenting upon various issues - societal, political, and economical. One almost feels the need to read it again, knowing that not everything was gleaned from one reading, but it would be a joy to read such a wonderful, effortless writer a second time around."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway takes place over the course of one day, starting with Clarissa Dalloway going to buy flowers for her party, and finishing at the end of the party late that night. Through this one day the reader is given a window into the life of Clarissa Dalloway, the central character, and to other characters that are connected to her in some way or another. We see Clarissa's marriage to her husband Robert, old suitors whom she rejected, friends from her childhood, and people she passes on the street. It does not have much of a plot, but is instead driven by vivid characterization and a dreamlike style. Mrs. Dalloway is the portrait of a woman, a flawed and human woman, and of the many people who orbit around her in one day,The first thing that really struck me about Mrs. Dalloway was the style, for which it is rightly famous. Like many of her modernist contemporaries, Woolf experimented with style, in this case using a stream-of-consciousness narrative that focuses on portraying the consciousness and thought patterns of her characters. Since people almost never think in logical or linear paths, the narrative wanders from subject to subject. The style matches these wandering thoughts perfectly, with the sentence lengths and amount of description changing to match the mood of the narrator. This style makes the characters thoughts feel incredibly real and honest, like you're looking through a window into each character's mind. The narrative moves seamlessly between characters, transitioning from one narrative perspective to another both smoothly and without warning, making it sometimes difficult to realize that it's happened until the end of a sentence or paragraph. While this can sometimes be confusing, it is a perfect way to transition from one person's experience to the next; it makes the book as a whole just as wandering and fluid as the individual narratives. It's things like that, the way that the larger and smaller structures reinforce each other and work together thematically, that make Woolf such a good writer, and make her books so effective.The stream-of-consciousness style and the free-indirect narrative mean that the characters in Mrs. Dalloway are incredibly rich and lifelike. Each time there is a change of narrator, the reader is given an entirely different perspective on the characters. When Clarissa is narrating, she seems like a reasonable and good person, and her decisions, actions, and estimations of the other characters make as much sense to the reader as they do to her. When the narrator changes to Peter Walsh, we see Clarissa in a different light, more silly and flawed. When Clarissa described her marriage early in the book, I was inclined to dislike her husband Richard, and Peter's opinion of him only supported those feelings. But during the brief section where Richard narrates, I saw him for what he was, not evil or cruel, but a well-meaning, flawed, and all-together too human man. Woolf's characterization, her ability to portray the feelings and motivations of characters so well that the reader understands and believes them, her insistence on making even her antagonists real people, is something that I found completely surprising and utterly pleasing.The style and characterization in Mrs. Dalloway are not just aesthetically pleasing and inherently interesting; like in any good novel, they also serve thematic purposes. Many of the characters in Mrs. Dalloway are detached or separated from the people around them. Clarissa is described as \\"cold\\" by a number of characters, and her marriage to Richard is a distant one. Peter Walsh just returned to England from a long stay in India, and is constantly reminded of how different the two places are, and how much people have changed, or not changed, since he left. Septimus Smith has shell shock from his time in the war, and is kept mentally distant from both his wife and from reality in general. The narrative voice compliments and draws attention to these many kinds of distance through the use of free indirect style. Rather than using \\"I\\" or \\"we\\" like in a first person narration, the novel is in the free indirect style, which is a special kind of limited third person narration. Rather than being an impartial narrator, in this style the third person narrator sees and describes things only how the character would see or describe them. This makes the narrator and the characters nearly indistinguishable, but still separates them through the use of third person pronouns. This narrative style allows Woolf to provide a rich and detailed portrait of the characters using stream-of-consciousness writing while still keeping the narrator detached from both the characters and the author. This separation between narrator, character, author, and reader matches the separation between the characters themselves, and puts the reader in the same situation as the characters.As much as this novel is a portrait of the distance between people, it is also a story of people trying to make connections. Clarissa's party is, above all else, her attempt to bring people together. Woolf's use of smooth transitions between characters, the repetition of ideas and places in the thoughts of different characters, and the lack of chapters and rarity of section breaks all endeavor to make connections between the wandering strands of narrative in the same way that the characters try to make connections with each other. The themes of this novel pull in two separate directions, pointing toward the loneliness of the modern world and the many ways in which people find connection. Woolf manages to incorporate both of those elements and, through her mastery of style, fuse them into a coherent and aesthetically pleasing whole.I feel like I should mention some of the problems that people have with Virginia Woolf. Many people find the fact that she only writes about upper-middle-class white people and completely ignores the existence of the working class and minorities to be problematic. I think that this is a valid critique not of any single novel, as no novel can have everything in it, but of her output as a whole, especially her nonfiction. In Mrs. Dalloway there is only one working-class character, Ms. Kilman, who is not portrayed in a good light even in her own narration. This erasure of the working class and minorities is a problem not just with Virginia Woolf, but with both literary Modernism and early feminism as a whole. I think it's important to interrogate the limitations of these works even as we enjoy the beauty and virtuosity of the writing. Another problematic element is the depiction of empire in Mrs. Dalloway, specifically the British colonization of India. I personally don't know what to make of this theme, which returns multiple times throughout the novel. Partially because of the free indirect style, I don't know where the characters' opinions on the matter stop and where Woolf's ideas and possible biases begin. I will have to read the novel a few more times before I can say anything conclusive about empire in Mrs. Dalloway, but I wanted to throw it out there as something to pay attention to if you are reading this yourself.Mrs. Dalloway is often hailed as one of the modern classics, and after reading it I can absolutely understand why. Woof's use of style and structure serve to paint a picture of a woman, a truly human woman, complete with flaws and strengths, full of new hopes and failed dreams, and to show the people who come into contact with her throughout the course of a day. Despite the high literary style, it feels honest and uncontrived. The characters feel familiar, like the people you meet every day, and the feelings and thoughts they have could very well be your own. It is a beautiful, luminous, haunting book that will only improve upon rereading. I had a lot of expectations going in to this reading, and I am happy to say that Mrs. Dalloway exceeded them all.Rating: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is, of course, a classic novel and a great read.

Regardless of the difficulties anyone may have with understanding its complexity, this novel communicates a message about things we all share and provides a commentary on all of our inner struggles with all of what we say, do not say, do and do not do.

This was a literary tool that was trademarked and used effectively by Virginia Woolf. Through this tool, the reader can draw many correlations between Virginia's life and Mrs. Dalloway. Mrs. Dallowway's marriage was one of respect rather than passion. Virginia's marriage to Leonard was a platonic relationship with no passionate love involved. This book also deals with sucide and it views it as a freedom from the strains of life. This is symbolic later in Virginia's life becuse she later committed sucide. Sucide in her mind was unleasing her from the mental breakdowns and the manic depression she faced in her life daily. Overall all this is a good book and it is intersting to draw the similarities between Virginia and Mrs. Dalloway."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is the first book I read by Virginia Woolf.

The language, the history and the suspense had me wanting to keep the book by my side always until I finished."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf's novel reads like a long, protracted REM state. Everything takes place within one June day, with Big Ben striking out the hours in downtown London. As Mrs. Dalloway, a fairly cunning society woman, gets ready for a big party, the world whirls around her. Big political deals are struck, a war veteran goes mad and dies, a young girl is nearly seduced by a missionary of shaky sexual orientation, and Mrs. Dalloway's former lover bursts upon the scene.It's sometimes overpowering, because the sentences can ramble on for pages, but it never takes on that corny stream-of-consciousness style that so much American literature is riddled with. It's always lush and surprisingly rich with details, even when thee obversations are downright nasty.It's easy to see why Michael Cunningham chose this as a basis for his own book, THE HOURS, which features its own tightly interwoven characters. Reading MRS.

All of this made it a little hard to read the book. So, not the best Kindle edition in the world."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"the story is always told from the view of being in someones head listining to there thoughts. it's rather novel and gives the reader the oppertunity to understand the characters better than they understand themselves."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"The style and execution of Mrs. Dalloway is of necessity a departure from her famous essay, A Room of One's Own, and even from the smattering of the short stories of hers I've read, and normally the comparison many make of it to James Joyce's Ulysses would have turned me right off. I'm glad I gave it a go, though, because in my opinion Woolf takes the stream-of-consciousness writing style and does it right, threading the narrative together in a wandering but coherent and meaningful way.The story spins itself out over just one day, as Clarissa Dalloway occupies herself with the planning of a party she's hosting that evening. Throughout the course of the day we jump around from her point of view to a few other characters she comes in contact with, namely Peter Walsh, an old friend who has been living away from England for decades, mostly in India, and has now returned to try and work out divorce plans so he can marry a woman back in India. In their youth Peter and Clarissa were a couple whom most thought would marry, but she ended up marrying Richard Dalloway instead, an event that Peter has never really gotten over. When he comes to see Clarissa the day of her party they reminisce about old times, particularly about a specific weekend they and another friend of Clarissa's, Sally Seton, had spent together at Clarissa's family estate. This is where we get the most informative glimpses into Clarissa's youth and what has formed her over the years, including her romantic but not entirely understood feelings for her friend Sally.Two other significant points of view we get are from the loosely connected character of Septimus Smith and his Italian wife Lucrezia as they're out and about in town. Septimus, a WWI vet, is clearly mentally disturbed and distraught over something he can't quite clarify, even to himself, and although it's never known if he's suffering post-traumatic war stress or is perhaps schizophrenic, the passages following his rambling, tormented thoughts are intense. His wife Lucrezia is desperately worried about him and unsure what to do, and feeling like a displaced foreigner dropped in a strange town, has no one to turn to. When she finally calls upon the local doctor and he tells her Septimus will have to be taken away, she is horrified and frightened, both for him and herself.Mrs. Dalloway was actually the combination of two short stories, \\"Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street\\" and \\"The Prime Minister\\". Generally I don't find a lot of literature that looks at the social aftermath, even peripherally, of WWI (Hemingway stands out as an exception, of course, but he focuses more on the war itself) since that conflict tends to be overshadowed by the events of WWII. The impact of the first world war, though, was significant, given the incredibly high death toll and economic impact. \\"This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears,\\" the narrative goes at one point, speaking volumes in those few words.It's masterfully done and has a delicacy and eloquence about it that makes each word important. Woolf's vision and unique perception of the world around her is extraordinary: \\"It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over -- the moment.\\"In the end I was left wondering what the events of the day would signify for Clarissa, as she looks down the path at impending old age and is vaguely, uncomfortably aware that the years she has lived, rather than forming her more clearly and definitively as a person, have seemed to somehow make her less; that her sense of self has been watered down, as if essential parts of herself have been allowed to erode and disappear, rather than crystallize and build some crucial inner self. The image remaining is one of death, when at the end of life a person eventually returns to the original state one is born in: soft, embryonic and unformed. Disturbing!That's just my own interpretation, mind you. At any rate, it's a compelling read from a woman I can't help but think must have tormented herself with her own thoughts and questions, so much so that she eventually committed suicide. Like Sylvia Plath, she obviously had a brilliant mind and it's a shame the world was robbed of it too soon."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"For the longest time, I thought I disliked Virginia Woolf's work. Typically, I am not a fan of \\"stream of consciousness,\\" and being that \\"To the Lighthouse\\" was my first read, Woolf left me not wanting for more. However, in a Queer Theory course in my graduate studies, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" was assigned and I absolutely loved it. In fact, upon finishing this work, I ordered all of Woolf's works.Not only is the work hauntingly beautiful and melancholy, but also rather daring. The book takes place in the course of one day in London, yet somehow, the reader becomes familiar with lifetimes of relationships, some of them homosexual relationships. Woolf's work here is gorgeously poetic.The book generated a lot of discussion because it has so much to offer to many different kinds of readers. I once swore I would never read Woolf again, but this book has made me recant the error of my ways.If you are a fan of poetic prose, read this book. I intend to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her fourth novel.I read her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" before buying the present book, then skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop - then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and then \\"To The Lighthouse.\\"\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Mrs. Dalloway, or simply Clarrisa Dalloway the character, was used in her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" but only as a minor character who the protagonist, Rachel, meets on a sea voyage. Mr. Dalloway makes a pass at Rachel and kisses her. Woolf brings them back in force here with their own novel.The present story is set in the summer in post WWI London and it revolves around a few days in the life of Mrs. Dalloway. She has a party and during that period an old suitor, Peter Walsh, makes his return appearance from an overseas job posting in India, and does so after thirty years. Part of the story involves her thoughts about that relationship and her life choices. The second plot element is mental illness and the appearance of Septimus Warren Smith and his Italian wife Lucrezia. He is a war survivor but is suffering from depression. The third element is her present husband and his love for her.The compressed in time and chaotic story which involves Clarrisa, her husband, Peter Walsh, and Septimus, lends itself to the stream of consciousness technique. Some make comparisons with Joyce and his stream of consciousness novel \\"Ulysses.\\" In any case, Woolf uses it to advantage here. Finally, Woolf is an author who promoted aesthetic purity in fiction. But here she uses the novel as a chance to attack the care for the mental illnesses.This is an excellent novel written by Woolf at her prime. Her approach lends itself to the subject and it is quite effective. If you want to read a conventional novel by Woolf, then I recommend her first novel, \\"The Voyage Out.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This book certainly requires more effort on the reader's side than many books, but it is well worth the effort. Woolf keeps up her half of the bargain by making effective use of the diffucult style; leading the reader with a purpose rather than pointless meandering. She explores the stream-of-conciousness style effectively, without going to the silly extreme that some other Modernist authors did. Her portrayal of mental illness strikes me as eerily realistic, especially when you take into account her own personal history.The way I attacked it was like this: I read it once as quick as I could, without stopping to figure it out, then read it again taking my time. In the end, I was rewarded with a cathartic experience."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Although the time covered in this complex novel is only one day, Virginia Woolf, through her genius, manages to cover a lifetime unraveling and exposing the mysteries of the human personality.The central character of the novel is the delicate Clarissa Dalloway, a disciplined English gentlewoman who provides the perfect contrast to another of the book's characters, Septimus Warren Smith, an ex-soldier whose world is disintegrating into chaos. Although Clarissa and Septimus never meet, it is through the interweaving of each one's story into a gossamer whole that Woolf works her genius.The book is set on a June day in 1923, as Clarissa prepares for a party that evening. Unfolding events trigger memories and recollections of her past, and Woolf offers these bits and pieces to the reader who must then construct the psychological and emotional makeup of Clarissa Dalloway in his own mind. We also learn much about Clarissa through the thoughts of other characters, such as her one-time lover, Peter Walsh, her friend, Sally Seton, her husband, Richard and her daughter Elizabeth.It is Septimus Warren Smith, however, driven to the brink of insanity by the war, an insanity that even his wife's tender ministrations cannot cure, who acts as Clarissa's societal antithesis and serves to divide her world into the &quot;then&quot; and the &quot;now.&quot;In this extremely complex and character-driven novel, Woolf offers her readers a challenge. The novel is not separated into chapters; almost all of the action occurs in the thoughts and reminiscences of the characters and the reader must piece together the story from the random bits and pieces of information each character provides. The complexity of the characters may add to the frustration because Woolf makes it difficult for the reader to receive any single dominant impression of any one of them. This, however, forms the essence of the novel and displays the genius of Woolf: It is impossible to describe any human being in a simple phrase or collection of adjectives. We are many things to many people, all of them somewhat different, none of them the same, just as we are many things to ourselves.Throughout the book, the reader is constantly called upon to compare and contrast Peter Walsh and Richard Dalloway, the two significant love interests in Clarissa Dalloway's life. Compared to Peter, an adventurer, Richard Dalloway appears more than a bit reserved and dour. But, readers must constantly question this view of Richard as his personality seems to alter with his altering relationships.Intimacy, particularly emotional intimacy, and the preservation of one's uniqueness are two of Woolf's continuing themes. We find that Clarissa married Richard, in part, to preserve her sense of self; Peter would have demanded far more of her than she was, perhaps, willing to give. Here, Clarissa and Septimus, so outwardly different, would find they share much in common. While Clarissa feels threatened by her daughter's tenacious tutor, Miss Kilman, as well as by Peter, Septimus feels threatened by his doctor. Each feels the others are asking too much. Septimus and Clarissa even agree on the subject of death: &quot;There is no death,&quot; Septimus declares, while Clarissa, the atheist, secretly believes that bits and pieces of her will remain intact forever.Although some characters in this book may, at first, appear to be one-dimensional, we soon learn that all are extraordinarily complex. There is Sally, impulsive yet considerate; Richard, bashful yet timid; Peter inhibited yet adventurous; Septimus, insane yet credible. And Clarissa? She is all of these things and more.It is, however, Woolf's torrential stream-of-consciousness prose that makes this novel a true masterpiece. Even those who find the plot of little interest will be drawn in by the exquisiteness of Woolf's language. This is a complex, character study in the fullest sense of the word, one with no easy answers, for Woolf, in the end seems to be telling us that perhaps, at our essence, we are all unknowable, even to ourselves."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Any young aspiring writer should compare Woolf's early work, such as Night and Day to something like Mrs. Dalloway. The transformation in narrative strength is incredible. I think Woolf found her voice when she gave up on traditional technique and focused on vivid imagery, poetic language, and really getting into the souuls of her characters.Her views on love in this boook are heartbreaking. Love serves as mere convenience, romance is just an illusion. 9 times out of 10 people choose safety. Pretty cynical viewpoint, but she lived during the days of a crumbling Empire and wrote about it beautifully. She really achieved her greatest literary power later on in life.Also, this book studies insanity and the doctors who are impotent to help. I'm sure woolf would have the same view in today's heavily medicated society.This book is not for the faint of heart. She does not hide characters emotions, but tends to dwelon their weaknesses. The final party scene is brilliant. If you like this book, read To The Lighthouse, which is equally brilliant."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"It's not really fair to judge this book or its author by today's standards, but damn, this is a hard read. I'd read it about 20 years ago and recall struggling with the endless sentences and the rambling explorations of Mrs. Dalloway's interior thoughts, her every little fleeting idea, and the tiny events of the day in her life which this book chronicles.Then of course when The Hours was published, I rummaged around in the bookshelf, found it, and read it again.And then the movie came out with that wonderful cast of characters, and, well, I had to read it a third time. And I'll say this: it takes more than a single reading to harvest all the gems from this dense prose. Mrs. Dalloway grew on me with the passage of time and with three careful readings. The studied explorations into past and present, men and women, women and other women, society and the family, love and regret...it's a lot to take on in what is really a pretty small book - and only someone of Woolf's talents and brilliance could have made so much of so little.Highly recommended, but I'm sorry - you'll probably have to read it more than once to extract every single little diamond chip."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"On a single day in June, Clarissa Dalloway is preparing for the party she is giving that evening. Septimus Warren Smith struggles with mental illness as a result of his experiences in WWI. Using stream-of-consciousness technique Virginia Woolf explores the thoughts, emotions and sensations of these two characters and others connected with them. Past and present commingle in her characters' minds and this merging of past history and present moment allows for much richer presentation of the characters and their universe than the plot would suggest.The chief pleasures of the book are the vivid, evocative, poetic language, and Woolf's gift for inner dialogue - the stories characters tell themselves - which in turn reveals them to us.How good is the book? I \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" can be found on many lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century, one of Virginia Woolf's major achievements. More often than not, it's considered her best work after \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Personally, I loved the book, and it led me to start reading her other books and to the biographies. The practical question is not whether this is a good book - it is arguably a great book. The question is whether it is for you.The book is unapologetically literary, which means that if you don't find language a genuine pleasure, you probably won't enjoy it. For those who do, the rich, imaginative language is the reason for reading. There is little in the way of conventional suspense to keep one turning the pages. The stream-of-consciousness style is demanding, and it requires an attentive reader. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to overemphasize the difficulties. The action of the book is relatively easy to follow, and one does not need a concordance to appreciate it. In fact a good sense of the language can be had simply by reading the first few pages provided in Amazon's section, \\"Look Inside the Book.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I believe it was Lionel Trilling who said that if it's true that a book reads you as much as you read a book, certain books had found him at first difficult and boring, but had eventually grown friendly. &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; found me to be -- when I first attempted to read it in high school -- a dull, even fragile creature; but with time the book made way for me in its life, and now we are rather fond acquaintances. Virginia Woolf is, of course, one of The Greats, but despite this debilitating label she is a writer whose books are addictive to any energetic and patient reader who is in love with the English language. Language is certainly not the only beauty in Woolf's work, but it is the aspect of her writing that first drew my amazed attention. She is in many ways an impressionist, a literary Monet, while we Americans are more comfortable with naturalists and expressionists, so perhaps a reader new to Woolf would need to exercise a few mind muscles which haven't had much attention paid to them, but this isnot a bad thing. And there's a good chance I'm wrong, a good chance that I'm taking my own particular weaknesses and ascribing them to the readership at large. (Oh well.) The point is this: give &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; a chance. Go to it blind, without assumptions, with an open mind and curious heart. I think the book will find you to be a very engaging person, full of wonders and mystery."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"A day in the life portrait that centers on Clarissa Dalloway, a wife of a wealthy politician, in 1920s London. This work looks at the affects of aging, the psychological impacts of the first World War, the role of friendships, how people view the past, and the complexity of human emotions. It makes the reader question what really is important in our lives. The descriptions put you right in the world of Mrs. Dalloway.Nobody does stream-of-consciousness like Virginia Woolf. And this book is stream-of-consciousness at its best. Definitely not an easy read, but well worth the time and effort. Read this book and you will be rewarded. If you get a chance, see the movie as well."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is a fine edition and value, including a helpful preface introducing the author and novel as well as an appendix (the \\"annotated\\" part) with explanations of terms, places, and designations for non-Londoners along with identifications of literary, political and historical allusions for readers who could use a little extra help.Anyone who has read James Joyce's \\"The Dead\\" will recognize some of the same themes and preoccupations in \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" which in addition evokes numerous English \\"comedies of manners\\" as well as satirical narratives about a straight-laced Victorian culture that has become an anachronism in the 1920s. The story at times resembles a Jane Austen novel, except for the absence of a \\"fixed\\" point-of-view or reliable standard by which to measure the characters, each of which has, to lesser or greater degrees, sympathetic and unsympathetic qualities and is shown from the \\"inside\\" as a mind-in-process, a consciousness-in-flux (consequently, a reader needs to be careful not to apply an overly \\"logical\\" approach, insistent upon hanging on to a single point or statement as \\"the truth\\" about a character, who is more likely to try one possibility, then another, leaving it up to the reader to infer a character's essence through careful consideration of the important meanings derived from multiple impressions).This is not a novel for the impatient or tone-deaf. Woolf creates a character's interior life through a virtuosic, highly mobile third-person narrator, who might be thought of as the character's \\"persona,\\" not merely \\"expressing\\" the character's thoughts but \\"mirroring\\" how the character perceives him or herself as seen by others. Moreover, the indefinite pronouns can shift unexpectedly or occur in too close proximity to make identification easy or even definite. As a result, the reader has to work overtime to achieve entrance into the mind of the \\"right\\" character while simultaneously sensing the liquid, interpenetrating and shared qualities of human identity itself. And finally there's that tone, now soft, next loud, and never to be trusted to be without irony.Woolf makes it fairly easy on the reader with the broad, sardonic strokes she uses to paint the practically villainous Sir William Bradshaw, the eminent psychiatrist viewed by many (especially himself) as the scientific high priest of this cross-section of deluded London luminaries; and she's equally nasty to her other \\"villain,\\" Miss Kilman, a repressed and embittered born-again Christian who, like Sir William, lives by the code of \\"conversion,\\" Woolf's euphemism for those powerful personalities who are bent upon breaking, controlling and dominating the will of anyone not strong enough to resist them. The other portraits are more subtle, requiring the reader either to hear the soft, nuanced ironical tones or risk missing both the social satire and the character. Woolf's targets range, perhaps not surprisingly, from the pretense, pride, and hypocrisy of an out-of-touch social stratum that clings to the \\"orderly\\" past; to the arrogance of modern medical \\"science\\"; to, more surprisingly, the suffocating alternatives offered by both religion and love.Readers lured to this novel because of Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" (novel or film) may be disappointed or quickly frustrated. Moving from Cunningham to Woolf is a bit like going from Fitzgerald to Faulkner, or from Austen to Shakespeare. What you immediately notice is, despite Woolf's limiting her story to a single day (compared to Cunningham's three-generation setting), the far greater range and more inclusive thematic focus and, most importantly, the sheer power and vitality of the prose (from fluid motion to dynamic rush). Woolf--like Joyce, Faulkner, and Shakespeare--employs a syntax that can cause the earth to move from under a reader's feet: she's a writer who represents not merely individual characters but captures the world whole not to mention the life of language itself.The greatest challenge \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" presents to a first-time reader is never to let up. It's essential to stay with Clarissa throughout her entire day, finally becoming a fully engaged participant in the party itself--the final thirty pages of the novel, which contain some of Woolf's best writing. Especially critical is the extended moment, almost 20 pages into the party scene, when Clarissa, like Septimus, walks to the window and has her epiphany. At that moment, one character chooses death; the other, life. But Woolf enables us to see these apparently opposite choices as \\"existential\\" cognates: both characters make choices that enable them to save their souls.Cunningham is a first-rate stylist and craftsman who can tell a story that's moving and evocative, a narrative, moreover, that connects with today's readers by affirming the choices available to the self. But it inevitably pales alongside the vibrant novel and microcosm of life that is its source and inspiration. Virginia, like her character Clarissa, knows how to throw a party."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Hard to believe I've never read Virginia Woolf before this, and now I know I've been missing true greateness, indeed! Mrs. Dalloway is a book to savour, every sentence, every phrase. A quick read it is not, even if quite a short novel! A few pages at a time is best, I found, to let it drift slowly into my soul.It's like a long narrative poem, with exquistely perfect descriptions (what verbs!), dreamy stream-of-consciousness meanderings, and sudden cut-to-the-quick action. I found the sudden shifts into various character's points of view a little disconcerting at first -- whose head am I in now? -- but soon came to realize the distinctive voices.Unfolding over one hot summer day in London, we gradually ease closer and closer to Clarissa Dalloway's grand party. Flashing back to holiday scenes at Bourton, we learn about the tangled relationships between the young Clarissa, her n'er-do-well fianc&eacute; Peter Walsh, her wild and sensual girlfriend Sally Seton, and her eventual Member of Parliament husband Richard Dalloway. Peter Walsh, who has been away in India some 25-30 years, turns up on Clarissa's doorstep the morning of the party. Sally Seton, now Lady Rosseter, unexpectedly waltzes onto the scene that evening. How do those sensual relationships of youth translate into a sophisticated party scene decades later, with the Prime Minister and much of upper crust London in attendance? (I won't give that away!)As counterpoint to London high society, we have two other important characters, Septimus Warren Smith and his Italian milliner wife Rezia. Septimus suffers post-World War I shellshock, and we follow his descent into suicidal madness. The paths of Septimus and Rezia touch those of the other characters' ever so tangentially, little more than a quick brush in the street. Yet Woolf has seamlessly woven them together.Altogether this is a hauntingly beautiful novel, one that will continue to reverberate through you."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I guess I came to this book through the back door -- first I read Michael Cunningham's pulitzer prize winning book The Hours (based on Mrs. Dalloway) which I LOVED, and then I decided to read the original. First off, I must say that Cunningham impressed me even more when I fully understood the references and parallels that he uses. As for Mrs. Dalloway, it is the language itself that dazzles. The plot is nothing to speak of -- it's similar to a Jane Austen book when lots of interesting and not-so-interesting people interact in their mundane lives. It's what Woolf does with the subtle interactions and her stream of conscious writing that makes this book so good. Having read maybe 6 of Woolf's works, my favorite is still To the Lighthouse. Maybe that's because Mrs. Ramsey is so much more human -- Mrs. Dalloway is always described as distant and cold. This book is a love story of sorts about how Clarissa turns down the true love of her life and instead marries a wealthy politician. Like Ulysses, the narrative jumps around the minds of various characters in their journey from morning in London when Clarissa goes to buy flours to the evening of her party. It is a bit difficult, but the language itself makes it worth the effort."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I must admit, I shied away from Virginial Woolf for some time, mostly due to having read \\"A Room of One's Own\\" in college. While mildly interesting, it certainly does not tap into the genius that is Virginia Woolf. So I didn't expect much when I picked up \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" But wow, what a book. It is a direct response to James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" (though a bit more accessible) and runs with the same stream of consciousness style and also takes place in the space of one day. Virginia Woolf illustrates her greatness in this book and I highly recommend it. People looking to read more of her should also try \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" She was a very talented and creative woman who more than held her own against the great male minds of the time and continues to impress even years after her death."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Reading Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf reminded me of why many of these books I have pledged to read are considered challenges. I was really looking forward to reading this book because I was under the impression that other people liked it. As I found out later, this is not necessarily the case and I can understand why. It's not that Mrs. Dalloway is a bad book and, in fact, it gets better as it goes along and even has some profound quotes, such as, \\"Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind.\\"The book is incredibly detailed and vivid in its descriptions, and Woolf does a great job of really getting inside of the heads of various characters. The problem is the stream of consciousness writing made it difficult to recognize transitions from one person to the next. No matter what page I was on, I felt like I was having aha moments about two pages before. I was always reading a few pages of my comprehension. The result is that I can look back on the book with some fondness, but I remember the difficulties I encountered. My favorite parts were those pertaining to Septimus and Rezia (even more so than Mrs. Dalloway herself). Theirs was a palpable and tragic story that I could have read an entire book about.To be fair to the book, I skipped the Introduction. It was more or less a play-by-play of the entire book and I thought that reading it would ruin the story for me. Instead, I read it after I finished the book and it put things into better context for me. If I were to do it over again, though, I still don't think I would have read the Introduction first. I don't like knowing everything that's going to happen in a book, even if it makes it \\"easier\\" to get through. The book has a great quote that says, \\"It is a thousand pities never to say what one feels,\\" and so, I will be honest..... I could have just read the Introduction and skipped reading the book altogether and come away with the same amount of comprehension. But that's neither here nor there and I am left feeling ambiguous about the book. I enjoyed it after the fact, but not as much while reading it."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This novel depicts much of early 20th century Britain as others did - but in a very different manner.This is a detailed reflection of one person's ideas whose ideals are influenced and among the upper crust society of early 20th century England. Unlike Evelyn Waugh, Woolf does not stride with succinct and pernicious dialogue (but I find similarities between Clarissa in this book to Brenda Mast in \\"Handful of Dust\\"). Unlike Max Beerbohm, Woolf does not overly state how cutely atrocious British society can behave. Unlike E.M. Forster, Woolf does not engage in panoramic writing. Each is great. Woolf is unique and magnificent.Moving about in an undulating fashion, her ability to have the characters' thoughts zig and zag throughout each sentence of contemplation is unrivaled. She moves within their thoughts so quickly that within the confines of this less than 200-page novel, we know a tremendous amount about Clarissa and almost as much about her dumped early lover, Peter Walsh, and her old friend Sally Seton.Dialogue exists, but it is the characters' thoughts that speak so vividly. We learn what it is or was that Clarissa did to Peter Walsh that has made him upset or even mad at her. We learn a little about the depression funk of the war-damaged Septimus Warren Smith (Interestingly, as Woolf too was a depressed person who followed Smith in suicide, I wonder why more of his angst was not described or detailed). And, we discover that even one hundred years ago, mothers and daughters (Clarissa and Elizabeth) had problems with one another, in a fashion reminiscent of the \\"rebellious\\" years of today's teens.I have not read all of the great writers, but among those I have read, none can enter the thoughts and perceptions as well or as vividly as Woolf. This is a great skill by an unmistakenly great writer, who may have shined most with this novel or its contemporary - \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"I add that I read this AFTER I read \\"The Hours.\\" I would recommend to others to do the opposite. And, I would add a recommendation to sandwich those two books with \\"To the Lighthouse\\" -- as the three would make a great trilogy of exquisite reading."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read Mrs Dalloway the first time for a class a couple of years ago and fell in love with it on the first page. I recently spent a school quarter in London and was so excited to see this on the syllabus. The tone of this novel suits London beautifully, and I found myself seeing the places the characters visited in a whole new light- The feeling of being lost in Trafalgar Square, or the magical quality of the serpentine in Hyde park were captured so perfectly in by Woolf. I could not imagine a novel better suited to such an incredible city.That being said, if you have never been or don't plan on ever going to London, still read this book. I have never read a novel in which I felt I knew or understood the characters so intimately. And the language and words she uses, even just the mechanical syntax of Woolf's sentances, are brilliant. Her words pour through the novel like waves, and the descriptions are vivid and heartbreaking. I felt so sad finishing this novel, and yet, it ended exactly as it should have. But I confess, the instant it was over I turned back to the first page and read it again!I understand why some people don't like this novel. The stream of conciousness can be a little difficult (although I never had any problem figuring out who was talking, like some people said). But I find it refreshing to read something wholly different from not only writers of Woolf's time, but even writers today. The use of stream of conciousness is very different from, say, James Joyce, or other authors who write in this style. And it definitly breaks away from the typical formula novels that dominate most library and bookstore shelves. All in all, read this book. At best, you'll fall in love with it like I did, and at worst, it's a quick read so you didn't waste much time."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"One of Woolf's masterpieces (although To the Lighthouse is far more accessible) this book introduces us to Clarissa Dalloway: dutiful wife, proud mother, hostess extraordinaire, cream of London society, and perhaps ultimately, failure. Using a stream-of-consciousness technique that was pretty radical for its time, Woolf bounces us from the mind of one character to another in sometimes erratic fashion, presenting a multi-faceted view of a single day in post-WWI London.The focus is on Clarissa and the grand party she is throwing that particular evening, but as her thoughts frequently hearken back to the past, we gradually learn her life's story, even as participants in that story make appearances in \\"real time\\". Peter, just back from India, still has strong feelings about her, despite the many years since she broke off their love affair. Sally, the brazen, independent woman who Clarissa so much admired, also puts in an unexpected appearance, and some may wonder if a romantic attachment might have also played a role in their relationship. Clarissa's husband Richard is something of disappointment, neither as successful as his contemporaries or as passionate as the now-unattached Peter. Will this confluence of faces from her past be enough to shake Clarissa out of her despondency?A major sub-plot revolves around a young WWI veteran named Septimus who is also obsessed by the past. Seeing visions of his late comrade-in-arms, Septimus finds it difficult to deal with the realities of everyday life. His wife, tormented by his inexplicable behavior, wants to get him medical help, but her husband fears these threats to his freedom even more than death. Will her love be enough to save him?The intersection of these two plots is not overly dramatic, but in light of the facts of Woolf's own demise, the effect of one upon the other should not be overlooked. The novel bears more than a hint of social criticism, blaming the patriarchal culture for Clarissa's lack of choices, but even more than that it is a cry for help from an author who was plagued by her own fears and doubts.As characters, the women are better realized than the men, and apart from the over-critical Peter and the intellectual light-weight Richard, most of the men are pretty unpleasant. As such, women will probably enjoy this book more than men. Casual readers be forewarned: the stream-of-consciousness technique makes for a very difficult read, particularly in the early pages, before we know who's who. There's not a lot of plot; this book is primarily a character study of some fairly unhappy people. For devotees of great literature, this novel is essential to understanding the author and the untold numbers of lost souls like her. For everyone else, this is a very challenging novel about how we perceive others and ourselves, and not exactly a light entertainment."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This Kindle edition is terrible. The margins change without rhyme or reason. Pages end in the middle of a word. Words are hyphenated for no reason. Given the complexities of Virginia Woolf's narrative, the formatting is particularly distracting. Buy another edition."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Read as much as you can about Virginia Woolf -- especially the biographies by Quentin Bell, Hermione Lee, and Julia Briggs (2005) before re-reading Mrs Dalloway. In fact, I can't imagine enjoying Mrs Dalloway without \\"knowing\\" Virginia Woolf. Some say Sir Walter Scott invented the historical novel. If true, I think one can say Virginia Woolf invented the modern autobiographical novel. Clarissa, Mrs Dalloway, is Virginia. Mrs Dalloway was published in 1925 when VW was 43 years old; Clarissa is 52 and perhaps that's how old Mrs Woolf felt when she wrote her autobiography of middle age. When sane, she is Mrs Dalloway; when mad, she is Septimus. Her descriptions of madness (hallucinations, paranoid delusions) are incredible, especially when written at a time when Freud (whose work Virginia's Hogarth Press had published) was all the rage. Her questioning lesbian love is extraordinarily interesting -- not so much whether it was morally right or wrong but, at a deeper level, what was lesbian love all about and where did it fit in. It becomes a parlour game to correlate details on every page with the corresponding details in Mrs Woolf's life. Her questioning lesbian love in 1925 would have occurred at the height of her involvement with Vita Sackville-West, whom she first met in 1922. Even little references to the fact that an individual would not inherit a family home due to male preference inheritance laws tracks with Vita's predicament. And why \\"Clarissa\\"? Where did that name come from? Mrs Woolf's diary entries and letters suggest it was a random choice, but I wonder if it was not a reference to Samuel Richardson's Clarissa?"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"So many people have gone back to read (or re-read) Mrs. Dalloway since The Hours came out that it almost makes me want to have Hollywood create interesting movie versions of numerous other classics. Think of the possibilities! It's almost a shame that people are forced to \\"plow through\\" some of these books as course assignments, where all of their enjoyment is completely lost. With movies, it encourages people to read them voluntarily when they are older and can relate to the themes of the book.While young teens might find the musings of a middle aged woman confusing or tedious, most of us who are over the age of 25 understand completely where Mrs. Dalloway is coming from. She's wandering through the streets of London, going about the chores before an important party. Her mind is flitting all over as she waits for the road to clear so she can pass, while she chooses flowers, while she runs into friends. She thinks about how the party's going to go, how her daughter's doing, what her husband is up to. She's barely aware of the \\"real\\" world around her.As if this isn't enough, an old boyfriend from her teen years shows up. That sets off all sorts of other thoughts. Should she have stayed with him after all? Then there was that girlish crush she had on a female friend. Someone wants to come to her party who wasn't invited. Her husband's off lunching with another woman. Finally the party starts, and she worries that it's not going well, until she finally settles in and is comfortable.In amongst all of Mrs. Dalloway's angsts and daydreaming, we also get glimpses into other peoples' minds - her old boyfriend, her daughter, her daughter's tutor, and so on. This lets us view the world from a variety of angles. Tying it together is Big Ben, chiming away the hours as the day goes by.I realize, if you're used to action-oriented straightforward stories like The Da Vinci Code, that it might take a \\"slowing down\\" to read this story. Where I zip through other books at break-neck speed, when I re-read Mrs. Dalloway I have to sit back, take a deep breath, and go along at a slow pace. If you don't quite get the hang of the characters the first time through, read through it again. Once you understand who the people are and how they relate, it makes the inner musings much more clear. It's its own rhythm, the slow, steady rhythm of a day in London. It's not about racing to a goal. It's about the daydreams of life that happen *while* you're preparing for something.Interestingly, another book - \\"The Party\\" - gathers together many of the short stories Woolf wrote at the same time as Mrs. Dalloway. One in particular is a different version of the beginning of this story. In Mrs. Dalloway, the title character is going off to buy flowers for herself. The imagery is very powerful, and very meaningful for women who are used to having flowers bought for them - but not getting them for themselves. Intriguingly, \\"The Party\\" version has her going out and getting grey gloves, and wondering if they should have buttons of not. The power of the scene is *really* changed. It makes you wonder what other famous stories had different versions of their beginnings, and how much the story might have been different if they hadn't redone it. I definitely recommend getting both books and reading them together.Then rent and watch The Hours, and see all of the interweavings of the stories!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Admittedly, many will find Woolf's dense prose difficult to comprehend, and honestly, I was initially no exception. I had attempted Woolf's greatest work twice before I picked it up yet again just two days ago. On previous attempts I became lost in the language, and entirely lost as to any discernable plot. Perhaps I'm just bull headed, but if so many people considered this work a classic, I must simply be missing something, so on this attempt, I came in prepared. Some may consider it cheating, but on this reading, I prepared by perusing a summery of the work before beginning to gain a basic knowledge of the work's plot, and I have to say, it did the trick for me.Being well aware of the bare structure of the novel, I was left to concentrate on the sheer poetry that is Woolf's language. I found once I got my foot in the door (that is once I read the first 15 pages or so and adjusted to Woolf's prose and use of long running sentences) I simply loved it, and could not get enough of Clarissa and the rest of her world!I suppose another road block for many readers may be the clear depth of Woolf's observations within the novel. One must realize, Woolf is less concerned with the present action of the novel than what that action causes in the mind of her characters, and this is simply an arrangement I believe many readers have not previously encountered, and therefore condemn the novel, not seeing the genius of the tome, and Virginia Woolf herself.Despite the confusion some readers may find in Woolf and Mrs. Dalloway subsequently, the novel given its due is worth every moment of effort, and the reader I find will be well rewarded, I know I was!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf was a surprise to me, even though I thought I had an idea of what to expect. It was a lovely surprise, actually.I knew it was considered an \\"experimental\\" novel, and focused on only one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a 50-something wife of an upper class and successful, but not quite successful enough governmental official. But I didn't know that the stream of consciousness as Clarissa prepares for a party that evening, and remembers and considers her life, is shared among multiple characters. I loved the way the viewpoint flowed among the characters, in a way, as if once they shared an experience on the street or in the park, the point of view would switch to the next person and follow him or her. It was fascinating and done even-handedly.The flow of point of view brought out some key differences in the characters. Clarissa, while one empathizes with her, seems shallow and self-involved when compared with Septimus, the only one of the main characters who doesn't appear at the party at the end of the day. Septimus is seriously mentally ill, the result of shell shock from World War I. He has an Italian wife he has brought back to London with him from the war, and she is beside herself with worry. Her husband talks to people who aren't there. He writes cryptic notes to himself and leaves them about. She can't connect with him anymore. When it's her point of view, her loneliness is palpable and painful. She's losing hope. Septimus, who watched his war buddy die and \\"took it like a man\\" is afraid he no longer feels anything, and has been getting \\"treatment\\" from a family practitioner who has no idea what to do for his psychological problems.Meanwhile, Clarissa prepares for her party by mending her gown. Her former love interest, the man she was involved with before she became engaged to her husband, Richard, comes back into her life from India and drops in her. She remembers that she always feels judged by Peter Walsh and sees him as someone who has made poor and ruinous errors in judgment where women are concerned. He's in London to get a divorce for his new interest, an Indian woman married to an Indian military officer, so that he can be with her. His being back in London and her receiving him in her home causes them to remember their pasts, including a woman, Sally, they had both known, who was very antiestablishment, and with whom Clarissa seems to have been in love, as well.The day moves forward, and the author ingeniously inserts chiming clocks throughout the narrative to keep the reader anchored in time as the characters' minds flow back and forth over the years and the recent days. The contrast of Clarissa's and Septimus's lives is striking, and there is an idea that Peter Walsh's connection with India, Clarissa's thoughts about her own death and Septimus's pain over the death of his friend and his lack of feeling are commenting on a coming demise of the British Empire. When some characters speak of a patient's death during Clarissa's party, she is selfishly offended; though someone has died, she feels very petulantly negative toward those guests, thinking that they have \\"brought death to my party.\\"The book is very thoughtful, very considered, and always, of course, subjective. It's a wonder to read because although it flows so well among all these people who tend to answer each other and make pointed contrasts, there is a lot to think about within this one day. One gains from this perception: You know Clarissa's feelings and you know others feelings about her. It's an interesting way to see a fictional character.0 I would like to read it again sometime, just because I know there's a lot more there.I did want to mention that having read \\"The Hours\\" by Michael Cunningham, I wanted to read this novel, which inspired it. After reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" I like \\"The Hours\\" less. Things that I credited Cunningham for were taken, sometimes whole, from \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" and I did feel that the end of \\"The Hours\\" seemed wrong, not quite believable, not quite what we were led ahead into. \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" did not disappoint in this way."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Of course, Clarissa Dalloway is a stunning creation of Woolf's, but notice also her relationship with Septimus Smith.

Apparently the setup is that Clarissa Dalloway is getting ready for a gathering at her home. As she prepares, we get the stream of thoughts about guests, past parties, scenes of days gone by, random impression of observations, India, the war... Like Joyce, this is a day of the inner life of thought. The abstract impression that comes across offers no story line, no direct character development, no traditional structure, nothing of what one might expect of a novel. Woolf's genius is that she makes this flowing narrative beautiful. There are turns of phrase, descriptions, patterns of proses that indicate tension, anticipation and climax. Woolf presents words the way a jazz musician develops a melody. She provides phrases that indicate story, though there is no clear story. She evolves a description that draws the reader in with fascination for what is going to happen in that scene, and then she changes scenes. She flirts with the reader imagination so consistently that the book is satisfying and brilliant.The analogy that comes to mind is Jackson Pollock. There is a canvas at the MET in New York City which is easily 30' x 10'. It is one of his paint spatter works that seems absolutely random, which it may well have been, and yet, I can sit and look at it for an hour, and have. The eye follows a line which flows to a patterns that forms a shape that seems deliberate before dropping into a burst of color that is surprising and them swirling into a tornado of another symphony of color. Absolutely abstract and yet familiar.I suppose one could extrapolate a story of sorts. Clarissa Dalloway muses on men she has known and returns repeatedly to Peter Walsh in contrast to her stuffy, athletic husband. Many strong impressions that form a story come across, but it comes out of her internal dialogue. There is no voice explaining or telling the story.I would like to wrap up by saying that I really liked this. However, I liked it in the way that I like good jazz or Pollock's painting. I live with images of Constable's castle ruins and Turners storms at sea in my mind. I can see Renior's faces and Degas' dancers. I know I like looking at Pollock's painting, but I don't remember details of what they look like in the same way. When I hum &#34;My Favorite Things&#34;, it's the words and melody, not John Coltrane's improvisation. Virginia Woolf was a genius and this work is well work reading. It is an experience of art though, not a story that will stay with the reader beyond the impression it makes of beautiful words forming impressions."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This story will have you submerged into it's world of high class and wealth of ladies and gentlemen.

DALLOWAY. Gaining popularity after it's portrayal in Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS, MRS. DALLOWAY continues to be a classic in the many decades since it's original publication. Set in London in June 1923 Woolf creates an intriguing mix of characters. As Clarissa Dalloway is busy preparing for a party in the evening the narration cohesively jumps to Peter Walsh, her lover from years past. The reader also meets Sally Seton (her childhood friend), Elizabeth (Clarissa's daughter), Richard Dalloway (Clarissa's husband) and Septimus Warren Smith (a man suffering from shell shock from WW1) among others. Lack of action is fully compensated by the extraction of the inner workings of the character's consciousness. This aspect makes this book a success. We learn about their passions, guilt, anger, and loneliness. Transitions from one character to the next are seamless without losing the narration's flow. Especially admirable are the transitions occurring between strangers passing each other in Reagent's Park. I must admit that MRS DALLOWAY is not easy accessible as Woolf's prose can be convoluted and confusing to some readers. But I beg those who are struggling with this book to hang on. The ride can be difficult but the message is profound."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"A very enjoyable book - I visited the Woolf's original Hogarth Press printing press in England and it was amazing to stand next to it and actually touch it.

This is, in my opinion, a nearly perfect book, and here it receives an introduction truly worthy of it. David Bradshaw's introductory essay is the best I've ever read: illuminating and deeply engaging, it will prove an invaluable resource both for those new to Woolf's prose and for experienced readers. Indeed, because the introduction offers such lucid, rigorously researched social and historical context combined with profoundly insightful textual analysis, a careful reading of it will go a long way to eliminate the confusion and frustration described by some readers who, because of a lack of proper preparation, find Woolf's artistry intimidating. Whether you are reading for your own enjoyment or teaching the novel, you will not find a better edition."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I have to say that I love this book. When I first read it I was irritated by the stream of consciousness style but when I'd got a few pages in, it all made sense. The style is unique and engaging. What I also like is that it leaves so much to the reader's imagination and ingenuity to piece together the different strands that all come together at the evening party. With modern novels, you are spoon-fed or left to fill such large gaps that the experience can be frustrating. Not so here. It is beautifully written with much poetic prose, so much so that you find yourself going back to read it again and bathe in its stunning originality. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Clarissa Dalloway lives in a world in transition, though she and her friends, some of thirty years past, show little awareness of this, insulated by the transitory sameness of their everyday lives. Royalty, nobility, and aristocracy are still revered in quasi-religious fashion by the poor and the middle class, as well as by those who occupy elevated status.Nevertheless, the place of the most fortunate in this class-based society is in the process of being relegated to co-equal or even second place by the power of emerging technology, however garish its appearance and however gaudy its trite commercial messages. Post-WW I England seems as staid and unchanging as ever, but the products of modern science harnessed to an evermore aggressive capitalism threaten to transform traditional ways of life, much as the hopelessly ungainly machine called the \\"tank\\" hastened the end of the static nightmare of trench warfare. Septimus Smith may know this well, but who's to say.Tradition gives way to the garish and commercial; the English gentleman is superseded by the equally empty-headed captain of industry, and, oddly, the traditionally privileged are challenged by those who ostentatiously sacrifice for those impoverished and maimed by war. Though only vaguely evident, value, morality, and patterns of social organization are up for grabs.Still, for today, Clarissa Dalloway's life, now in its fifty-second year, is much as it has been since childhood. Solidity, stability, the everyday pleasures of walking in London, looking in shop windows and seeing the same people, though perhaps a bit wizened now, doing the same as they did forty years ago is fortifying and even beautiful. Not a religious woman, Clarissa nevertheless, sees beauty all around her, in everyday things, ordinary people, and commonplace events. While walking in London, she loves it all, including the strong and reliable bell of Big Ben.Time, however, suffuses all things. Recovered from an unspecified illness (Something to do with her heart?), she feels quite well, though she knows she is getting older. Still slender, attractive, and smartly dressed, she is content with herself and looking forward to this evening's party, one of many she hosts, largely because that's what one does, and she enjoys them.Early in the day, however, she has an unexpected visit from Peter Walsh, a suitor of thirty years ago. He seems much the same to her, and she to him. England is still an imperial power, and Peter has, true to family tradition, been a high-level administrator in India for nearly three decades. He is in London nominally to see lawyers about facilitating the divorce of a woman he says he loves. Given that she is married to a major in the Indian Army, this hardly seems a way to maintain the morale and commitment of troops charged with holding together the empire. Besides, it is obvious that Peter still loves Clarissa, and she is not oblivious to the good times that marriage to him might have brought. Good times, yes, but perhaps too many and too intense. She must retain some independence.At her party in the evening, the Prime Minister graciously makes an appearance, looking every inch a bookkeeper or mid-level clerk, though he does try. Sally Seton, the closest and most irreverent friend of Clarissa's youth, makes an unexpected appearance. Now married to an industrialist and the mother of five, one is led to wonder if marriage to a wealthy industrialist represents failure. After all, where does an industrialist, however wealthy, fit into the class system of England of the 1920's. Peter Walsh wonders much the same about himself as a colonial administrator. Is he a failure?All the while, and unbeknownst to all but an eminent physician at the party, Septimus Smith, war hero and promising member of the middle class, has succumbed to shell shock, making clear the limitations of traditional and commonplace medicine of the day. (In this regard, Virginia Woolf's novel is quite timely.)Mrs. Dalloway may be the most beautifully written novel I have ever read. Encompassing only a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway and her memories and the memories of others, it is in the deepest sense an existentialist masterpiece. What does it mean to be? If not in the ontological sense of a professional philosopher, than as a matter of getting by with a feeling that all these man-made social conventions that constitute our experiential world make some sort of sense and have some sort of purpose. The author's mastery of a stream-of-consciousness style is ideally suited to questions of just this sort, illuminating the fluidity behind an unchanging expression.Characters get older, but never seem to change. All around them, however, unnoticed and unacknowledged, there are hints that the world is becoming a massively different place. It's good,perhaps, that we get old and die. Settled creatures that we are, we would soon be unable to cope. Witness our too often ineffective responses to rapid change in the world of the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This book is A great Read but pay close attention to details and keep an open mind.

Holmes and Bradshaw), feminism (viewed, for instance, in the contrast between Elizabeth's potential and old Aunt Parry's reminisce of India), and homosexuality (Clarissa's impossible love of Sally Seton at Bourton) -- is the non-stop motion of the novel from the opening in the morning when Clarissa leaves her house to purchase flowers for her party to end of her party and the day.This motion manifests in the physical movement of various characters, the movement though the minds of the characters, and through time itself, in particular linear, interior, and flashback time. The unceasing motion within the novel and how Woolf manages it proves one of MRS. DALLOWAY's great pleasures. Being aware of and contemplating how Woolf works time -- something like a Congreve clock, down to the imprecision of the timekeeping -- adds to the enjoyment of the novel.Woolf employs linear, or the hours of the day, as a skeleton upon which she hangs the physical action, that being the movement of the characters around London and through the day. Big Ben and St. Margaret's chime at regular junctures in the novel. Many have written much concerning this aspect of time in MRS. DALLOWAY. Others have mapped the routes of Clarissa, Peter, Elizabeth, Septimus and Rezia. If you enjoy the novel, you might like to explore these commentaries. You can find some online.In addition to moving through the day, characters move back and forth in time. This is particularly true of Clarissa and Peter, who are about to see each other after a very long time. They once loved each other. Clarissa contemplated marrying Peter, until an important summer at her family's estate at Bourton when Richard Dalloway appeared. Peter still holds a passion for Clarissa and Clarissa rethinks her choice of husband. We view the events of that past time interpreted through their recollections. Septimus, the shell-shocked war veteran, and his wife Rezia also spend long passages remembering the war and their meeting. During these passages, real time may be a few moments but in the characters' minds days, months, and seasons pass.Most striking, however, is how Woolf moves the cerebral action of the novel, which is the thoughts of the characters, from individual to individual, including an array of minor characters. Switching from person to person can be a tricky technique that when done unskillfully results in confusion. So deftly does Woolf make the numerous transitions, you never find yourself lost in the novel. Doubtless, the aeroplane that follows the belching automobile is what first comes to mind. Speculation as to the lettering jump from person to person in the streets until finally Rezia urges delusional Septimus to look up and get out of himself.Recommended as a landmark of interior monologue and stream of conscious that is more approachable than RichardsonPilgrimage: v. 1 (Virago Modern Classics)or JoyceUlysses (Modern Library), and for the sheer pleasure of reading brilliant fiction that changed modern literature."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This is a tough one to judge. Perhaps it's my age (I'm 21) but I don't think that's really an excuse. Throughout High School I had to read classics where it was written like Mrs. Dalloway. I'm not sure what it was, perhaps I don't understand what really is going on throughout this book or exactly what Virginia was trying to get at, but I couldn't get through this book. I read 80 pages into it and throughout the entire time I was completely lost and yes, even bored. Now, I don't think Virginia Woolf is a bad writer. Her work will forever be imprinted as one of the best and there are very few who compare to her. But with that said, and I think this is where I got turned off by this book, her words are wordy and she uses her ability to write to the very maximum. What I mean by that is, nothing is given to you.Not a word not a sentence. You have to read, and stop, think, translate and continue.And this was the difficulty that I had throughout the pages that I did get through.I simply didn't get what she was trying to say at the end of the sentences.She never exactly got straight to the point. There were always metaphors, constantly, along with symbolism that never ended. And at the end of each page I just wanted to continue on with the story and characters and as I got through their thoughts and their reflections of the lives they once lived, I was so drawn away from her visuals that I forgot what was really going on.And like I said before, it could be my age or it could simply be me. I have it a try and in the end, I just couldn't do it. I am sure that if I fully understood this book and appreciated what Virginia was doing throughout this book, I would haveenjoyed it.I personally can't recommend this book, unless you enjoy classic literature, then by all means, give it a try, but if you're stuck into toady's writing, I believe anyone would have a difficult time reading this book, just like I have."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I needed this book for a college class.

Apologies to Virginia Woolf's fans out there."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"First of all, I must get this out of the way and say that Virginia Woolf is an absolutely amazing &quot;writer&quot;. She writes very well. Each sentence in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is precious. It is important to not try to speed-read this book, because that would really be an utterly shameful waste to Woolf's carefully structured sentences. Honestly, each sentence is gold. For people who are inspired to be writers themselves or those who simply adore good'o fashioned writing, this book is it! The content is densely squeezed into each line and the page really jumps out.However, (I know many Woolf specialists will disagree, but I have to say what is MY opinion) the content is somewhat on the weak and even occasionally confusing and incoherent side. Much of the content is about the mental traffic inside the characters. If you are looking for that, then this book will be your favorite. But if you are looking for a plot-rich book, this piece of literature will prove to be disappointing. There is not much &quot;story&quot; per se in here. Amazing emotions, sentiments and nostalgia flow in the novel. The last 25, 30 pages are overwhelming powerful in its conveyance of personal emotions about the time lost; lost youth and time that can only be touched in the mind but not by the hands. If you are feeling &quot;old&quot; and feeling you are &quot;getting old&quot;; if you want to read something that is reminiscing, this books truly is gold. Then why did I give only 3 stars? Plot-weak. I wish Virginia Woolf did spend more ink about the party, but maybe, just maybe, the climax is intendedly short to make the readers want more. More emotions, more drama, more grief. More of something that one cannot have anymore. A must read for anybody who wants to &quot;feel&quot;. Do not read this as a past-time."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"It is a great novel but I have some sympathy with those reviewers who thought they were seeing the emperor's clothes. Some of its greatness lies in its originality. It was brilliantly original in 1922. At that time the typical Anglo-American novel was a baggy monster full of long-winded digressions, unlikely coincidences, stilted speech, arch facetiousness, and melodramatic adventures. (There were exceptions, and the French and Russians were doing better).Woolf was experimenting with a new way of structuring a novel, using multiple points of view (she was inexpert at this and the shifts are often confusing) and letting the action of the plot take place in the minds of her characters. The sexual relationship between Clarissa and Sally is delicately but unmistakably hinted at.I suppose in a way I'm saying that a classic is entitled to be difficult to read. Michael Cunningham's \\"Hours\\" is easier going for a modern American reader, but the genius of Michael Cunningham lies partly in his ability to see and illuminate for us the genius of Vitginia Woolf."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Marcel Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" and James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" stand, to this day, as the two great classics of modern literature. In Proust, the stunning use of memory and sense perception, as well as the stream of consciousness narrative of the great \\"roman fleuve\\", marked the auspicious beginnings of a modern sensibility and technique in fiction. Similarly, Joyce's difficult, blasphemous and similarly streaming novel, set in the course of a single day and emanating from the perceiving mind of its narrator, carried forward this sensibility and technique. It is not surprising, then, that Virginia Woolf, while writing her brilliant and innovative \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", was reading these two authors at the time, for Woolf's novel stands as yet another masterful work of modern sensibility and technique, a classic in its own right.\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is set entirely during a single bright beautiful day in June, when Clarissa Dalloway is occupied by last minute preparations for a party she is having that evening. The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party. But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative. Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict. It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychological darkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings. But it is worth the effort, for \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is truly one of the great works of Twentieth century English literature, a modern novel that can stand comfortably, albeit diminuitively, next to The Great Marcel and the creator of Bloom's Day."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"\\"To the Lighthouse\\" was my first experience in reading Virginia Woolf, and from that dense text I (like many other readers) developed a view of her as an eccentric and unnecessarily difficult writer of the modernist avant-garde. However, this book changed my mind.Quite simply, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is one of the most complex, intricate, revelatory, intelligent, and beautiful books ever written. The story unfolds on a hot day in June, 1923, as the wealthy Clarissa Dalloway prepares to throw a party for her friends in the elite social world of aristocratic London. Meanwhile, a parallel series of events unfolds in which the shell-shocked World War I hero Septimus Smith teeters on the edge of sanity, and society itself. Throughout the day, other intriguing characters also enter the narrative through Woolf's characteristic stream-of-consciousness style. While that basic summary may sound rather unremarkable, there is so much more to \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" than I could possibly discuss here. Woolf turns the everyday observances and events of urban life into a complex imagistic web of social critiques, intense memories, historical traumas, and subtle discussions of the arbitrary nature of language, nationality, class, sanity, and identity.Now, I won't deny that this book is on the difficult side. Because of this, I would advise anyone embarking on their first journey into Woolf's world to purchase the Oxford World's Classics edition of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". Read the introduction carefully, and check the explanatory notes as you read through the text. While you won't catch everything on the first read, the introduction will help you understand some of the major images and themes of the text, and make your reading experience far more enjoyable. Don't worry if you sometimes forget who is talking, or encounter a strange digression. Those are the things that make books like this so rewarding to return to again and again.So, to summarize, if you want to have your eyes opened to some of the major issues of literary modernism, and experience a beautiful and entertaining book, I highly recommend you give \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" a chance."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Difficult, detailed, descriptive, dense -- an apt description of Virginia Woolf's prose. I've never been so annoyed by the difficulty and pointlessness of a story in my life. I thought Faulkner was difficult to read. At least his stories go somewhere, never mind that figuring out his plotlines is like putting together the pieces of a broken bottle. Even after I looked up the Cliff's Notes to see what it was that I hadn't picked up from this story, once I'd learned all I could learn, I still just didn't care."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I don't usually write reviews for books purchased from amazon, but since the kindle version of Mrs. Dalloway had no reviews, which made me skeptical to read this edition (I have had some bad experiences in reading some of the kindle editions that haven't been rated), I thought I would give it the review it deserves. This is a great edition, which seems to be perfectly faitfhfull to the original work. I very much enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Wolfe's effervescent imagination captured me; I enjoyed the motif of the leaves on the trees shimmering, shining and fluttering--to me, it seemed that each character shook in the wind with vitality; Clarissa, Peter, Sally, Septimus, Rezia, they all shimmered. Then, I enjoyed the contrasting motif of the clock--mechanical; represented by the characters of Richard, Dr. Bradshaw; it connected all the characters; it was reductionist; and ultimately completing, as all the characters come full circle (yes, even Septimus!).I enjoyed--rather, respect this novel for what it achieves. But I enjoyed The Great Gatsby (written in the same year) much, much more. I muse; I consider both novels to be similar in many ways. But, unfortunately, I found myself drifting in my own &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; while reading this novel and had to force myself to come back to the pages. Still, I recommend it.(Sorry if there seems to be a higher amount of semi-colons. But I told you that I had just finished reading it!)"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I had read three works of Virginia Woolf's - \\"Jacob's Room,\\" \\"A Room of One's Own\\" and \\"To The Lighthouse\\" but had not gotten around to reading her most famous, \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Promos for the new movie, \\"The Hours,\\" which is apparently based in part on \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" impressed me with Nicole Kidman's performance; so I decided to see the movie, a decision which was reinforced by its nomination for a number of Oscars. In order not to miss any references in the movie, I first read \\"Mrs Dalloway,\\" or tried to, as I ended up skimming it after the first 100 pages of its overall 192 page length. I have difficulties with my eyes and tend to skim if the material being read is not rewarding to me, and I do not have to discuss the material in a book group I belong to.\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" covers one day in the life of the title character who is the wife of a very well-to-do member of the British House of Commons. The time is the early 1920's; Mr. Dalloway is influential enough to at least occasionally receive the Prime Minister at his home and to be invited to functions of the royal family. That makes Mrs. Dalloway a social power house and at the end of this day she will give a dinner party which the Prime Minister is expected to attend. She has a coterie of servants experienced with such dinners but she characteristically reserves certain tasks to herself. The story starts as she walks from her home near Westminster Cathedral on a beautiful June day for exercise and to buy the flowers to be used at the dinner. If you have spent some time in central London, the places she goes and the differences between then and now are interesting.The story makes use of flashbacks, stream of consciousness techniques, and very long sentences strung together with commas, semi-colons and parentheses which can take a lot of work to decode, just as a recording of one's thoughts would be difficult to decode. The writing, except for the flashbacks, is similar to that of Henry James's \\"The Beast in the Jungle,\\" published ca 1900; Woolf's publication date of 1925 makes her work almost contemporary with that of James. James, however, never gives life to any character other than that of the lead male character, and then only to one facet of his life. Maureen Howard's introduction to my copy of the novel indicates that Woolf was consciously seeking to write in a new, unhackneyed form but hoped to avoid the appearance of the use of a \\"method.\\" I think that, like James, who wrote \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" in his \\"arty\\" period, Woolf's \\"art\\" has made her novel a less than satisfying story for me. There are similarities with Woolf's 1927 novel, \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" with its much more accessible main character, Mrs. Ramsay, and which was a much more interesting read for me as I developed a fondness for Mrs. Ramsay but not for Mrs. Dalloway. It seems to me that art was used with a lighter hand in the later novel and it is more intellectually stimulating.According to one source, Woolf was very much interested in getting the reader to experience the flow of time and used various devices to achieve this. The memory flashbacks allow the author to reach outside the events of the day and place some of the attendees at the dinner in perspective and tell how they have related to Mrs. Dalloway in the past, making their presence at the dinner more significant. In contrast, \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" and \\"To the Lighthouse\\" are more linear,covering very extended periods of time more in sequence.Both of the Woolf novels have a society matron as their central character and a dinner party takes a central place in both; in the later novel, however, the husband is an academic of much more modest means and all of the characters seem more accessible. The principal difference is that place, a home in the country, is also a character in the later work, while it is not so in the case of the Dalloway's London home.Both novels are also impacted by the First World War in a peripheral way as Woolf relates the woman's view of the war, concerned with loved ones, not battles or great political and patriotic themes.Woolf reaches outside Mrs Dalloway's society and brings in a character, Septimus Smith, who is rapidly losing his grip on reality, and his life will impact on Mrs. Dalloway's during the day. It is not clear what Woolf's motive for bringing Smith into the story was. Perhaps it was to contrast the somewhat artificial problems in Mrs. Dalloway's world, insulated as they were by wealth, to the real problems of Smith, having much more limited assets. The events of the day in the lives of Smith and his Italian wife, Lucrezia, bring \\"real life\\" into the dinner conversation that night and we read of Mrs. Dalloway's reaction to the intrusion into her party. Smith's doctors are picturedas self-interested charlatans and one of them as bringing fear into the lives of Smith and his wife. Perhaps there was a connection with the doctors in Woolf's own troubled life into which mental illness intruded as an unwelcome stranger. Woolf succeeds to some extent in making her characters \\"live\\" but less so, for me, than in her later novel.All in all a good read if you are very interested in the art if writing, less so if the story and characterization are your main interests. If you are going to read only one Woolf work, \\"To the Light House\\" is a better choice in my opinion.By the way, my wife and I went to see \\"The Hours\\" after I wrote the above. The connection between the movie and the novel, \\"Mrs Dalloway,\\" is very minor. There is some attempt to portray a small part of Woolf's life with her husband but overall the movie was more of a propaganda piece for homosexuality which never struck me as a theme in Woolf's writings. All of the major characters in the movie are portrayed as homosexuals. Hollywood loves anything that pushes the envelope."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Out of a gnawing curiosity after reading The Hours, I found my way to Mrs. Dalloway. The novel unfolds over one sultry day in London as Clarissa Dalloway is preparing for a party she will give in the evening. Smith has battled against mental illness from his experiences in World War II. Clarissa kicks off the day buying flowers for the party. As the day unravels, narration begins to shift to different characters. Clarissa reminisces of her entangled love relationships at Bourton. During her earlier years, Clarissa caught herself between her fianc&eacute;, Peter Walsh, her sensual female friend Sally Seton, and her husband Richard Dalloway. Much to Clarissa's surprise (as well as mine) is when all these old-time lovers reunion at the evening party in the presence of the Prime Minister. Peter Walsh shows up at Clarissa's doorstep right before the party after running off to India for some 25 years. The voluptuous Sally Seton also makes her entrance as Lady Rosseter. Present among the London elite are Sir Septimus Warren Smith and his wife. Smith has struggled with mental illness from his experiences of World War I. Incidents that lead to convergence of these characters is what makes the book a legacy (you have to read and find out).The book overall does not manifest a structure. Virginia Woolf has told the story through the multiple point of views from the different characters. The book also explores the hidden thoughts, feelings, and actions and relies on which to tell the story. At the end the story is seamlessly woven together with the party being the meeting points of all her characters. The pleasure of reading this book stems from seeing how these characters have gone their own separate and unpredictable ways, headed off in their own directions, pinned by memory, and cross path again at the evening party. If you find reading The Hours somewhat confusing, Mrs. Dalloway is even more so, between the shifts of characters. For a tiny book Woolf has written prose that is packed with figurative language, poetic expressions, vivid details and provocative tones. The sensual affair between Clarissa and Sally is hinted at in a stifling manner. Michael Cunningham graciously makes that affair come into fruition by putting Clarissa and Sally in the same bedroom in The Hours. The book is simple in plot, but rich in language. That is, certain level of attentiveness is required for reading. I'm convinced that Michael Cunningham must have inherited Woolf's idiosyncratic language and long sentences! And I think this is what many fellow reviewers refer as the &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; approach. But don't let that the big term turn you off and miss this great novel. A crafted work. 4.0 stars."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I am 24. Had I read Mrs. Dalloway any time in my teens, or very early 20s, I am sure the experience would have passed me by and I would have dismissed Ms. Woolf as an overindulged, deliberately obscure, unneccesarily wordy author of irrelevancies.Sometimes you have to be ready for a brush with genius. And I have no doubt that genius is what Virginia Woolf was. I read Mrs. Dalloway at the same time as Arundhati Roy's 'God of Small Things'. Now Ms. Roy is a fine writer. But the difference between the fine and the sublime is all the difference in the world.I cannot praise Mrs. Dalloway too highly. Its virtues have been lengthily extolled elsewhere (and to some, those same virtues are faults), so I will not repeat them here. But to me, whenever I think of Clarissa and those who touched her, I am filled with an unutterably sad, yet joyful love for life and for who we are.I do think you need to be ready for this book. As Virginia herself put it, the joy of age is not that you have experience, but that you can turn that experience slowly around in the light. If ever you feel like that, do read Mrs. Dalloway."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"First off, I need to start by saying that my review could not possibly do justice to Mrs Dalloway. This was both a complex and beautiful novel.I've been meaning to read Virginia Woolf for quite a while now since I am particular to the classics. I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book, but what I found here was a poetic and lyrical read.The book is told by an invisible narrator and as you read you get a glimpse into the thoughts of the characters within the story. It is a story about old regrets and old dreams. There are no chapter breaks and the book is a series of free flowing thoughts from one character to the next.The writing is disjointed, and though it was a short book, it's not one that can be read quickly.In Mrs Dalloway, we get a glimpse into a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman, as she plans a party. The book takes place in June during post-World War I England.As Clarissa prepares for her party that will take place that night, she has flashbacks and memories of her past. She remembers her love affair with a woman named Sally. Her ex-beau Peter Walsh stops in for a visit and tells Clarissa he is in love with a married woman. She finds herself sad at this confession and wonders what would have been if she had married Peter herself. Peter is actually still in love with Clarissa and has many regrets about losing her.Another character in the story is Septimus Warren Smith, who is a severely depressed veteran and is contemplating suicide. Although Clarissa never meets him, he is a main character in the book and his depression is taking over his life. I did feel bad for Septimus and Woolf does an excellent job at getting the reader into his head, to really see what his illness makes him feel like. His thoughts are frightening and sad.I found him the most touching character in the story, I felt bad for Septimus. I think sadly enough, Woolf may have written a manic depressive so well, since she suffered from mental illness and ultimately committed suicide herself.The story all comes together in the end at Clarissa's party, where friends from her past and as well as her present are gathered at her home.I have to mention, the final lines in this book are among my favorite of any book I've read.Like I said, I really enjoyed Woolf's style of writing. I think Mrs Dalloway is a book to be read slowly and to be savored. I bought this book at a library sale for about 25cents. Don't you love when you find gems like that?"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This was the first Woolf novel that I read and i am glad that it was. I was a college freshman who had just seen The Hours. I was immediately drawn to this author. After reading it the first time, it is possible to know what the basic story is about: a woman giving a party and wondering about the choices she has made in the past. But each reading helps bring out so many details that are easy to miss. People may claim this is a hard read, but Mrs. Woolf's books were NEVER meant to be read quickly. The word usage and details are so precise that is should be read slowly to appreciate it more. A great book to start getting into Woolf."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Like many readers, I picked this book up after reading The Hours and seeing the movie.The Hours can be appreciated separately from Mrs. Dalloway, and of course Mrs. Dalloway can be appreciated without The Hours. In both, an upper-middle-class woman plans a party, and the action (at least in the party sequence) takes place in the course of a single day. The difference between the two books is the poetry.Not to take anything away from Michael Cunningham, who is an outstanding novelist, but Woolf's unique and pioneering style is what makes this book memorable. Her lengthy sentences, her use of repetition, her interior monologues, her extended Homeric metaphors -- all remain in my mind. This book is not difficult to read if one lets oneself go and lets oneself luxuriate in Woolf's poetic prose.Lingering over the bright sunshine of London in 1923 and the finely honed manners and titles of nobility is the apprehension of the past and the fear of death. Mrs. Dalloway thinks about death and fears it, not so much religiously or philosophically, but simply because it would end her self-satisfied life. Septimus Smith sees death as a welcome end to his (clearly paranoid) delusions.Woolf brilliantly brings together the past, the present, and the lurking future."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Probably her best, and most known book, Mrs. Dalloway is by far the richest reading experience you will ever have if you choose to do yourself a favour and read it.Virginia Woolf excels in her imagery, language, rich vocabulary, allusions, the weaving of plot - or lack of it of thereof for that matter in a manner and style that are unsurpassed. She is certainly a pioneer, a precursor for whatever she has begun with her insane sentences, and fragments and questions.Stream of consciousness...? I don't think so, most people like to call it so, but she pops in and out of the text every now and then and she just keeps surprising you with her comments on the characters at the right time, when you are wondering, where did she go? What does it all mean?If you are looking for a meaningful plot, and action, forget it! Nothing happens in this book, but if you are a fan of refined prose, poetic imagery, exquisite language, read it, and you won't regret it.&quot;The world has raised its whip; where will it descend&quot;?Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dalloway)"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This book was published 74 years ago and was, in its day, somewhat experimental. It is not so dense and difficult as \\"Ulysses\\" (I believe Mrs. Woolf was reading Joyce and Proust at the time she was writing Mrs. Dalloway) and is much more accessible, not to mention shorter.I personally loved this book and found it liberating as a writer, to read the flowing, discursive narrative. The language is worked by a master craftsman and a pleasure to read. Without books like this, newer books like \\"Angela's Ashes\\" would not exist. Writers like Joyce, Woolf, and Dylan Thomas paved the way for prose such as Frank McCourt uses in his book on his Irish childhood.The book takes a little patience, I admit. It's not a book that \\"gets on with it.\\" It's a book for reading, sometimes as little as a page or two a day, and for savoring. I don't agree with some reviewers thinking it's a \\"woman's\\" book as opposed to a \\"man's\\" book. I don't agree with some of the didactic comments here, either... complaints about the use of parataxsis, for instance. People think paratactically, why not write that way? It requires that the reader shift gears somewhat, that's all.I found the book engaging all the way through. I think the great triumph of this book is that, given the distance - from the majority of present day readers - in time, culture, and class of the main character one can nonetheless find common ground internally with this attenuated woman and her worries and concerns. Yes, she is worried about the flowers for her party, but she is also worried about her daughter's apparent affection for another character.All in all, one of the finest books in the language.EKW"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Although I know that this book is a masterpiece of literature I liked it very much. I'm living in London now and found this book to be a wonderful evocation of the sights, sounds, and smells of the city--Westminster, Whitehall, Belgravia, Regents Park, etc., etc.-- especially as they must have been in the 20s. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what London is and was like."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is not on my list of favorite books. That is not to say that it is poorly written; to the contrary, Woolf does have a writing style worthy of merit. It's just not my cup of tea.Mrs. Dalloway was written in the beginnings of the modernistic movement in art and Woolf was writing in a style called \\"state-of-consciousness.\\" This style was revolutionary in it's day, and many readers have embraced it. I however did not. State-of-consciousness takes the reader on a meandering journey through the thoughts of the characters as the story progresses. What we get, for example, are the thoughts of Mrs. Dalloway as she goes down the street to buy flowers. As she walks down the street, we learn about the task at hand, then her mind goes to an interesting sight that she sees, then she sees someone that she knows and her thoughts go to that person. We then jump into the thoughts of that person for a period and get their perspective on things and back to the original person or to someone else.I found this style to be very confusing at first and it took me a good portion of the novel before I was comfortable with it.Overall, Mrs. Dalloway felt too abstract and odd to my way of reading. The story itself is not bad, although a bit depressing. The language and amount of detail do an admirable job of creating beautiful images in one's head and is the main reason that I did not rate the novel lower than what I rated it."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf's brilliant novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" originally entitled \\"The Hours,\\" is a vivid account of one woman's thoughts and actions during the course of a single day, June 23, 1923. That woman, Clarissa Dalloway, is the upper-middle class wife of Richard Dalloway, an affluent Member of Parliament. As the day begins, Clarissa, buys flowers for a dinner party she plans to give that evening, where prominent society guests and political figures will mingle, engaging in same banal conversation and banter as always. Clarissa is renowned as a hostess in London society, an asset to her husband.When Peter Walsh, a man she hasn't seen for thirty years, pays her a surprise visit, her thoughts take her back to the summer of 1890. She reflects on the choices she made as a young woman and how they shaped her life and effected her as a person.Juxtaposed upon Clarissa's story, her character and elite social position, is that of Septimus Warren Smith, a shell-shocked veteran of the First World War. While the prosperous Mrs. Dalloway purchases her flowers, Septimus sits in Regent's Park listening to the sparrows sing to him, in what he believes is Greek. He is still young, though shattered in spirit. Septimus is poor with few resources to improve his health or position in life. Yet the two individuals share common fears. Toward the end of the book, their lives intersect, for just a moment in time.Ms. Woolf uses flashbacks as a method to broaden the novel's timeframe from a day to a lifetime. She employs stream-of-consciousness, a relatively new literary device back then, to allow her characters' thoughts to travel back and forth in time, reflecting their emotions, and enriching them tremendously as complex personages. In literature, there are relatively few characters who approach the memorable Mrs. Dalloway in depth. The author believed that the remarkable, the momentous, could be found amongst the mundane details and occurrences of everyday life. Characters are tied together by time's thread, weaving a tapestry through the years. In the novel, Big Ben marks the passage of time, booming out the hour, a reminder that precious moments of life are passing as it tolls.Virginia Woolf is one of the most talented and noteworthy literary figures of the twentieth century. She is renowned as an innovative novelist, especially for her contribution to the development of the stream-of-consciousness narrative technique. Her prose is some of the most poetic I have ever read and her character development, especially in \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" is superb. She clearly demonstrates in her fiction and essays her concerns about many of the social and political issues of the early twentieth century.This is an outstanding novel. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Those were college days when Woolf was known to the literati but somewhat of an interestingly enigma to the world in general. Now her century has passed and her works and life are being recognized for the importance they deserve. Re-reading MRS. DALLOWAY reinforces past college memeories of just how dazzling a thinker, poet, writer, and personality she was. In so many ways MRS. DALLOWAY could be a memoir, mirroring Woolf's personality, artistry, and her advanced inspection of same sex love, the decay of aristocracy, the thin line between memory and imagination, fantasy and reality, the loneliness of genius, desire and conscious commitment to the standards of the day. All of these issues she compresses into one June day in London - a day for the preparation of one of the parties for which Clarissa Dalloway is so well known. \\"Successfully\\" married to a politician, the mother of a 17 year old beautiful daughter, she allows her thoughts to ramble about love that could have been, mental illness that leads to suicide, brackish and acerbic words from the Lords and Ladies invited, and a lover from the past who rises like a smoldering injured phoenix, making Clarissa reevaluate internally all that has been her life.There is story here, there are well drawn characters here, and the book can be read solely on the virtues of a novel construct. But if you want to really experience the magnificent wordsmith gifts of Virginia Woolf, then savour each page for the grace of the English language stretched into a seamless, protracted poem. This is book to read slowly, catching all the references to history as it blanketed England after WWI, when in 1923 the Bloomsbury group served as a quiet cocoon of intelligensia, when writing was an art in itself, more concerned with thoughts and ideas as words might mold them than in best selling, rapidly written and published transient pops in the vast sky of literature.Then Martha's answer to George's/Albee's question will make so very much sense."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Virginia Woolf's finest literary achievement."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of \\"The Hours.\\" If that's your motivation, don't waste your time. My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off. Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that \\"Ulysses\\" has. Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction. I recommend, however, that you read \\"To the Lighthouse\\". I may still be motivated to read the book version of \\"The Hours\\" given how great the movie was. But my taste for Woolf is all done now."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"My initial response of hostility, sustained through much of the book, mellowed some at the end. It is a sensitive story of love and madness, apparent mostly on afterthought. Still, I thought more of Faulkner than of this."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"...but this is, more or less, absolute rubbish. Mrs. Woolf really really wanted to be a great writer, and she had all these big ideas about tragedy and meaning and modernism and reality going around in her head (wow!) but she was just a spoilt upper class brat, who was unfortunately also pretentious and wanted to change the world, like the rest of the Bloomsbury mob. That's not to say that spoilt upper class brats can't come out with some good literature - T.S. Eliot and Vladimir Nabokov, for example, or Aldous Huxley - but compare this to Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; (which she completely ignorantly called a &quot;disaster&quot;) and there's nothing there. Slew through Joyce's painstakingly complex methods of experimentation and we find some hilarious, in-joke puns, brilliant psychological observations about ordinary people, true demonstrations of genius. Slew through Woolf's complexities and you find a few extremely unrealistic, unconvincing characters, and the message which Woolf brings across through them is full of prejudice and ignorance. Her insight into life and psychology is absolutely nil, and the emotional plot developments are deus ex machina at their worst, and completely unconvincing (especially the depiction of madness, and Mrs. Dalloway herself). The characters are a mixture of unconvincing descriptions and descriptions of unconvincing characters leading fake lives, but this includes the heroes and heroines, and she does not display any insight into their problems at all - her own values are equally ignorant and oh so sensitive. That's not a moralising judgement, just a factual one. Woolf is one of the many upper class British writers of the early 20th century who believed that money, education and delusions of grandeur made great literature - Waugh, Forster, Ford... the list goes on. Their legacy still remains and it's up to modern readers to filter out the period pieces like Woolf from the true geniuses. &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is in fact her worst novel (of the famous ones, at least), as &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; and &quot;The Waves&quot; are a bit more poetic and so, while certainly mediocre, not concerned with the psychological areas in which she completely fails to have any insight whatsoever. As such, this is a perfect example of everything that was wrong with early 20th century Brit lit."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I read the novel \\"The HoursThe Hours\\" where the assumptionis that Virginia Woolf killed herself. I just read a murder mystery where the solution was very differentA Breach of Promise (William Monk Novels).I changed my ideas about this book as a result. It is no longer the depressingdeath anthem that the modern history gives us, but a life affirmation of a femalein a male dominated society that would bleed the life out of her for being different.I think this understanding fits better."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Touching characters and a beautiful narrative."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I've never read any of Woolf's novels (or seen The Hours). I recently obtained a copy of Mrs. Dalloway. I was really looking forward to reading something by Virginia Woolf and I really liked the idea of the story taking place over the course of one day. Unfortunately, this was a very tedious and boring day. \\"Dense\\" is used in many of these reviews and it is certainly apt. I normally enjoy stream of consciousness, but the writing was extremely meandering and repetetive. At times I felt like I was reading some writing student's homework assignment where the task was to write as many metaphors for one thing as you possibly could. Descriptions were beaten to death. The absence of spacing to differentiate between each character's thought process makes for unnecessary confusion.This has really put me off wanting to read anything else written by Woolf if this is her regular style. Perhaps this was a poor choice as an introductory novel to her works? All I took away from this novel was the impression that Woolf had a huge obsession with semi-colons."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"I have been in search for an Everyman's Library edition of the novel Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, with the blue cloth binding. At first, I settled for a more modern edition, not at all what I truly wanted. But, when I decided to browse on Amazon, I found exactly what I was looking for. After purchasing it, I got the novel in the mail within four days of my purchase I am very pleased to have bought from Amazon and Restaurant of the Mind. Thank you again and I highly recommend them if ever they have a book or whatever you wish to buy."},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"This no-holds-barred tale of struggle and bravery had me hooked from page 1. The raw emotions, the vivid scenes of battle, the intrigue and the romance, all bring this intense historical drama to life in a way that no other author can match. You go, girl!"},{"Title":"Mrs Dalloway (Essential Penguin 2)","review":"Imagine an epic struggle between Vampire and Hobbit for control of the Southern Hemisphere, Dragons used as a luxury form of mass air transit, and Cotton Candy promoted as the new super-food. While none of the aforementioned situations are found within the pages of Mrs. Dalloway, serious though, wouldn't they make a great premise for a book? We'll make some calls... Unfortunately, while reading Virginia Woolf's famed novel all we could do was imagine a more interesting plot.Going in we knew this was going to be a struggle and after only a few pages our concerns were realized - there would be no conceivable way for us to finish Mrs. Dalloway with a smile. The novel possesses a certain charm, but we just couldn't get into the characters or the plot. As interesting as pre-party planning can be (don't ask us about The Christmas Extravaganza 2008... seriously, don't ask us. It's a very sore topic), Clarissa Dalloway's activities and reflections were in a word: quite boring. Don't say it.The themes addressed in this novel are admirable and quite weighty. However, the way in which the subject matters are presented makes us wonder if addressing FAWR (Falling Asleep While Reading) wouldn't have been a more prudent concern. Fortunately for Mrs. Dalloway, her party isn't a total bust and frankly, we'd have accepted an invitation. Maybe we're giving away something here, but we needed a little more content for this review. There're only so many interesting way to say, \\"Thanks, but no thanks.\\"Virginia's Woolf's, To the Lighthouse is staring longingly from our 2011 TBR pile, but our return gaze reflects heavy eyelids and a small stream of spittle on the left side of our mouth."},{"Title":"Reconstructing Citizenship: The Politics of Nationality Reform and Immigration in Contemporary France (Suny Series in National Identities)","review":"I've never thought much of academic political histories. I depend on similiar books as a remedy to my sleeping disorder. But Ms Feldblum's book has turned my head. This is one fabulous read. Since reading &quot;Reconstructing&quot; I've been able to enchant my co-workers with tales of French immigration. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Reconstructing Citizenship: The Politics of Nationality Reform and Immigration in Contemporary France (Suny Series in National Identities)","review":"This is a fascinating book about citizenship and immigration. Given the growing importance of this area, I found this book to be quite useful. I do a fair amount of work in Washington, D.C. on immigrants and benefits, but I didn't know much about the area from a theory perspective. This book was great for that."},{"Title":"NYC LIFE GOING ON","review":"Compiled by the staff of the Syracuse University Press and specifically dedicated to the men, women and children of New York City on 9/11/02, NYC Life Going On is a moving photographic testimony of daily life and common joys, problems, sorrows, and challenges in New York City one year after the devastating September 11th attacks. Almost no captions distract from the full-color pictures, which vividly and eloquently speak for themselves, evoking a universal characterization of humanity's can-do spirit. NYC Life Going On is a very highly recommended addition to personal and community library Photo Journalism collections and a welcome visually oriented memorial tribute to a city and a people dealing with and recovering from a horrific and unexpected experience."},{"Title":"Brendan,","review":"This continues the story of the O'Nollan family. The other books, Reasons for Gladness, Patter and the Rock, and Bright Windows tell the story of a loving Irish Cop and his family. If you like heartwarming stories with good morals, this is a series you will like. I grew up in a small town which did not have a book store, just the public library. Reasons for Gladness was the first book I ever purchased. I loved the story in McCall's magazine so much I just had to have the book. Then I had to have the others."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I just about cried when I tasted the Hungarian cabbage rolls in this book. I bought this cookbook a few years back and this is my favorite! I never was graced with being able to spend a day with my grandmother in the kitchen learning her recipes that she brought over from Hungary. Jeff has nailed them! I have spent years tasting other peoples Hungarian recepies and none have come close. The secrete is in the paprika gravy!For anyone who is truly looking for an international cookbook, this is a must! My family and I have had more fun with this cookbook trying all the different recepies from all over the wolrld.PBS....Bring back Jeff Smith.... Jeff if you are out there...we miss you in Cleveland!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"My family has been using this cookbook for about 15 years, and we all love it. My brother and I started using it as high school kids, and loved experimenting with the enormous range of completely different cuisines represented here. When we left home our parents gave us each copies of this book, and it's still a favorite; now my husband loves the Filipino egg rolls, and the authentic Ethiopian section brings back fond memories of time I spent working there.Over the years we've tried a high proportion of the recipes, and they've never failed or turned out &quot;wrong.&quot; You will need access to some unusual ingredients, but many come in dried forms you could order over the internet if the selection in your town is limited. There's a helpful ingredient dictionary that suggests some substitutions. Any unfamilar techniques are explained so clearly, it's hard for even an inexperienced cook to mess things up. This is a great cookbook for any adventurous eater!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"If you can't get your kids interested in history or world events, or better yet if they are, this cookbook is just what you're looking for. No lesson about the world at large is complete until we connect with those we hear about. Food is the ultimate form of communication, and this book communicates brilliantly. Every listing of recipes from an ethinic group in this book includes a map of their place of origin, and details of what great events of history shaped them. They also give the dates of major surges of immigration to the US for each group. Help your family develop a hunger for history with this book. You won't regret anything but the pounds (this stuff is delicious!)."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"When I was a kid I used to come home and turn on the Frugal Gourmet as he whipped up his meals. It was the first cooking show that I had ever seen and I still have fond memories of it. I bought this cookbook at a second hand store and have loved it ever since. The book breaksdown into chapters introducing and including simple recipes from different countries. Each dish is a typical, common meal that you would be served if you were there. The food is easy to make and all the ingredients are things you should be able to pick up in the local grocery store. The countries range from Cuba, Mexico, USA to Spain, Italy, Norway, France and then on to Ethiopia, Thailand, Egypt, Philippines, and Japan. There are around 60 or so countries represented and I have attempted to try foods from each. I love especially the Cuban, Hungarian, and German dishes. I really like how Smith puts his personal touch in describing fondly some of the reasons he chose the recipes.The Frugal Gourmet has a series of cook books but this one is a good starter. This is great for someone who likes comfort food, and cuisine from different countries."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"This book is an excellent tool to sample cuisines from numerous cultures. Each of the recipes that I have tried are excellent. Also, there is a background of not only each culture, but often a background of each dish.The book is not only a good cookbook, but also a fun and educational read."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"My title blurb is a funny quote I remembered, Jeff Smith spoke on his entertaining PBS show. Before 'The Food Network' we had the witty and talented 'Frugal Gourmet'. This book deals with some simplistic, yet very good classic old world dishes. Nothing fancy, just great traditional food!This is yet another excellent cook book by Jeff Smith! It's full of great recipes and stories by a very talented cook and writer. This one focuses on old world cooking. I have used many of these recipes and found them to be very good. Being a home grown cook myself and having had many of my grandmother's classic recipes handed down to me, I found this book to be very helpful in expanding my culinary taste buds.Jeff Smith entertained us for years on his PBS program 'The Frugal Gourmet'. Not only did he teach us many savory dishes, he also educated us. Not satisfied with just cooking delicious meals for his viewers, he would give detailed history lessons about the origins of the dish and made it all a lot of fun!This may be Mr. Smiths best cook book and it is a worthy edition to everyone's cook book library. I own and have read many, if not all of his cook books, not only for the man's knowledge of cooking, but his incredible wit! This guy was funny and I would have loved to have hung out and throw a few beers down with him.Unfortunately, this man had some very seriously bad press released about his personal life and well..... I am not one to spread rumors.....he seemed like a great guy and sadly he died before he was able to clear his name.R.I.P. Frugs!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I refer to this book often! It's a MUST HAVE! Of course I adore Jeff Smith and his assistant Craig. I used to watch them regularly on PBS. In fact, there have been many times while I was reading one of the recipes or the little anecdotes that he has written when describing the recipes and I could practically hear his voice, reading it to me.The history lessons given in the book just by themselves are awesome! I learned more reading this book (and actually remember it) than I did in high school history! I may not remember everything about the War of 1812 but I can sure tell you about who the Basque people are and what Haggis is!My three favorite books are:Better Homes &amp; Gardens &quot;New Cook Book&quot;, &quot;The L L Bean Cook Book&quot; and Jeff Smith's &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Immigrant Ancestors&quot;. These are the books that I refer to most!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I love this cookbook! I just pulled it out to look something up, noticed how torn up it has gotten, and thought I'd look online for a replacement copy. This is, hands down, my favorite and most used cookbook. Recipes are easy to follow and delicious. I've had \\"authentic\\" cooking from some of the countries included, so I can vouch for the fact that the recipes are right on target."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"The Mexican section of this book is well worn in my house, even though I own over 15 Mexican cookbooks -- Jeff's just hit the spot. The Armenian recipes are wonderful, and my Armenia FIL loved the meals. The only sadness I have with this book is the Three Ancient Cuisines that are missing! I love to take a country and make an entire meal and my family loves it, too. I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook, which I can read like a novel."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I have always been pleased with Amazon.com and their efficiency.Despite all the public shunning of the author, Jeff Smith, I have always admired his experience and knowledge in cooking and in culture. This book has been criticized by many \\"gourmets\\" for being too vague and not being precise with the recipies. I say \\"hog wash\\" those \\"gourmets\\" have to be told how much and when and they can't feel the recipe. Smith has combined his knowledge with cooking as an artist does paint for a canvas. Sharing the knowledge was a gift, for sure. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I never really watched The Frugal Gourmet when he was featured on Public TV. One of my Amazon Friends recently reviewed this book, and that review piqued my interest. I recently received my copy of Jeff Smith's \\"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors: Recipes You Should Have Gotten from Your Grandmother.\\" What a fascinating concept and what a nice set of recipes!Smith begins by laying out the methodology of this book (Page 2): \\"We have traveled all over this great nation eating with immigrants, many of them grandmas, who know that it is terribly important to retain those characteristics of our immigrant ancestry, characteristics that will help us remember who we are.\\" Hence, we have a cook book with a small set of recipes from many countries, from Armenia to the Basque region of Spain to Ethiopia to Jamaica to Ireland to Korea to Lebanon and through Yugoslavia (countries are in alphabetical order). I just received the book and have not had a chance to try out any recipes. But there are a number that I already find tempting and expect to begin trying these out soon!The first part of the book is a standard discussion of cooking tools needed, a glossary of ingredients and condiments, and an essay on the immigrant experience. But it's the recipes that are the heart of this book. Let's take a look at a few examples.Armenian Stuffed Meatballs. Ooh. This looks like some work, but it seems scrumptious! A meatball within a meatball. The inner meatball is made from ground lamb (or beef), onions, green bell paper, parsley, pine nuts, paprika, mint leaves, and a set of spices. After cooking these and rolling small meatballs, one makes the outer meatball, with a different set of ingredients.From Ethiopia, Lamb and Cardamom. Some onions, a couple Ethiopian sauces (recipes included in this section), lamb, cumin, cardamom seeds, ginger, garlic, salt and pepper. Once one has assembled the ingredients this looks pretty straightforward--and tasty!A Lebanese dish, Baked Lamb Kibbe. Boneless leg of lamb, butter, pine nuts, onion, cinnamon, allspice, salt and pepper. Sautee the lamb in butter, and then assemble Kibbe (recipe on the preceding page), and move ahead. Again, a recipe that really sounds delicious.And so on. It's fun just to skim recipes from different countries and enjoy contemplating what each would taste like! The book ends with a quotation from the author (Page 574): \\"The point of this book is simple. If we do not understand our ancestral table, I doubt that we can understand our history.\\" Maybe a bit overstated, but that sums up the author's philosophy in this volume. Worth taking a look at!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I received this book as a gift. It is a terrific collection of some of the best recipes from various cultures. Jeff Smith provides well-researched commentary on the country of origin and shows a true love for the dishes he presents. Oh, and yes, I tried out some of the recipes. The flan and sauerbrauten were great. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"This is a wonderful collection of recipes many of us who are first generation ethnic Americans grew up with. I understand the author passed away in 2004 but not without leaving many fond memories of his FRUGAL GOURMET cooking show which used to air on PBS some time ago. I used to watch his show while living in New Orleans between 1982 and 1997. Of course my favorite section is THE LITHUANIAN IMMIGRANTS which lists recipes for Pressed Cheese (Suris), Kugelis Potato Pudding, Fresh Sausage (Kielbasa), Smoked Sausages (Kielbasa), Cold Beet Soup (Saltibarsciai), Pork in Gelatin (Koselina Saltiena) and Raw Sauerkraut with Caraway. The author acknowledges \\"Father Peter, Ann Challan, and the kind people of St. Casimir's Lithuanian Church in Pittston, Pennsylvania\\" for this section. My husband's favorites, of course, would be THE GERMAN IMMIGRANTS and THE IRISH IMMIGRANTS. The author acknowledges Bavarian Meats in Seattle and Herman Berghoff of Berghoff's German Restaurant in Chicago for the German section and Doyle's Irish Restaurant and Bar in Boston for the Irish section. The author really celebrates over 35 ethnic groups not only noting some of their best recipes but giving mini geography lessons and short descriptions of each individual culture before getting into detailing their recipes. I strongly recommend this book for taste treats around the world!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"How could a book on immigrant ancestors leave out the English? He covers Irish, Scottish, And Welsh immigrant recipes as well as recipes from many other cultures. Did all the English settlers become United Empire Loyalists and move north to Canada? I'm a Canadian and we ignore the English here as well. We have days celebrating every other culture except the English - Carribanna (in Toronto), Black history month, St. Patricks Day, Robbie Burns Day, St. Jean Baptiste Day (especially in Quebec) but no St. Davids Day (I don't even know when it is).It's a good book but I guess I'll just have to look elsewhere for recipes for bangers and mash, bubble and squeak, fish and chips, trifle, etc."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I got this book several years ago when it came out in the first printing. An astounding compilation of recipes from all over the world. I have checked the authenticity of the recipes with friends of ethnic background, and they are pretty true. The nice thing about this book is that there are some recommendations for where you can find ethnic ingredients, or close substitutes. This is important for some cuisines such as Ethiopian, Thai, and regional eastern Indian cooking where the original ingredients are important for achieving authentic taste. The food I have prepared using the recipes in this book tastes pretty close to what I have gotten in good ethnic restaurants, but some of the recipes are easier to duplicate than others. I did have to take a couple or three stabs at some of the recipes, especially ones with complex steps, to get them to come out as a native would prepare them. Quite a few of the recipes are easy enough for a beginning or intermediate cook, but overall I would say this is for experienced cooks who don't have to follow a recipe exactly, and who have savvy with regard to interpretation of \\"doneness\\" and texture/consistency. This book in hardback edition (when you can get it) makes a fantastic unique, well remembered wedding gift, especially if one of the spouses is really into cooking. It also is great entertaining reading as a book. In paperback, it makes a great gift along with a care package of ethnic spices."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I can't remember where or how I got a copy of this cookbook when it came out in the early 90's, but I have used it so many times and made so many recipes that is it starting to fall apart. Even in high school I was able to make many of the recipes. I loved the fact that they are very true to the culture and the original recipes found in the various countries.One reviewer mentioned that she had problems getting the ingredients and she was not happy that it lacks pictures of the dishes. This cookbook is more than just a picture book like many cookbooks are, it is an educational tool. As to the fact that some of the ingredients she needed were not available to her, I think that it kinda goes along with the fact that these are authentic recipes, not ones easily made with cheap ingredients. This cookbook taught me how to make a roux, the best Guinness Stew ever, how wonderful curry is, the most mouth watering Beef Strogonoff (which since I could not find kasha, I just used barley), and awesome meat pies. The New York Style Cheesecake is pretty good too.I suggest this cookbook to anyone interested in ethnic cuisine. Most of the recipes can be made by the average cook, but they do take a lot of time to make. I am a librarian, so I am lucky I know how to fix my book, or I would be buying a new copy."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"If you are into recipes other than burgers this is a great cookbook. Many cultures are covered with easy recipes using ingredients found in any supermarket. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"I am the proud owner of every cookbook written by Jeff Smith. Frugal was what drew my attention and the Frugal Gourmet on our Immigrant Ancestors is worthy of every penny spent. The appeal of this book is the enticing photos and the wonderful history lesson that Mr. Smith provided for each recipe, granting the reader and the aspiring cook (that wants to provide something new and unique experience on the dinner table) a tale of the creation of the meal. He has insightful little chapters that explain Mexican, Korean, Welsh, Persian etc. food. Never is it just one recipe and your left looking for sides, Mr. Smith has always provided the entire menu for a great sit down dinner, and succeeds in keeping the meal as close to the original recipe of the country."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"My uncle and aunt had an old book like this but they loaned it to someone who tore out a bunch of receipe pages.

Growing up, my grandmothers cooked their favorite foods and passed along some of the recipes. Now we live apart and grandparents are gone. This cookbook includes several of their recipes (perogies in the Polish section, potato pancakes in several chapters, among others) and many more that are just good home cooking from scratch. Sure, Jeff Smith included lard in many of the recipes, and he also included background about what lard is, how it is used, how to render it, and how to substitute for it. It is obvious that he published this cookbook in the mid-90's before the obesity epidemic became an issue so some recipes could be easily modified by the reader to be lower in fat. This cookbook is good for learning or just getting a refresher on the old cooking techniques. Another gem in this book is the recipes and cooking technique for dishes from scratch that Indian and Asian restaurants include on their menus. All of the recipes for dishes that I'm familiar with look like they have good ingredients, proportions, preparation and cooking methods so that they will always be successful, not flop. I strongly recommend this cookbook to anyone who wants a good resource for traditional recipes and cooking instruction from a wide range of ethnic cuisines."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"Excellent recipes, currently exploring Cuban recipes.

It's certainly well organized, the recipes seem authentic and the extensive cultural/historical notes may be of interest to some readers. I was very turned off, however, by the lack of pictures and the extensive use of uncommon or hard-to-find ingredients.I know my area isn't known for it's multiculturalism and maybe these things are easier to find in more metropolitan areas, but it was a real turn-off to not be able to make a bunch of these recipes without special-order items. The lack of pictures seemed particularly odd, given that most of these aren't recipes the average cook is likely to be familiar with; one would think that pictures would be especially helpful and appropriate in such a case."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors","review":"Pleased with the book but was disapointed with the fact that I thought that I was buying a Hard Cover not the soft cover that arrived."},{"Title":"Red rust","review":"I received my purchase in a timely manner. I am currently reading the book and find it quite interesting."},{"Title":"In Disgrace","review":"Famous for her connections as La Peche, the last model and muse of the late artist Phillipe Faucon, naughty Natasha Linnett finds herself comfortably rich from the sale of his looted paintings. With three secret admirers, rubber doggie bones, a lover with a foot fetish and plenty of disciplining men who are happy to dominate her, what more could a girl like Natasha want? (Other than to enjoy the fruits of her labour with lots of kinky sex and to stay out of the public eye?)After Natasha enjoys a romp with Percy Ottershaw in Regent's park, and a good spanking, her decision to keep a low profile is squashed when her saucy antics are captured on film. Glutton for punishment, we follow the \`lengths' she has to go through to retrieve the photo's from discerning paparazzi Andy Devlin. Will she get them back, before her face (or rather bare bottom) is splashed all over the newspapers? And who is the third illusive secret admirer she cannot track down?If you are a fan of Penny Birch's work already, as many of you are, you will no doubt be familiar with the amazing high level of sexual content there is in her books. If, like me, you are new to this genre, then you're in for a real treat. Penny Birch is the mistress of erotica and a wonderfully talented writer. Drawing information from a mixture of real life experiences and a vivid imagination, Penny Birch delves into the explicit thoughts and fantasies of down to earth characters in contemporary, believable settings. Moreover, In Disgrace has a strong story line, a gift when it comes to attracting readers and clearly evident in the quality and quantity of her writing. I liked the fact that this story follows on from Peach and When she was Bad, and for that added touch, you will often find Penny Birch's characters know and interact with each other. Even six books later, Natasha Linnett is truly a bad girl -- who must be punished.A spanking good read!Don't miss my review of Playthings"},{"Title":"In Disgrace","review":"Natasha Linnet is back and in fine form. One of Penny Birch's on-going heroines, she enjoys one of her best outings in this book. She is on top of the world, financially independent and very sassy in her approach to satisfying her needs, most of which include spankings and dirty sex, from both male and female. Penny displays a good level of energy in this book, which has not only a good plot, but a strong storyline that allows Natasha a wide variety of adventures. As usual, she gets more than she bargained for, but that's fine with her. Penny's skill at describing scenes, both the actual and those that Natasha fantasises about, is as good as or better than it has ever been. I enjoyed both. Penny strikes the perfect chord between fun and nasty, but never too nasty. Natasha's old friends Monty and Percy make appearances, and are up to their usual antics. Penny also introduces a couple of new characters who have a few new twists on how to deal with Natasha. This book can be read as a first time, stand-alone story, or as part of the \\"Natasha cycle\\", which started with \\"Brat\\". Either way, it's a lot of fun, and well up to Penny's high standards."},{"Title":"With a Little Luck","review":"I'm not a regular fan of Janet Dailey. Her characters and story lines are too predictable in the standard, tiresome Harlequin mold. \\"Americana\\" does little to break that mold.Dailey's male protagonists are uniformly wealthy as well as just too \\"chiseled\\" of countenance and physique; too cocksure and unerringly able to know what the heroine is feeling before she herself does. These guys are simply too \\"compellingly male\\" to be believable.The heroines are predictably portrayed as insecure \\"good girls,\\" unaware of their actual striking good looks while possessing of wholesome, sweet personalities. Often they are presented as being in shaky financial straits. Though Eve Rowland is spared that last trait, she nonetheless toes the line as one who considers herself a \\"brown mouse\\" not worthy of even the passing glance of a man as vital as Luck McClure.The rest is even more predictable. Said hero is able, through brute-force application of his potent masculinity along with liberal \\"quirks\\" of the mouth and eyebrows, to overcome said reticence and charm our heroine, despite growing rebellion against her feelings, into a \\"devastating\\" kiss that gets her to reassessing her romantic priorities, etc., etc., etc. Then they get engaged and, implicitly, soon married. Financial problems solved too.This book is redeemed for me partly by its setting in my home region of Northern Wisconsin. Credit Dailey with having done a good job of researching the locale and accurately portraying it and casting its denizens as the peripheral characters in the story. Surprisingly and delightfully, McClure's eight year-old son adds a nice touch to the story to set it a notch above the formulaic. I found \\"The Homeplace\\" (Iowa) palatable for the same reasons - personal familiarity with the locale and the inclusion of a precocious child."},{"Title":"With a Little Luck","review":"I love this book as much this time as all the times I read it before.

In 1972, Nicole Stephane, who held the film rights to Proust's work, asked Joseph Losey if he would like to work on a film version. Losey turned to Pinter to write the screenplay, and THE PROUST SCREENPLAY was written over the following year.The screenplay covers all of the Recherche, Pinter rejected any attempt to select one or two volumes as the center. The dramatic arc is twofold: on one hand the narrator moves toward disillusion in his personal life, but on the other hand all that has been lost (ultimately Time itself) is regained and then preserved permanently in the narrator's writing. The screenplay consists of 455 scenes, and just to give an idea of how compressed the narrative must be, the entire opening of \\"A la cote du chez Swann\\" up to \\"Un Amour de Swann\\" is represented in just fifteen pages of sparse script. But even with such trims, it is said that a film resulting from the screenplay would be about five hours long.The action shifts among eras from scene to scene. Marcel sees M. Vinteuil's daughter and her lover in 1893, and in the next scene Albertine is telling him in 1901 of her esteem for the couple. Many scenes are single images. Scenes 134 and 135 are only of Saint-Loup looking at a photograph, 136 is only of an empty dining room in a hotel, and then 137 is of a band of girls on a cliff top in Balbec. However, there is a considerable amount of substantial dialogue here, especially in the tortured relationship of Marcel and Albertine. Of course, as this is a dramatic work by Pinter, we find the infamous \\"Pinter pause\\", but generally the voice is that of Proust, not the grim English playwright.What a pity this film was never made. Although the common cinephile who has never read the Recherche wouldn't know the backstory of all characters and events, the film would still be a moving experience. For lovers of Proust's masterpiece, the screenplay is an opportunity to consider several portions of the novel in a new light due to Pinter's often relevatory telescoping of the story. At least the screenplay was printed and made widely available. If you've never read Proust, read him! And if you like the Recherche and are curious about a dramatization, do check out Pinter's creation."},{"Title":"The Proust Screenplay: a La Recherche Du Temps Perdu","review":"A screenplay of Proust's In Search of Lost Time sounds like a hopeless project. In the most recent translation, Proust's novel ran to over 4,000 pages. Reducing this to a screenplay would seem to require cuts of such magnitude that nothing of the novel would be left. Indeed, those movies that have been made of the novel usually are of a small part, like the Swann in Love section of Swann's Way. Pinter, however, managed to pull off the impossible. He concentrated on key events in the novel, and even more on key images. It is hard to say whether this would have worked with someone totally unfamilar with the material. However, presenting Proust's novel in any literal fashion would be impossible, and probably contrary to what he attempted to accomplish in his novel. Pinter's screenplay, for anyone who has read the novel, is a tremendous success. Unfortunately, it was never made into a movie."},{"Title":"The Proust Screenplay: a La Recherche Du Temps Perdu","review":"Harold Pinter's screenplay of Proust's novel is commendable. It does not try to cram too much in, but instead relies on a more imagistic adaptation. Raoul Ruiz's recent movie &quot;Time Regained&quot; wasn't dissimilar--although named after the last volume, it really drew from the whole work. However, I have to feel that even so, it was of little interest to those not familiar with the novel. I think a movie based on Pinter's screenplay, as good as the screenplay is, would suffer the same fate. It would be a visual tone poem for the Proust fan, capturing one thing but leaving out a dozen others. The meat of the novel is in the narration, and I'm afraid the best way to translate it to the screen would be through a miniseries, even a regular series. It's the only medium that stands a chance at duplicating the scope of the novel. One has to remember that its great length is no accident, it helps constitute the very nature of the story. Pinter ought to expand his screenplay, like Proust expanded his early drafts of the recherche, to give a greater impression of the time lost, and give it to the BBC or something."},{"Title":"The Proust Screenplay: a La Recherche Du Temps Perdu","review":"The Proust Screenplay is an imaginative and entertaining read that can be enjoyed whether or not you have traversed the pages from Swann's Way to Time Regained. In this condensed form you get a heightened sense of the dramatic action of the novel- its scandals, seductions, and heartbreaks- with Pinter's characteristic dark humour throughout.

Just be aware it's the same book."},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"While &quot;Magical Melons&quot; is not as good as its predecessor, it's a charming collection of stories that get into the lives of the other siblings and some friends of the Woodlawns. Although Caddie is still present, Clara, Tom, Warren, Hetty, and others get a little story as well.The book is interesting to a reader of more modern children's literature in its terminology, especially concerning Native Americans. But its heart is in the right place, and those who express negative opinions about the native people are shown to be wrong. The book is also somewhat religious, but not in a specific sense. Religion is just another part of the Woodlawns' lives, and the morals in the stories don't pound you on the head.I remember riding my bike 4 miles to another library to check this out when I was younger, and I still enjoy the stories today. Recommended reading for anyone that enjoyed &quot;Caddie Woodlawn.&quot;"},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family (originally titled \\"Magical Melons\\") was written several years after the award-winning best-selling original \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\". This is a more loosely connected selection of stories about Caddie and her family which covers a wider span than the original book and even overlaps a bit. Although it sounds a little funny, it works (and even makes sense) since these are true stories written down by Caddie's granddaughter.The stories are simple, but delightful. Not only do they give readers a glimpse into a different era (and in a way that isn't overly sanitized or modernized), but the stories are delightful in and of themselves. They are so real in illustrating the way children are and the way life is. And the icing on the cake is that they really happened.If you liked Caddie Woodlawn even a little, you certainly won't want to miss these gems."},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"Caddie Woodlawn is a hyper pre-teen, 10, who is a tom-boy and loves to do unlady-like things.

It, too, has been a delight to read at night as our family time together. The stories are entertaining as well as historically informative. The Woodlawn books are a treasure we will always cherish."},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"). If you liked the Newbery Award winning Caddie Woodlawn, you'll want to read the sequel, Caddie Woodlawn's Family, which includes fourteen further tales relating the adventures of that high-spirited, lovely redhead, Caddie Woodlawn, and her six siblings living on the Wisconsin frontier in the 1860s. Originally titled Magical Melons but renamed in 2000, probably to capitalize on the popularity of the original book, it is based on stories that the real Caddie Woodlawn told to her granddaughter who was the author. The original book covered one year, from 1864 to 1865, while the second covers a period of three years, from the fall of 1863 to the fall of 1866.As the book opens, Caddie is ten and her brother Tom is twelve. The seven Woodlawn children discover a secret horde of watermelons in the hay loft that seem to have appeared by magic long after melon season. They adopt a baby lamb, engage in a cattail fight, and attend a medicine show. The one story that does not really belong to Caddy, about a young preacher in Wisconsin doing a favor for a wandering Indian, came from a gentleman who told it to Mrs. Brink, and she included it as a tale from the local circuit rider Mr. Tanner. Mrs. Woodlawn has always had bad luck with Caddie and white dresses, so when she makes her a new one for the Independence Day celebration, will Caddie ruin it too? The common euphemism \\"golly\\" appears several times, but otherwise there is nothing objectionable but just a lot of humorous reading that will delight any child, especially one who is interested in learning about how life for children on the frontier was in the middle of the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"I bought this for my younger g'daughter to read and the older one has also enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Caddie Woodlawn's Family","review":"This was a collection of stories about the Woodlawns, not all were just about Caddie, but a few were about Hettie and some of her other sisters/brothers.

They are effective when put into practice, and the book is a relative fast read -- and re-read.I found this book more transforming than some others I've read because the author is truly focused on the reader, it seems, not her own story. She taps her own experience to make practical points, and conveys &quot;no B.S.&quot; sincerity in her efforts to support and affirm the reader.I feared this might be a &quot;makeover&quot; book with a smattering of broadly useful information (thought I could always pass it along to a woman friend). It's really the opposite -- largely helpful information for any person of size with just some specific tips for women only.

I love the dressing advice -- finding a uniform and sticking with it has saved me hundreds of dollars and hours of frustrations.What I find annoying are the lame bits about self-esteem and accepting yourself. It's become a rote line in the emerging field of plus-sized books. Don't get me wrong -- I believe we need all the encouragement and support we can get -- but it seemed cookie-cuttered. It didn't seem very personal.If you're look for fat-positive stories of success, stick to 'Wake up!, I'm Fat' by Camryn Manheim.

The body image exercises are very good.While raising one's self-esteem may be more complex for many than what is implied in Lippencott's eight steps, a well-rounded woman may well be on her way. Sometimes a person just needs a few tools (postivie affirmations, body image exercises) to reach a level of new-found confidence.

The outcome of these individual assessments is directly used to help enhance her self-image as well as the she image presents to the world.The book's fashion advice is not 'one-size-fits-all'. The reader can learn to identify her best features and customize her appearance to highlight them, no matter what they are or what her size.'Well Rounded' is a quick read, but with deep thought and an obvious sense of caring and outreach behind it.

One wonders if those with weight problems (with which I can empathise, since it is a lifelong situation of my own) will not stop to think that few genuine difficulties in any life were caused by, or would be decreased by, anything connected with one's weight.

I would have to agree with their choice. Melia introduces supermassive black holes in a novel fashion. Sure, we first came to know of their existence because of the weird behavior of some galaxies. But he shows how in the past few decades, they've come to represent a totally new and dominant category of objects throughout the universe. It now seems that many of them were here long before galaxies formed, and it looks like they were responsible for the formation of galaxies and structure in the universe. But the most amazing thing of all is what observational cosmology is now telling us. Is it true that the universe itself may be a giant black hole? Melia's book has the best discussion of this that I have yet seen.

The book is deliberately targeted at non-specialists; it didn't contain a single equation, as far as I can recall, and is written in a highly accessible style. I have absolutely NO scientific background, I never even took physics, but I found the book pretty easy to follow. Those with significant background in physics might be disappointed with the lack of mathematical exposition, but this book is a great place for novices to begin.Melia focuses on a number of topics: the nature of supermassive black holes, how they were discovered and how they are detected, theories of how they are formed, their role in galaxy formation, their release of plasma jets, and their ultimate fate. The last chapter also contains a fascinating digression on whether our universe itself is a black hole; I found this to be the most technically challenging part of the book, but it was thought-provoking. I finished the book feeling very excited about the technological advances that are allowing cosmologists to peer deeper and deeper into the cosmos with increasing accuracy. Melia does a great job of explaining the instruments scientists use to detect black holes, and he discusses a number of projects that are likely to be completed in the next few years. Finally, the book contained a number of terrific images that really helped me to follow the narrative. In conclusion, this book is a great place to start for those who want to learn more about these fascinating celestial objects, and at 130+ pages, it is a fairly quick read."},{"Title":"The Edge of Infinity: Supermassive Black Holes in the Universe","review":"Last week I was fortunate to hear Prof. Melia speak on the subject of his two new books, this title, and &quot;The Black Hole at the Center of Our Galaxy&quot; and was so impressed I rushed out to get copies of both.

McCullough 02/10/2012"},{"Title":"In Pursuit Of His Glory","review":"R.T. Kendall's autobiography, In Pursuit of his Glory, focuses on his twenty-five years of service as the preacher/pastor of Westminster Chapel in London. The book chronicles Kendall's ministerial journey - from pastor apprentice under the influence of Martin Lloyd Jones to his Word, Spirit, Power conferences in the United States and England in recent years.I first came in contact with R.T. Kendall's writings when I picked up his book The Christian and the Pharisee, in which Kendall corresponds with an Orthodox Jew. In The Christian and the Pharisee, Kendall's Calvinism and evangelistic fervor impressed me. I found his book God Meant it For Good, a book chronicling the life of Joseph, to be a helpful resource as I recently took my Sunday School class through Joseph's life. I also knew Kendall as the primary scholar who argues that John Calvin did not actually subscribe to the doctrine of \\"Limited Atonement' as now espoused by Calvinists. (Having analyzed the arguments of both sides of this debate, I am unsure whether or not Calvin believed the doctrine his followers so clearly articulated, though I do find Kendall's argumentation compelling.) I eventually discovered that Kendall received his Masters of Divinity at Southern Seminary, where I am currently an MDiv student.All these factors piqued my interest in Kendall as a minister, so I was happy to come across his autobiography. The story he unfolds in the book encouraged me and challenged me to more passionately pursue the glory of God in my life and ministry.In Pursuit of His Glory begins with Kendall's church background. Kendall came to faith in Christ while being raised in a devoted Nazarene family. He embraced the Arminianism of the Nazarene church until he claims Jesus met him in a spiritual vision and straightened out his theology! Kendall became a Calvinist (although not all five points) and began pastoring a Southern Baptist Church.During his time at Oxford, Kendall was given the opportunity to preach at Westminster Chapel only a few years after Martin Lloyd Jones had stepped down from the pulpit. It is fascinating to read Kendall's recollections of his early years at Westminster. He speaks highly of Jones and the mentoring he received.In the 1980's and 1990's, Kendall began to more fully embrace the Charismatic movement that had always been nascent in his spiritual life since the 1950's. During his tenure in London, Westminster moved in a decisively charismatic direction, even while retaining its Reformed heritage. Kendall tells of his experiences with Arthur Blessitt, Rodney Howard Browne, Paul Cain and John Wimber. He writes of his initial skepticism towards the \\"Toronto Blessing\\" even as he eventually came to see it as legitimate.The most helpful parts of Kendall's book for me spiritually were the closing chapters. Kendall's story is tinged with regret. Kendall regrets the small number of people he led to the Lord (over 400 doesn't seem small to me, though). He regrets the pain he sometimes put his family through. He regrets not seeing a true revival in the Chapel. The chapter \\"If I Could Turn the Clock Back\\" should be read by every pastor and minister.Kendall believes strongly in expository preaching, and his passion for this method of preaching is evident throughout the book. He believes in the sovereignty of God and the inerrancy of Scripture. He advocates openness to different manifestations of the Holy Spirit's power, reminding his readers of the strange expressions that fell upon New England during the time of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield.At times, Kendall seems to be the legitimate successor of Martin Lloyd Jones. At other times, he leads the Chapel on a very different path from the previous pastors. As much as I admire Lloyd Jones, I was unsettled by the reference to Westminster Chapel as a \\"preaching station,\\" more than a \\"church.\\" I was also taken aback by the reticence to personal evangelism that Kendall encountered from a congregation that had sat under the teachings of the highly evangelistic Lloyd Jones.Kendall's exuberance, authenticity, and personal testimony make it difficult for me to critique his autobiography. Still, I feel that his full-fledged support of much of the Charismatic agenda is unhelpful. I appreciate his desire to see the Charismatic movement supported by a strong, Calvinistic theological foundation. But there is a major difference between seeing a Charismatic expression springing up out of a strong theological foundation (the Great Awakening, for example) and trying to bless Charismatic expression by giving it some strong theology. One springs forth out of clear doctrinal teaching. The other is a house built on sand. The first is legitimate. The second is misguided.In Pursuit of His Glory is a good book for ministers and laypeople alike. Kendall is to be commended for writing such an honest, reflective autobiography, a book that proves its title to be true."},{"Title":"In Pursuit Of His Glory","review":"I found Dr. Kendall's autobiography an excellent and informative book to read. Especially interesting were the years he spent with Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones at Westminster Chapel in London and the influence that G. Campbell Morgan played on the history of the Chapel throughout the 20th century. Dr. Kendall's honesty about his struggles in ministry and the challenges he faced in trying to lead a very traditional congregation were very helpful. Also helpful was his chapter on sermon preparation and the topics he covered while preaching at the Chapel. I found the chapters on various charismatic leaders to be helpful as well, particularly as one views their involvement and influence on the growth an expansion of the church throughout the world in the late 1980s and throught the 90s. I highly recommend this fine book and the inspiration and challenge it brings."},{"Title":"In Pursuit Of His Glory","review":"This is an inspiring volume! Not quite a biography, but a personal history of 25 years of ministry at one of the world's best known churches, Westminster Chapel. Dr. Kendall's accounts of the changes that God brought to the Chapel during his ministry are sometimes nearly breathtaking. You feel his hurt, and you share his bliss as Dr. Kendall guides the tour of God's sovereign revelation of His glory during those turbulent, yet fulfilling years.We are able to meet such notable personalities as Arthur Blessitt, Billy Graham, Paul Cain and Rodney Howard-Browne. Not to mention the heart-felt and loving description of Dr. Kendall's predecessor and mentor, the larger-than-life Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.We also get a variety of eye-opening theological insights through examining some of the things which Dr. Kendall both taught and learned during those years. I appreciate the simplicity with which he explains what could be very complex theological ideas.A fascinating read. Pastors, theologians and Christians of many backgrounds will come to love Dr. Kendall, even if they have not had the opportunity to read any of his other outstanding books, and even if they happen to disagree with some of his theological conclusions. He is without question a man of God, and a man used mightily of God."},{"Title":"In Pursuit Of His Glory","review":"This is an excellent book, especially if one is interested in experiencing the glory of God as I am.

Their men have the look of permanent boyhood; their women are curvy and compliant. The Immis' gentle hedonism gives them poor preparation for the acts of bravery. When a dark shadow falls across their land, the Immis draft Odkin into heroism and then exile him for the trouble that follows in his heroic wake.A great chef can built extraordinary treats from everyday ingredients. That's what Wood does here with staples of the fantasy genre. There are wizards, mucled heroes, grunting bad guys, and lots more of the usual. But, with Wood's enjoyable art and quirky spirit, the story steers well clear of cliche.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The hunters","review":"Howard is brilliant with his story of suburbia friends going on their annual hunting trip whilst a police investigation surronding the pre-meditated brutal killing of a cop grips their city.

The author has done some fine work: His non-fiction works, &quot;The Zebra Killings&quot; and &quot;Five against the Rock&quot; are compelling reading as is his fiction novels, &quot;The Wardens&quot; and &quot;Dirt Rich&quot;.

In the first 16 years of Fields Medal (given every 4 years), 3 out of 4 winners were from Bourbaki Masters.3. The best book written on SET THEROY is still from Bourbaki.I strongly recommend any reputable world-class Reference Library to stock up on the entire series of Bourbaki.

Its goals are to help librarians evaluate the adequacy of existing collections, to provide reading guidance to young adults, and to assist in preparing bibliographies and reading lists. The book contains over 6,500 titles, about two-thirds of them non-fiction, that have been recommended for library collections by at least two of the nine most prominent young-adult book review sources. The citations to these titles contain full bibliographic information for identifying and ordering the books, along with a helpful, brief summary of content. The arrangement of the book is by broad subject, ranging from literary form to history and geography to recreation and sports. Almost 260 pages are devoted to indexes by author, title, and subject/grade level. Although it's unlikely that many parents will want to buy this book, partially because of price, it should be seriously considered for purchase by school and public librarians, along with the companion volume Best Books for Children."},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"This program will not make you a fluent speaker of Japanese; but usage of all three comprehensive Japanese courses probably would. What this particular program will do, it will certainly give a basic tourist level knowledge of Japanese. The narator will give you some tips on grammer so that you can put together sentences from the various words and phrases you learn on the program. Also it will teach you proper pronounciation of the words - which will help you to sound more native.Keep in mind that this review is only refering to the Pimsleur Conversational Japanese course which is only half as much as that found in the Comprehensive. Also if you get this program to start then move on to the Comprehensive package Pimsleur will reduce the price of the package, I forget by how much, but I remember it was a good deal compared to what others are selling it for.Let's put my thoughts on the program this way, if you want to learn to speak Japanese on your own this will really do the job as long as you stick to it. I would recommend doing each section twice before moving on to the next. But it really does work. I don't regret spending a penny on this program.I honestly can't think of any problems I've had with this program."},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I feel the lessons go a little too slowly for my taste but maybe that's because Japanese is my 2nd foreign language (after French) and Ive already developed some useful learning skills and shortcuts. You really can't go wrong though I recommend supplementing this with additional study of grammar (\\"Teach Yourself\\" series is good) as the conversations taught here are limited by necessity and it's sometimes difficult to make out what exactly the narrators are saying without a written transcript. You get 8 hours of Japanese for $32 so this is a cheap and very effective way to learn. Dont hesitate to buy :)"},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I have been trying to learn Japanese for sometime now. I've tried different computer programs that rate your pronunciation and have struggled with the language. These audio cds are very clear and teach you as though you are a child. As an adult, it is much harder to learn another language, but I have used some of the phrases I have learned on friends and they were impressed. I love how the cd's give instruction in a male's and female's voice."},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I bought this because I wanted to find something productive to do during my commute, so I needed a program that was audio only - no books, no computer. Even if the program is ponderously slow in the beginning, and constantly repeats some vocabulary through all the lessons while completely forgetting other words, it's not a bad way to learn a language. No matter what the popular opinion, the research shows that adults are capable of learning a language faster than a child, and I could have used some basic explanation on some of the grammatical concepts and rules - just a little would have helped me understand the rules around using the various \\"extra sounds\\" that were added (since there was no grammar I don't know what to call them!).My problem with this is that there were massive glaring holes in what was taught. How could I just spend 16 hours (practicing the lessons twice) and not learn how to ask where the bathroom is? Or how to say \\"What's the word for xxxxx in Japanese\\"? Or ask for water (instead of the constant focus on sake and beer)? Or know how to say he or she instead of just you and I? Or how to ask \\"How are you?\\" Or the words for right and left (kind of important when getting directions...). I've read that this set is the first sixteen lessons from a larger set - maybe all these critical basics are in later lessons. These lessons don't fully stand on their own, they leave you as a beginner able to communicate in some situations a traveler might encounter while leaving you completely unprepared for others.It works - but it's not enough. I'm off to find something a little more comprehensive, and after this experience it probably won't be Pimsleur."},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"If your planning to take a trip to japan and want to learn some phrases, this is a great tool if your learning period is limited. But I feel that more could have been done to help the listener * truly* understand the language.First and foremost, A 5-7 page transcript should be included of all the conversations. This would help for several reasons-People would better remember if they could read along-people wouldnt say words wrong when they cant make out what the speaker is saying ( for example n and d can sound similar)- the user would better understand particles which would help them form their own sentences-The user would understand present and negative tenses betterWithout the transcript, a person will learn to speak well and have the context for several useful conversations. But they may not catch on to some things that would make more sense if there was a romajii translation. For example, nanika is to drink, ka at the end of this root word is present tense. However, nanimasen ka is a question, ka is not part of the word nanimasen which is negative present tense. A listener would be hard pressed to understand this if they had no prior japanese knowledge."},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I will be working in Japan soon so I wanted to pick up some quick Japanese. Reading reviews this seemed like the product to get. I must say it is VERY good! I am about 1/3 through and I already know I will be purchasing the full comprehensive set after this. It does a great job of refreshing your memory and condensing a lot of information into 30 minute lessons and really focusing on pronunciation. The main drawback is that there really is only so much they can teach you on a few CDs, so while it teaches effectively, your skills will be pretty limited to what Pimsleur has decided to include in the lessons.

The cds helped me so much in terms of pronunciation, as well as rhythm of the language. I have tried other language cds, and I think the Pimsleur approach is so different and effective, that it's really worth the price difference.

However, for the price I thought I would at least try this first as an introduction. Their phonic structure is so different from English that I had my doubts but I was pleasently surprised how easy they made it by giving you the much needed repetition of repeating back, not just words or phrases, but actually breaking the words down and having you sound out one sound or part of the word first and then building on it. They also do a good job of continuing to incorporate previously learned material so that as long as you have about 80% of the lesson down you can still move on to the next one. The audio format also makes it extremely convienient to listen to during a commute or to have on an IPOD during a walk or jog.So who is this best suited for?

Want to understand more of Japanese film dialogs (especially Japanese film classics)? Simply want to begin learning an Asian language just for fun? This CD set is an inexpensive and great way to start the process. Learning Japanese first by ear is considerably less off-putting (and far more natural--hey, this is how Japanese children do it!) than initially attempting to learn it from up to three sets of ideograms. And if you take your time and never really leave a lesson behind until you comprehend each and every nano fragment, you will develop the skills to gateway directly to the next conversational level (unless you move to Japan, it is likely to be Pimsleur Japanese II, Comprehensive). Some specifics:The Pros:* Pimsleur Japanese language products are still pretty much the gold standard after over 20 years on the market.* These eight CDs (covering 16 half-hour lessons) remain one of the most extensive and rigorous self-learning audio tool for beginners available today. (But also have a look at, for example, basic Japanese lessons on YouTube.)* Grammar for the sake of grammar is avoided.* Each lesson starts with a challenge to understand a short conversation in Japanese which the enterprising student can go back to and should be able to understand at the end of a lesson.* Sprinkled throughout each lesson are questions to test your skill at forming new phases (\\"how would you say...?\\") which adds fun to the learning process. (It also, of course, builds confidence.)* Each lesson includes extensive repetition of and practice from prior lessons.* The system really works if you stay the course and repeat/review each lesson as often as it takes (which may be quite a few times).The Cons:* Interactive (pause/reverse/repeat) participation is mostly limited to computer platforms. (I recommend only passive listening while driving or jogging due to lesson intensity and corresponding dangerous distractions. I've had several close calls!)* You may/will also need:- A quality headset (forget ear buds and speakers!) to catch things. (A quick ear is a plus.)- The largest Japanese-English-Japanese dictionary you can find in hard copy (not the backpack sizes)--or can access easily off the Web--to help get the pronunciation of newly-introduced words/phrases straight the first time. (If you initially learn an incorrect pronunciation, it may be harder to later unlearn/relearn, especially if you have been practicing--incorrectly.)- A clue card with phonetic pronunciations for Japanese syllables--the syllable \\"bi\\" is pronounced \\"bee\\"; \\"ri\\" = \\"ree\\"; \\"ru\\" is pronounced \\"rue\\"; \\"to\\" = \\"toe\\"; etc. (Easily found on the Web if your dictionary does not include it.)- A notebook (like for any course of study) to record the essentials of and build on each lesson. (One way to minimize dial back to previous lessons.)* For reasons unknown, new words/phrases are usually introduced backward (initial pronunciation is from end to beginning). (A bit irritating.)* Speaker clarity and enunciation can be so-so compared with other CD sources (such as the GENKI textbook and workbook for elementary Japanese).* The lead male Japanese speaker is allowed to slur words the student is in the midst of trying to master for the first time and to speak much too rapidly for the beginning student to initially follow.* Pronunciation can be hit or miss. Both female and lead male Japanese speakers seem to have an aversion to pronouncing \\"r's\\"). Examples: beer (\\"bi-ru\\") often comes out as \\"bi-do\\"; dollar (\\"do-ru\\") can be called \\"do-due\\"; how much is it? (\\"i-ku-ra desu-ka\\") is often delivered as \\"i-ku-da-desu-ka\\"); I don't understand (\\"wa-ka-ri-ma-sen\\") can end up as \\"wa-ka-dee-ma-sen\\"); 6,000 (\\"ro-ku-sen\\") can come out as \\"lok-sen\\"; etc. Single-digit numbers seem to vary all over the map (but there is at least consensus that \\"five\\" is only to be called \\"go\\"). Recommend for now that you just pick your favorites (a dictionary comes in handy here) and stick with them.* The challenge of teasing out (from poor and too-rapid delivery) when to use \\"ga\\" ,\\"wa\\" or \\"o\\" only increases when the speakers are allowed to interchangeably use \\"wo\\"! (To cover all bases?)Do the Cons outweigh the Pros? Not at all. Just be prepared so there are no surprises later that can distract from what is a very intense learning experience.WILLIAM FLANIGAN"},{"Title":"Japanese, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I've played with a number of language systems, including Rosetta Stone (fun, but wildly expensive). Happily, I can report that the Pimsleur Japanese system (Conversational) \\"clicked\\" with the way my brain learns. There's something quite rewarding about being able to understand full sentences, and even brief conversation, by the end of the very first lesson, which I listened to while driving down the highway on a vacation. Each progressive session gives the user yet more empowerment and confidence that they could actually USE what's been learned if plopped down in Japan right this minute.I did feel the need to repeat each session since near the end, my brain was going into overload. However, when I resumed with the next session the following day, I was dead-on, whipping off correct responses to questions without hesitation.This may be one of the smartest purchases I've made in a long, long time (coming from someone not prone to gushing).Note: YES, the discount for purchasing additional Pimsleur Japanese programs IS included in the Amazon version, to answer previous posters' questions.

It is also good to see that some business people in America are not only making money but also upholding the principles of honesty, hard work, generosity, and &quot;seeking first the kingdom of God.&quot;Written in a rather unconventional style charachteristic of Floyd Coates himself, Our Toilets are Not for Customers is bold, blunt, irreverent, and at times &quot;politically incorrect.&quot; It is a snapshot of an American success story--a man who had an idea and made it work. But it is more than that. On the surface, it appears to be simply a funny collection of stories about a successful businessman. However, within these stories, there are brilliant insights into customer relations that extend beyond companies and businesses to the relations we have within our families and society at large. These principles of relationships between human beings and with God make up the real contribution of the book. Although business people should certainly read Our Toilets are Not for Customers, any person who interacts with others will enjoy and benefit from the book.Our Toilets are Not for Customers will make most readers laugh. It will make some angry. It will make a few repent. It will make all think."},{"Title":"Our Toilets Are Not For Customers","review":"The book was great.

I have a masters degree in management and work for a huge Fortune 500 company. If my firm would employ the insights the author shares, we would not have to worry about business, The book is very easy to read, enjoyable and entertaining, and full of valuable snippets of plain common sense. Everyone who runs a business or deals with customers of any sort, should read it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Our Toilets Are Not For Customers","review":"There is a place in this book where Mr.Coates talks about being around people that make you feel good, I think he says they make you feel like you just had a bath, opposed to the saying that some people make you want to take a bath when you have been around them. The values of the man really comes through in this book that it made me feel good even though I have never met Mr. Coates, and I live in Indiana in his hometown where his business is. I read this book when I first applied for a job at American Plastics back in 2001 right out of high school, I've applied at the factory probably eight different times up until this year even, not sure what that says about me or my resume (laughing out loud) but as I've got older and had jobs I've realized something. I want to work for a man with the rules and values that Mr. Coates runs his company with. Being raised by Christian grandparents I can appreciate those rules and values. It seems in my experience I've seen its all about money, and in business I guess it should be profitable but not at the expense of good values and treating people the way you want to be treated. You can apply this book to most anything in your life. I found myself smiling most of the time I was reading it, Mr. Coates does a great job of making his point from his own stories.

Most of the book has nothing to do with customer service, and is simply a poorly written grouping of random occurrences in the author's life.One of the premium stories that does have something to do with customer service is when the author complains about the poor service he received at a K-mart. An experience that started with him soiling himself, illegally parking in an emergency lane, screaming for an associates help at random while standing in the men's clothing section, getting annoyed with the sales associate pointed out that the underwear rack was right next to him, and him smugly determining that they should learn something about appropriate behavior and customer service.Let that all sink in."},{"Title":"Christian Meditation","review":"One of the best things about this book is what it is not: it is not any type of &quot;how-to&quot; guide (as if God were somehow made accessible through magical-mathematical formulas). Rather, Hans Urs Von Balthasar offers extended reflections upon the possibility of Christian meditation, the experience of meditation and the meaning of union with God.Although a short read, this is also a demanding read. Balthasar notes that Christian meditation is fundamentally relational as it takes place between two subjects - the one who meditates and God - but also takes place within the context of the larger community of subjects - the Church. Christian meditation, then, does not ever allow for any type of abandonment of the world; rather, it leads to an engagement in the world and for the world - just like Christ.Two discussions, in particular, make this book stand out: firstly, the discussion on the silence of God is worth the price of the book alone. Balthasar writes that the silence of God is always meaningful and that our speech to and about God ultimately culminates in silence - not because it is meaningless, but because it is surpassed. Silence is not absence but is, instead, a real recognition of presence and participation.Secondly, Balthasar's reflections on union with God take the path of reflection on Mary's reception of the Word of God, which means receiving God's Word and then allowing the Word to be brought forth. Mary becomes less an object for devotion and more a subject (like other Biblical subjects, but preeminently) to be engaged and whose story is worth reflecting deeply upon.This book is well worth the short amount of time it takes to read, and well worth the direction and perspective it gives to the one who seeks to bear Christ and birth his Presence into the world."},{"Title":"Why Not?","review":"I found this product to be very inspirational in my work.

The photography is great and the overall layout is stunning. Look at the cover image and you can see why. The cover conveys the overall feeling throughout the entire book.The only thing that I wish this book had was more insightful information like sketches and opinions from the designers themselves. The beginning of the book talks a little bit about their history over the years but after that, there is very little beyond project descriptions.

Down comes the headmaster's birch-rod on the sensitive knuckles of the bumbling pupil. Botch that passage again, lazybones, and I'll have your hide!Poet-novelist Robert Graves and historian Alan Hodge have written a delightful book containing a very quirky 126-page critical history of English prose, a few short chapters listing every conceivable principle of clear & graceful writing, followed by some 200 pages of the most carping, anal-retentive editing & revising you've ever seen. Unlike most style-book authors, who criticize hypothetical or anonymous examples of bad prose, Graves & Hodge courageously tackle many of the biggest names of their era (Hemingway, Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw) and relentlessly pick, pick, pick until the carcass is clean and the bones lie strewn about the lair. Then they put it back together again PROPERLY, the way the author should have done it the first time. As G&H; themselves note, the book might as well be subtitled \\"A Short Cut to Unpopularity\\".Of course, if any headmaster ever treated me the way G&H; treat their victims, I'd be outraged. Luckily, we are not one of their hapless victims suffering under their harsh tutelage; so, although we wince in sympathy with those being raked over the coals, we can also profit greatly from their chastisement. \\"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\\" is the most painstaking and explicit guide ever published on the craft of revising one's prose. Ideal for self-study. But beware: G&H; get under your skin and stay there. Even as I write this review I can sense these two meticulous sadists hovering over my shoulder and I ready myself for a thrashing.This review refers to the out-of-print, unabridged 1944 edition."},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"This is my favorite book. For years I struggled as a writer, unnecessarily as I now know, because I had never been taught the principles of clear communication.This book teaches those principles. I recommend it to any writer who is trying to improve his work.This book teaches a hard-core discipline of writing. To follow its principles will not only improve your writing ability, it will make you a better person."},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"I thought this book was helpful. Its method is straightforward and holds both reader and writer to an exceptionally high standard. Part 1 consists of laying out of the history of English prose, and then the discussion of the principles (or rules) of what Graves and Hodges consider good writing.Some of this is pretty old hat, but Graves and Hodges are never boring in their writing or in the examples they give of the traps writers are capable of falling into. Basically what matters most to them is clarity and logical consistancy. Graceful prose, a much harder quality to explain, is dealt with much more swiftly and generally.Part 2 is perhaps the most informative, exhausting, and frustrating part, where numerous examples of writing are painstakingly disected showing the principles of part one in ruthless action. Personally I found this section a disappointment. Often I took issue with their critiques. It wasn't that they were &quot;wrong,&quot; but that I felt the authors were deliberately missing what was being written in order to score points. They would take issue with what was being said, feeling its meaning was unclear, but when they finally got around to saying what they thought the author intended, it was the very meaning I had understood when I read the passage without their comment. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the critique of the sample from T.S. Eliot, where I felt Graves and Hodges (though I expect Graves alone here) were being obtuse and extreme. Sadly, this section was not as helpful as I hoped. I came away feeling that ultimitely no one could possible read or write at the level demanded by the authors.Still, I would recommend this book -- if you can find a copy. It is a strong tonic for the loose prose written today. Sometimes it is the over stated argument that wakes you up. Just take it with a grain of salt -- much like Graves' &quot;The White Goddess.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"Robert Graves was one of the best writers of his era, but as this book shows, he was also a Puritan when it came to language. While this book contains many useful tips, it is also pedantic and argumentative. As many of the reviewers noted, Graves and Hodges often illustrate poor writing with examples that seem, in an initial reading, to be sound. Perhaps this merely shows that modern readers are being anaesthetized by bad prose, but I don't think so. If Graves and Hodges loosened up a notch or two they would have written a much better book.The authors leave the topic of style a little too early for my taste, making the book more of a guide to editing than a guide to writing well.Still, the book focuses on developing a prose style that is logical, clear, and succinct--the backbone of all good prose."},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"When I was a college student in China back in the early 80's, an American teacher brought us this book and made us read and follow it to the letter. Boy did I ever hate a college teacher: The first couple of months of her writing class turned out be excruciating to every student despite her seemingly simplistic motto: \\"Say what you mean, and mean what you say!\\" But her guidance ---- and this book's teaching quickly made its mark. Now, after 25 years in both public and private sectors, I have to say this book was by far THE most helpful tool in developing and improving my writing.Too bad I forgot that American teacher's name.

The first book is not easy to read but is really fun and so well-written it sings--\\"The King's English\\" by H.W. Fowler and F.G.Fowler. (Don't accept any interloper's revision of the book!) The second book, and it will give a writer courage,is the present one: \\"The Reader over Your Shoulder,\\" Graves and Hodge."},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"A lecturer in my now very distant undergraduate days recommended this book as the best way to improve one's writing, and I am eternally grateful to him, but shall not embarrass him by naming him here.This is a readable and practical book. It gives clear example and simple exercises, with worked examples or \\"fair copies\\". This means you can see for yourself the effect of the corrections to style that Graves and Hodge suggest. Their aim is always to help you to get your point across. They are realists, and admit that this is always a challenge, even for the best authors, and they admit their own weaknesses.As well as using this myself, I give a copy to every one of my employees and require them to follow its principles for at least trial period. Every employee who does this writes the better for it, and clients notice. The average level of ability in writing now does seem to have fallen. Perhaps this is an old man's grump, but I believe it is the case, objectively, for two reasons. First, when one of the world's leading professors of philosophy was asked for objective evidence that real standards in writing have declined, he paused for a moment, and then replied \\"Paragraphing\\" and went on to explain that undergraduates used to arrive knowing where to put paragraph breaks, but now they insert them at random. Secondly, many of my most senior clients complain that their new hires simply cannot express themselves in written English. I experience the same problem as an employer. I have hired arts graduates from Cambridge university who cannot write, and law PhDs who cannot. The answer to these problems is cheap, quick, painless and 100% effective: Graves & Hodge.The same book is published under two titles, _The Use & Abuse of the English Language_ and _The Reader Over Your Shoulder_.I recommend the book as highly as I have ever recommended anything. It does what it says on the tin, and it is amusing to read as well as effective. However, please don't buy it, or if you do, toss it aside lightly because otherwise there will be more competition for those of us who can write clearly much of the time.\\"EPICTETUS\\"Hong Kong"},{"Title":"The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose","review":"I just don't know about this book. ... I got it out of library, started reading it and came across this passage:\\"For example: 'Everyone this autumn is wearing amusing antelope-skin gloves.' This may have been true in 1934 of every woman, or almost every woman, of a certain income level in certain London districts; elsewhere it was demonstrably untrue. Fashion notes of this sort ... historians will find them most misleading.\\"Are these guys for real? Two distinguished authors, one a professor of English literature, apparently totally missing the point and purpose of \\"Fashion notes\\". It hardly needs to be said that historians are probably the last people for whom these fashion notes are written, at least if my own experience of historians' dress-sense is anything to go by.And then there's this example from a letter by an evacuee girl in the second world war:\\"'The old cat was on to me yesterday about being careful with my crusts. I bet she's careful enough with hers, the old ... I don't suppose she'd give one to a beggar-child, not if it was starving. I must waste not and want not and put everything in the savings bank ... I must bow down to her as if she was a little tin image. I must get out of this place before I go potty.'\\"Here is Graves and Hodge's analysis:\\"Great care must be taken to let the reader know just when the ironical note is sounded and just when it ceases ... The three 'I must's here are not parallel. The first is the reported advice of the Old Cat; the second is the writer's ironical deduction...; the third is the writer's practical decision, given without irony.\\"Now, what exactly do Graves and Hodge intend by presenting this example? Are they saying that the girl's letter does NOT make it clear when she's being ironic? Coz frankly I think it's stunningly clear. To anyone. I think it's a remarkably well written letter, lucid and eloquent -- which is why Graves and Hodge were so easily able to explain the precise function of each 'I must' in the first place.Graves and Hodge have themselves been guilty of a lack of clarity here -- are they criticising the letter or not? -- and for a book about good style in written English this is unforgivable."},{"Title":"Las claves de las vanguardias artsticas del siglo XX","review":"Un libro escencial para reconocer a los genios del arte de vanguardia contempor&aacute;neo, a lo largo de sus p&aacute;ginas nos vamos sumergiendo en las claves necesarias para descifrar las contradictorias y a veces conflictivas actitudes de la vanguardia artistica del siglo pasado."},{"Title":"Comrades in Business: Post-Liberation Politics in South Africa","review":"&quot;This timely book is comparable to a seminar on contemporary politics in South Africa.

This very &quot;readable&quot; book contains a series of essays on a diverse array of topics during the period from 1919 through 1941. The book's chapters are all essays written by the nation's best practicing historians. Isabel Leighton's fine editing provides the continuity for these historical vignettes which enhances the quality of an already excellent work.The topic selected for each year is not necessarily the most burning issue of that year. However, each year's topic captures a unique facet of the American psyche that invariably adds to the reader's understanding of other, perhaps more &quot;important&quot;, issues of that era. For that reason it is a very useful addition to any student reading list in American history courses covering the Twenty-Two years dubbed &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; by editor, Isabel Leighton. Indeed, most people encounter this delightful work as required reading in such courses. I first encountered &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; while an undergraduate at Southwest Texas University. It was on the required reading list for a course I was taking there on the depression era. There were a number of other books that were required reading for that course. In addition to these works, the professor required us to read one or two chapters per week of &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; to supplement our other reading.Although the professor certainly intended our class to read the book more or less &quot;piecemeal&quot; so that we would be able to understand the social and political context of the course materials, it did not work out that way in my case. As usual I failed to follow the professor's instructions relevant to to my reading assignment for the course. I started reading the book in compliance with my reading assignment but soon found that I could not put the book down. Consequently, I finished it a day or two after starting my first assigned readings. &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; was an unexpected pleasure.If I learned nothing else as a history major, I learned that not all historical writing is created equal and that scholarly treatment of a topic does not necessarily equate to entertaining reading. I was very impressed that this book that I &quot;had to read&quot; turned out to be such an enjoyable reading experience.I kept my copy of &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; even after I completed the course. After I graduated from Southwest Texas I began teaching history and graduation and was happy to use &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; with my own students. They enjoyed the book as much as I did as a student. The book quickly engages the student's interest. The interest level is such that the students finish the book before they have time to think about the fact that they are reading a scholarly work. It's fun to watch them devour the book. I heartily recommend the book to anyone who enjoys reading crisp,well crafted history. Most people encounter &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; like I did; as required reading in one history class or another. The book is a joy to read and a wonderful teaching resource. It is kind of a shame that &quot;The Aspirin Age's&quot; academic pedigree is so impeccable. If a non academic friend gave you a copy of it for your birthday, after reading it you'd probably appreciate that friend a little more."},{"Title":"THE ASPIRIN AGE.","review":"The impact the aticles in this book have had are really quite remarkable.

They cover events that somewhat center on the year they are dedicated to but include fore and after story and opinion.

I feel like he speaks directly to me as I am reading, and is personally teaching me how to achieve my goals. I befriended Monroe after adopting him as a soldier while he was in Iraq, and shortly thereafter became one of his biggest fans. After reading this book, I guess I also became one of his students. After reading just chapter one about attitude, I became motivationally addicted to this book--and I'm not even an actor! In the chapters that follow, Monroe describes his own personal experiences with struggle and success, and then proves how everyone and anyone can take his examples and put them to use. He doesn't just write about attitude though, but rather, about the real life business end of acting--how to get off your couch and into the spotlight. I recommend this book not only to anyone interested in breaking into the arts, but also those already there WHO WANT TO STAY THERE, and finally, even to those NOT in the arts, who simply want to read one of the most inspiring books ever written. No matter what your career or business, I believe, if you read this book, you will become more successful. You might also want to read his other book, \\"Battle Cries for the Underdog\\" which he wrote while in Iraq. It is a great book as well."},{"Title":"The Theatrical Juggernaut: The Psyche of the Star","review":"This is one of the absolute BEST books on acting, ever! The advice is so practical, direct, honest and inspiring that there's no way you won't make leaps and strides in the advancement of your career, if you follow it. Most acting books deal with technique, which is important, and maybe superficially the business side. But what you're going to learn is that it's ALL business, every bit of it and you need to treat it as such. After reading this book you will feel empowered, renewed and much more positively in control of your career. You don't have to wait for opportunities-you'll learn that you can and MUST make your own opportunities. Monroe will push you to think about your career much more creatively as a businessperson and the honesty of his statements will inspire you to get off your butt, stop dreaming and to start doing! I have had an email correspondence with Monroe himself for some time now and I can say without hesitation that he practices what he preaches and he has done more in his 27 years than many do in a lifetime. The great use of a life is to build something that outlasts it. Monroe has done that. Now it's our turn."},{"Title":"The Theatrical Juggernaut: The Psyche of the Star","review":"Mr. Mann's book has been the BEST book for my acting, writing, producing career TO DATE.

After a successful career as a Wall Street trader with a major hedge fund and then attending one of NY City's top acting schools, I knew I'd have to approach my acting career like any successful business venture. Monroe's approach had the gutsy charm, street-smart tools and beyond-the-box thinking vital to the all-out businesss of going from \\"D List\\" off-off-off to \\"A List\\" stardom.And yes, I'm very proud to recommend Monroe's 2nd Addition of \\"The Theatrical Juggernaut\\".

Rather than exhaustively address such standard matters as finding good headshots, creating a monologue, or getting an agent, it focuses intensely on why 99% of aspiring actors never even get noticed, and why the overwhelming majority of aspiring performers are in the wrong line of work. As for the few who are in the right line suited to their talents, The Theatrical Juggernaut explains how the need for an industry &quot;break&quot; to achieve success is a myth, and why everything rests squarely on one's own shoulders.

And grab your highlighter at the same time. This book is fast, funny, inspirational, and not for sissies or wimps. Unless of course you want to get over being a wimp.

I'm a living proof of it.I am an actor who has succeeded and risen to the top of the voice-over business in Brazil and I've used almost every advice from the book, but BEFORE it got written! The actions mentioned in the book are mostly the ones I took to succeed in the beginning of my career and some others are procedures I still practice, up to today. Not to mention many other \\"techniques\\" I learned from Mr. Mann and intend to start using soon. I wish this book were available 12 years ago, when I started in the business. This way I wouldn't have had to figure everything out by myself and would probably have had more energy to get where I got faster. It was so much fun to read that I spent 8 straight hours in the tub (where I do most of my reading) and only got out when my wife barged into the bathroom saying: \\"Honey, get out of there or you're gonna turn into a raisin\\".I recommend it to any fellow actor trying to make it out there and even to those seasoned professionals like me who have already gotten their share of success and intend to keep the good times rolling."},{"Title":"The Theatrical Juggernaut: The Psyche of the Star","review":"I live in Brazil, where everything related to filmmaking is so hard.

It is the belief in these two principles that is making Monroe Mann a huge success and a recognized name in the artistic and business world.

The Theatrical Juggernaut has been an inspiration to me, as well as a huge reality check. It really does work on the actor's, or should I say Star's, psyche. For once in my life I feel that I am in control of my acting career; my success does not rely on someone else spotting my talent but how I market myself, handle My Business and create my own work. My perspective on the industry has been turned upside down as I realise that the power does not rest with Agents and Casting Directors, a career in acting is not just for the special few and your success definitely does not rely on luck. This book emphasises the correlation between success and business; you cannot have your head in the creative clouds, you MUST realise and accept that you are a business and as such you need to be proactive and generate custom.

Or do you get off your butt and do it! It teaches you how to get on that path to get to wherever you need to go. Whether it's in entertainment or business. Whatever the case it gets you in the mind frame to come to the realization that you need to make what your doing a business and to think like a business man and conduct your business accordingly.

Period. This book drops the responsibility for your career right in your own lap-it leaves you with no possible excuses for \\"failure\\".The Theatrical Juggernaut is about how business sense, hard work and a good attitude toward the process are the building blocks for success-not luck or talent alone.

It's the kind of book that pulls you in two directions - on one hand, you're drawn in by Mann's stories and advice, and on the other hand, you feel like you need to be getting out there, whoopin' some theatrical ass. It's an honest book that makes the reader take responsibility for life decisions. In reading this book, one realizes the detriment of blaming others for one's failures.

Eucken's style is a little heavy but his analysis, theory and conclusions are solid. I wonder to what extent Clive Lewis read this man's writings, including this book? They are in a small, select group of original thinkers who have applied their considerable intellectual abilities to matters of deep spiritual and religious significance. This book is a must read for the serious Christian."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery","review":"This book may be considered a reference in the study of electric machines, because it brings the main aspects of electromechanical energy conversion devices without being difficult to understand.

Readability is not bad. The writing is fine and easy enough to follow but the equations in the text were frequently the wrong equation for the topic. Several tables had eroneous information. While most text books contain some errata, this book contained more than any of the dozens of engineering books in my personal library. None of the end of chapter problems had any answers in order to check work. While only a nuisance, example problems in the text would reference a machine from several chapters back, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to understand the situation of the current example. I did appreciate the fact that the book includes matlab examples and exercises as to aid understanding with simulations."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery","review":"I gave it 5 stars because the book delivers. You will have a good fundamental understanding of electric machinery after reading this (from an engineers standpoint I mean - if you're not an engineer or physicist, this probably will be way more than you can handle). Good problems in the book also for practice (although it would be a lot better if they made the solutions available?!? Not sure why they wouldn't do this. I mean we are trying to learn right?)FYI - You will need to supplement this book, especially for 3-phase and 1-phase induction motors, because the material just isn't explained/diagrammed out as well as it needs to be to get a FULL fundamental understanding. There are steps that are skipped and/or not covered in the detail I'd like. I have lots of questions that weren't explained/answered, and some stuff I can't see from the authors' logic how it could be so. I do think the synchronous machines chapter was excellent, but still had to scratch my head for a while on a few things.All in all though, I think the book is very good and would recommend it to any engineer trying to understand electric machinery. You're not going to come out of this book ready to design a synchronous generator or induction motor, but YOU WILL be ready for the next step in learning about them and understanding power systems."},{"Title":"Electric Machinery","review":"Book arrived on time, and exactly as was described.

There are several drawbacks though, the book is not the complete works, being a perfect-bound thick paperback it's not possible to open it fully (without breaking the binding) the paper is fairly course but it does support the 150 dpi the images are printed in, there are no page numbers and no dates on any of the artwork but despite all that it is still a fantastic book.To be able to see hundreds of examples of sexy robots, pin-ups and some really super examples of Sorayama's advertising work in this thick paperback will have to do until the definitive coffee-table book gets published. BTW if you are in a bookshop you can't miss it because it has an incredibly seductive, highly glossy cover mosaic showing details from thirty-one Sorayama paintings."},{"Title":"Sorayama: Complete Works","review":"This cheaply made book may be able to claim that it contains all of Sorayama's images, but the reproduction quality is poor, on cheap paper, and many of the best images are split down the middle by the spine/seam of the book, making them look even cheaper than this book already makes them appear. Not worth your money, unless all you want are tiny lousy quality images on tissue paper. Sorayama deserves better."},{"Title":"Sorayama: Complete Works","review":"This really does show a lot of Sorayama's work. From the sexy robots to the life-like pin-ups to the surreal to the over-the-top fetishes. This book shows them all.Sorayama is a masterful artist and an extremely talented airbrush artist. The majority of his work is sexually graphic and some are simply disturbing, but if you want to see some incredibly realistic art, you can appreciate this book. In fact, this book even includes some sketches he's done of buildings, planes, etc. The man is truly an artist. Still, keep in mind that most of the works in this book are graphic in nature.The good news: this book has page after page after page of his art - measuring almost 1.5 inches thick. The bad news: The book is only 6 inches by 8.25 inches - very small for an art book. It also places a number of paintings on one page - making them too small to really admire his detail. Also, the book is perfect bound - which makes the paintings that cover a double-page spread difficult to see.I still think this is a great book to get a good sampling of Sorayama's work. There's a lot of his work to see in these pages. Some of it is erotic, some of it is playful, some of it is disturbing, and some of it is just amazing technically. Larger format and better layout design would be the two things that would improve this book."},{"Title":"Sorayama: Complete Works","review":"If you are a fan of sorayama, this book is for you.

The pictures are not captioned so I cannot look up a particular pic name on the web for more info etc. The color is a little lacking, but for the original price it was well worth it. The paper is not a thick gloss paper like in an art history/ other collegette book which is one reason the color is not as saturated or vibrant as the original works. The book and bounding is more like a really thick paperback novel. This makes one annoyance where some pictures are spread across two pages and because of the way the book is bound you cannot open the book flat. Of course some of my more favorite pictures are smaller than others. It is not one pic a page. some pages have 4 pictures or so.

Christine's book stands apart from the mountains of works offering the latest parenting techniques. While parenting techniques are necessary, their overemphasis can reduce parenting to a heartless, mechanical venture. We can inadvertantly reduce our children into objects to be managed.Christine Yount offers an organic and spiritual approach to parenting. The goal of &quot;With All Their Heart&quot; is to inspire parents to raise children who have a passionate love of God. Christine's perscription is for us to engage our own hearts into the parenting process. She does this inviting us into her home. Christine writes with emotional vulnerability. As the editor of Childrens Ministry Magazine, Christine has experience and authority to offer us a &quot;how-to&quot; clinic. Instead, the reader is allowed to see the highs and the lows of parenting in the Yount home. Stories of a child's request for a tongue piercing, the soccer league, and failed cooking attempt all let us know that the Younts are parenting in the same world that we are. The stories gently unlock the doors of the readers' hearts and provoke self-inventory. At this point, scripture is applied our point of need. Each chapter ends with prayer based on a Scripture that guides to appeal to God on behalf of our children.I have to confess I didn't read this book as it was designed. The chapters are brief so busy parents can gobble up a chapter while they wait for a child's practice to finish. I lost myself in the vivid story telling and read through the book in two evenings. I plan on a second read this summer work through the daily prayers and the &quot;Reflections&quot; sections."},{"Title":"With All Their Heart: Teaching Your Kids to Love God","review":"This is a great book.

Even more, the author has Paul say that Peter is his \\"superior\\", which quite denotes a Catholic slant. But anyhow, I excuse him for these escesses of imagination because, overall, this is a good historical novel. Not accurate, and not only for the facts mentioned but in a general sense too.The tone swings from sarcastic and humorous to melodramatic romance. Thus its ups and downs. It tried my patience in the latter cases, but I guess I got over it. I would say it is a very interesting novel because of the scope of its subject, which interests me greatly, the Roman Empire, the beginning of Christianism in Rome, the lives of the first martyrs, the persecutions, the contrast of visions: pagan and Christian. Luckily the author was able to hold all these ingredients in one single story pretty well, despite the deficiencies noted.I would have expected to see in these pages the names of historical figures mentioned, like those of Peter, Paul or Nero, but not with these familiarity -though to a different reader it might be an incentive instead of an annoyance-, because I would have preferred that the author would limit himself to aknowledged facts and not make them up when historical characters are involved in the plot. The consequence is -to me- that they look less real, as part of a soap-opera, and this is a bad taste or, at least, cheap art.Anyhow, since there's not much out there about this time and subject, I recommend this book gladly. It's a worth read. Now hope they will edit the old movie version sometime.

First of all, what made this book boring for me was that almost one-third of it was in fact lecturing and preaching of the virtues and righteousness of all Catholic (!) Christians and Christianity itself. It sounds to me as cheap propaganda aimed at boosting the morale of the Polish nation at the end of XIX century.The rather shallow message that glared from every single page was: Here comes the new faith, the new true God, who will save the world. Well, it didn't. When I read that Jesus has told Peter to go to Rome and Establish his holy church (what the hell???), this was the most ridiculous scene! For those, lifting eyebrows, please, read some history of the Roman Church and give some credit to Atilla the Hunn for the lucky Vatican guys.So, my advice is that if you want to read some account on a petty event of a guy going head over heals about a girl and doing a number of stupd things, and all this is ridiculously covered with Christian mysticism, this is your book, NOT MINE!"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"A young Roman patrician becomes infatuated with a beautiful young Christian in a time period where being a Christian could mean prosecution and death. Fast-moving plot; intelligent, aware characters.

Sienkiewicz (an author unknown to me before discovering Quo Vadis) creates an extraordinarily detailed and vivid spiritual and psychological landscape of 1st cent Rome, both pagan and Christian. With a story line that grips the attention and keeps the pages turning, one meets Nero and several of the members of his vast, opulent household, the ruling class of Rome, dripping with unthinkable excess, decadence, intrigue and vacuity: lives despairing of meaning and transcendence, self-medicated with sensuality. And then you meet the followers of the new and strange religion, grossly misunderstood and mistrusted, and you begin to enter their secret lives and to understand them too. The followers of one they call Christ live in the same time and place - but in a completely different world, a world known by hope in a Kingdom infinitely greater than that \\"beautiful\\" one built by \\"the divine\\" Nero.In the novel, these two worlds collide with cataclysmic results. Externally, of course, we witness the gut-wrenching persecution of the Christians. But Sienkiewicz soars far higher as he opens the mind and heart of the reader to the internal conflict that this collision of worlds creates: the variety of responses in the persecutors ranging from heart-hardening indifference or even enthusiastic amusement and blood-lust to an awakening of conscience, a glimpse of the eternal and sometimes even to conversion. But even more poignant is the challenge to the persecuted: the temptation to despair, to disillusionment, the pleading prayer for deliverance, the self-abandonment in hope to the promises of Christ, and, finally, the supernatural gift of forgiveness and love that is at the heart of this new faith, a faith that is gently flowering in the hard, cruel soil of the ancient Pagan world. And it is, indeed, a faith that can only survive the darkness by a total and miraculous self-giving of love, both human and divine.In short, one meets real men and women in Quo Vadis, struggling with the most real and fundamental conflicts of human life. And though the story is set long ago in a land (for most of us) far away, the struggle it addresses is perennial because it is, recognized or not, the spiritual struggle of every human soul."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"First, I want to be clear about which edition of \\"Quo Vadis\\" I am reviewing here: it is the edition from Hippocrene Books, ISBN 0781805503, translated by W.S. Kuniczak. I spell this out because I believe the translation is of great importance. Kuniczak already cut his teeth with a splendid version of Sienkiewicz's \\"trilogy.\\"I really ordered this book out of curiosity. \\"Quo Vadis\\" was the generally-accepted American view of Nero's Rome and the rise of Christianity when I was a boy: the mammoth film spectacle was released in 1951. Yet it seems pretty certain that the \\"narrative\\" presented by \\"Quo Vadis\\" --- \\"Christianity good, Roman paganism bad\\" --- is pretty much dead in the water (or, even worse, a laughingstock) by the early years of the 21st century. I was also curious to look at one of the very first global best-sellers: \\"Quo Vadis\\" was translated into 40 languages, and sold millions of copies.What surprised me was that reading just the first five or ten pages really hooked me. The book starts out as a passionate love story: the patrician pagan Vinicius, by all accounts a phenomenally handsome man who lives at the top of the pagan status-heap, is stricken by a fatal love-at-first-sight for a girl he does not even know. A few more pages, and canny readers will understand that the girl, Lygia, is a secret Christian --- and then you start wondering how all this is going to work out.Besides that, the novel's most memorable character is Petronius, who is master of the revels for the megalomaniac Nero. He is at first scornful of Vinicius's \\"total love\\" for Lygia, but he is a very intelligent (if cynical) man who is finally forced to admit that, in this case (as in others) Aphrodite and Eros are the supreme gods guiding human affairs.And then Sienkiewicz begins raising the question --- sometimes gently, and sometimes forcefully --- a question which boils down to \\"which side are you on?\\" Despite all of our sentimentality about \\"the grandeur of Rome,\\" is it not finally self-evident that Rome had to be destroyed, and replaced? If you doubt that, then reflect on the massive amount of slavery, tyranny, sadism, and cruelty which was the daily fare in Rome. Even if you have only seen \\"Gladiator,\\" you have a good idea of what the Romans considered to be a good show --- men and beasts slaughtering one another to entertain the masses. Sienkiewicz also provides good insights into pagan philosophy (mostly via Petronius).On the other side, you meet the secret and persecuted community of Christians, along with memorable portraits of St. Peter and St. Paul.In sum: I found this to be a fascinating and very well researched historical novel. Biased? Of course it's biased. Everyone who picks this book up will probably be biased as well. But biased towards which side? :-)If you are a fan of Gibbon's \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" this is probably a good volume to read at the same time.And it's a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"A great story of faith,political intrigue,and romance during the bloody reign of the Roman emperor Nero.Vinicius, a Roman aristocrat, falls in love with a simple Christian household slave and uses his uncle's influence to get her which at first alienates her and arouses the attention of mad Nero who begins the bloody persecutions of Christians and non-flatterers.

The binding thread of its many themes is the passionate struggle of Marcus Vinicius and Callina Lygia to love one another amid the opposing forces of Nero's Rome and Christianity. To this thread, a running commentary on the philosophy of the times is elegantly and lightly attached using the characters, Caius Petronius and the apostles, Peter and John. The detail throughout Quo Vadis illuminates ancient Roman culture with scholarly diligence. Seinkewicz especially manages to present a balanced Judeo-Christian viewpoint that takes both the positive and negative aspects of pagan Rome into account. The historical accuracy combines with a vivid presentation of such life and magic that it inhales the reader. Through images of lust, vice, and violence blended with faith, peace, and daring, the thread of Vinicius and Lygia's love unfolds in triumphant conversions, tragic peril, and victory.

(Also view the lavish and engaging l951 MGM spectacle film version of the same title with Sir Peter Untinov as Nero!)"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This book is a great, well organized, well directed and powerful work of art particularly relevant to life in the current social context of Post 9/11 and 21st Century America.I read somewhere (Mortimer Adler, I think) that the pursuit of art is ultimately a search for significant aesthetic experience. By extension, we can remove much of the content bias in art (that which often allows sophists to say, \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\") and focus on a set of artistic standards that allow us to evaluate art quality based on estimates of the likelihood, or probability, a given population of art consumers can identify a promising opportunity to share aesthetic experience.Quo Vadis provides such an opportunity at this interesting time in our shared world and in that sense I believe the book should be read by anyone interested in enjoyment and personal growth from one book. If our time is not as unusual as other times, then the book will rise to universal greatness in my opinion. But, even so, it is a great book for our time regardless of how it is treated in the future.Provisionally speaking, and for the purpose of my argument of the greatness of Quo Vadis, let me define a significant aesthetic experience as cognizable moment of overwhelmingly transformative confrontation between ourselves and the art we have chosen to explore. At the instant of this confrontation, we are touched by the art and enjoy a quantum change at the very core of the neural network defining our personal being. There is a distinct chemical and electrical reaction and, from that moment on we are comprehensively changed, renewed and set on a different course in our lives and in our thinking. At an instant in this fleeting confrontation we are aware that this work of art \\"echoes in eternity\\". It rattles the foundations of our very genetic structure.An avid, chasseur de l'art, if we may coin such a phrase, will not consider such a definition strange. Rather, he or she will recognize it as more or less true and will acknowledge that it is the search for such moments that fuels the budget for the quest. The addiction is not a casual dilettante search for epicurean delight. It is blood sport. And, reflecting on my own lifelong search for such experience, I feel right in saying the reader I am speaking to will agree this can only occur in rare situations and at rare times. It does not happen out of the blue. The pump must be primed and the message must be clear.The pain of defining my philosophy to this point is all about making the point that I am serious in my report that Quo Vadis provided for me a very significant aesthetic experience (which I rarely experience in literature as often as I do with painting, photography, music, opera, theater or cinema) and that I feel quite assured it will do so for most contemporary reader's of any degree of modern cultural awareness. Anyone can describe the book and its content. My goal is to indicate why it should be read and why it will be enjoyed. As such, but with a logical admission that such experiences could emerge in a random pattern as accidents of time and space, I have to recommend Quo Vadis as among the best and most enjoyable works of fiction I have ever encountered. I rate it on the same level as War and Peace, The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma and Moby Dick as a book that cannot and will not be put down once the wheels of the story are turning.But, why is that so?I think the answer is that at the time of reading this book in the last three years, I stood symbolically (as many modern people do) exactly at the point where Peter stands at the essential moment of the story of Quo Vadis. At just that moment Peter is fleeing the unbearable persecution of Rome with his Christian followers. But, his course is reversed at the instant of the famous vision of the spirit and image of Christ confronting Peter on the outskirts of Rome to lead them back to Rome to confront the secular forces opposed to their spiritual convictions. The moment culminates in the resoundingly famous phrase \\"quo vadis domini\\".This great moment should strike a contemporary reader square between the eyes. The entire book is organized around and leads the reader to this moment with resounding effectiveness. The story is told with such skill and patience, that the reader is allowed the necessary time to reflect upon the events of the book and find the connections between his or her own life and the lives portrayed in the book. Once the empathy is in place, there is no way out of the story.I am motivated to write this review now because I have taken some time away from work for reflection and I see in the world around us a similar, and perhaps equally profound, set of circumstances dividing the spiritual and secular worlds. Quo Vadis provides a useful and powerful insight into both the traditions of Christianity and secular Rome. But, through the recitation of conditions in Rome, at the time of biblical transformation, an allegory arises to the worldwide struggles we have today.The secular and spiritual confrontations of our current world leave us all contemplating conditions rarely more obviously juxtaposed in these two dimensions, and rarely more focused on such a universal scale, as they are today in the post 9/11 American culture. This is why I believe this book had such a great impact on me and this is why I believe it will have a great impact on almost any reader. Like most Americans, I was raised in a Judeo/Christian tradition, but I rarely attend church. Likewise, as a modern American, I am very receptive to advances in my understanding of the \\"real politik\\" of our day that come from investigation of Roman secular history and institutions. In this respect, I am confident that I am not very different from most Americans and most reasonably successful business or professional people in the world today. By logical extension, this is why I strongly recommend the book. If it can give me a significant aesthetic experience, then it must certainly do the same for many other prospective readers.Regardless of our political views and our reactions to organized religions, the lessons of this story seem quite helpful. We are all aware of the many dimensions in which the clash between the secular and spiritual worlds is engaged today. Whether we are secular in outlook or spiritual in orientation, the events of our daily discourse must cause us all concerns and worries. Most of us have been shaped by a modern blend of spiritual training, scientific education and secular tolerance. It should be very easy for all of us to place ourselves in the Rome depicted in this story. And, the story should teach us all a great deal about ourselves and the world we live in today."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I was really hoping for some annotations to add some explanation for some of the arcane roman terms, but there were none after 30 pages of reading.

Written in the 1890's, this book is seen as one of the world's first &quot;bestseller&quot; novels, and is definitely an epic of, well, epic proportions.Unfortunately, the book does suffer slightly as a result of the translation, as noted by an earlier reviewer, so if you can read Polish, do get the original version. Nevertheless, although the book starts off a tad slow, think of the beginning as a push off from a cliff, because after that it's as fast paced a thriller as money can buy.A basic exposure to Roman and Christian history will make the book really come alive. Although certain &quot;facts&quot; are not correct, or have been omitted, remember that the book is meant to be fiction. The historical events are merely a platform for a passionate love story between a pagan Roman and a Christian girl. However, it is the seeming impossibility of this love, together with descriptions of the nearly moronic Roman &quot;royal court&quot;, keeps you reading well into the night. The emotional roller-coaster makes you, the reader, feel exhausted.Definitely recommended, and one of the most enjoyable books I've read.If you liked this, do check out his other novels - especially the brilliant &quot;Teutonic Knights&quot; which is another epic of a young Polish knight (and of course a lovely maiden or two thrown in for good measure) and the history of middle ages Poland up to the battle of Grunwald where the Teutonic Knights were defeated."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"The Christian v. lion's story has been around so long that it has pretty much become a kind of myth. It is a phrase one brings up in order to illustrate some point or other, but is hardly ever thought about in historical terms. In fact, Christianity itself sometimes seems as if it is becoming a kind of myth. The left doesn't take it seriously, and bashes Christians for being intolerant and condescending. But Christians, in their haste to retaliate, often act intolerant and can be arrogantly condescending. The sense of what it means to be Christian seems to get lost in all of this.Quo Vadis takes us back to the days when Christianity was fresh and new and shows us just what kind of world it was then that caused such a movement to flourish. This alone would make it an excellent novel, but it works wonderfully on all levels. The characters are superbly drawn, the setting is realistic, the plot crackles along, and, perhaps most importantly in a novel with this subject matter, it never becomes preachy or didactic, instead maintaining an objective perspective throughout.Rome was the greatest of the ancient empires, yet despite all of its glorious achievements, it was truly a barbaric place. The concept of human rights was non-existent. Slaves--of all races--were property, and could be used in any way one saw fit, including the most vicious or depraved. The rule of law, while discussed in philosophical terms, was only sporadically and occasionally applied. The law instead came and went at the whim of the powerful, and if the powerful happened to be someone like Nero--the ruler of Rome during the course of this novel--then the law was sadistic, cruel, wicked and unpredictable.We see the effect that living this kind of society has on the two main characters of the novel, both of whom are members of the upper crust: Petronius, a courtier; and Vinicius, a military officer. Petronius, as Nero's confidant, can never let his guard down. He must flatter, cajole, deceive and manipulate Nero every minute of the day, for his very life depends on it. It is a life, \\"drained and listless and detached,\\" as we are told in the first sentence of the novel. Vinicius falls in love with a captive Christian female, and through his love we see how Christianity changes his life. But it is an unbelievably difficult and dangerous undertaking--with the demented presence of Nero and his sycophants looming over everything--to form an attachment with a person and then a cause such as this.It gradually dawns on us how the Christian movement began in the first place, and why attempts were made so mercilessly to stamp it out. Instead of dishonesty and cruelty, it called for honesty and kindness. Instead of privilege for the elite, its promises were made to all. Instead of arrogance, it preached submissiveness. Perhaps most importantly, it simplified one's life, and allowed one to live without fear.Rome is burned, possibly at Nero's orders, incredibly, so that he can experience suffering as he believes a true artist must. To divert the anger of the Romans, he blames Christians. Thousands of men, women, and children are rounded up, put in dungeons for months, then on successive festival days were crucified, burned alive, mauled by gladiators, and, as we know, attacked by wild animals. Their fate is so hideous that in time even the jaded Romans became sickened by it.These historical events, and the actions of the characters during them, are what make up the bulk of the novel. To say the least, it makes for very compelling reading; indeed, some parts are difficult to bear. And as mentioned, it is presented in a very objective way. Not all of the Christians are presented sympathetically--one, in fact, is a fiery, all-will-be-damned type--and not all the Romans are presented harshly. The noblest character in the novel may very well be Petronius, who uses his influence as much as he can to alleviate the suffering he sees around him. And although he recognizes to some degree the power and decency of the movement, he himself does not wish to become a Christian. He can not abide the idea of being required to love his fellow man, most of whom--the unwashed, ignorant mob--he detests. He is a magnificent creation.The book is a real eye-opener, a good reminder of what the world was like before the birth of Christ, and a sobering reflection on what being a Christian truly means. At the same time it is also a superbly researched and entertaining piece of historical fiction, and the kind of thing for which historical fiction buffs are constantly on the alert. Great stuff.(I should mention that this review is of the Kunizak translation.)"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Given that Mr Sienkiewicz won the Nobel literary prize for mainly this work, that alone is a pretty good bet for reading it. Written in the 1890's, this book is seen as one of the world's first &quot;bestseller&quot; novels, and is definitely an epic of, well, epic proportions.Unfortunately, the book does suffer slightly as a result of the translation, as noted by an earlier reviewer, so if you can read Polish, do get the original version. Nevertheless, although the book starts off a tad slow, think of the beginning as a push off from a cliff, because after that it's as fast paced a thriller as money can buy.A basic exposure to Roman and Christian history will make the book really come alive. Although certain &quot;facts&quot; are not correct, or have been omitted, remember that the book is meant to be fiction. The historical events are merely a platform for a passionate love story between a pagan Roman and a Christian girl. However, it is the seeming impossibility of this love, together with descriptions of the nearly moronic Roman &quot;royal court&quot;, keeps you reading well into the night. The emotional roller-coaster makes you, the reader, feel exhausted.Definitely recommended, and one of the most enjoyable books I've read.If you liked this, do check out his other novels - especially the brilliant &quot;Teutonic Knights&quot; which is another epic of a young Polish knight (and of course a lovely maiden or two thrown in for good measure) and the history of middle ages Poland up to the battle of Grunwald where the Teutonic Knights were defeated."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is a book that took me about 50 pages or so to get completely hooked. After adjusting to the fine translation and getting accustomed to the way in which Sienkiewicz peppers his prose with latin phrases I found myself truly absorbed in the story and the characters. Nothing I've read has captured the clash of cultures that Rome and early Christianity represented as well as this book does. The decadence of Nero's Rome and court compared with the simplicity of the early Christian community in Rome that is being visited by both St. Peter and St. Paul is contrasted in such dramatic fashion that it is hard to put this down.The characters are realistically drawn and you can feel the disgust with Nero expressed in private by those near him and sense the declining civilization of Rome in all of it's aspects. No historical novel that I've read comes close in bringing the sights and sounds and smells of the ancient capitol to life as this one does.The underlying love story between a captured Princess who is a committed convert to Christ and a Roman centurian who is exposed to the Christian teaching through his obsessive love of her and consequent exposure to the teachings of the early church is a remarkably effective literary device that brings these contrasting world views into sharp relief.The burning of Rome by the deranged Emperor is so vividly described that you can smell the smoke.Truly a fabulous historical novel, Quo Vadis is a book I will read again and feel comfortable giving it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"\\"Quo Vadis\\" is the kind of novel one simply must include on his shelf. For those who don't believe me, it won the Nobel Prize--and actually deserved it. In my experience, lots of books, although unworthy of receiving even a single positive review, have gotten awards. But the main reason you should read this splendid novel is because of its wonderful storytelling, compelling plot, beautiful imagery, and great characters. To boot, it wasn't very difficult to comprehend, even though it was written more than a century ago. Despite the fact that I cannot understand a shred of Polish, I know that Kuniczak's translation is an absolutely superb one, and that both he and Sienkiewicz are first-rate novelists.What I particularly loved about \\"Quo Vadis\\" was Sienkiewicz's wonderful attention to detail and imagery. His writing style was so lyrical, poetic, and sense-evocative, I could clearly visualize what he was describing, and for the first time ever, I felt like I was actually *seeing* everything: the wild, drunken orgies of Nero's debauched reign, the city of Rome burning, the coliseum packed with rowdy citizens and sweaty gladiators. People enjoy reading books that provide a vivid visual picture of the setting; I know I do. It is also very evident that Sienkiewicz did his homework and researched extensively for this historical novel.The characters are what drive the plot--and they certainly do that in \\"Quo Vadis.\\" I found myself liking a few characters and hating several others. And it is interesting, because when I realized that this novel was about Christians in Rome during Nero's time, I had expected Sienkiewicz to have portrayed each Christian as a kindly saint and all the Romans as decadent louts. I was surprised that not every single Roman was depicted as wicked--the honorable Aulus and his gentle wife Pomponia, for example. And not every Christian was a saint in this book, with Crispus, a fervent follower of Christ, seeming to me somewhat intolerant and very narrow-minded at times. Of course, there are some characters who are pure evil; Poppaea, the golden-haired, manipulative wife of Nero, is \\"evil incarnate,\\" as Sienkiewicz describes in his novel, and (in my opinion) it is difficult for anyone to like Nero.The core of the plot is a love story between Vinicius, a young Roman tribune, and Ligia, the beautiful Christian girl with whom he falls deeply in love. Vinicius loves Ligia so much--not merely for her beauty, but her virtue and purity--that he actually converts to Christianity, and we see a prodigious transformation in him, from a decadent, pleasure-soaked Roman courtier to a caring and benevolent Christian. Petronius, Vinicius's uncle and another main character, is painted magnificently as well. Although Petronius does not become a Christian like Vinicius, he seems the sublimest character in the novel; he does whatever he can to lessen others' suffering (especially his nephew's) yet still, he cannot bring himself to love everyone--which is exactly what the Christian faith preaches. Petronius is a worldly Roman noble with an eye for beauty and good taste, and he is also the emperor's confidant, called the \\"arbiter of elegance\\" at Nero's court. Despite the impact Christianity has upon his life, he cannot love the dirty, recalcitrant mob for which he has such contempt.\\"Quo Vadis\\" has everything you would want in a great novel: a stellar plot, sublime characters, lively dialogue, and graceful prose. It is a truly laudable novel of epic proportions--something to stay on my shelf beside the classics."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I would concur with what others above have written about the work. They have said, for the most part, what I would say. I would recommend this work if you plan on making a trip to the Eternal City. The places written about would be fun to track down and visit, rewarding your efforts with a cup of gelato. The characters of the work are very believable, in their flawed being, and in their heroic moments. The plot of the story is the selling point. For myself, it does get a little mushy towards the end, losing the objective structure that carries it up to that point. Chilo's conversion is credible, but others parts of the story just get a tiny bit sappy (for example, the gullibility of the Roman citizens). Up until the end, the structure of the plot is excellent. Magnificent research written in very well. Sienkiewicz has a great role for the honorable Petronius. And the risky conversion of Vinitius is honestly done. The Apostles Peter and Paul are given human form, and come off as more real than men who just re-iterate what is in their epistles. The early church, in all its anonymity, is offered as a dynamic sign of dedication for the church today. I believe this is a romance novel a man can read, and much more.My own copy was translated by Stanley E. Conrad."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"\\"Quo Vadis\\" is another outstanding book by Henryk Sienkiewicz. It was a little slow to get started, but it built steadily over time, until I couldn't put it down. Looking back on it, the slow steady build actually gave more depth to the story, as it gave me a deeper sense of knowing the characters as if I knew them personally. This seems to be a real talent of Sienkiewicz. The two books I have read by him \\"Quo Vadi\\" and \\"The Teutonic Knights\\" have had some of the most endearing characters of any books I have read.I was a bit concerned the parts of the story about the early Christians would have a prosylitizing feel, but they didn't. Sienkiewicz stayed focused on his characters, and conveyed the history of the early Christains no differently than he conveyed other aspects of ancient Roman history. I did come away though, with a new understanding of the early Christians as real people, not just part of a religion.Overall, this was an excellent book. Slow to start, and not quite as good as \\"The Teutonic Knights\\", but deeply satisfying as I turned the last page."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Having been a huge fan of Robert Graves' I Claudius and Claudius the God, I was always sad that Graves did not write a sequel to highlight the reign of the last Augustan ruler. Many times reading Quo Vadis, I felt like this was that book. It does give a good insight to the decadence of Nero's reign along with some references to his predecessors. It also clarified some often-misrepresented assumptions like all gladiatorial competitions taking place in the Colosseum. We learn that Nero pre-dated the Colosseum and in fact, the battles were staged in a large \\"wooden\\" arena.Some of the action has some good vivid descriptions such as the burning of Rome and some of the gladiatorial fights. The book also gives a glimpse at what Christianity could have been. We see how the disciples Peter and Paul worshipped their religion in a way that is totally unlike anything today.The characters are excellent and the book never gets boring."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Quo Vadis is one of my favorite all-time novels. Quo Vadis is interesting and worthwhile for many reasons - in describing the activities and lives of early Christians, in detailing the gradual conversion of a Roman patrician to Christianity (and, thus, describing plainly some of the principles important to Christians), in illustrating the history, activities and &quot;mindset&quot; of Rome and her citizens during the reign of Nero and in describing the upbringing and reign of Nero himself. It is beautifully and clearly written. I sought out this book after reading about it in Ayn Rand's &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; in which she says &quot;...I consider &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, technically, &lt;to be&gt; one of the best-constructed novels ever written...&quot; (p. 16). I agree with her short analysis of this book: It was easy to follow the plot and all of the many details as they were being built while, at the same time, not appearing &quot;simplistic&quot;."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Wow! This book is a real eye opener to the times of Nero and the ancient Roman empire. Somehow I find myself comparing Rome's decadence with present day America.

This was the first book I read by Sienkiewicz and surely not the last."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Quo Vadis is fast-paced in plot, sublime in character and theme, and historically persuasive. I had read that Nero had not burned Rome, and this book explained how it most likely came about so beautifully and sensibly, it seems that he had.The portrayal of historical characters is unparalleled - Nero, Poppaea, Acte, and Petronius brilliant and poetic. Saint Paul and Saint Peter are sublime and very human figures.This is probably the strongest pro-Catholic document I have ever read, because instead of talking about dogma, it simply and impartially presents the actual moment of birth of the Church as fiction. I had heard this was the late Pope's favorite book, and I can see why. All through I read wondering how John Paul would have read it.A fascinating, noble, classic work!"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This book was incredible.

I have another copy and think the story is excellent......."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Quo Vadis is an 1896 historical novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz. I am specifically reviewing Jeremiah Curtin's translation. In first-century Rome, during the time of Nero, young tribune Marcus Vinicius falls in love with Lygia, daughter of a conquered barbarian king and hostage of the Roman government. As he pursues her, Vinicius begins inadvertently to learn about her Christian faith. Quo Vadis features a number of historical figures, including Emperor Nero, Petronius, Saint Peter and Saint Paul.Sienkiewicz does a fine job of immersing the reader in the Roman culture of the day, and of developing Vinicius and Petronius, his two main characters. They are well-rounded, and their significant differences in personality contribute to a multidimensional view of the story. Petronius, the clever hedonist, is likeable from page one, but Vinicius is rather unlikeable, and Sienkiewicz does a fine job of changing and evolving the character as the story progresses.Beyond that, Sienkiewicz's writing has a number of problems. Supporting characters are not nearly as well done - many are one-dimensional. Characters like Ursus and Lygia are astoundingly nave - at times they seem like small children, and have to be dealt with by other characters as such. Lygia certainly has little going for her other than that she's extremely attractive. Also, Sienkiewicz's foreshadowing is profuse and heavy-handed throughout the novel. The parallels he draws between Nero's corrupt empire and the future Rome-based Catholic Church are similarly overt (but the comparisons between the decadent Roman life and the liberating Christian life are well done).Pacing is Quo Vadis's biggest flaw. At times, particularly at the beginning, the novel absolutely crawls, and the reader has to put in a great deal of work just to get into the story. Throughout the book, Vinicius does a painful amount of moping and pining after Lygia, often for pages on end. The last hundred or so pages, though, make everything worthwhile - Sienkiewicz generates and maintains a great deal of suspense, and they absolutely fly by.Perhaps what is most impressive here is Sienkiewicz's treatment of Christians and Christian martyrs. Here we have genuine, committed, upstanding Christians of integrity, who would rather love their enemies than retaliate against unjust persecution. At the same time, they aren't perfect people - some are nave, some are petty, and so on. Sienkiewicz's handling of their noble, willing deaths is similarly noteworthy.I have not read any other translations of this novel, nor have I read it in the original Polish, so about Curtin's translation I can only say this: the archaic pronouns thee and thou have (and had) long since passed out of common usage, and whether Curtin used them to make the book feel more period or more epic, I don't know - but their use is annoying.On the whole, Quo Vadis is an impressive piece of epic historical fiction whose scope and story and treatment of Christianity overcome the author's flaws. It's one of those books that everyone should read once."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Quo Vadis is one of the greatest novels of all time. Sienkiewicz deserved the Nobel Prize he received in 1905. This book is very religiously symbolic. This story takes place in Rome during the reign of the crazy Nero and the growing Christian faith. &quot;QUO VADIS&quot; which means 'where are you going' is symbolic and it is asking, if you will go to the Christian side or stay with the Roman faith. Quo Vadis is a story of a Roman man who over time realizes the truth and changes to Christianity after falling in love with a beautiful Christian girl."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is an outstanding historical novel. When I was reading it a few years ago I asked myself a question: Is it a history or just a religious story? Well, it is a story, that's for certain. But what a story. It is well developed and extremely well written. Mr. Henryk K. Sienkiewicz was one of the greatest Polish writers and he should be known and remembered for his work."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Henryck Sienkiewicz was a Polish writer who enjoyed huge popularity in Europe over one hundred years ago. His works were historical epics celebrating heroic eras in the life of a country that hadn't existed for decades, having been swallowed up in cynical power deals orchestrated by its neighbors, Austria, Prussia and Russia. He chose themes with strong appeal to his fellow Poles and it was not surprising that at some point he would turn to a narrative with strong religious content. Quo Vadis was an international best seller and has been turned into films many times. It is a well written romance come adventure story of love, faith and hope recounting Roman emperor Nero's persecution of the early Christians. Sienkiewicz's handling of the historic detail is impressive and his characters in the main are convincing, three dimensional human beings. It is an engaging, thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time!! What a beautiful story. I have given it as a gift to many of my friends"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is an old classic that never loses its value. I recommend it for all Christian readers, young and old."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Near the end of Quo Vadis Petronius (Arbiter) writes a letter in reply to his nephew Vicinius who has fled Rome with his bride, Ligia. In the letter Petronius discusses his philosophy and his fate contrasting it with the Christian belief that Vicinius has accepted. He says:\\"There are only two philosophers that I care about, Pyrrho and Anacreon. You know what they stand for. The rest, along with the new Greek schools and all the Roman Stoics, you can have for the price of beans. Truth lives somewhere so high that even the gods can't see it from Olympus.\\"(QV, p. 566)It is interesting to note that Pyrrho is noted for a philosophy of skepticism that claims the impossibility of knowledge. For him our own ignorance or doubt should induce us to withdraw into ourselves, avoiding the stress and emotion which belong to the contest of vain imaginings. This theory of the impossibility of knowledge suggests a sort of agnosticism and its ethical implications may be compared with the ideal tranquility of the Stoics and Epicureans (who were more popular among Romans). This certainly contrasts with the Christian spiritual view that emphasizes belief in the supernatural. It is a philosophy that, at least for Petronius, lets him face death unequivocally with a sort of stoicism that provides a potent example in opposition to the Christian view. It also is an example of the breadth of beliefs shown by Sienkiewicz in his portrayal of the culture and character of the Roman world.This contrast of philosophies underlies the novel and made it more interesting to me than the simple love story that it also presents. In Quo Vadis we are presented with an historical novel of depth that shows us the corruption and depravity of Nero's Rome while it presents the worlds of aesthetics and skepticism represented by Petronius and that of the young Christian sect whose believers include Peter and Paul, of biblical fame, and Ligia, the barbarian princess who becomes the focus of young Vicinius' amour. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the nineteenth century had several writers (Bulwer-Lytton, Kingsley, and Wallace) including Sienkiewicz who reacted to the prevalence of anti-christian views among the romantics (Shelley, et. al.). This is seen in the pronounced admiration for the poor Christians and the sensational nature of the culmination of the story involving the Neronic destruction of many of the Christians in terrifically brutal games. In spite of this Sienkiewicz through vivid detail creates a believable historical setting for his love story; and overcoming his biased portrayal of the Christians and the contrast with the irrationality and evil of Nero, he succeeds in telling a moving and thoughtful portrayal of Rome in the first century A.D."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I'm a huge Sienkiewicz fan. The Deluge, With Fire and Sword, Fire in the Steppe, The Teutonic Knights all were phenomenal books. While I also loved Quo Vadis, I didn't get the same page-turning thrill that I did with the previous Sinekiewicz books I've read. Some indefinable quality just didn't transfer from the author's martial tales of medieval Poland to Pauline-era Rome.Perhaps, the thematic romance between Vinicius and Lygia threw me off, though, as romances go, it was deftly done. There certainly was no lack of despicable Neronian deeds and compassionless megalomania. Petronius, the protagonist's Machiavellian uncle, is one of the more finely-wrought characters one will find.In the end, it's personal preference. I, used to Sienkiewicz tales of war, pillage, and plunder, found myself in the midst of a love story and couldn't shake it off. This is no basis to pan a piece of excellent literature - a classic that, despite my druthers, is written as well as any other. There is much to be gleaned from good historical fiction and this book proves no exception. Quo Vadis takes the reader through the horrors of Neronian empire and deposits them at the other end a better student for it. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Saying this book is nothing but Religious Propaganda, as one reviewer put it before, is ludicrous. It's like saying that Gone With the Wind is southern propaganda. Just because this book narrates the persecution of the early christians in Rome doesn't mean Sienkewitz is a newborn Christian (he wrote it in in the late 1800's! ) he is just basing himself in the known history of Rome at the time, plus probably visited some of the many cathacombs that served as hiding places for early christians and that can be found all over Europe and even Asia... It's a fictional novel that doesn't pretend to be a historical document, just to tell great adventure with a fantastic backround .. This book is up there with I, Claudius, Sinuhe The Egyptian, and the Name of The Rose as my top favorite Historical Novels."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Quo Vadis draws the reader into the time of Nero and into the hearts and heads of the main characters.

Hey, high school students, this is a great way to get a grip on how things worked in early A.D. Rome. Nero, Lydia, Marcus, and Petronius were unforgetable characters. This is love at its greatest!

It has been a year since I've read it and I'm still raving about it! Hey, guys, this is a cool book for men to learn about love. I'm telling you, it is worth it!"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I had honestly never heard of Nobel Laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz--though I was aware of the title of this novel--until I picked up an interesting looking book at the Dartmouth Bookstore one day. It had a cover painting of a Cossack or someone wielding a saber and an introduction by James Michener. Either Michener or a cover blurb referred to the book, With Fire and Sword, as the great novel of Poland. So I figured what the hey, and I bought it. Well, suffice it to say, Henryk Sienkiewicz is now one of my all-time favorite authors.Basically, Sienkiewicz was a victim of a trap that I had never previously given much thought to; he simply had no great modern translator to render his work accessible to us. With Fire and Sword and the volumes that followed it to form a trilogy had not been translated into English since Jeremiah Curtin, a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, did so on their publication. Though there appears to be some scholarly dispute about the quality of Curtin's work, I tried reading reading his translation of the middle volume, The Deluge, because the new translation is almost impossible to find, and I have to say that as desperately as I wanted to read it, I could not get into the flow of his text. The Polish names make for tough sledding anyway, but combined with his fairly archaic English, I just couldn't take it.Quo Vadis? has actually remained more popular over the years, in fact it is one of the best selling novels of all time, so there have been decent translations available all along, but you really should seek out the W. S. Kuniczak version if you can find it. Kuniczak, himself a novelist, devoted at least six years to updating Sienkiewicz's Trilogy and his dedication to the author's work paid off brilliantly. Though still recognizably written in the style and language of a hundred years ago, the books now read with a much more natural flow. His background as a novelist seems to have served him well, because rather than reading like someone converted Polish to English verbatim, they read like an English retelling of the Polish tale. That obviously could be cause for concern to folks who have a thorough grounding in the original, particularly if he took great license with the author's work, but as a reader, all I really care about is that his versions are terrific books.The novel--which will particularly appeal to anyone who enjoyed Ben-Hur (see Orrin's review) or The Robe--is set in Nero's Rome and is built around the stark contrast between the voluptuary decadent Romans and the ascetic Christians. Vinitius is a patrician in good standing at Nero's court until he falls in love with the Christian girl Ligia. At first somewhat reluctantly, but then with gathering fervor, Vinitius is drawn out of the moral depths of his prior life and himself becomes a Christian. By the time that Nero burns down Rome and blames the Christians, Vinitius has become a believer and is prepared to sacrifice his position and even his life to save Ligia from the Coliseum and the Games where Nero sacrifices Christians to distract the restless populace of Rome.In addition to Bread and Circuses and the romantic tale, there are scenes of surpassing beauty centered on Christian faith. One such is Vinitius's baptism scene; after he tries futilely to convince the Apostle Peter to flee to Sicily with him and Ligia, Peter responds:&quot;The Lord will bless you for your kind heart and noble feeling, but you do not realize that the Master Himself thrice repeated to me the words, 'Feed my sheep.'&quot;Vinitius became silent not knowing what to respond.Peter continued, &quot;I cannot leave my flock in the day of disaster. When there was a storm on the lake and we were all terrified in the boat, the Lord did not desert us. Why should I, His servant, desert my flock, those whom He has given me?&quot;Then Linus raised up his emaciated head and said weakly, &quot;O Peter, Christ's appointed shepherd, why should I not follow your example?&quot;Vinitius rubbed his forehead as if struggling with his thoughts, then taking Ligia by the hand spoke to all present: &quot;Hear me, Peter, Linus and you, Ligia. I only spoke as my own human intellect dictated. However all of you reason according to Christ and His teaching. I don't fully understand that yet and my inclination and my thinking is still different from yours. But since I love Christ and want to be His servant, I here kneel before you and swear to you that I too will not leave my brethren in the days of trouble.&quot; Then he raised his eyes and with religious fervor exclaimed, &quot;Do I understand You at last, O Christ? Am I now worthy of You?&quot;His hands trembled, his eyes glistened with tears, his whole body shook with faith and love. Peter took an earthen vessel filled with water and, pouring the water over the head of Vinitius said solemnly, &quot;I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.&quot;Another such scene explains the title of the book. &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot;, means &quot;where are you going?&quot; and derives from a New Testament verse (John 13:36). As Sienkiewicz renders it, Peter is finally leaving Rome, at the behest of Paul and the remaining Christians, when:Suddenly, up ahead a vision struck the eyes of the Apostle. It seemed to him that the golden circle of the sun, instead of rising in the sky, moved down from the heights and was advancing on the road toward them. Peter stopped and asked Nazarius, &quot;Do you see the brightness up ahead approaching us?&quot;&quot;I See nothing,&quot; replied Nazarius.Peter shaded his eyes with one hand and said after a while, &quot;Someone is coming toward us amid the gleam of the sun.&quot;But no approaching footsteps could be heard. All was quiet around them. Nazarius however noticed that the trees were quivering in the distance as if someone was shaking them. The light too was spreading in a broad vista over the plain. He looked in amazement at the Apostle.&quot;Teacher, what is the matter?&quot; he cried out in alarm.The staff fell from Peter's hand to the ground. He stood motionless looking intently ahead of him; his mouth was open; on his face Nazarius could see surprise and rapture.Then Peter threw himself on his knees, his arms outstretched and cried out, &quot;O Christ! O Christ!&quot; He prostrated himself kissing someone's feet.The silence continued long. Then the words of Peter could be heard by Nazarius, with mingled sobs coming from the old fisherman, &quot;Quo Vadis, Domine?&quot; (Where are You going, Lord?)Nazarius did not hear the answer but to Peter's ears came a sad but sweet voice saying, &quot;When you desert my people, I am going back to Rome to be crucified a second time.&quot;The Apostle lay on the ground, his face in the dust without motion or speech. It seemed to Nazarius that he might have fainted or even died, but he finally rose, picked up his staff with trembling hands and without a word turned back towards Rome.The boy, seeing this, asked, &quot;Quo vadis, domine?&quot; (Where are you going, sir?)&quot;To Rome,&quot; answered the Apostle in a low voice. And he returned.It is sequences like this that make this not merely an action packed historical melodrama but also a genuine novel of ideas. At the core of the story lies the miracle of how an obscure religion embraced by the people at the very fringes of this society, literally hiding in catacombs to escape persecution, could rise up, conquer the Empire and reshape the world. On either plane, the physical or the metaphysical, thifind the rest of Sienkiewicz's works is an exciting story and is sure to send you scurrying to.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

The story itself is good, but do NOT get this edition!!!!"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I believe that this is one of the best books ever written Its major prop line is typical of the time: a young man falls in love with a young woman and vica versa but they cannot be together. Sigh. It is the circumstances, as well as the secondary plot lines that give this book incredible power. It is a mirrored reflection of modern times. A demoralised society whitewashed to the outside world, but inside it is decadent, amoral and corrupt. It is against this background that a young tribune, Marcus Vinicius meets Lygia, the adopted daughter of a Roman general and decides that he wants her as his mistress. Lygia, however, is a Christian. The characters in this novel are many, some fictional, others factual, and all have an immense impact on the development and effect of the story. Firstly, there is Marcus Vinicius, who believes that he must get the best out of life. He does not understand the Christians who allow the wishes of their God to prevent them from participating in the pleasures he has indulged himself in all his life. Then there is Lygia, a dedicated Christian who desperately tries to explain her faith and the joy and new life it brings to a disbelieving Marcus, and is confused when he does not seem to feel what she feels and see what she sees. Petronius is probably the best realised modern character of all. He is a satirical, well-educated man who is quite ready to believe that Christ existed and that He is powerful above all, but has no intention of following Jesus because it will mean disrupting his way of life. Chilo is another. He is one who thinks that he understands Christianity but really does not because he was failed to percieve the beliefs, the concepts, and the soul of the faith, and thus has missed the whole point of the Christian religion. This is a very well written. Unfortunately, some parts of the translation fall completely flat, while other fairly ring with power. A very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"While the Kuniczak translation of this GREAT novel (like THE ROBE and THE SILVER CHALICE) is ok it is no where near as good as the Curtain Translation -- sorry about that. This novel was written a hundred years ago and should be read by English translated language of 100 years ago. Otherwise you get something less than what this great epic deserves. And by the by the History in this book is indeed TRUE and anyone who suggests otherwise was educated on Rome via I, CLAUDIUS or someother such ludicrous soap opera. Read this book.

Those readers partial to the speedy &quot;assembly-line novel', will no doubt find it somewhat challenging to get involved with the story. But Sienkiewicz's ability to bring his readers close to the story's characters will richly reward the reading experience of the persistant reader. I loved the novel.

Each person that has read it has thanked me."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is one of my favorite books for all time. It has some glaring flaws in it. I could've done without all the preachy messages about Christianity. The female characters are poorly characterized--either paragons of virtue (Ligia) or pure evil (Poppea).Despite this it has some of the most moving passages as well as an unforgettable character in Petronius. The letters near the end of the book between Petronius and Vinicius are true literary gems.In fact, one can argue that Sienkiewicz achieved exactly opposite of what he wanted. Every passage with Petronius is scintillating and fresh, whereas most passages with Peter is dull and uninspiring (with the notable except of the final \\"Quo Vadis\\" passage).Vinicius asked how much better the world would be if people accepted Peter and Christ, but whose world would you live in? The middle ages or Rome (which in a couple of generations was in the midst of Pax Romana). I think it's kind of a no-brainer.Anyway, it's a great book. Everyone should read it, but I would plead that you don't read it with a religious bent. It robs the book of its best parts."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Spoiler alert. This will be a short review and the plot is as follows - Roman pagan is smitten by a Lygian queen who converts to Christianity. It takes him 300 pages to see the light and convert himself and another 200 pages for her to be rescued from torture and death by Nero and his evil minions. Thats it! 500 plus pages. All Christians are good, Almost all pagans (except one) are bad. Save yourself the time."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"The conflict between paganism and Christianity has never before been better dramatized than in this breathtaking novel. It's only a shame that Rome traded Petronius for Peter.It's the former that makes this novel for me. A real Roman, whose last days are recorded by Tacitus, Petronius is in the unenviable position of being the Supreme Critic of Taste during the reign of the supremely tasteless and supremely powerful Nero. Meanwhile, the old Roman high culture he embodies is being destroyed by blood-engorged Imperial parasites on one hand and by bloodless Christians on the other. O tempora! O mores! What's a good Roman to do?This novel would receive a 10 if only I hadn't had to endure the authors' obvious sentimentalism for the spiritual destroyers of the world's greatest Empire."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This book is one long sermon. Very tedious. Robert Graves' Claudius novels & Count Belisarius are much better books.

It tells the story about the first European christians in a setting of Nero's Rome. Still the person descriptions are a bit too simple and shallow for my taste. It was first published at the hight of the epic novel in the last part of the 19th. century, but as said the person descriptions never go beyond the kind of Victor Hugo like characterisation. The most interesting character of the account is definitely Nero himself, I am not sure that the author intended it to be this way. It rather seems like that the account was written as a praise to Christianity."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"\\"Quo Vadis\\" is one of my favorite works of literature. The characterization is generally very well executed and the plot was able to hold my interest throughout. Sienkiewicz created characters who are sure to be loved or supremely disliked by the audience and several characters change throughout the novel making them even more interesting. Despite some historical errors (most scholars now believe Nero didn't order Rome burned), the work was obviously highly reasearched. Sienkiewicz did a fantastic job at showing some of the darker sides of Roman culture; the novel is very violent in places. Sadism is quite blatantly visible in regards to some of the \\"amusements\\" the imperial court and circus crowds entertain themselves with. The scene in which Rome burns was protrayed vividly and epicly. Overall, I believe Sienkiewicz deserved a nobel prize for literature for this piece alone.I read \\"Quo Vadis\\" earlier this summer after returning from a trip to Italy. The reading experience was greatly enhanced by seeing some of the sites promently featured in the novel. Although the novel leans Catholic, I believe Christians of about any denomination can enjoy it (I am a Southern Baptist myself). Even non-Christian readers might enjoy the plot and vivid detail.Personally, I preferred this novel to Ben-Hur (I enjoyed and would recommend both books though)."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"Excellent novel describing the struggle of early Christianity under the tyrannical and mad Emperor Nero. It's also a beautiful love story, the love of a handsome but troubled Roman soldier who has to give up his old ways of thinking for a beautiful Christian girl. This book really makes you think and does a wonderful job of showing the contrast between the simple truths of the early Christians and the debauchery that permeates the word. Petronius is the most memorable character, with his sarcastic, dry sense of humor and his ability to control the vanity of Nero. One of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This is a story of love that defies all odds, a faith that defies the most powerful man on earth, and a moral code that survives the most brutal of tortures, the most horrible of deaths. \\"Where are you going?\\" asks the Latin title - a question that St. Peter directs at the vision of Christ, but one that Mr. Sienkiewicz directs at Rome of the first century, and by implication his world of the late 19th century - a world where the old moral values were dying, and new ones have yet to appear.Little mentioned in modern criticism, and largely unknown to modern readers, Quo Vadis, published in Polish in 1896, is considered to be the best selling novel of all time. It has been translated to more than 40 languages, and has been adapted into a play, an opera, and four different films (the best known of those being a 1951 movie featuring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr). In 1905, it earned Henryk Sienkiewicz a Nobel Prize for Literature, and international fame. Its unequaled success may be partly due to its glamorized treatment of early Christianity, but the main reason for its success is more pleasant: Quo Vadis is, in fact, one of the technically greatest romantic novels ever written.A moment before the great Roman Empire crumbles into dust, under the all-powerful emperor Nero, an impossible love affair starts a chain of events that will turn life around for many. Marcus Vinicius, a young Roman aristocrat, falls in love with Lygia, a beautiful Christian girl of royal descent. Through their tumultuous relationship Vinicius, still a pagan and a slaveholder, learns to appreciate the newly formed Christian religion, with its stress on the individual soul, respect towards one's fellow men, and forgiveness. He learns the difference between Lygia and the lewd, frivolous women of his time, and begins, gradually and torturously, to accept the new faith.But the reign of the sadistic, narcissistic Nero is the worst possible setting for a love affair of this kind, and as Nero searches for scapegoats to blame for the burning of Rome, which he himself instigated, the Christians fit perfectly into his plans. Soon the two lovers, together with everyone they have come to love and respect, will be in the gravest danger. Not even the apostles Peter and Paul, sharing their adversity, can guarantee their safety in this world.Henryk Sienkiewicz strove to perfect every element of his craft - and did. The plot is complex, logical, fast-paced and suspenseful. The theme is important, and so well-integrated into the plot that one cannot separate the two. The writing style is superb, alive with metaphors and very witty. One feels as if he sees the whole of Rome in front of him, its orgies and slaves, its great wealth and great corruption, the red flames consuming it while dancing enchantingly to Nero's lute.Nothing makes turn of the first millennium Rome more real to us than its characters. Fully developed individuals to the least of them, Sienkiewicz's characters come to life in the reader's mind - and stay with him long after the book is put aside. Nero the poet, who murders and burns for inspiration; Vinicius, who has to fight his soldier's instincts and put his faith in greater forces; Petronius, a frequenter of Nero's court, who's unforgettable wit and charm are surpassed only by his hidden moral nature (which he would prefer to call simply \\"good taste\\"). Even the two apostles receive a full development and are presented as conflicted, suffering human beings - who remain true to their beliefs.But what is the message of this story? What is its theme? And can any non-Christian sympathize with it? The answer to the last is yes, because this is not primarily a story about Christianity, but about the power of morality. The Rome that Sienkiewicz portrays is evil not because it is non-Christian, but primarily because it has no regards for morality as such. It is a nightmarish mix of nihilism, pragmatism, and hedonism - all of which are not systems of morality at all, but denials of the very need for morality. Even though Sienkiewicz offers early Christianity as the model of morality, it is clear from his choice of characters and events, as well as his stylistic focus, that he does not mean to present a specific, fully developed moral code, but to the essence of morality itself. The theme of this story is: the ultimate impotence of unprincipled evil, even if it does seem all powerful, against a principled morality.And indeed, the objectivity of this piece is noteworthy: Not all Christians are presented as good, and not all \\"heathen\\" are presented as evil. Even inside the emperor's court, one can find heroism. Indeed - the noblest character in this novel is that of Petronius who, despite being somewhat sympathetic towards the Christians, is by no means a Christian, and does not wish to become one.The inconsistencies of Christian morality are not glossed over or ignored. A few times throughout the novel the pacifist Christians are saved only when one of them commits the sin of self-defense and kills a few Roman soldiers. He is then overcome by guilt, and \\"forgiven\\" by the very same people he had just saved from sure death. At other times the principle of forgiveness gets the Christians in a world of trouble - and indeed this whole Christian holocaust could have been prevented with a little less forgiveness towards one very evil character. One can sense, though this is open for debate, that Sienkiewicz is not a great fan of turning the other cheek.Heaven and hell, the afterlife, are not treated in this novel as facts, but hopes and fears of men who admit, at least to themselves, that they are not sure. In a sense, they are all holding on to their beliefs because they feel it alone gives them a sense of an orderly, just universe in face of the grim reality of ultimate power and ultimate corruption. While I disagree that only a belief in God can grant meaning to life and instill moral principles, I did enjoy this book as a story about the power of morality as such - and with that in mind one can admire the heroism of men who abide by their principles, even when one disagrees with those heartily.Perhaps the greatest value of this work lies in the way it brings ancient history to life, and examines it. The author had obviously done a tremendous amount of historical research, and is well versed in even the smallest details of the times. The historical characters (Nero, Petronius, Burrus, Senecio, St. Peter and St. Paul) are fully developed fictional characters, yet they are true to what historical records tell us about them, even when dramatized.Alongside its philosophical-moral theme, the novel presents a historical theme. \\"How is it possible,\\" one can imagine Henryk Sienkiewicz asking, \\"that such a small group of people, and such a strange mix of ideas spread like wildfire and take over the Roman empire, and the entire world, so quickly?\\". The novel dramatizes the answer beautifully: Christianity gave absolute and more humane moral answers, at a time of a complete moral and intellectual vacuum.The historical events described in this novel are larger than life. By selecting a time of such cataclysmic events, Sienkiewicz manages to remain both true to history, and as dramatic as any great romantic writer. One of the high points of the novel is when the great fire of Rome rages through the streets. History tells us that in that fire much of Rome was burned down to the ground, many hundreds were killed, and many thousands lost their homes. Slaves rebelled against their masters. All possible kinds of lowlifes crawled out of the gutters and tried their hands at pillaging what the fire left behind. Nero's Praetorian guards, instead of putting the fire out, helped it spread, and Nero himself did nothing but play his song on the burning of Troy.Imagine what a great artist can do with such an event, and then rest assured: Henryk Sienkiewicz does it better. Unlike the often heavy-handed style of Hugo's historical references, you feel while reading this novel that you are learning the essentials of the time, without being burdened with historical trivia that's irrelevant to the plot.The most serious problem with this novel is mostly the result of the specific morality it promotes: the morality of turning the other cheek. Marcus Vinicius, the so-called hero of this novel and a hot blooded soldier at the beginning of the story, is reduced to a sniveling coward by this ideal. Instead of fighting for his life and love, by the end of the novel he just keeps crying, blanching, and almost fainting like a French noblewoman whenever he hears some bad news. One is tempted at times to cry to high heavens: \\"Christ, bring me back the old Vinicius!\\"Vinicius's transformation into a whining, quivering pacifist is as well-written as the rest of the novel. His focus is slowly shifting from self-defense to turning the other cheek, and that is followed by a shift of focus from this world to the next. As a man of action who's no longer able to strike out, Vinicius is limited to running and praying - which he does quite a bit near the end. This process is portrayed as necessary in the impossible circumstances he is put in, but one cannot avoid feeling disappointed by his weakness, and thank Sienkiewicz for at least providing a better hero, Petronius, who remains a worldly man of action to the end - and drives the plot forward.But what a great hero-substitute is Petronius! His mind is sharp; his morality, though somewhat lacking, represents the best of first century Rome (a mix of hedonism with a sense of honor and good taste); and his wit is reason enough to read this novel. Time and again he manipulates Nero and the entire court to his favor, and time and again he manages to do some good even while playing by the rules of an evil game. When his end comes, he reclaims his integrity and directs his final stab of wit at the great Nero. The best of Rome would perish with him, but what a show it gives before the end!A lot can be said in criticism of the glamorization of early Christianity in this novel. But despite its weaknesses, the story retains a degree of honesty, importance, and drama that was rarely matched since. Henryk Sienkiewicz's technique is near flawless, and the experience as a whole is overwhelming. The modern reader will find that the dilemmas of this novel are still very much alive today, and will rediscover the power of fiction to transcend time, distance, and language."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This novel has ideas, romance, violence, adventure, mysticism, and politics, so it can't be boring even if some reviewers complain about its slow start. Set in the middle of Nero's tenure in power, in the First century AD, it tells the story of Vinitius, a Roman military officer from a Patricious family with good standing at the court. He has the friendship and protection of Petronius, the Arbiter of Elegancy, a sensual, rich and cultivated man with much influence in court. Vinitius falls in love with the beautiful slave Ligia, who is a Christian living with a Roman Patricious family also converted to Christianity. Through his obsession with her, he gradually discovers the new religion and realizes the moral pit in which his culture has been decaying. Then Nero sets Rome on fire and Vinitius finds out that he'll have to rebel against the State in order to gain love. He is baptized and suffers persecution. Then he has to rescue his beloved from the Colliseum, just when she's going to be throwed in to the lions. The end is mystical and completely beautiful, and that's when you understand the title, which means \\"Where are you going, my Lord?\\", and is pronounced by St. Peter as he is fleeing Rome.A very entertaining and rewarding novel, it is also a fictional testimony of the early years of Christendom. My favorite character is Petronius, a liberal, magnanimous and \\"cool\\" Pagan Roman who finds disgrace for protecting those he loves. very recommended."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"I saw the movie as a kid in the fifties and subsequently struggled through the available translation.

In the subsequent conflagration, his corpse remained remarkably preserved.Despite his height and weight, obviously being quite smaller than us, the presence of muscular tone and apparent physical strength is both startling and revealing. National Geographic did an extraordinary photo-essay on this about 15 years ago.Needless to say, these men and women were at least physically the same as us 2000 years later.Sienkiewicz describes for us the debauchery of ancient Rome under the aegis of Emperor Nero and the blossoming of Christianity.The dialogue of the early Christians is, while not disturbing, distracting. By example, Stephen Pressfield's dialogue between Leonidis and the emissaries of Xerxes in Gates of Fire is wholly conjectural. Likewise, Vinicius' coversations with Paul of Tarsus and Peter are also guesswork.Yet, this is a brilliant story of societal conflict, love and treason. One is reminded of some of the correspondence between Lord Acton and the Pope of Rome hundreds of years later. Acton wrote, \\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"And the backdrop of this remarkable love story between a Christian Princess and one of the battle weary Tribunes of Rome is one of total immorality and corruption.Additionally, we get to read a novel over a 100 years old. The first printing of Quo Vadis is in 1896 so we see a great historical romance in a style a century old. No quips here. No witty remarks between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. It's hard times with Super Bowl-like events in the Coliseum where the losers get eaten.It's great read. You really can't go wrong with one of the first \\"best sellers\\" ever written. A little PG-13 caveat. It is quite gory."},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"The battle between good and evil underlies the stories of the greatest works of world literature. This conflict is implicit, if not explicit, in almost every literary work of considerable merit. While in Goethe's &quot;Faust&quot;, the two opposing forces are represented through Mephistophiles and God Himself, in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; by Dostoevesky, the conflict takes place within the soul of Ivan Karamazov. However the central theme of neither is the conflict between good and evil itself. Of the novels of the 19th century, the one which deals with this conflict itself as its main concern is &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. It is a novel set in the reign of the Roman emperor Nero-the period which marked the begining of the decadence &amp; fall of the Roman empire. However, &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; is not just a historical novel depicting the tortured rise of Christianity and the staggering decadence of the Romans. To understand a novel, it must be judged in terms of its abstract meaning - the aspect of universality, the metaphysical value judgements it propounds; the timeless and fundamental problems of human existence it deals with. If a novel projects a certain fundamental view of man and of life; concerns itself with human values, purposes, goals, passions and emotions (which are changeless) it can never become outdated. It is from this point of view that &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; has been and shall remain relevant for all ages to come. In purely abstract terms its theme is, 'the conflict between good and evil', presented in terms of the following questions: which is more powerful?, which shall ultimately triumph? The crux of the novel lies in the dilemma of Peter: Why did Jesus choose Rome - the centre of wealth, power and corruption, drowned in debauchery and immorality - as the place to lay the foundation of the Christian faith? &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; tells us:- 1. Integrity-unflinching devotion to one's ideal-will ultimately reap its fruits. The good, in itself, is indestructible. 2. The evil, in itself is impotent; it shall ultimately perish. 3. Immoral means can never achieve a moral end. 4. By pandering to evil, the essentially noble soul only makes itself a victim of evil, not a winner over it. These value judgements, clearly apply to all men, at all times, all over the world. In a world where the evil seems to be pulverising the good, this novel claims: &quot;The Good shall prevail&quot;. At a concrete level, the theme is: &quot;The tortured but exalted rise of Christianity in the decadent and evil world of Rome&quot;. The plot-theme is :&quot;The agonized spiritual journey of a typical Roman towards the understanding, acceptance and internalization of Christianity.&quot; The Christians represent the Good-an entirely new moral order that seeks to change the world; the Romans represent the Evil-unconcerned with morality. As a part of the background Nero symbolizes evil, Peter symbolizes the good, while the battleground of good and evil is Rome itself. As a part of the central plot, Ligia symbolizes the Christian virtues, Petronius symbolizes the Roman decadence, while the battleground of good(the Christian attitude) and evil(the Roman attitude) is the soul of the hero, Vinicius. The central plot moves and is moved by the background in a manner rarely matched in world literature-the integration of plot and theme is simply perfect. Every action of every character, and every event follows from the characters' values(or moral premises)or quest for values or moral conflicts; dramatizes it and furthers it towards the achievement of those values or resolution of those conflicts, forming a logically determined plot structure. Every event dramatises the spiritual state or development of the characters and every step in the spiritual development of the characters is dramatised. There is a direct analogy between the trials and tribulations of the Christian faith and the complete internalisation of the Christian faith by Vinicius and his quest for attaining Ligia. Another striking feature of the novel is the way in which Sienkiewicz has portrayed an era 2000 years old. One would think - &quot;He must've seen all this with his own eyes!!&quot; The vividness of his descriptions matches (perhaps surpasses, in terms of colour and vitality) the level of Tolstoy in &quot;War and Peace&quot;. I suppose Kuniczak's brilliant translation has enhanced this aspect significantly. There is, however, a minor flaw - many readers may find the first half of the novel rather slow, since it over-elaborately concentrates on Vinicius' psychological development. At the end one is awestruck by the overwhelming merits of the novel - a superlative sense of drama; a wonderfully handled plot structure; the fact that that the power to chose one's actions in full focus of ones values has been given to man; that integrity, endurance and moral courage have been glorified; that love has been projected as a response to another's moral values and virtues, integrating the soul and the body; the fact that the basic premise is that the world is a place where the good shall ultimately triumph over the evil and the fact that man has been projected as being capable of achieving supreme joy and spiritual fulfilment. The above view has been given in reference to the hardcover version of W. S. Kuniczak's translation of &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot;"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"What a book, I have told people many times to read this book, it is epic and wonderful, a must read"},{"Title":"Quo Vadis (The Best Sellers of 1897)","review":"This was a re-read for me, having read it as a teen in the early 1960's. This translation is quite flowery, and filled with Roman terms for parts of buildings, status of people, and tools, all in Latin. (I must have read another translation back then, because the flowery Edwardian English is truly obfuscatory for a modern reader.) I had thought annotations would make history a bit more understandable. There are very few notes in the Kindle edition, and most of the Latin terms are let stand without note. It helped that I had both high school and college Latin, but it would have been more helpful to have read it with a Latin/English dictionary at hand. I did read it with a map of Imperial Rome close by, and the author's physical descriptions of places in relation to one another are quite accurate.This does put human faces on early Christians in Rome, including Peter and Paul, at times utilizing Biblical statements as their speech, and if anything minimizes the decadence of Nero's court. The novel mirrors the standards of propriety of late 19th century readers, and may even have stretched that. A viewer of TV's \\"Rome\\" would be able to imply the breadth of the delicately worded sensual happenings, and this book would be appropriate for PG audiences, though as stated above a difficult read for most.Basically \\"Quo Vadis\\" is a love story between a Roman and a \\"Barbarian\\" royal, captured and serving as a hostage for her people's behavior in their captured Roman province. ( I had forgotten that hostages of this status had rights differing from both Roman citizens and foreigners. There is also the historical accuracy that Paul, as a Roman citizen had to be tried and found guilty before he could be prosecuted as non-Roman citizens could be ). Amidst this love story is a story of Faith and the fervor of early Christians, convinced their Savior's return was imminent.A very good read, if at times frustrated by the Latin terms and Edwardian language.

Lonely and desperate for playmates, he has to make do with the kindly old lady and his own imagination. He is intrigued by a realistic replica of a sailing ship which is stored high on a shelf in her kitchen. This is the only ojbect in her humble cottage which she will refuses to let him play with, so naturally it acquires additional charm--the attraction of the Forbidden.But the young boy has a mind of his own, capable of reasoning like an adult. Convinced that the ship actually is housing tiny, living beings, he becomes a master of deception and cunning as he plots how to catch them. He lies to granny and sneaks the tantalizing ship down in her absence. Proving the existence of the little fellows (and capturing one alive for public display) become his obsession. Which leads to inevitable disaster. So, are they real or merely the result of an over-active imagination?This is an excellent short book to read aloud; be sure to take a vote on this burning question, before revealing the climax. Although I was dissatisfied with the ending, I was spellbound throughout--I only regret that I can read it for the first time but once!

Looking at the beautiful pen and ink drawings, comparisons to Chris Van Allsberg come immediately to mind. Zelinsky has drawn characters that are beautifully lifelike and real. The story itself leaves a bit to be desired. A strong moral tale about how obsession can make a person crazy, the little boy searching frantically for the miniscule men he imagines inside a small boat eventually goes completely bonkers and rips his grandmother's beloved model ship to pieces. He then, upon realizing that the little men will not be forthcoming, throws himself into his bed in tears. The kindly grandmother goes to comfort him and, in an odd cliffhanger ending, she has not yet seen the damage her grandson has wrought. Bear in mind that up until this point the self-absorbed little boy has been copping out of chores and walks by pretending to be sick so that he might catch the mini men in motion. His grandmother has been worrying about him and tending to him all the while. Kids will not, I suspect, enjoy the ending. The age group for whom this book is intended will undoubtedly demand to know how the grandmother took the news that her grandson was a destructive Tasmanian-like devil in her home.

He is certainly best known for his Walt Slade Texas Ranger novels which were an outgrowth of his pulp western writings of 30s and 40s, some of those appeared under the Jackson Cole name, with Jim Hatfield being another of his fictional characters.This particular western novel appeared as a hardcover from Arcadia House in 1957, with the main focus on Tombstone, Arizona Territory, in the days of John Ringo and Wyatt Earp and Curly Bill Brocius. The book chronicles the \\"long and deadly friendship between the shrewdest, most vicious outlaw Arizona had ever known (Curly Bill) and John Ringo\\". It may also be safe to say that Ringo was one of the few men who could have stood even with Earp in a shoot out, but since Ringo ended up dead: some say by suicide while others say Doc Holliday gunned him, history was never to know. Wyatt is reputed to have called Ringo 'the deadliest man in the west'. But then I recall Wyatt also said something similiar about Buckskin Frank Leslie, at the time Leslie was working for Earp as bartender in Tombstone. No matter though, all three of these gunman were aces when it came to firing a pistol, and Tombstone, Arizona Territory, had more gunsharps than a tree full of owls.This is an excellent historical western of fiction by an exceptional writer of western fiction, a writer who came of age during the 'pulp western' era. Though in many ways he has been lost to modern day readers, with many of his books commanding larger prices from dealers, though Leisure Books has recently released a few of his works. If you enjoy westerns and are fortunate to come across a Bradford Scott, Leslie Scott, A. Leslie Scott, or Jackson Cole western, you would be advised to pick it up, pard.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"I lived in Thessaloniki as an exchange student in 1980. I wish that this book had bee available for me to realize the historic gems around every corner of my favorite city at that time. Mazower's book opens up the reasons for its (the city's) being and why it was and is so important. People of every religion, or none, will be fascinated by its political turmoil and intrigues, and visitors today can walk the same roads and shop in the same marketplaces as those who went before them, thousands of years ago.I have purchased this book several times and keep giving it away to other Thessalonians and people who love Thessaloniki as much as I."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"The Mazower book is superb.

I now know more, and this book certainly helped. It is also enjoyable to read. The Balkans are complicated; focusing on one unique city which has a rich past is a useful entree. The author does a fine job describing the upheavals of mass population movements over the centuries. I was little aware of those in the early twentieth century between Greece and Turkey; this book describes them well, and allows one to better appreciate the variety of ethnic cleansings which have gone on over the decades."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"I was born in Thessaloniki and after reading this book I feel like I should excuse myself for being born there a Greek! Interestingly the 5 and 4 stars are coming from folks who from their comments seem to have never visited the city. One wrote \\"the once cosmopolitan city...\\" The city is very much cosmopolitan today as ever and even politically it played and still plays a prominent role in Greek politics including the November 17th revolts and so much the same in the tough times that Greece goes through today.The author provides a caricature of the hardships in Greece during the German occupation using of all sources a full paragraph from the pro-nazi French government about Thessaloniki of the 40-42. He goes as far as to claim that the Germans brought food to help the Greeks!!! This is an outrageous assertion neglecting completely the fact that the Greeks were punished with a blockade by the Germans both for their successful resistance against the Italian invasion and the general strike that followed after the German invasion itself. In fact the author chose to omit altogether the fact that WWII was brought by the Italians first! In his narrative WWII was brought by the Germans in Greece from the North. In so many ways the author presents a pretext of Greek intend if not a plan for the German holocaust!It would have just been a book after all had I not met with a Jewish friend who went on and on about this narrative to me of all people when my family at the time took grave risks to provide shelter and hide people who were otherwise heading to the trains of death.I would have read it differently if it were entitled \\"The Jewish History of Salonika: A City of Ghosts\\" than this misleading title. Salonica is not a City of Ghosts, she is a city of glory and drama as most other cities in the region are. She stood over one century after another seeing her residents falling victims to one destructive force after another, witnessing massacre and peril by what a Bosnian intellectual called the destroyers of cities, folks who came to take, from armies to politicians. Only in that common destiny is the second part of the title \\"Christians, Jews and Muslims\\" justified.There is no love for the City in this book to begin with. For the author this city is merely a city of ghosts. For me and for those who lived and died in it regardless of time and religion it was, is and will always be sweet home. I am a Greek and proud for the city's history and its legacy, for being the birthplace of legendary reformers and men of action, from the Cyril brothers to Kemal Ataturk and the Venizelos revolution, to the Politechnic School of '73 and the resistance against the great sellout of today my city is strong and alive. The voices,colors and the wisdom of those being forcefully taken and of those who left are still there and trust me they are no ghosts at all. Come visit and then write a review about the \\"once cosmopolitan city.\\"I maintain two stars for the effort. I cut off two stars for the inaccuracies and the bias, and one for the destructive intent and effect of both. I would love to see a book that would address the wounds of the city without the chauvinism; constructively, and with the city's past present and future in mind."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"This book on Salonica was most interesting indeed and certainly offers an indispensable preparation for anyone thinking of visiting this city - although, clearly, from Mazower's account very very little of old Salonica now remains, so much having been destroyed or having been purposefully built over. However, when one finds oneself confronted by the sea of post-war concrete that is modern Salonica, dotted here and there by the occasional reminder of its Byzantine past, this book will provide depth and background where little is visually present. It is very well written and almost every fact within it is referenced.But I have to say that I became aware early on in my reading of \\"Salonica - City of Ghosts\\" that the author's purpose seemed, above all, to show the horrific plight and end of the Jews of the city. As the text worked towards the horror of the Nazi extermination camps, I was conscious that although the author described in detail the unbelievably vast numbers of refugees streaming in from Anatolia (Asia Minor), well before the 1923 formal exchange of Christian and Muslim populations between Greece and Turkey, he did not describe or dwell upon the terror of the Greek Genocide that had been going on in Anatolia in such away that the reader's sympathies were as aroused as they could have been, towards the Christian (Greek-identifying) refugees. This seemed to me rather an extraordinary omission because, of course, most of those Greeks who managed to escape the Greek Genocide ended up in the refugee settlements of Salonica which Mazower does describe in exceptional and vivid detail. In fact, I did not see the word \\"Genocide\\" in the text until I turned a page and saw it heading the chapter on the Holocaust. All that happened in Asia Minor, between 1912 and 1923, according to the text, were a few sporadic massacres. This was most certainly not so. There was a Greek Genocide and there was an Armenian Genocide (both Greeks and Armenians were Christian) and both genocides were perpetrated by the (Muslim) Turks. To date 26 different states or cities around the globe have recognised the Greek Genocide by formal decree.The book is subtitled \\"Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430 - 1950\\" and indeed the position of each of these religious groups in Salonica during the period 1430 to 1950 is examined in detailed in this book. However, within that period, from roughly 1500 to 1945, the dominant population of Salonica consisted of Jewish refugees from Spain and Portugal. And then when one observes the greater degree of detail in the text regarding the Jewish plight in World War II than regarding any other period in the city's history one senses the unindicated intention of the writer. I feel also that in effect this book pans the Greeks' \\"Hellenization\\" of Salonica and does so partly by panning the Greeks for not stopping the Nazi genocide of the city's enormous Jewish population, although Mazower does acknowledge that some Greeks did risk their lives to outwit the Nazis by either hiding Jews or spiriting them elsewhere.There is of course nothing wrong with this book climaxing and ending shortly after the Jewish Holocaust: it's just that the subtitle on the front cover should have more accurately reflected the effect of the text. And as 60 years have now passed since 1950, this history of modern Thessaloniki is strangely and disappointingly incomplete. I would have liked to know of all that has happened within the city in the last five decades, at least. For example, there has been an enormous Albanian influx, and Albanians are mainly Muslim. Additionally there is the continuing controversy regarding Macedonia. Also, there are still Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Salonica and it would have been satisfying to have a complete account.For an excellent reading list regarding the Greek Genocide, I recommend the Bibliography page in the Documents section at [...]."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"The book has a couple of slow passages, but overall Mazower offers a very lively account of Salonica since Ottoman times.

I will be honest and say that I'm not only reading this book to learn about Salonica, but to understand what is meant when it is claimed that Muslim countries have frequently been more tolerant than Christian ones. This history shows that Ottoman Salonica was a model for its time, a place that welcomed the Jews that the 'West' rejected (this is for those whose selective historical memory considers the 'West' always to have been the enlightened, tolerant place it is now). By modern standards, the Ottoman period was not tolerant, that's for sure. But those who might dispute condemnations of pre-modern Europe, saying we cannot judge the past by the standards of the present, ought not to pass similar judgment on contemporary Islamic societies; if they do, they must admit the Muslims come off far better in comparison. And by the way, Mr. Frantzman, the Turks were just as much expelled as the Greeks (they didn't just 'leave'); you seem to have this notion that only Muslims are culpable for their sins. You also forget that Mazower speaks of Christian slavers operating at the same time as Muslims in the Mediterranean, so don't be smug about that (it's bizarre in any case for a Jew to be defending the 'West' so single-mindedly, which killed more of his people than anyone else ever). Indeed, the West forced the Turks to end slavery, but this is because they had adopted modern, liberal policies, not because they were Christian or Western, which was never a barrier to slavery."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"500 years of a city in the Balkans makes for an awful lot of history. Salonica (or Thessaloniki as it is known today) is located at one of the crossroads of the world. It is Greek at the moment, but has at times been Turkish. As a crossroads it had strong Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities. It was not without conflict, but they lived together for centuries. Only in fairly modern times were the Muslims forced to leave, and during World War II the Germans rounded up the Jews as part of the final solution (which makes for tragic reading).This is an area far from the mainstream of most modern American history books. Most of our history comes from other areas of the world. So this book opens new areas to study for the first time. It is exhaustively researched and provides an insight into a world, a culture far from our own. For many years, this was considered the orient, where east meets west.A fascinating place, a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"This book covers Salonica, a city in North East Greece, where once thrived a more diverse community. It covers the mostly Ottoman period and then into the period of nationalism, war and the present.A few significant items are brought to light through this read. The book tries to reconstruct and explain how this city thrived with so many diverse peoples as a trading center in the Mediteranean. Unlike many books published today on the region this book does not cover up the Ottoman Muslim slave trade that invovled 11 million Africans and millions of Russians and Slavic peoples, many of whome passed through Salonica as it was a center of the slave trade in the Mediteranean. This book also tells the truth regarding the fact that it was the British and the West that stamped out slavery in the Mediteranean.The most significant proposal of this book is to try to look at the interplay within a city that was at one time almost 1/3 Jewish with large Greek and Turkish populations and the resulting three religions. The idea here is to try to create a picture of Spain before 1492. In doing so certain negative apsects of Ottoman Muslim imperialism in the region and colonization of Greece are swept under the carpet to make for a more politically correct read. However no punches are pulled relating the population exchange whereby Greekse were forcibly removed from Turkey in 1922 and settled in Salonica and Turks left the city for Turkey. In the 1940s the Nazis came to Salonica and the once thriving ancient community was brutally deported and destroyed almost to a man. THis is the modern world, and Salonica only serves as a good example of the evils of modernity and runaway social extremes and political 'solutions'.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"I read this book with particular interest because I was born in Salonica (in 1934, a child of parents who were refugees from Asia Minor) but I found it rather disappointing. While it filled gaps in the stories I had heard from my parents I also found that it treated some stories superficially, such as the the \\"Macedonian struggle\\" that was, in effect, a three way conflict between Greek and Bulgarian bands and Turkish gendarmes. My main problem with the book is that the history of the Salonica is covered through the lens of a political bias. Mazower does not like nationalism and he is quite critical of the Greek policy of Hellenization of Salonica after 1912. Therefore he is sympathetic to all non Greek inhabits of Salonica (including the Jews). But the same attitude would lead him to be negative towards Zionism (Jewish nationalism) and Israel. If I had any doubts about such an inference, they were cleared on page 439 where the following sentence occurs.\\"The history of the nationalists is all about false continuities and convenient silences, the fictions necessary to tell the story of the rendezvous of a chosen people with the land marked out for them by destiny.\\"This seems to be out of place because the Greeks never call themselves the chosen people and for them there was no issue of rendezvous with the land because there was always a large Greek population in what is now Greece and no significant immigration of Greeks from outside the territory of Greece for the first century of the existence of the modern Greek state. The large immigration of 1922-24 was forced on the Greeks from Asia Minor who left their old homelands unwillingly. So either the author has misjudged completely the Greek situation or, more likely, he is taking a shot at Israel. In short, any good words for the Jewish community of Salonica, are to be used, in effect, to make later a case against Israel.It would be nice if we lived in a world where nationalism did not exist but, unfortunately, this is not the case. Ethnic identity seems to be rooted in the human psyche and it is too pat to dismiss it by attributing nationalism to 19th century ideologies. It would have been nice if the Ottoman empire had been modernized without a break up in a multitude of states and all the ethnic groups lived in harmony instead of the horrendous ethnic strife that took place. (My late father was of this view. When he died, I found amongst his files, his Ottoman citizenship papers that he had saved for over half a century.) But it did not happen and it is unfair to single one or two of the states that emerged from the Ottoman empire break up for the offense of nationalism. Interestingly when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, it was also broken up into a multitude of states. Also ethnic strife is by no means limited to the Middle East or Eastern Europe. His bias against nationalism causes the author to downplay the strength of the Bulgarian ethnic identity which results in the weakness of his coverage of the \\"Macedonian struggle.\\"The author laments the loss of the multiethnic character of the city that persisted between the late fifteenth and early twentieth centuries. We must remember that the 20th century saw several cities lose their multi-ethnic character, most notably Alexandria in Egypt, as well as Smyrna, Istanbul, and several others in Turkey, Monastir in Macedonia, etc. (All of these used to have significant Greek populations, and in some cases significant Jewish populations as well.) Why single out the actions of the Greek government for criticism? As a person who has a close connection with this \\"exotic\\" city I found the book far too condescending.If you can take the political commentary with a grain of salt you may find the book interesting reading. It does cover a lot of ground and other reviewers have given a good summary of the contents."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Just started reading this book.

In the center of the city is the ancient arch built to honor the Roman Emperor Galerius who defeated the Persians. There is a new museum devoted to the Byzantines and when a traveler departs from the train station, the locals might ask if \\"Constantinople\\" is the destination.There are some hints of a less homogenized past. For example, there are places that serve Anatolian food or Turkish-style ice cream and there is the Ottoman-built White Tower near the waterfront as well as some disused Turkish baths. And, of course, the boyhood home of Mustafa Kemal, or Atat&uuml;rk, is a great tourist attraction. Still there are few remnants of the Ottoman Turks and even fewer of a Jewish community that was one of the largest in Europe. Today Salonica appears to be purely Greek and Christian. Symbolic of this is the university built on the site of the old Jewish cemetery.So, it is ironic that in recent years Salonica has been praised for its \\"multicultural\\" history. Mark Mazower writes about the period from 1430 to the 1950s when the city really was multicultural; when this historically Christian city was ruled by Muslims and the largest community was Jewish.Ottoman rule began when Sultan Murad II conquered the city after, legend says, a dream in which Allah told him that Salonica was his to take. Christians watched as the Ottomans changed Byzantine churches into mosques and welcomed in large numbers of Sefardim Jews who were fleeing persecution in Spain. By the 16th century, the city was divided among the Christians, Muslims and Jews, with the last group being the largest in number.There are many tragic episodes to tell. After the Ottomans arrive, many of the conquered Greeks are sold in the slave market or reduced to begging for alms. Centuries later, after the Ottoman Empire had ended, the Muslims were forced to leave the city and Greece as a condition of the Balkan wars. As the Muslims left, millions of Christian and mainly Greek-speaking refugees arrived: they had also been expelled from their homes in the new republic of Turkey. Finally, the Nazis took away the Salonica Jews in the Second World War.Most of this book is about the city under Muslim rule. The three communities identified themselves more by religion than by race, yet the Ottomans didn't attempt to extinguish the Christian and Jewish communities. Mazower writes that \\"for contrary to what our secular notions of a religious state might lead us to believe, the Ottoman authorities were not greatly interested in policing people's private beliefs. In general, they did not care what their subjects thought so long as they preserved the outward forms of piety.\\" So Turks, Greeks, Jews, Albanians, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Vlachs were able to live together.Often the different faiths shared curious similarities. Salonica became a center of Mevlevis, who followed the ideals of the Muslim teacher Haci Bektasi, and were \\"always to be found in the company of Greek monks.\\" In fact, among the Albanians who followed the faith, there was the legend that Haci Bektasi had invented Bektashism as a bridge between Christianity and Islam. There was also the Ma'min sect of Judeo-Spanish speaking Muslims. These were followers of Sabbatai Zevi, who proclaimed himself the Messiah for the Jews before converting to Islam in the 18th century. Mazower writes \\"in short, the city found itself at the intersection of many different creeds.\\"The book also describes other aspects of the city and its history. How the Ottoman Jannisaries became a law unto themselves in the 18th century. How Greek merchants became wealthy despite Ottoman rule. How a British national and Salonica resident Jackie Abbott became rich selling leeches to the local healers. There is also much about the 19th century rush to excavate and haul away archeological treasures from the city and the effect of the Muslim women on European visitors.To Europeans in the 18th and 19th centuries, Salonica was the orient. However, at the same time, the city residents began to build and dress in \\"the Frankish style.\\" This period also saw the decline of Ottoman power in the region. In the first part of the 19th century, the new state of Greece was created. The presence of an independent Greek speaking country nearby greatly exacerbated the tensions between Christians and Muslims in Salonica. A wider-spread tension resulted in a series of wars between the Greek state and the Ottomans and eventually brought Salonica into the Greek state. Finally, the new republic of Turkey defeated Greece in the 1922 Balkan War and the two governments agreed on exchange of Muslim and Christian populations. Greece received over a million Orthodox Christians from Asia Minor while Turkey received over 500,000 Muslims. The Muslim presence in Salonica was gone.Twenty years later, with the Nazi occupation, the Jewish presence would disappear as well. Salonica had been one of the great centers of Jewish culture, Alfred Rosenberg reminded Martin Bormann in a letter; so the Nazis gave the city special attention. (The Nazis were surprised to learn that the city had never had a Jewish ghetto.) The occupiers looted the synagogues and sent the Jews to the concentration camps. This part of the book makes chilling reading.Mazower's book could be seen as a counterpart to Philip Mansel's book on Istanbul, \\"Constantinople: City of the World's Desire 1453-1924.\\" That book covers roughly the same period and ends with a lament for the Greeks that once lived in that now almost entirely Muslim city. And many Turks today will express a wish to see Salonica, which was the birthplace of Ataturk, the poet Nazim Hikmet, and very often, their grandparents.Mazower\`s book has some dry pages but also some interesting anecdotes about this once cosmopolitan city. And it is a valuable book because it covers a period of European history that is unknown to many readers. In 2004, many people watching the Olympic games in Athens wondered why \\"The Greeks\\" only referred to Plato, Aristotle, and Alexander the Great and what had happened after the classical era. This book will fill in some of that gap."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Salonika was an anachronism. Unlike most of Europe, where nations had been formed around a major city or a capital, and where ethnic and religious minorities had been absorbed, expelled, killed, or at least marginalized in some fashion, in Salonika different groups lived shoulder to shoulder for over 400 years.Mazower tells the story. First we get Greeks, then Turks, then after 1492 Spanish (and Portugese and Italian) Jews (speaking Ladino, Judeo-Spanish). The first half of the book describes the communities, daily lives, interactions.More communities developed. Sabbatai Zevi declared himself Messaiah, won a following, converted to Islam, and his followers, well, followed him. \\"Donme\\" or \\"Apostates\\" (the descendants of these Jewish converts to Islam) remained a distinct part of Salonika's fabric. Albanians arrived. And eventually Bosnians and Bulgarians as well (there is dispute over whether they should be called Bulgarians or Macedonian Slavs).The first half of the book is jumpy. It is not organized chronologically. Primary document spellings are not followed by modern equivalents. There are insufficient maps. It makes for slow reading. But Mazower hit his stride around 1700. The history begins to flow chronologically. And he tells history as an engaging story. Modern is definitely his period. And the more modern, the better he gets.He includes details that would be easy to gloss over. The story is complex. Mazower makes it flow, and makes it clear, and makes it engaging.The book ends with two major chapters: the Nazi extermination of almost the entire Jewish population of the city is told with great detail. The Greek Civil War seems to be strangely tacked on, with little detail, and little of Mazower's flair. But it hardly takes away from the book's overall strength."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Salonica, City of Ghosts functions well both as a history of Thessaloniki and as a meditation about nationalism. There is a lot to learn, particularly in Europe, from this city which has served as a home for so many cultures.Mazower's book begins with the Hellanistic origins of Salonica and takes it and the reader through years of conquest and recapture beginning with the Ottoman victory in 1430. The book ends with the aftermath of World War II and the birth of the city which we know today. Mazower has a very clear point to make about the way in which conquest becomes an act of erasure and forgetting. The subject of national identity is the thread that ties the pages of the book together.Salonica is very complete and thorough. The pictures selected are appropriate and illustrative and the notes helpful. Mazower is a good writer. I was not as engaged with the book as the material warranted-- Mazower can have a very dry tone which does not always welcome the reader into the work.Recommended for anyone with an interest in Greek or Turkish history. This should also appeal to readers with a general interest in the subject of nationalism and national identity."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Mark Mazower breathes life into a place completely swept away by the conflicts of the 20th century. Masterfully written and eminently readable despite its size, Professor Mazower's work provides depth of detail and real context to all the cross-currents of culture and politics at play, of which he clearly has a profound understanding. While he does show a sympathy toward the much-maligned Ottoman Empire, the effort convincingly argues that the commonly held perception of the Empire in the 18th & 19th century as a decrepit, dysfunctional state was not deserved. He brings to life the lost Turkish presence, as complex as it was often ruthless, the once thriving predominantly-Jewish city the Greeks have willfully buried and forgotten and the substantial Slavic component in the surrounding provinces that dated back to their arrival in the 6th century. He handles the volatile period between the tragic dispossession of the local Turks and the arrival of the horribly tormented Greeks of Asia Minor with great sensitivity by focusing instead on the tragedy of individuals instead of faceless masses. The final chapter is devoted to the Nazi annihilation of the Jews and the city's subsequent metamorphosis into a completely Greek metropolis consciously revising its identity in the older Hellenic context. The singular glaring lapse of this work lies in the author's gratuitous swipes at Greek and Jewish national aspirations, as alluded to by another reviewer below. Somehow, Ottoman hegemony and its destruction of the Classical world it usurped trumps the desires of others who followed it (or more accurately, preceded it). The author seems unable to reasonably reconcile this inconsistency."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Instead of trying to fit everything into the imaginary frame of nation-state based historical accounts, it is much better to focus on a place and observe the interaction of civilizations through time.This book very successfully undermines any simplistic understanding of Balkans and the relationship between faith, state and society.Essential book for anyone who is seriously interested in history"},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Today I got Mark Mazower's first book in Hebrew, a translation of this book I have in English.Two Quotations from the Paperback copy.p 12 \\"By 1950, when this book concludes, Salonica's Muslims had been resettled in Turkey, and the Jews had been deported by the Germans and most of them killed.\\"On the same page \\"Similar transformations occurred in cities across a wide swathe of the globe - Lviv Wroslaw Vilna Tiflis, Jerusalem, Jaffa and Lahore...\\"(I know live with Arabs in Jaffa.

A Greek Orthodox friend found me alone around midnight and said: \\"I understand you, Jacques, you don't really know any more where to go in Salonica, the city where you once knew every stone.\\" And that's how it was.\\"S.C.: Jacques was my fathers friend at school and Sorbonne in Paris. My father survived WW2 and saved most of the family by leaving Salonica for Athens and hiding there as Christians.But the book is the History of Salonica from 1430-1950, not only WW2.WW1 and the Fire in Salonica in 1916.Very Good reading!"},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"Mazower captures in remarkable ways the history of Salonica, a town which is today in northern Greece. At the same time many events that took place at Salonica were repercussions and optics on European and Middle Eastern history as a whole. For very different reasons at different epocs, Salonica found itself responding to events far beyond its shores. In the fifteenth century it became the home of many Jews expelled from Spain. After centuries under Ottoman rule, in the twentieth century it saw the return of Greek rule and then the forced removal of its large Jewish population under German occupation. The story of Salonica is an illustration of the ways in which a single physical place has seen whole communities come and go, typically under tragic circumstances. The book reminds us of how difficult it is for human beings with different beliefs and ideologies to live peacefully together. For many centuries this was achieved in Salonica, but then something changes and persecutions and emigrations follow. Mazower tells these stories without any attempt to prove a thesis about inter-faith or even human relations. There are interesting individuals but no heroes or saints. Communities do good things and do bad things. It is a story of many human lives that would otherwise have been buried with the communities that over the years have been forced to leave and officially left out of the city's history. After reding it Salonica will be on my next trip to Europe!"},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is informative not only about Thessalon&iacute;ki but also the overall region, including the Balkans and Ottoman empire. The author concentrates on the Ottoman period, but the primary focus of the book is how the relationship and conflict between the three religions shaped this dynamic region over time. It was interesting to read how these three groups, that are now antagonistic, lived somewhat peaceably through most of the city's history. In addition, this book gave a fair representation of the agonizing effects from the forced migrations of much of the population and also the Holocaust.The style of the book is a little different than most histories in that it is not purely chronological. The author discusses a particular group over time, then within the same section, will \\"rewind\\" to cover another group that existed around the same period. In retrospect, I think this style makes sense as it allows a thorough analysis of each group; however, it would have been beneficial to have been warned in the introduction or forward that this style would be employed.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to understand more about this city, Greece, and the Ottoman and Byzantine empires, as well as the history of these three religions."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"My background: I was born in Thessaloniki 1961) and leaving the last 25 years in Europe.I found the book excellent in the sense of describing long period of time without prejudices and certain political or historical dogma approach.

Very good analysis."},{"Title":"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950","review":"I first opened Mazower's book hoping that I would read a neutral, unbiased account of the history of my home city with a 2300-yearl old history.I was disappointed. Without much ado, let me say that his account is highly biased, even sometimes anti-Greek.He extolls the \\"contribution\\" of other ethnic groups but fails to mention that the city has been a major Greek center even under the Turks for over 2000 years. By analogy, just because different nationalities live in New York does not make NY a non-american city, which is how Mazower portrays Thessaloniki (NOT Salonica).What he calls \\"peaceful co-existence\\" Greeks, Armenians and others see differently. It was full occupation by a a foreign power over ancestral Greek soil. Bloody oppression was the norm, especially against Greeks and Armenians, less so against Jews.Let me summarize some of his intentional(?) factual mistakes:He writes: Salonica, now known as Thessaloniki...\\" Here's a few facts about Thessaloniki so that the unsuspecting reader is not misled:The city was built in 316 BC by Kassandros, son of Antipatros who was Alexander the Great's general. He had married Thessaloniki, half sister of Alexander the Great, and named the city after her.So the city is NOT only \\"now\\" known as Thessaloniki. It has always been called Thessaloniki. If others who happened to co-habit with Greeks there call it differently, well, that's their right to do so.He writes: \\"Salonica was at its best, economically and culturally, when it was part of a multi-ethnic empire\\".Fact: There always were other ethnicitoes in Thessaloniki but Mazower chooses to minimize Greek presence (it's customary these days. for example the Skopian Slavs decided to usurp Greek history and call themselves Macedonian!!!) and praises the virtually non-existent contributions of others, as if their mere presence constitutes a cultural achievement.He writes: \\"They (the Nazis) wiped out Salonica's Jews while the Greek city fathers looked the other way, more worried about keeping out the Bulgarians than saving their fellow citizens\\".Fact: The legitimate Greek city fathers were up on the mountains fighting the Nazis. The ruling \\"city fathers\\" at the time were Bulgarians; the author here simply shows his anti-Hellenic sentiments. He ignores that Macedonia was under Nazi-Bulgarian occupation. Greeks suffered the most from this dual occupation, but Mazower chooses to minimize it.Fact: When the Germans started rounding up Jews, the standing orders by all resistance groups were that if people could flee to the Middle East, priority was to be given to Jews. Violation of this order was punishable by death.Fact: Since Jews were also Greek \\"fellow citizens\\", they, too, could join the resistance, but their leaders advised them against it. Some did and fought along the side of other Greek compatriots.He writes: \\"In three cities with the greatest number of Jews, Thessaloniki, Ioannina and Monastiri (Pitola), only two Jews from Ioannina, one from Monastiri and eight or nine from Thessaloniki joint the resistance against the Nazis.Fact: It is conveniently not being mentioned that Greece, with a population of 6,5 million at the time, lost 580,000 people during the German occupation (8.9% of the total population), and had 1,000.000 wounded.Fact: A great number of Greek families hid Jews knowing that they were endangering their own lives. It is also being ignored that the then Archbishop of Greece Damaskenos, together with Angelos Evert (Miltiades Evert's father) who was the Chief of Police, issued 27,000 fake IDs and gave them to Jews to escape. It was common knowledge, and living members of the Greek resistance would confirm, that Jews were not only given fake IDs, but also police uniforms and were placed to guard churches so as not to raise German suspicions.In fact, In proportion to population number, Greeks represent the highest number of \\"Gentiles\\" mentioned at Yad Vashem Museum in Israel.He writes: \\"The Nazis may have run the gas chambers, but it was the city government which paved over the Jewish cemetery to build a university\\".Fact: The city government bought the land, paid for it, the Jewish leaders signed the contract, and after their signature added obscurely the words \\"with reservation\\". Based on those words the Jews have taken Greece to European Court for that land that the university is built on.Fact: The government at the time were Nazis and Bulgarians. The Jews who returned to Greece from the concentration camps where the Bulgarians and the Germans had sent them, got their properties back. For the properties of the people that did not return, the Greek government paid the state of Israel in the early 1950s and settled all claims. This was done by the Plastiras-Venizelos government.Obvioulsy, for Mazower this is not worth mentioning.He writes: \\"While city life was marked by the usual odd Ottoman mixture of tolerance and hostility, the blend was successful more often than not\\".Remark: One wonders if the author mentions the fact that Jews of Thessaloniki were the primary financiers of Kemal Ataturk's armies or that Leo Trotsky who was hosted by the Jewish community of Thessaloniki during the Balkan wars, was praising the Ataturk victories while working as a journalist for a Kiev newspaper.Conclusion:It seems that the central theme of the book promotes a coherent objective:\\"Thessaloniki was our city, the Greeks unfairly stole it, they are complicit in the fate of Jews, they (the Greeks) ought to be made to feel guilty, they need to be embarrassed, and finally they must show in practical terms that they are really sorry.Finally, he fails to mention that this has been a Greek city for more than 2000 years.

It is incomplete, biased and unorganized. If you are looking for the author's views of select products and companies the author has chosen to include, then perhaps this book has some merit. If you are looking for an objective analysis of products based upon solid research and the reported results of consumer surveys, you will be disappointed. This book fails to measure product pros and cons, even of those featured, in a consistent and intelligible manner. As a result, when trying to select between two or more similar products, you are left comparing apples to oranges. For example, there are product specification tables in the appendices, but there are not feature rating comparison tables. As a result, the book rambles from one product to the next covering and/or omitting features randomly. If you are just beginning in astronomy, it will definitely whet your appetite for what's out there, but that's where it stops. Finally, on pages 107-8, the author mentions that an unnamed company's products were omitted from this edition of this book based upon the author's personal experience with that company. Even more, the reader is actually invited to compare this edition with the previous and figure out what company's products were omitted! The manner chosen to deal with this company and its products aids in making the book even more incomplete and biased, and does not serve serve the astronomy community well. (Note that I am NOT from that company). This is where survey comparables would have been beneficial. Despite a less than favorable experience, the author did get his money refunded. The company should have gotten a &quot;satisfaction&quot; or &quot;performance rating&quot; based upon cumulative data collected from previous customers, and its products included."},{"Title":"Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Ultimate Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories, 2nd Edition","review":"As an intermediate/advanced amateur astronomer, I purchased Star Ware primarily as a reference tool for optical calculations and starting astrophotography. Well, I wound up reading the book from cover to cover in about two days, and I must say it is a wonderful book for all levels of viewers. It covers everything from selecting equipment and observing sites, to long exposure astrophotography and do-it-yourself projects. The author imparts his knowledge in a no-nonsense way that allows the reader to fully understand the concepts of all topics discussed.If you are just beginning and have not yet purchased a telescope (or binoculars), or are fairly new to astronomy and looking for additional equipment or accessories, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK FIRST! It will help you to become a very informed consumer, teach you to evaluate your observing site(s), and help determine your overall situation with respect to astronomy. For the price of $19.95, the book could save you hundreds (or thousands) of dollars in the long-run. Moreover, you will have a great reference to use throughout your observing career.Whether the reader is interested in planetary work or deep-sky viewing, Star Ware gives great techniques and tips for viewing everything from our own star to the extra-galactic domain. This book helps the beginner to select the proper equipment for starting out, and also guides the more advanced observer in choosing accessories for enhancing equipment performance for specific areas of astronomy. In addition, the book delves into the complex science and art of astrophotography, with helpful suggestions from the author about getting started and basic methods.A very nice part of this book is the appendix section, detailing out equipment, accessories, manufacturers, etc. It also contains the entire Messier Catalog in table form, complete with R.A. and Dec. coordinates. In short, Star Ware is a superb text that belongs on the shelf of every amateur astronomer."},{"Title":"Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Ultimate Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories, 2nd Edition","review":"There are a few books no amateur astronomer should be without. One is Peterson's Field Guide to the Stars and Planets, which packs more useful information into a smaller package than any other book I know of. A second is The Backyard Astronomer's Guide by Dickinson &amp; Dyer, which covers the basics of the hobby in a more expansive, descriptive format.A third member of this short list has recently been republished in a new edition: Star Ware, Second Edition (The Amateur Astronomer's Ultimate Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories) by Philip S. Harrington, 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons. Star Ware is aimed mostly at beginners, teaching in a lively and informal style the basics of how telescopes work and how to use them, but there is a fair amount of information of interest to advanced amateurs as well.The book begins with two chapters about telescope optics and different types of telescopes, with something of the history of telescopes along the way. Chapter 3 covers the pros and cons of each type in some detail, ending with a quiz where you add the point values of your answers to show what type you should buy - fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Chapter 4 is a still more detailed look at the offerings of different manufacturers, again sorted by type. Phil goes easy on the major manufacturers, judging from some of the tales of woe I've heard; but the treatment is fair and useful. Chapter 5 compares the myriad eyepieces available to go with these scopes. Both these chapters have appendices where the information is laid out in convenient tables.Chapter 6 covers finders and filters, other books and software, cameras and CCD's. One thing I would have appreciated would be a similar appendix covering all the competing software packages, what they do well and which was the best for each purpose. As I wrote two months ago, I have purchased a number of these packages and started to evaluate them; maybe I need to write this comparison myself.Chapter 7 was the most interesting to me - a description of projects you can make, from a collimation tool to a video camera bracket to a binocular chair - the latter I want to get started on Real Soon Now. \`Till Death Do You Part' is on care of your scope, and repeats sage advice against unnecessary cleaning, as well as how to collimate your optics.The last and longest chapter, \`It's Time to Solo!', covers the targets to point your scope at (moon, planets, comets, sun, deep-sky), a description of a few dozen of the best deep-sky objects, and a brief introduction to astrophotography. This will be of less interest to advanced amateurs, who probably have more detailed sources of this type of information. One might question why to include this in a book about equipment, but it probably does make it more useful for the beginner who may buy only this book.Parts of the book overlap with the Dickinson &amp; Dyer book mentioned above, but the treatment of telescopes and eyepieces is much more detailed. Overall, a fine book, highly recommended for a beginning amateur, and recommended for an advanced amateur looking to buy a new scope or eyepiece."},{"Title":"Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Ultimate Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories, 2nd Edition","review":"I've read 'em all and Star Ware is, without a doubt, the single best book about equipment for the amateur astonomer ever written.

It was entertaining but I couldn't begin to tell you the plot line. Sue Civil-Brown always writes in an offbeat manner. That's one of the reasons I buy her books. However, this is just a little to much when you can't really figure out the purpose of the story. I didn't care for the heroine or hero. They didn't make an impression on me. I did enjoy the huge cast of secondary characters. If it hadn't been for them, I would have never finished this book. This isn't the best, neither is it the worst I've ever read."},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"SO I was dissapointed in this book. This was my least favorite of all the books by Sue Civil-Brown.First the positive: The saving grace of this book was the zany, creative characters. There was an aunt who has tigers for pets, an uncle who paints and so on. The characters in this book gave me some chuckles. I also liked how there were characters from previous books interwoven into this book. It is nice to revisit old characters and see how their lives are moving forward. I particularly liked Seth in many ways, he was the adult voice that Kelly needed to hear. Also, because this is a Sue Civil-Brown book, my least favorite book of hers is far better than other author's best books.And the negative:Right from the beginning Kelly, the main character, was needy, whiney, somewhat self centered, and fairly certain she was the normal, sane person. Her family of aunts, uncles, grandmother were oblivious to her neediness. I couldn't help feeling that her family just needed to sit her down and explained in simple, honest terms that they loved her, were proud of her, that she didn't need to be a creative type to be important. If they had done that there would have been no story.As it was, there really was very little plot. Kelly comes home to save her grandmother (and her grandmother's money) from Seth, a football star with a bum knee who has become a family friend. She is constantly on the lookout for the negative in him. Seth on the other hand has decided that Kelly has neglected her family and has no problem showing her his dislike for her.Despite the initial dislike of each other, these two manage to gain respect for each other and eventually fall in love.So, although this was my least favorite Sue Civil-Brown book, it isn't a complete waste of time or money to read. I just think that there are better books out there that are much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"I found that I did a lot of skipping. I liked the hero but the heroine mostly annoyed me. I didn't want her to end up with the guy. I would not recommend this one."},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"I almost didn't read this after seeing some of the reviews. I am glad that I changed my mind. This novel was great. I can see where people complained that the romance wasn't really steamy. There maybe was only 6 pages of romance (sex) in the book. So if you are a die hard wanting to read sex scenes every few minutes, this book is not for you. However, if you want to read a great book with a group of fun loving eccentric characters, this book is for you. I thought it was a great book. I don't think Kelly was overly whiney (Maybe a tad but... - it fit the character), but Seth was perfect. I also liked how she added characters from her other books also. It was nice to read about Corrigan again. So if you haven't read this book, don't go by the reviews on this page. Pick a copy up yourself and maybe read a chapter or so at a bookstore. If it grabs your attention read on - I am sure you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"I thought this book was great! Not a lot of heavy romance, but lots of zany characters and laughs. It's not often that I laugh out loud while reading ....

The characters were well fleshed out, but seemed to be existing separately. Kelly's relationship with her family was very special and worth reading the book for. However, her relationship with the hero was not well formed and, frankly, not at all believable. This is a good book to read when you have some forced waiting time; doctor's appointment, long airline flight, etc."},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"If you like a wacky story line you'll love the cast of zany secondary characters in this one, unfortunately, the romance isn't nearly as interesting. The heroine is whiney, selfish, childish and very difficult to sympathize with. Seth, the hero, is terrific though and he so deserved a mature, loving woman to spend the rest of his life with. Instead he got Kelly and I nearly wanted to tear my hair out! END"},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be like something by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I was thoroughly disappointed. I sat down for an enjoyable read and from page 1--I couldn't manage to stay focused or to care about any of the characters. I wished Brown had made an attempt to create vivid but believable characters instead they were all shallow and grating. There wasn't any kind of introduction, the family was just thrown at the reader.While I can understand Brown's desire to make the story zany and the family lovable (again, emulating SEP), I couldn't finish this scattered book and threw it in the trash after barely getting to pg.30.What a waste!"},{"Title":"Catching Kelly","review":"I am only 1/2 way through and I am laughing outloud at every page.

It gives a good basic overview of the history of \\"Old Guard\\" as well as insights into how different from and similar to gay SM is from het SM. There are some odd digressions and a bit too much focusing on why women and hets are in the book (why would they be? this is a book about gay male SM!). Still useful for everyone who does BDSM with a male though if you are too homophobic."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"The title should suggest it all, book for sale discussing matters that would never be put into print by the people discussed -- i.e. hand-book. There were some interesting anecdotes and kinda interesting reading about BDSM, but should be considered complete fiction or fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"I should preface my comments by stating that I am not a Leatherman. I enjoy the leather \\"costume,\\" but felt a need to learn about what it really symbolizes. It was out of respect for the leather community that I picked up the book, in hopes of educating myself on its practices.Larry's text serves as a nice introduction to leathersex, but it is by no means a comprehensive guide for the would-be practitioner. He does an admirable job of explaining the two basic roles of S and M, as well as differentiating between bondage and SM. The text goes into often riveting detail on many of the various roles, scenes and accouterments used by experienced leathermen, always with emphasis on mutual consent and safety.The text lacks a discussion on the details of technique. In my opinion, the inexperienced practitioner should not attempt to use all the techniques discussed in the text without further research and/or training. To do so would be akin to skydiving after merely hearing of another's experience. Larry touches on the dangers associated with many of the practices featured. However, more emphasis is needed on this point if the reader is provided with enough information to tempt him to try it out on his own.Throughout the text, Larry has commented on various changes in social attitudes toward the gay and leather communities and the impact of HIV and AIDS on sexual behavior over the last 30 years since the original text was written. Nevertheless, the text still falls short, in my opinion, in accounting for other changes over the last 30 years. Most notably, the seemingly increased number of psychos loose in society combined with the increased visibility/accessibility of the gay and leather communities. Larry warns against putting oneself in a position of vulnerability with an unknown partner, but I believe this warning takes on a new and higher degree of relevance today where hate crimes have seen an increase in number and brutality.In short, the Handbook is a great introduction to the leather community and leathersex. However, the would be practitioner should still do a good deal more research, soul searching and acquire training before actually practicing leathersex."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"This book is the quintessential guide to how to be a good Leatherman. The foremost thing to me was the Leatherman's Code, it describes how a real Leatherman should act. Many men wear leather and think they are leathermen, but have no real idea what the concept is all about. Larry tells you exactly what the mindset is of a true leatherman, and guides the reader into the world of all the varied parts of the leather community. He informs the reader that there are so many more things to being a leatherman than just S and M. A MUST READ for anyone interested in pursuing the leather lifestyle and especially anyone that wants to be a competitor in IML."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"Back in the seventies, it was still a very risky proposition to attempt a gay publication of any sort. But in the California Seventies, books like \\"Song Of The Loon\\" (from the sixties) and eventually the likes of \\"Tales of The City\\" began breaking down the barriers, allowing homosexual men to be presented not as crazy or unstable, but as regular people in love. Larry Townsend went even farther out on a limb. He sat down in 1972 and spelled out, for the first time in book form, the codes of conduct that the underground Leather Scene and S&M; men lived by. There were also several accounts of steamy real life kink encounters.This was unheard of. Even now, with a much wider variety of books available on how to and relationship studies, not to mention my own writings, it is hard to remember a time when Larry's book was such a shocking event. Voluntary servitude and fetishistic behaviors are given a great deal of coverage here, and the amazing thing is just how much most of Larry's original foundations remain relevant. Even more to the point is just how much the format of \\"The Leatherman's Handbook\\" has become the blueprint for so much of our community's guidebooks; A little journalistic information followed up with some hot episodes.Still, \\"The Leatherman's Handbook\\" remains a viable source of both etiquette and education in addition to its historical value. Quite possibly one of the most important books about the side of Gay Life that many would like to ignore, but is with us and vibrant and exciting for those who have taken this intimate discovery. A classic."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"This is a great book for those who are leather curious. It clearly explains what the scene is all about and describes some of the games people play and how to make them successful for all parties involved. It gets pretty kinky though so this is not for the prudish. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"This book was recommended to me - actually, I was instructed to read it - by a prospective daddy. As a newcomer to the scene, I found it quite instructive, affirming, and positive (not to mention HOT). It answered all my questions and gave me LOTS of ideas - I can't wait to try all these new things. I recommend this book to any man with an interest in SM."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"We have three editions of this essential s/m book. I'm especially fond of the 1972 edition, since Larry signed it \\"To Laura, my editor\\" back in 1994. It's a great combination of guidebook and hot leathersex, and while the current editions left out the slang of the day (I'm especially fond of the \\"groovy sex\\" in the first edition), the essential bits that give a good look into the 70's leather community makes this a classic."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"This was recommended to me by a Dominant Male friend of mine and i could NOT be happier with His recommendation. For years i've been drawn to the leather side of life (and most of its attendant fetishes) but never knew exactly what it was that appealed to me. Having it spelled out in readable lingo (along with some delicious vignettes) allowed me to have a much better understanding of the leather lifestyle and answered quite a few of my own introspective questions. Mr. Townsend's guide is amazing in that so many of the fundamentals he spelled out back in 1972 are still true and applicable today. This is a must-have for anyone wishing to better understand the often misunderstood leathersex culture. It's also a fascinating journey to see just how far the gay community has come since the earliest days of desperate fumblings in the back rooms of bars, all the while keeping an eye out for the Vice squad."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"Was recommended to me and I enjoyed reading this version of the Handbook. Learned a lot and it gave me a new appreciation of the scene and history also."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"I have never been into this scene, and never would be into it, for more than one reason. I used to be friends with a college professor of philosophy who was into this scene. I remember telling him in 1973 about seeing a copy of this book available at the local convenience store. My friendship with him soured after he tried to lure me to his apartment, apparently with intentions that I don't even want to think about. But I am not going to blame the whole community for what he was up to. Although I admit to having sadistic feelings, I have never acted upon them. What gets me about this scene is that it is supposedly a form of \\"sex\\" and yet it need not involve genital contact. I always thought that \\"sex\\" refers to genital contact. You know, the birds and the bees and all that. In any case, there seems to me to be a distinction between real sadism and this rather let's-pretend form of pseudo-sadism. Real sadism is Auschwitz. Anything that falls short of that is pseudo-sadism. Real sadism does not involve consent. To me, stuff like this book is merely an imitation of the real thing."},{"Title":"Leatherman's Handbook","review":"The Leatherman's Handbook is truely remarkable. This book being published back in the 70's, has some strange lingo. I found it to be a bit funny myself. This book uses stories to illustrate the chapter topic. For a portion of the chapter Larry talks about the topic and then goes into &quot;story telling&quot; mode. During the later he tells of expriences he has had in relation to the topic. Lots of good information here and gives a good look at &quot;Old Guard&quot; thought.If it weren't for the lingo I would give it a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Addams Family and Munsters Program Guide (Virgin)","review":"Perhaps I was biased to this book from the start. The very fact that it marries two fundamentally different shows made it clear that it would not be catering for the fans. Unfortunately my prejudices were confirmed throughout, as this book is sadly as superficial and lacking in imagination as its editorial decision to cover both &quot;The Munsters&quot; and &quot;The Addams Family&quot; in the same book. That alone probably makes a sound enough comment about the contemptuous nature of the writer and publishers alike for its subject matter, though that is not its greatest sin.Shallowly researched and littered with errors and authorial conjecture throughout, perhaps this book stands as more of an anachronism than anything else: fifteen years ago it would have doubtless been acclaimed, but in this day and age it is shown up for what it is, a hastily composed effortless hack-job.In the world of reference books, titles seems to fall between two distinct camps: there are those which are to be treasured, and those which are often referred to, with plenty of annotations made in the margins. In this case, the latter is doubtless the case, though I notice that in my copy the notes are all corrections.If you want proper, substantial guides to both series, get copies of Steve Cox's tomes &quot;The Munsters: Television's First Family of Fright&quot; and his recently updated &quot;The Addams Chronicles: An Altogether Ooky Look at The Addams Family&quot;. Perhaps author John Peel might be advised to do the same, to learn how such books should be done."},{"Title":"The Knower and the Known (Current Continental Research)","review":"Grene is a good writer with a great mind and takes command of her subject matter.A great text that explores the grappling of former philosophers with the idea of knowing the real world.

Thus a little look at history, in this case the history of American parliamentary politics, is called for. For openers that study will show that such dramatic politcal shifts do not occur often so that we had better be prepared when and if it happens. Elsewhere in this space I have commented on the creation of the Republican Party from the remnants of the Whigs, Free Soilers, disaffected Northern Democrats and other forces just prior to the Civil War. (See Review of Free Soil, Free Labor by Eric Foner in an entry entitled The Heroic Age of the Republican Party). The book under review here is a detailed look at the creation of the Democratic Party in the mid 1820's that was solidified by the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828. And what better place to look at how that occurred that at the career of the master mind of that creation Martin Van Buren, who would ultimately benefit by that realignment himself both as Vice President in Jackson's second term and as his immediate successor as president in 1836.This book is narrowly focused on the creation of the Democratic Party and Van Buren's role in it. Thus the time frame for the work is essentially limited to the elections of 1824 and 1828. The story as it unfolds here shows that Van Buren did not come to prominence out of thin air but had done yeoman's work in creating the embryo of the Democratic Party in New York State with the famous Albany Regency that controlled, or attempted to control, New York politics during this period. The strength of the Regency lay in its control of patronage, its policy of only rewarding its friends and devotees, its adherence to a uniform political line and of fighting for organization, organization and again organization. Those are not bad lessons to learn even today. Strangely in reading about this organization and its rules and regulations it conceptually reminded me of a proto-Leninist vanguard organization-without its revolutionary aims.Of course strong organization only helps if you have some access, or potential access, to power and in American politics the coin of the realm is control of the American presidency. And for that purpose the election of 1824 gives a text book lesson in all the strengths and weakness of the presidential electoral process. Many changes had occurred in the first fifty years of the American Republic as it moved away from the bucolic agrarian/mercantile society of the 1780's. These included the relentless driving of the frontier westward, the increased role of capitalist production and technology in linking communications and transportation systems and the cry of the masses for more political participation in the electoral process. Those factors were the social basis for Jackson's ultimate victory.But not in 1824. At that point the Monroe presidency and its so-called \`Era of Good Feeling' had theoretically blunted the political party concept at a time when, as now, the class divide was growing. One of the strange things about the 1824 election is that the several candidates all professed to be of the same \`party' from the closet monarchist John Quincy Adams to the plebian hero Jackson. Something had to give. What gave immediately, to Jackson's immediate disadvantage, was the popular outcry against the Congressional caucus system where that body essentially provided the official candidate. Van Buren was the master of that system and it died hard with him. He, howver, eventally gathered himself together and moved on. In any case no candidate got a majority of the Electoral College votes and thus the election was thrown into the House of Representatives for settlement. In the end Henry Clay's electoral votes and whatever promises he received from Adams determined Adams's victory. 1828 would be a different storyVan Buren learned the lesson of that defeat well. He went through out the country trying to build a coalition of forces that would create a national party based on a set of principles, essentially taken from Jefferson's philosophy of government and a strict constructionist school of interpretation of the Constitution. In the process Van Buren basically formed the modern political party by uniting forces from the West, the South and New York to give the New England-centered Adams a thumping. Having a popular candidate like Jackson obviously did not hurt. One can argue with the author about the weight of Van Buren's role in the Jackson victory however one cannot argue that Van Buren knew which way the wind was blowing and created a powerful plebian based party that fought for power up until the Civil War with some success. For good or evil, Van Buren also became the proto-type for the professional politician that we have today come to know and loathe. But that is a separate story.

The authors lack background in science and yet are presumptious enough to question the crediblity of time tested scientific methods like archaeology and linguisitics, simply because these approaches do not assign the kind of fantastic dates to the ancient world as iskcon would like to.As is the case with creationists and other adherents of pesudo-scentific methods, Stephen Knapp is also looking more for believers to support his position than to uncover facts and discover truth. He starts from the premise that his religious sources provide correct history (for example, the entire world following the vedas at one time) and then sets out to uncover physical evidence to establish this fact. Obviously, since this is not what mainstream history has to say, it must be false per Stephen Knapp's binary logic.It must be noted that ISKCON in reality does not follow any of the four vedas and instead adopts other peripheral texts. Yet, it markets its religious belief as Vedic and claims to follow a vedic culture thus misleading the general public especially in the western world, where people are not aware of the basics of Indian religion. The Vedic culture was about worshipping fire, now obsolete Vedic Gods such as Indra, Varuna, etc and sacrificing animals. This culture died out in India a long time ago and has hence been supplanted by what we now call Hinduism which is primarily based on idol worship and non-vedic Gods for the most part. ISKCON worships idols and does not worship fire or any of the vedic Gods thus making it non-vedic in every sense.In short, this book abounds in mistakes and is not worth the paper it is printed on. For a professional review of this book, refer to Mark Newbrook's review which can be found online."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"Stephen Knapp presents historical facts as they are.

The news spread in the Western world that there finally was a new place to visit replete with safe places to eat.The 'h' in Delhi was added by subsequent generations in an effort to coopt the word and obscure it's true origins.If you found the above analysis convincing, you'll love the book.There is a direct correlation here with the never ending cavalcade of lying, smiling, venal and manipulating swamis who don't seem to get enough of the Western world and women where they can easily trade phoney spirituality for hard cash.So there, somebody had to say it plainly."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"&quot;One fairly typical case involves the name Australia, which is a modern coining transparently derived from Latin, where it would mean 'southern' (land, etc).

It is interesting and one of the few nonfiction books that I could not put down once I started reading it. So many things I've wondered about and questions I've had were answered here by the information that made a lot of sense to me.There are all kinds of bits and pieces of evidence scattered throughout numerous books and articles on the widespread influence of Vedic culture, and Stephen has collected a large amount of this to present in this one condensed volume. As he mentions in his Preface, which most critics don't seem to read, he has compiled the information from many sources and researchers who have been studying this for many years, and you can decide what evidence is most agreeable or not. However, whether you agree with it all or not, the credibility is when the numerous references and researchers that are mentioned all allude to the premise that the area of India was far larger, and Vedic culture far more influential, hundreds of years ago, creating a global culture. And this book points out why and how it can be recognized.Personally I found the book to be fascinating and well documented and referenced. There's a lot more here than a few points of comparative linguistics. You can see the connections of the different areas of the world and religions to Vedic culture, which is the real point of the book. So if you want to get an idea of how Vedic culture had spread around the world and had been a worldwide influence, this book will certainly give you insights into this. As others have said, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"Linguistic comments by negative reviewers should not deter one from reading this book. The notes on non standard linguists are pure rubbish. Non standard according to whom? and defined by whom?Theories about Sanskrit and Indian culture written by European 'Historians'and experts with an agenda which are taken as Gospal should not be a factor. History is written by the winners to distort their world view. This book is an honest attempt to rebut the distorted theories taken as fact in the western world which should be disputed.I would urge the reader to read with an open mind without allowing those with a hidden agenda to poison the well.A good attempt at exposing Vedic ideas. Not fully sold on all aspects of the book, but certainly a much more honest attempt then prevailing theories put forward by Colonial quacks."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"I did not read this book, but I browsed thru this and some of Knapp's books and many of the reviews here. It is difficult for people in the west (especially religious ones) to accept that their language and possibly even some of their ancestors have roots in ancient northern India from thousands of years ago, given the present poor condition of India in comparison to the west. Although in recent times, after 60 years of independence from British, it has made remarkable progress; may once again become one of the global powers as it was before the arrival of Islam and British into India. There has to be a common thread, whether that thread originated in India or else where. There is no evidence that great civilizations and thought existed in the west, 5000 years ago. So, how could they have come to India from the west, as English led us all to believe. When one reads ancient Bhagavatam, it is clear that the Vedic kings before 5000 years ago were global rulers, it was a different era and these ancient books need a close look without any pride and prejudice. According to bible, the world is only 5000 years old, these ancient books of India go back to hundreds of thousands of years and even millions of years in time line, right there, there is a conflict with Judeo, Christian, Islamic beliefs. So, how can majority of the people who belong to these religions will ever study these ancient books of India and try to find the truth. I admire Stephen Knapp's courage and will to study these ancient books and write mainly for westerners. Granted that there may be a stretch in certain cases, but unless there is fire there is no smoke, we can see Vedic signatures thru out the world."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"This is an easy to read book, full of interesting information for those interested in spirituality and the history of religions.It uses examples that are not always scientifically proven, and yes, the claims are so amazing that even if only one tenth of them would be true, it still would mean a radical new view on world history.But science is not absolute, and so called scientists have been known to cover up the truth. I, for one, am glad to be able to read about some other perspectives on world history.Some reviewers mentioned that comparing languages on the basis of similarity in writing is not acceptable, and they gave some examples.I would like to give some counter-examples that I found rather convincing, such as the names of the months - Saptamber, Ashtamber, Navamber, Dashamber in Sanskrit - the analogies between Krishna and Christ, Abraham and Brahma in their contextual meaning, and the fact that the Lithuanian language still contains so much Sanskrit.The book has a militant undertone and after reading about the Taj Mahal it is easy to understand why. This magnificent Vedic palace - like much of the Vedic culture - has been appropriated by conquerors and up to today is still widely considered the summum of Islam civilisation.

It refutes the fallacy in the old historical books about aryan invasion etc and gloriously proves vedic culture as one source of all religions in the present world. This book is full of some very intriguing facts which really makes one think and believe the author. However, sometimes the associations of different words/names of places to a sanskrit word seems far fetched. Even then, this book is a must read for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"This book adopts the non-standard view that Sanskrit was in India much earlier than is thought by most linguists. This view is almost certainly mistaken, but there is an argument of sorts to be had about it. Knapp, however, goes well beyond this in claiming that Indo-European actually originated in India, as early Sanskrit, and spread westwards, and indeed he proclaims that Sanskrit is the ancestor of all languages! These more extreme positions, especially this last, simply do not hold up.Knapp's ideas historical linguistic reasoning is straight out of the 18th Century, before historical linguistics became a serious discipline. He identifies superficial similarities between Sanskrit words on the one hand and words in English and other languages on the other, and deduces that these words have a common origin. Because of his main theory, this amounts to claiming that the non-Sanskrit words are derived from the Sanskrit words. Most of these links are simply asserted as facts, with no supporting evidence.As we now know, such cases are in fact much more complex and uncertain. One cannot rely on superficial resemblances of form, even when accompanied by similarity of meaning, in establishing etymologies. It can be established that words are cognates (ie, that they descend from a common ancestor word in a common ancestor language) - only if they display systematic correspondences in their pronunciation, repeated over large numbers of word-sets.Isolated superficial similarities prove nothing. ANY pair of languages will display some such pairs, simply by chance. The likelihood can be calculated and it is often quite high.In some of Knapp's examples, the Indo-European roots from which a complex English word is derived do appear in Sanskrit. But in most such cases the English word is clearly derived from Indo-European via Germanic, or else from the Latin or Greek forms - not from the Sanskrit forms.But many of the equations given by Knapp are altogether illusory. A high percentage of them are actually known to be invalid; the words in question have separate, established etymologies and are clearly unrelated. In some other cases, we simply cannot be sure whether words are cognates or not; there is insufficient evidence. But in most of these cases there is no particular reason to believe Knapp. And in many of them his equations are implausible on other grounds, eg historical.One fairly typical case involves the name Australia, which is a modern coining transparently derived from Latin, where it would mean 'southern' (land, etc). On p 76 Knapp states that it is from Sanskrit Astralaya, meaning 'land of missiles'; he suggests that the pilots of vimanas practised firing their missiles in Australia, thus creating the deserts! This is just not true.Knapp places a great deal of emphasis on linguistic equations, and I am sure he is sincere; but he apparently does not know linguistics well enough to use linguistic examples persuasively. If he did, I think he would realise that there is no linguistic basis for his claims.It should be added that Knapp's historical expertise is also suspect, and that even if his story were true that would not imply that Vedic religious beliefs are themselves true."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"History remains the most abused subject of education throughout the world. This is true even in India. As claimed by Stephen Knapp, not only the people outside India lost touch with their Vedic roots but also Indians themselves. With centuries of assault, humiliation, molestation the present day history of Vedic culture as depicted in the classroom books presents a contradictory picture of what was really happened. Very few blessed people have had the chance of going through this sacred knowledge and associated training in India. But the truth especially in the matters of religion can be appreciated only when one comes out of reasoning. One has to be completely open to understand sensitive matters like religion and ancestoral links which are very personal to everyone. Even for a devout follower of Sanatana Dharma, there are many things in his/her spiritual life which do not hold up to real life terms. But deep in heart persons who had gone through these know that their experiences are simply beautiful and true. It is hard to explain all such incidents unless one goes through them. I guess Stephen wants to bring this point forth by establishing the truth that this culture has spread over the globe and has influence over all the regions.Whether one belives in what is explained in this book or not, Stephen Knapp has done an excellent job in trying to throw light on a broad and yet complex issue that makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"For anyone who has wondered as to why, despite the existence of different religions, different cultures and different races of people in different regions of the world... why do they all have some common basic foundations, such as the concept of God. Every religion has some form God or the other. There is this concept of heaven and hell (the description varies from relg. to relg). There is this concept of good and evil. The concept that if you do good you go to heaven and if not, you go to hell.Whether you believe in them or not, it is just too much of a concidence that all these different part of the world/religions should come up with the same basic concepts. The only theory that can completely explain these concidences, is the theory that there existed one religion/culture throughout the world at one time. And over a period of time, it broke up as is bound to happen.And the author has done an excellent job of driving that point home with the use of linguistic tools, prevelant names and legends. There are some places where I felt that the facts were being stretched to fit the theory, but such occasions were very rare.Anyone on a quest to understanding vedic religion and its roots, this book definitely a must read. You can also read &quot;In search for the Cradle of Civilization&quot;."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"I thank the author for being bold enough to put all this information and evidence together in aconclusive manner. It is most fascinating to see all of the connections around the world to Vedicculture. I think more books like this should be written. It is time to recognize the contributions ofancient Vedic culture and its impact on the world, and this book helps do that. Since the authordoes not support the conventional views about the Aryan Invasion Theory and provides evidenceagainst it, which most Indians know to be a speculative theory anyway, there are those whooppose this information. Naturally those people who speak out the most are also the most likelyto be criticized, especially by those who still have faith in the conventional and often mostcontrived ways of viewing things. So I thank people like Stephen who can provide a wide varietyof evidence to help show the truth about the prominence and influence of ancient Vedic culture."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"This book provides you with a better understanding of human history.

It is clear that Climate change not Aryan invasion that destroyed the Indus-Saraswathi civilization."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"I bought this book right here on Amazon and it takes some time to get through it as it is a relatively larger sized book. It has a lot of useful information like how sanskrit is related to other ancient languages like greek, latin, hittite, and mittani with common words like matr, pitr, sapta,....etc. This is pertinent as it shows there is some relationship between the vedic india kingdom and far off countries in europe like Italy, Greece, and Ireland. But there is also a few spurious facts like austrailia is a derived vedic name because of the sanskrit name astral-alaya (the land of the missiles). This is erroneous because the english word austrailia is derived from the latin word austrailis, which means southern land or land that is south. Now, this latin word austrailis maybe derived from a sanskrit orgin but it has nothing to do with land of the missiles. An english explorer or military man (I forgot) named the continent that in Latin as it went well with the other geographic continentinal names. I have to commend Stephen on enlightening me on facts in ancient European artifacts that show instances of vedic culture. An example would be of frescoes in Etruscian cities depicting the Ramanayam. Or how Druids, and anicient egyptian priests wear dhotis, bathe their deities and offer their deities food just like Hindu priets have done and still do today. He also points out major places and countries were descended from vedic rishis. Like how the area around the caspian sea was named and are the descendents of the sage Kashyap. Also, how egyptians and ancient egypt is descended from the Raja Yayati. This all makes sense and I would presume the rishis mated with different beings like Daityas, Kinnaras or Gandharvas to create the different races. If not, then everybody on earth would look like the Indian race and there would not different people of different races that look different from one another. Scientists have found out all people of the caucasian race have descended from one person. This makes perfect sense when you read this book. To summarize, this is a great book to learn how vedic culture was the one culture which everything spurned from. This is not so outrageous or ridiculous to believe. From one comes many multiples. Even in the bible, abraham started the whole jewish people and race. From that one person, there is now so many varieties of humans who are jewish and now who live on this earth. Why is it ludicrous to not think that vedic rishis started human civilization and culture? If you get a chance you should buy this book and learn about real history. Not the history you are brainwashed in school telling you that the aryans invaded India or that sanskrit is derived from a mother indo-european lanaguage. In this book, you will learn about the real history of mankind (english world derived from the sanskrit word manu for man) coming from authortiative vedic sources that came directly from god."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"I agree with Knapp. The word Australia denotes a land lying to the south.

Thus, they would have rejected the idea that the earth came into existence after Sanskrit did but it is an interesting thought since some think that \\"speaking in tongues\\" is the same as speaking Sanskrit...(another research idea?)Secondly, on top of this prejudice was added a second, irrational presumption that the Christian's own scripture **must** be older than some \\"Hindu\\" texts, in order to claim the prestige of 'absolute anteriority' for their western religion.Mark Twain said that, (paraphrase) Prejudice is the ink with which history is written...Yet, the \\"proof\\" of Vedic India is out there. Just to pik your interest: For example, Angor Wat is a \\"Hindu\\" temple located in Cambodia but it is an undeniable example of a remnant of Vedic culture still existing **outside** of India, which offers some proof of a global Vedic culture. Some deluded academics may try to claim that Angor is merely a indication of an early Vedic \\"influence\\" in Cambodia, but...just consider, this is the world's largest religious complex. Even today, it is the world's largest religious complex.We can also consider how fair it would it be if at some time in the future, someone were to claim that the World Trade Center was built due to an \\"outside\\" influence. Ridiculous and unmistakably condescending, isn't it?.(One note: Buddhists have now kindly taken over managing the Angor Wat temple, which leads to some confusion, but Ankor is still a functioning Vedic \\"Vishnu\\" temple).I would suggest reading this book **only** in conjuction with, \\"Searching for Vedic India\\" which is a better example of a well researched, and more authoritative book on the subject."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"This unique book (well-researched and well-written) that reveals the truth about the Vedic history.

Although attention has been drawn to the affinities between Sanskrit and other languages, mention should have been made of the fact that Vedic sciences and arts pioneered the flowering of these subjects globally.More careful editing could have eliminated redundant information and some misleading assumptions. Thus, it is incorrect to equate the antiquity of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization with that in Mesopotamia, although white race supremacists have done so arbitrarily to embellish their own ancestry. Whereas archeological evidence at Mehragarh has firmly established the former to go back to at least 8000 BC, there is no evidence that the latter took shape before 6000 BC. Also, the author opines that the message of Jesus was directed to poor Hindus whereas in reality the period between Ashoka and Gupta Empires was the golden age of Bharata with free food, lodging and health care for all.

In particular, he certainly seems to be on to something when he points out that there is little if any evidence to support the received view of an 'Aryan Invasion of India.'It would seem that this THEORY - which is all it is - is a MYTH propagated by Western Scholars who wished, for politically motivated reasons, to devalue the achievements of Ancient India. As such it becomes not unlike certain other current myths which have been planted in the common mind and that work to prevent a true understanding of the past.Those who may be interested in pursuing this matter should try to find a copy of David Frawley's 'Gods, Sages and Kings : Vedic Secrets of Ancient Civilization.' His article, 'The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India' which appeared in \\"The India Times\\", can be found through Google and is available at: http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/aryan/aryan_link.htmlOn another note, although I'm not a linguist it's my understanding that language tends to evolve from an older and earlier complexity of grammar towards a later simplicity, and if we look at Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Latin and English what we find is that Sanskrit is more complex than Ancient Greek, Ancient Greek is more complex than Latin, and Latin is more complex than English.

Aptly enough the Vedic Culture will continue to be a force in shaping the thoughts and minds of the future generations if we bear with the trends of the present times wherein we are making a stronger and more honest effort to reveal our human destiny."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"I've recently bought a copy of this book, and quite frankly I was appalled at the sheer number of factual errors, mistakes, howlers, etc. To quote a few:(i) \\"In England we find towns such as Lancashire, Pembrokeshire, Hampshire and Wiltshire\\" - these are NOT towns, they are counties, and in any case Pembrokeshire is in Wales!; (ii) He tries to make out that Canterbury is connected to the Sanskrit word 'Sankarpury' - it is NOT : it is derived from the Roman name for an indigenous tribe in that part of Kent, the Cantiae; (iii) \\"The 'Pound Sterling' is a corrupt form of the Sanskrit term Poundra Sterling - it is NOT: the word \\"Sterling\\" originated with the 'Esterlings', members of the Hanseatic League in Mediaeval England; (iv) mistakes with translations of Russian - \\"malka\\" is SMALL and does not mean 'Mother'; (v) lack of references to most facts, all too often completely unsubstantiated; and on , and on, and on, and on. . . . .the review by a fellow Englishman from Cheshire, singles out Mr. Knapp's predilection for changing letters around to make words sound more Sanskrit, rightly drawing comparison to those amateur historians of 200 years ago, who so desperately wanted historical facts to fit their theories that they were not adverse to \\"bending the facts\\". If I, as a Vaisnava 'Hindu' living in England, can recognize the errors and irregularities pertaining to references to Britain, then I wonder how much more has he perhaps written of other countries in like manner? A great pity, for his other books are inspiring."},{"Title":"Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence","review":"This is the first book in last five years I read cover to cover and couldn't keep it down till I finished. Very well written with lots of examples and context. It's amazing to believe that there existed a global civilization long before modern history was began to be recorded. This existence of global civilization is a perfect explanation for me to understand the fact that the basic concepts like life, death, god, religion, society, marriage, language &amp; script existed across the globe thousands of years ago.One needs to read this with open mind as at times you may think the theory is going overboard."},{"Title":"Student Companion to Stryer's Biochemistry, Fourth Edition","review":"This book doesn't give you any extra information, and is as thick as the stryer text itself.

It is completely unnecessary to own, apart from answering the few problems from Strye's book."},{"Title":"Student Companion to Stryer's Biochemistry, Fourth Edition","review":"The multiple choice is very helpful in studying for the exam. The book outlines in depth questions on specific reactions. This is great for piecing everything together."},{"Title":"Student Companion to Stryer's Biochemistry, Fourth Edition","review":"Using Stryer as your sole text is like walking through thick concrete; the chapters are incomprehensible without extreme effort and many cups of hot coffee. Gumport has provided a point by point outline of the concepts locked within the dry text's prose and provided useful application exercises with explanations that far exceed the textbooks' approach. This might be a waste of money for lab rat science geeks, but for those of us with outside lives, this is a real asset!Read the outline in the study guide, take the pretest, read the chapter in the text (if you can) thinking about the outlined points, try to work the chapter questions, then go to the study guide again and finish your chapter understanding. You can't make it in your classes without reading Stryer, but if you can't grasp what Styer is presenting, you are wasting your time and your prof's time. The Companion is not a complete solution by itself to &quot;getting&quot; biochemistry, but it helps impart Stryer's solid foundation of the field on those of us who are willing to try. Without it, my A's would have been C+s. It was worth the money to me, although it was hard to get through Amazon.

He doesn't exist as far as the government knows. He has no social security number, no credit cards, pays no taxes, pays cash for everything always keeps a low profile.Jack \\"The Equalizer\\". If you remember the TV show of that name from several years ago, that is what Jack does. No he's not \\"The Equalizer\\" but if you've been wronged and you've got the money, Jacks available and Jack can be deadly. He can be your worst nightmare but as nightmares go everything is relative and Jack takes second fiddle in this book!Jack has a girlfriend named Gia (they are currently estranged) who has a daughter named Vickey. Jack loves Gia deeply and adores Vickey and would lay down his life for either and in this story he almost does. Now Vickey's father's surname is Wesphalen. None believe it but the Wesphalen family is living under a curse, precipitated by the murderous acts committed by a greedy ancestor over a hundred years ago in India.Kusum Bhakti, an East Indian priest of a tiny sect that worships the bloodthirsty deity Kali and his sister Kolobati are descendants of the victims of the atrocities perpetrated by this elder Wesphalen. They have come to New York City to carry out their vendetta and wipe out the rest of the Westphalen line. Kusum has brought with him the Rakoshi, vicious, flesh eating monsters, to accomplish this horrible undertaking.Rakoshi are huge (over eight feet tall) hideous, malodorous, perversions of the humanity created eons ago by the Otherness. The \\"Otherness\\" or \\"The Other\\" as it is named in other books is discussed at length in my recently completed review on \\"Nightworld\\"Coincidently, Kusum hires Jack to locate the thief that mugged his aged grandmother and stole a necklace which is a family heirloom. Jacks thinks lightning just might strike twice so he dresses up like an old lady and sure enough our perp. attacks him. Jack quickly turns the tables and after a couple broken bones convinces the perp. to relinquish his ill gotten gains. Funny thing, the perp. claims the victim was young.In fact, the aged grandmother is Kolobati, Kusum's younger sister and both of them are almost 150 years old. They maintain their young appearance because of the necklaces they wear (the family heirlooms) and of course when the mugger took the necklace, Kolobati began to age immediately.When Jack returns with the necklace, Kusum is ecstatic and Jack walks away a few thousand richer and now has to visit Gia and Vickey. Gia called while Jack was on the Mugger case and needed to see him.Gia Westphalen had broken off her relationship with Jack but called when one of Vickey's two aunts disappeared. She's decided Jacks line of work, which she abhors and is the reason she broke with Jack, might be helpful to locate the Aunt. Unfortunately the aunt is long gone and the other aunt is next and Jack and Gia get dragged into a battle with Kusum and supernatural creatures, the Rakoshi to save the last remaining Wesphalen - VickeyConclusionNot for the faint of heart this story gets quite scary as our hero Jack must confront a nest of monsters but an excellent fast paced read that I personally have read four times. For horror fans this is essential reading!!!!This novel has ultimately been listed as one of six books that form the Adversary Cycle. I don't think it started out that way but it ended up that way. It and \\"The Touch\\" are self contained reads that can be taken that way with no further reading, however they must be read sometime before reading the final book of the series \\"Nightworld\\"."},{"Title":"The Tomb","review":"The horror genre is enriched by this book, which is inventive and original. Though the book is plot, rather than character, driven, it does not suffer for its lack of character development. The reader is kept too busy thinking about the plot to worry unduly about character development. Such is the power of this unusual and compelling horror story.The plot is relatively simple. The horror reaches out across the world from India to the United States. A heinous defilement and murders by British soldiers in a temple in mid-nineteenth century India unleashes a curse that is to follow the descendants of the leader of the attack. Coupled with that curse is an entourage of creatures of unimaginable horror that have once again risen to do the bidding of one who would avenge past wrongs. With great power, however, comes great responsibility.Enter Repairman Jack, a man who works to right what once went wrong and who earns his living by his wits and by his ability to defend himself to the death, if necessary. If one has a problem, he will fix it. When he agrees to help a one-armed Indian gentleman, Kusum Bahkti, retrieve a necklace that is a priceless family heirloom, he soon discovers just how priceless it is.Jack suddenly finds himself thrust into the middle of a series of almost inexplicable events. Besieged by mysterious disappearances, rank odors, unusual substances of Indian origin, he finds that the necklace holds the key to an ancient horror. He then comes up against the most formidable foes he has ever encountered. He must find a way to vanquish these hellish creatures or risk losing those whom he loves.Highly original and inventive, this is a pretty well written horror story that should keep even the most jaded of readers turning its pages. It is also the book that introduced Repairman Jack, a popular character that would go on to have a series of books revolve around him."},{"Title":"The Tomb","review":"The horror genre is enriched by this book, which is inventive and original.

It has a satisfying amount of information for identifying poison ivy, oak or sumac, where they are most likely to be found, plus scientific background and history. Then it provides guidelines for classifying your sensitivity and what to expect in a reaction, as well as ideas for remedies and prevention. Also included are stories from other poison ivy sufferers so the book does tend to repeat itself when discussing how the common myths are misleading. But because it has decent photos for quick identification; handy charts for finding desired info fast and basic tips for avoidance, makes this book a good reference to have on hand. Not to mention that it's size makes it an easy one to pack with your gear for extended trips into the backwoods.Prevention is the best way to outwit the effects of poison ivy and this book will inform you on all you need to know. {After reading, I couldn't help but notice that the cover image is inadequate, because the poisonous plants described have white berries, not red.}"},{"Title":"Outwitting Poison Ivy","review":"A concise, informative book debunking the myths of the dreaded poison ivy.

Anyone who has lived through the two to three week nightmare of poison ivy will agree that for the rest of your life a certain amount of fear lives in your psyche, of ever becoming infected again. So that was what prompted me to pick the book up. It was an interesting read, including the little personal stories related by other suffers. I will however say that this book had nothing new to offer short of perhaps, that certain toilet seats made in China could give you a case of Ivy rash as they are lacquered with a plant which is similar in make up to Poison Ivy. Good luck if you have the rash, I myself recommend spending a lot of time sitting in a hot tub, or if you can swimming in the ocean, since those are the only two things that seemed to give me any relief.

Why is this ridiculousness being perpetuated in what should be a concise, intelligent synopsis/review? I mean, really, does it have to be so banal? I love Minnie Bruce Pratt.

If all this is new to you, open the door. If you are already a fan, you know what to expect. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"S/He","review":"Pratt's language in this book is sometimes painfully raw, as she strips her feelings and experiences bare for the world to read.

It is a genre-crossed book.Like the soft spoken and appearing Southern lady gone North as she is, Pratt's got a near subliminal \\"undertext\\" going on beneath the surface reading of everyday life stories.

I cried again and again as MBP moved through her journey from young wife to lesbian feminist to femme, to powerful superfemme force to be reckoned with. This book is the only one i have ever read that deals perfectly with the pain and shame and profound sadness and lonliness of growing up filled with a desire that is not recognized in our culture, and is difficult to understand inside ourselves.

With short one to four page vignettes the book moves quickly and is written in a rather \\"poetic\\" style (the author is a poet) and I would actually like to read a more conventionally written autobiography fleshed out with more detail. I thought it was interesting that later in life she reunited with several schoolmates and came to find out that many of them were also gay and reminisced about how different their lives could have been if they could have been out with each other, but back in the 60s that just couldn't have happened. I would also like to know more about her mother who is described once as a bulldagger. This book has lots of great slice of life scenes and I didn't want it to end.

I remember quite clearly an anecdote she tells about a self-defense class she once took: the teacher told her not to worry if she couldn't bring herself to hurt him because most women have a hard time overcoming their nice-girl training at first, and then she nearly broke his kneecap.I think Pratt loves the hostility Feinberg engenders more than she loves Feinberg, and I didn't enjoy her (temporary vicarious) company."},{"Title":"Badertscher (Stonewall Inn Book/Photographer)","review":"Disclosure: I know this photographer and have a number of his works displayed in my home and certainly cannot claim to be unbiased. That said: This is not a book full of &quot;pretty&quot; pictures of boy toys. These images don't glamourize the coupling of gay men. They do haunt, shock and cause the viewer to wonder about the lives of &quot;others&quot; who may not have the same comfort or ethos as we, but whose humanity can still reach us despite our lack of contact with them in our protected lives. Badertscher brings a discerning eye to the subject, having what is clearly a familiarity with his &quot;models'&quot; lives and desires. He gives us a glimpse of those at the edge (or are they?) This book is a jewel at a &quot;bargain&quot; price."},{"Title":"Badertscher (Stonewall Inn Book/Photographer)","review":"This book has some value but very little. I have to questionthe photography skills of the photographer. True, most of the novelswere far from pretty--which is a minus--but that's only the start of the problem. Many of the poses were awful; the only poses that impressed me where a series of mirror shots, but they would be a lot more impressive if the photographer were not preasant in them. I was not impressed at all by a great portion of the end of the book dedicated to reverse negative photographs; a cheap affect that loses any goodness in the actual picture. And for how in ALL demensions (thickness, and most notably the hight and width) this book is truly a [not worth] the price asked. The shot on the cover is one of only two I found to be excellent, and of only three or four worth anything at all. Don't waste your time or money with this one."},{"Title":"Badertscher (Stonewall Inn Book/Photographer)","review":"Generally my first impression of photography books is wrong. This prooved to be the case with BADERTSCHER which I almost tossed straight in the trash when it arrived. I was frustrated with the second and third sections of the book in which the artist experiments with mirrors and then negative images.The first dozen or so images are a reprise of work dated 1976-1995. They are brooding and sexy without being very original. The ghost of Mapplethorpe looms large. Oddly, plates 4 and 7, both shots of the same model, apparently in the same session, are dated 1976 and 1983! The rest of the book is given over to recent work.The middle third of the book, in which the photographer &quot;objectifies&quot; and dismembers his models and himself using mirrors is interesting and worthy but not particularly erotic. The artist may be attempting to create a self-concious remoteness and succeeds in a cool, in fact rather dead, way.The final section, containing negative images grew on me a great deal with several viewings. After an initial reaction of &quot;I can't see what I want to see!&quot;, the sensuous eroticism of these images became more and more powerful. I now feel they are the most original and lovely works in this collection, despite the occassional silly Greco-mythological titles. Plate 41, depicting two apparently remote models, has infinate possibilities. It has the same power and beauty you find in Francis Bacon.The tiny format works for most of the images which are uncomplicated. it works against the more complex compositions using mirrors."},{"Title":"Badertscher (Stonewall Inn Book/Photographer)","review":"Tiny &amp; trivial book.

The subject division experiences a steep learning curve from 1939 to 1943. During the last two years of the war it survives under strategic doctrines misaligned with its hard-won maneuver skills. The author's insights are not to be found in any other work on the subject. The book includes many diary entries, dispatches, newpaper clippings, and photographs in parallel with the official history. Across the later chapters, the interested reader will discover one of the best montages of the Russian soldier during WWII; in this regard, the work is particularly commendable for its independence from the contemporary political biases. Interested readers should familiarize themselves with the role of the Waffen-SS and its struggle for a worthy reputation alongside the regular army before tackling this piece; a 'cold' reading from the present would be confusing. For context, v.Manstein's \\"Lost Victories\\" [English] (Presidio, 1982) is probably best."},{"Title":"Like a Cliff in the Ocean","review":"This book is the English translation of \\"Wie ein Fels im Meer\\" by Karl Ullrich and this version is published by JJ Fedorowicz. As a side note to the curious, the original \\"Wie ein Fels im Meer\\" came in two volumes, a photo book with German/English text (which I own also) and the divisional history in German text only. \\"Like a Cliff in the Ocean\\" is the English translation of the divisional history. As with all JJ Fedorowicz books, the book is physically of very high quality and is well translated.The book is a detailed but overall general history of the division from its inception in 1939 until its demise in 1945, and the book's strength is that it was written by a man who was there. The author was part of 3. SS Panzer Division \\"Totenkopf\\" from the beginning and commanded a combat engineer company and later the combat egineer battalion. He later became commander of 5. SS Panzer Division \\"Wiking\\", earning the Knights Cross with Oak Leaves.Also contained in the text are many personal accounts by various soldiers; and these definately give a better feeling of what an average soldier in the division experienced. The 127 photos are all very clear and well reproduced. Included throughout are 23 nice b&w; maps detailing the where the division fought and an appendix of 27 very detailed colored military maps. Interspersed are numerous photos and the traslations of documents pertaining to the division; ranging from corps orders to commanding generals praise, like von Manstein, for the division's combat record. The appendices have some nice tidbits of info too: Knight's Cross and other medal recipients, divisional organizational tables, command/staff positions, etc.As the two other reviewers have mentioned, the author does not go into the wider context of the division and its role in the Waffen-SS and National Socialist Germany. Other authors have done this if you're looking for that. As said, this book is a factual divisional history. If you are looking for more personal accounts of the \\"Totenkopf\\" division I recommend \\"Soldaten, Kampfer, Kameraden\\" by Vopersal, however it is in German.Overall I recommend this book for those interested in the \\"Totenkopf\\" division in particular and those with a general interest in the Waffen-SS as well."},{"Title":"Like a Cliff in the Ocean","review":"There are always two sides to any position. It is a welcome relief to see the German Waffen SS (weapons) presented fairly in the field of action."},{"Title":"Like a Cliff in the Ocean","review":"Considering the author was an officer and probably one of the better soldiers in the SSTK division this book is a huge disapointment. Ullrich's book consists of nothing more than a collection of maps, documents, and Propaganda Kompanie photographs that do little to explain history of probably one of the most remarkable and controversial divisions of the Waffen-SS. Karl Ullrich was with the division during its most critical engagements but provides the reader with no useful information or insite into the fighting qualities, organization or personalities of the 3 SS Panzer Division.I would recommend this book if you are only interested in pictures of SS men and SS equipment.

It fought from June 1941 to May 1945 almost continuously on the Eastern front of World War II, where it gained the reputation as one of the most feared divisions of the German army, and participated in famous operations such as the drive to Leningrad (1941), the Demyansk pocket (1942), the third Battle of Kharkov (1943), the battle of Kursk (1943), Poland (1944), Operation Spring Awakening in Hungary (1945) and Vienna, Austria (1945). Written by one of its long-time officers, the book is a compilation of combat reports, maps, photos and experiences of soldiers; the author sometimes adds comments, but in general acts as an editor.As the author admits, the division has committed war crimes; seeSoldiers of Destruction.If you are interested in the combat history of the division, this book may be of interest to you; in fact, you can consider it a nice supplement to the classic studySoldiers of Destruction."},{"Title":"Footprints Along the Shore of an Incoming Tide: Impressions of a Fellow Traveler","review":"Its often hard to put into words one's relationship with self and God and our reason for being.

Hollywood does not work that way. If Smith wanted us to believe this unbelievable series of events then she should have addressed it more.The plot was trifling and the couple doesn't make love until the last few pages of the book. Before that we are led on this tired cat and mouse game between Brian and Alexandra. What was up with the epilogue taking place decades from 1995? It was ludicrous. I should have listen to another reviewer who warned readers not to pick up this book. When I found out my library doesn't carry the book I thought it wouldn't hurt to take a chance and buy it.

Nothing good would come from an older African American female dating a long blond hair earring wearing sexy and gorgeous rock star. Fans and people wouldn't accepted the realtionship and she had to make Brian understand this.Brian didn't want to listen to Alex and he was determined for them to be together no matter what others thought or felt about their realtionship.

I stumbled across this one, and while it had many valuable pieces of advice, the information became incredibly redundant. There are chapters upon chapters about positive thinking and recognizing how you think. These are incredibly important topics, but the author keeps going back to explain the same steps, and at a snail's pace too. Quite frankly, the 365 steps should not be done one at a time, rather, they can be read one section at a time. Get the gist of the chapter, remember anything that sticks out, and LIVE YOUR LIFE. Don't get caught up constantly thinking about your confidence, day in and day out. DO WHAT YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE and forget what anyone else thinks.

I wonder what she expected of this type of book. I note that most of the favourable reviews she has posted are for fiction - confidence building is a serious issue, unlikely to be as entertaining! I also wondered whether she believes it is possible to build confidence as quickly as one can read a novel - it takes application and - yes - time and patience! The steps in my book are effective if applied, and anyone who thinks that a year is too long in the context of a lifetime is probably not struggling with lack of confidence to begin with.

I was able to preview the book through NetLibrary and decided that it seemed good enough to purchase. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. The problem is that the author does not use his own voice and insights; the book is filled with numerous exercises (over 400!), and they give directives like \\"write down your greatest dream,\\" \\"try to visualize something positive happening for you,\\" and so on. The author makes a very very brief introduction to each chapter and, the chapters aren't really chapters at all. Basically, this book is a compilation of exercises that you have to do on your own. At the very end of this book the author states, \\"by the end of this year, you now know...\\" A year?? Anyone crazy enough to spend one year with this book needs some serious help.

The murder and the stories of the other characters added wonderful color to this story, to make it part mystery.

Bounds' book, Power Through Prayer. Bounds explores the dangers of relying on knowledge, skill, charm, the art of sermon-making, among other things, while neglecting the prayer closet. He passionately expounds the absolute necessity of a pastor spending hours on his knees in fervent prayer in order for his ministry to bear good fruit. He does this through the use of many scriptural and historical examples. This is a must read for any pastor, but can also greatly benefit any man seeking to lead a ministry, small group, or his even in his own home. Bounds' words were used by God to convict my heart of thinking I could be used to effectively care for my family and my small group apart from a consistent and fervent time on my knees communing with God Almighty. I am also convinced that this is best done in the quiet morning hours, if possible.Thanks to the Christianaudio ([...]) Reviewers Program for the privilege of listening to this classic work. I particularly enjoyed the numerous quotes on prayer throughout the book from many well-respected giants of our faith. Also, the narrator's deep, clear voice was pleasant to listen to and made me feel like I was hearing the words read by Bounds himself."},{"Title":"Power through prayer","review":"E.M. Bounds is well known as one of the pre-eminent, and certainly one of the most prolific authors on the topic of prayer. Power Through Prayer is an audio production of one of his classic works, which while brief (50 pages in print-form, 2.5 hours of audio) is deeply convicting.Bounds writes mainly to pastors, opening each of his brief 20 chapters with a quotation from a great man of faith, followed by his own musings on the importance that a rich prayer life has on the fruits of one's ministry. Though geared towards the pastoral implications of a dry or rich prayer life, Bounds' applications can easily be transferred to the life, ministry, and fruit of any believer.Focusing on the internal spiritual life of pastors, Bounds points out that academic study, charismatic delivery, theological know-how, and a wide variety of other pastoral skills are absolutely no substitute for communion with God. He rightfully points out that reliance on any of these outward abilities will result in a dead ministry. While it may be popular, it will lack the truly life-giving quality that draws members of the body closer to their Lord.Hovel Audio's narrator Doren Elias (Doren is a man, just thought I'd clarify as his is an unusual name) speaks with a warm, rich voice that handles Bounds' rich text skillfully. Though brief, this audio book is well worth listening to multiple times, as it is so full of practical insight on the importance and power of prayer on life."},{"Title":"Power through prayer","review":"I listened to the audiobook through [...] Reviewer programE.M. Bounds is well known for his writing on prayer. He's written multiple books on it and is highly regarded among Christian theologians for his Biblical based approach on prayer. This is actually the first book I've read by him.1. NarratorI consider myself an audiobook junkie, so I'm always drawn to a good narrator. Doren Elias did the reading for this book. I found him to be perfectly acceptable. He simply got out of the way of the text. In non fiction writing, I am not looking for a narrator to draw my attention to him/her, but to the information in the book. Doren's voice is powerful, but not in a way where you begin to focus on his voice rather than the words of the author.2. BookSince this book was written before the mega church area, you won't find discussion on the latest church growth strategies or the most influential youth ministry strategies. I find this fact as a much needed change. Bounds continually prayed between 4 AM and 7 AM. He saw prayer as much more than just getting what you want out of God, but rather seeking God for Him and Him alone.This book seems to be written to pastors (a lot of discussion on spending time praying over a sermon than getting every transition just right), but it is VERY valuable for all believers.

Bounds books are very convicting. In fact, few writers can touch a saints heart like E.M. Bounds. His words (while over 100 years old) are still full of truth. Without a doubt Bounds writes as a man with a passion for Jesus Christ who knows that power truly only comes through prayer.In our \\"modern\\" era it is often the duty of leaders in the church to look more like business CEO's rather than biblical servants of Christ. Churches \\"hire\\" men based on their resumes rather than their brokeness and their humility nor are they much concerned with their prayer lives. Bounds attacks this false Christianity head on. He shows that power comes through prayer. Much head knowledge is no substitute, says Bounds, to a dynamic prayer life. If we are to preach Christ, we must pray!While popular preachers such as Osteen, Warren, Stanley, and others sell books full of milk - Bounds books don't sell because of their truth. The \\"purpose driven\\" church knows nothing of what Bounds writes and never will until we learn the lesson of Isaiah 31:1 and then we will pray (Luke 18:1). Read this book and weep."},{"Title":"Power through prayer","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars. E.M. Bounds wrote a book on prayer, and the result was a little book of timeless dynamite that goes straight for the jugular.If this book doesn't drop you to your knees, nothing will. I've read a few books on prayer by such titans as Watchman Nee and Andrew Murray, but this book is certainly THE ultimate. Bounds was a Civil War chaplain and a Methodist preacher back in the 1800's -- the \\"old school days\\" when holiness was the standard and the Glory of the Lord filled the meetings. This, simply, is a book on prayer by a praying man who spent a lifetime on his knees before the Lord.Bounds had a great way of laying tremendous spiritual truths into short, third grade level sentences. Quick reading (only 120 pages), but you'll want to read it over and over again to soak up all the glorious treasures. You'll spend a lifetime musing over them, incorporating the truths into your time spent alone with God. Bounds doesn't teach you how to pray, but the book's guaranteed to get you on your knees where Jesus will.This has got to be the all-time classic on prayer, period. I can't imagine a more powerful, concise, or influential treatise on the subject. It's the best there is. Every line is inspired, not one sentence is wasted or superfluous. The book is worth over ten thousand dollars, but most Christian book stores have it in their bargain bin for under five bucks. God is so awesome!Take advantage of this blessing and get the book! Your prayer life will be changed forever as you get closer and closer to Jesus."},{"Title":"Power through prayer","review":"I have never read a book like this book about prayer with such an overwhelming weight, compelling exposition and reasoning in regard to why not only preachers, but christians should pray. What I mean by pray is one that is \\"...strongly into the heart and life as Christ's \\"strong crying and tears\\" did; must draw out the soul into an agony of desire as Paul's did; must be an inwrought fire and force like the \\"effectual, fervent prayer\\" of James; must be of that quality which, when put into the golden censer and incensed before God, works mighty spiritual throes and revolutions.\\"(Ch.4)I can not say I agree with everything Bounds said, but I can not help but be stricken with so many strong statements he made or quoted from the giants of Christianity in the past, among which are as follows (I have to restrain myself from revealing too much of the book):- Preaching which kills is prayerless preaching. Without prayer the preacher creates death, and not life. The preacher who is feeble in prayer is feeble in life-giving forces. Professional praying there is and will be, but professional praying helps the preaching to its deadly work. Professional praying chills and kills both preaching and praying. Much of the lax devotion and lazy, irreverent attitudes in congregational praying are attributable to professional praying in the pulpit.(Ch.3)- Prayer--secret fervent believing prayer--lies at the root of all personal godliness. A competent knowledge of the language where a missionary lives, a mild and winning temper, a heart given up to God in closet religion--these, these are the attainments which, more than all knowledge, or all other gifts, will fit us to become the instruments of God in the great work of human redemption. (Ch.4, quoted from Carey's brotherhood)- Preachers who are great thinkers, great students must be the greatest of prayers, or else they will be the greatest of backsliders, heartless professionals, rationalistic, less than the least of preachers in God's estimate. (Ch.4)- The character of our praying will determine the character of our preaching. (Ch.4)- Prayer is humbling work. [1] It abases intellect and pride, [2]crucifies vainglory, and [3]signs our spiritual bankruptcy, and all these are hard for flesh and blood to bear. It is easier not to pray than to bear them. ...perhaps little praying is worse than no praying. Little praying is a kind of make-believe, a salve for the conscience, a farce and a delusion.(Ch.5)- No ministry can succeed without much praying, and this praying must be fundamental, ever-abiding, ever-increasing. (Ch.6)- A desire for God which cannot break the chains of sleep is a weak thing and will do but little good for God after it has indulged itself fully. The desire for God that keeps so far behind the devil and the world at the beginning of the day will never catch up. (Ch.9)- \\"The leading defect in Christian ministers is want of a devotional habit.\\" Richard Cecil (Ch.10)- \\"I urge upon you communion with Christ a growing communion\\" -- Sam Rutherford (Ch.11)- \\"All the minister's efforts will be vanity or worse than vanity if he have not unction.\\" -- Richard Cecil (Ch.16)- Apostolic praying was as taxing, toilsome, and imperative as apostolic preaching. They prayed mightily day and night to bring their people to the highest regions of faith and holiness. They prayed mightier still to hold them to this high spiritual altitude. The preacher who has never learned in the school of Christ the high and divine art of intercession for his people will never learn the art of preaching (Ch.17)- \\"If I should neglect prayer but a single day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.\\" -- Martin Luther (Ch.20)This is an unquestionably must read for Christians who long for sweet and growing communion with Christ and need some fuel and fire to do so."},{"Title":"Power through prayer","review":"E.M.

Don't read this book if you are not ready to devote much time to prayer. It is convicting. It is a classic.

Now that I have finished his second book Concepts of Life, A Biblical Reality into God's Plans for Man, I have to say that it only helped corroborate my belief that he must be one of Publish America's finest authors. Daryl not only has a way with words but his words are not carelessly or superflously written. Having knowledge and wisdom seasoned with God's Holy Spirit he has given us the reader, the sinner, the Christian, fifty letters based on God's Biblical Truths to use in our real life living. From day to day battles, struggles, weaknesses, and faith he gives us examples, some which are very personal and painful, but all beautiful and truly inspiring. They will be letters that one will want to read over and over many times. Very simple and easy to read and yet very, helpful and beneficial.Whether you are a sinner, or a Christian, these letters will do something for you. You will be so happy that you read them and you will take something away from each and every one of them that will make you a better person for having read them.Every sin that man is tempted with is explained in these wonderful letters, as well as God's way for escape. If you are in search of a better way than the sinful way you are leading, then these letters will lead you to the One that can save you from that way you are in.Daryl's love for God and his fellowman shows through with his direct way of telling things as they are in Spirit and in Truth and dressed in the full armor of God. I truly respect Daryl Worcester's life he is leading and his ways to minister to both the sinner and those who have already committed their life to God's will and His work.I pray that those in need of spiritual guidance, or those who want to grow in the word of the Lord read Daryl's book, for it will enrich your life if you do so.Best wishes with it Daryl and may your contribution be Heaven's gain through the saving of lost souls.Review done by Mary E. Preece"},{"Title":"Wildcat Aces of World War 2 (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"If you don't know about the Osprey &quot;Aces&quot; series, it is a set of paperback books describing in great (and sometimes arduous) detail just about every sortie and every aviator who ever shot down another in the title aircraft. Lots of little B&amp;W photos in the margins, these books aren't for everyone. In fact, when I picked up my first few, they went unread for many months.Then, when I tired of the picture books with nothing to say and the &quot;history&quot; mags with their usually-uninspired writing and lack of good stories, and after I had read the same specs and summaries over and over... I re-discovered Osprey! Osprey is the motherlode... where you finally get to when your thirst for the details of the WW-II airwar can no longer be sated by the coffee-table glossies (exception: anything from the late Jeff Ethell) and the $5.00 mags from Borders.And the Wildcat is a great place to start. This was the first type to see sustained action after Pearl Harbor, mostly in the Pacific, where it performed for literally all of the war.Tillman has done some excellent research to find often first-hand information on every Wildcat ace and near ace of WW-II. He uses a chronological approach within the major Wildcat deployments: first USN/MC Pacific, then USN Europe and finally British Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with due relevance given each.Beginning on Dec 7, 1941, we see the newly-deployed Wildcat get its sea legs, through Wake Is., Midway, Guadalcanal... We see all of the major campaigns, (good and bad but mostly focusing on the positive) culminating in VJ day and the poor guy who lost it strafing a Japanese carrier deck 3 hrs before the surrender; then we see how the Wildcats were used in the ETO - knocking out some ships up in Norway, or U-boats in the north Atlantic; and finally the Brits and their &quot;Martlet&quot;, from pre-Pearl Harbor to their General Motors-made Martlet Mk VIs near the end of the war(again), when the Wildcat is relegated to the important but ignominious task of &quot;forward observing&quot; for Iwo and Japan-pounding naval artillery... and still knocking bogies out of the sky to and fro the combat area.However with these Ospreys, the only vantage point is from a single type of aircraft - which you might find peculiar... some would say artificial. You certainly don't get the big picture of the war unless you read the other Ospreys of the major fighting types: Corsair and Hellcat for the Pacific; Mustang, Lightning and Thunderbolt for Europe. But this single aircraft look gives you one important perspective: that of the war as seen by these pilots and their support crew.And taken with its brethren, you can get the big picture... of the air war anyway, and all the great reading you could want from this series - and I found Tillman's Wildcat issue is right up there with a story as important and interesting as the plane itself. Definately worth 4 stars."},{"Title":"Wildcat Aces of World War 2 (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"Tillman does his usual superb job. He knows more about naval aviation history than anyone. I bought the book as a reference, but anyone will find it easily readable as well as complete. Superb illustrations as well."},{"Title":"Wildcat Aces of World War 2 (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"Going from the Buffalo to the Wildcat in '41, pilots liked the Buffalo better than the Wildcat! The Wildcat was a more stable gun platform than the Buffalo, but the ex-Buffalo pilots liked the Brewster fighter better with it's small maneuverability (surprisingly). The Buffalo was being replaced by the Wildcat, however, and by '42 the Buffalo was history.The F4F-3/-3A Wildcat had only 4 .50-cal. machine guns, but the F4F-4 had 6 \`.50s'. Not all pilots liked the added armament, as you will read in the book.The Wildcat was much out-classed by the A6M Zero, but many pilots scored heavily against the Japanese.Barrett Tillman delivers a wonderful book, starting with the first Wildcat development, to the battles at the Solomons and Guadalcanal. I thought the information on the aces was nice. Color plates of the F4F-3 to the FM-2 (an updated version of the Wildcat). There are also color plates of six aces. There are a total of 96 pages in this book, but I do not list appendices in any books, so there are 88 pages of information on F4F, Martlet and FM aces such as Marion Carl, Ralph Elliot, Joseph Foss and many more.There is a chapter on the FAA and the Martlets (British name for the Wildcat) it flew.There is a section dedicated just to Joe Foss and Eric Brown, (but the latter did not become an ace), but it is nice to read about the FAA from someone who was apart of it.Throughout the book Tillman list tables of air groups and aces and their scores, very helpful to see how successful an ace/air group did.I found this book a pleasure to read, I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Wildcat Aces of World War 2 (Aircraft of the Aces)","review":"Very good for those of that era.

This does teach you about DOS Kermit, a file transfer program with terminal emulation features. The commands of Kermit are self documenting. The language can be scripted and is capable of accessing a lot of the potential of model software, especially dated systems. I found it an interesting read but I do not believe I will gain any resume points for having learned it."},{"Title":"The earth goddess","review":"The first two books of this trilogy were action oriented and interesting. The Earth Goddess was chocked full of religious and scientific theories but became very boring and tedious. I feel the author also became bored with this book and the ending killed the spirit of rebellion in Paulo. That was a let down."},{"Title":"The earth goddess","review":"The first two books in the Pagans trilogy, The Stone Arrow and The Flint Lord, are definitely two of a kind: action-oriented rather than introspective; cinematically violent; atmospheric yet fast-moving. I knocked each of them out in a day or two, and enjoyed them very much. In beginning The Earth Goddess, I expected more of the same, and would have been happy with it. What I got instead was something altogether different, surprising, and in the end rewarding. Where the second book in the trilogy is more or less a direct sequel to the first, this book quickly serves notice that that will not be the case here. The story wastes no time in breaking some major ties to the first two books, sweeping the reader to a different place, full of different people and a very different culture - seeing the agrarian vs. hunter/gatherer conflict of the first two books from the other side.The book takes more apparent liberties with historical speculation than its predecessors. Set largely within the elite, secretive priesthood of the titular Earth Goddess, it was actually easy to forget that I was reading a novel set in a real, historical time and place. The priesthood's ethos is sometimes reminiscent of Buddhism, other times of some medieval monastic order, other times utterly unique, and surprisingly sophisticated, especially compared to the protagonists of the first two books.All in all, this was a great wrap-up to The Pagans. The central theme of the series (i.e, the agricultural revolution and its far-reaching effects on human civilization) was well-served by the change in point of view, as well as the gentler (though still plenty violent), more character- and intrigue-driven feel of The Earth Goddess. A fine read in its own right, and a worthy close to this unique trilogy."},{"Title":"The earth goddess","review":"After reading the first two books in the Pagan Series, I was really excited about this book. It was a let down to me andactually found in boring in a lot of parts. Then came the ending.... I would not recommend reading this book, unless you want to fall to sleep."},{"Title":"The earth goddess","review":"Book 3 of The Pagans trilogy, The Earth Goddess, has a different tone than the first two stories. The focus is now on the developing spiritual concepts of this time period (3000 BC), so not surprisingly, there is a lot less fighting and killing. Indeed, after an initial spate of it, most of the subsequent bloodshed occurs offscreen.Richard Herley sets this story about 8 years after Book 2 (The Flint Lord). Tagart, Fodich, and Lord Hewzane serve as a bridge between the two novels. Rian and Ika are also present, albeit in lesser roles. For the most part, we are treated to a new cast of characters, and new lands to explore. Paoul, the hero is initially being raised by Tagart, but is not of Tagart's bloodline, and that's a nice change-of-pace. Like his stepdad, he has his flaws.Despite the paucity of gore, TEG is not a boring read. The writing is strong, and the pace for the most part moves along at a nice clip. The major characters are well-developed (maybe that's the upside to less bloodshed), and there are some deep insights about Religion in this story that are still applicable today.The ending seemed a bit hurried to me, but it still had some neat twists and all the major plotlines (Paoul's heritage, religion, and love issues; plus Hothen's lot) are tied up. The book closes with a kewl epilogue.4 Stars for The Earth Goddess; 4 Stars for the series as a whole. The books are not stand-alones, so start with the first one, The Stone Arrow (it's FREE!), and enjoy the historical adventure."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"The Spell of Making tells you how to create wonderful, effective Pagan rites, step by step and as quickly as possible. It's a great resource for all those Witches out there who create rituals on a regular basis and want to make meaningful contributions to their Coven's BOS. {Those of you with carved-in-stone rituals probably won't find it too helpful, however.} Blackstone's sincerity and sense of humor make this book an enjoyable read. If you need recommendations for your &quot;advanced&quot; reading list, add this one!"},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"This book is a very well written book for any Wiccan to have, be they very experienced or a neophyte. Blacksun has the practical experience and knowledge to share with the Pagan community worldwide and he does so with this book. This is a book that I keep in my 'top 10 recommended books' for people seeking this path...yes, it is not an easy read. But, hard work makes the reward all the more valuable. In this day of fluffy bunny pagan books, it is wonderful to see books like this, that don't cater to the &quot;cash factor&quot;. Thank you Blacksun for sharing this with us! I value my book immensely."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"Blacksun, as no other author to my knowlege, has explained in great detail the how and why of ritual as well as spelled out instruction for constructing your own. I do have to agree with one point of other reviews that I have read on other books, most which I have read myself, in that they all pretty much have the same &quot;fluffy&quot; content. There is absolutely no &quot;fluff&quot; in this book. Take a look at what you claim to be your religion - a duality in deity and nature, as is addressed in all those &quot;fluffy&quot; books, would also suggest a duality in everything wouldn't it? Good and bad, light and dark. If you look hard enough, this book can help you keep them in balance and keep your life in balance."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"an ambitious beginner might enjoy this book, but it is certainly not a &quot;light read&quot;. If you are going to write rituals, for yourself or a group, this is an essential reference. I picked it up by mistake, thinking it was about ritual tools, and quickly realized that I needed this book! Blacksun gives clear details on the many aspects involved in creating a ritual, from magical intent, to symbology and drama. What to include, and how to decide, is only one of many ritual construction steps he explains. There are a few rituals included that are completely explained, including why each decision was made. Even though the book is written from a Wiccan perspective, the book would be usefull to almost any religion since ritual is an integral part of all faiths."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"There are many books that give the very basics of ritual writing among the rest of the text. This is an excellent starting point to wrting your own rituals. I don't think this would be a beginners book. After you have a good understanding and have done a few rituals yourself, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"This is one of the most useful Wiccan/Craft books I've read in many years. Refreshingly, the author wastes no time denigrating others' paths or trads, but focuses on the processes and components (e.g. tools, visualizations) of creating rituals, orderly explaining them in impressive depth."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"I was surprised by the review calling it 'fluffy'. Obviously it depends on what perspective you approach from. This book is almost legendary in both Neo-Pagan and Traditional circles as the best reference for what we do and why we do it. If you're not serious about your religion AND your craft, skip it, if you are, then, this book will fill a gap left by most of the other stuff on the market. Worth it at ANY price."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"Blacksun is my intiator, my teacher, and my friend. I saw this book in MS. I have seen the principles he teaches in action. I have watched him create magic with them. I have used them myself. For those who would create ritual, I say listen to him."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"Blacksun's book, The Spell of Making, is a wonderful resource for those Wiccans/Pagans that want to learn more about modern witchcraft. It is based on his personal experiences with his coven and the ATC (Aquarian Tabernacle Church). I enjoyed it very much and have found it to be a wonderful resource since I bought it from Blacksun at a festival. He uses an innate sense of humor and an intelligent style of writing to bring the information to the reader in an understandable fashion. I recommend it heartily for those seeking answers."},{"Title":"The Spell of Making","review":"Blacksun stresses the need for overstatement when writing your rituals. This makes sense for ritual purposes but unfortunately he also overstates anything he says in the book. There are some good points in there but they are buried unders layers of superfluous banter. I much preferred Watson's anecdotal approach in her Practical Solitary Magic, it just felt more real to me and I was much more interested. This is not the book for you if you already understand how to make up your own rituals, it doesn't even really help you refine the technique very much. I'd say it's more for the person who has immersed themselves in the religious side of the Craft and now is taking a first side int practical magic."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I have all of WEB Griffins books and rate him along with Wilbur Smith as my all time favorite author. His sagas span several different action themes, but they are all either military, police or intelligence services.

Now they led America's finest against her most relentless enemy deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia. It was a new kind of war, but the Generals led a new kind of army, ready for battle and for glory."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"The only reason I started reading &quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; is because I needed something to read to pass the down time at Camp Geiger, NC, and these books were the most interesting ones they sold at the PX. (BTW, isn't it sad that 10 year-old books are being passed off as new? I had no idea these books were as old as they are 'til I looked inside the cover.)This is a weak series of books, as far as war novels go. They're more like an ongoing soap opera than gritty war drama (think &quot;General Hospital&quot; as a novel, only set between 1945-1970 and revolving around the Army instead of Port Charles.) The characters are given plenty of time to evolve, and some do (Lowell, in particular.) But it all seems too phony. A good war novel should have some truth in it, but it is in short supply with these books.&quot;The Generals&quot; is the best of the bunch. It is actually a decent book in it's own right. It could have been better if Griffin had developed it as a stand alone novel and gotten deeper into it's specific story (a Song Tay-type mission to rescue POWs held in North Vietnam) rather than diluting it for the sake of continuing the series.If you like military fiction, buy this book, but stay away from the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"The series got boring even before this book! It's always the same plots just in different times!And if you care for details in a series, to follow the whole history of the caracters, don't buy any of Griffin's books, because he is mixing everything: names, ranks, places, dates,...! It can drive you crazy. Doesn't he ever control what he writes?What made me really angry at this special book, is that there is no reference to the title, concerning the main caracters!"},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I am an unabashed W.E.B. Griffin fan, having read all of the Corps series as well as some of his other novels. I finally took the plunge a couple of months ago and bought the entire Brotherhood of War series. I am the first to admit that the themes Griffin tends to use are predictable--obscenely rich characters who manage to enjoy all of the finer things in life while still being \\"regular guys\\" to all of their comrades, officers who are grossly disrespected or mistreated by others in the military until they are \\"put in their place\\" by superiors, etc.--but I enjoy the books nonetheless. As another reviewed has alluded, they are probably more aptly described as historically-based soap operas than \\"war novels.\\"All that being said, I have in the past few months made a substantial investment of time in reading through the Brotherhood of War series, and was enjoying the journey. Reaching the end of \\"The Generals\\" yesterday was, however, one of the two or three most unsatisfactory, disappointing, and even depressing literary moments I have ever experienced.To begin with, the book ends abruptly, with the briefest of epilogues that winds up the lives of all of the main characters in a paragraph or two. These are characters, mind you, that the reader has come to know intimately and love or hate over the last six books and 2,400-odd pages. To have the last ten or more years of their lives suddenly abridged into a few sentences is incredibly unacceptable.Moreover, there are distressing conflicts that are left completely unresolved. Just before the final scenes in the book, which take place in Vietnam, the main character of the entire series is involved in a scandal that results in EVERY one of his closest friends essentially terminating their relationship with him. That conflict is never alluded to in the final scenes of the book, never addressed in the epilogue, and is simply left hanging in the air for the reader to guess at. I can analogize it to having a terminal spat with a best friend and then having that person die before there is any ability to reconciliation. It is extremely unfair for anyone who has pored over these books for weeks or months.Last, this book--number six in the series of nine--is apparently the last book, chronologically. I say \\"apparently\\" because I am so darned mad about the ending that I have not read books 7 - 9. I have, however, skimmed them, and it is pretty clear from the dates in those books that they are actually PREQUELS to this book. What kind of a numbering system is that? Now that I've read the last book, chronologically speaking, in the series and know what happens to every character for the rest of their lives, whether they live or die, not to mention about the horrible unresolved conflict that this book ends with, why in the world would I want to go back and read about events that took place earlier in their lives?This book should either be renumbered as the last in the series or labeled with a warning that the reader ought to consider reading books 7 - 9 before tackling it, and should also have the ending either rewritten in more detail or have another warning stating that the reader is likely to be left incredibly angry after turning the last page...Did I mention that I am unhappy with this book?"},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"This book was a nice ride -- right up until the sudden ending. I enjoyed the book completely, but you get the impression at the end of the book that Mr. Griffin simply wanted to end the series.The book ends with a multi-page epilogue that discusses what happens to the main players in later years (hint: the &quot;New Breed&quot; is a &quot;prequel&quot; to this book). I can't tell you how let down I was to see the series come to an abrupt end like this. I've really enjoyed the series and I'd looked forward to seeing players who'd become old friends move onto higher and higher levels of rank in the military.Enjoy the book, but be prepared for the sudden end. It's like a cold splash in the face."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"This book is the beginning of the disappointment in the Brotherhood of War series... In 'Part 1' which seems to have been written at a different time and mind set than 'Part 2' a senior officer demands to know why Colonel Lowell was not given a command position in the new Air Cavalry they've developed. He is apparently given one but that's ALL we get to hear on the subject except for in... 'Part 2' which feels altogether different from the first part. We hear a couple sentence rumor of Lowell's exploits in 'nam where he's supposedly insulted a superior and challenged him to court martial him. That's it. Lowell's service as a commander (something he's good at. Something we're told repeatedly throughout the story that's he's good at) is concluded in less than a paragraph and will now and forever be left a mystery. I sort of feel that by now in the series that Craig Lowell would have learned not to have affairs with married women seeing the trouble it's gotten him into in the past but this brilliant, intelligent, rich man once again is written into the stupidity of sleeping not only with a married woman but a fellow officer's wife. This foil got old several novels ago and it was disappointing to see it raised again as a plot device. We also finally see the return of Lowell's son who's in and out of the novel in a short time. He's grown up to be not a very nice person. The ending, as others have stated is abrupt, confusing and very disappointing. The mission in 'Part 2' is interesting (if not historically accurate) and well done but sadly kills off a long time character for no apparent reason. This book begins the decline of the series and should have been the last as it was planned to be. Worth reading but not as good as past novels in the series. Long time readers will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"This book was a nice ride -- right up until the sudden ending.

Reading it again I've forgotten how good of a storyteller Griffin was before writing with his son in his last few books. While this one sets the stage for each of his other series (i.e., Corps, Vigilantes, Philadelphia police series) with a rich guy who always bucks the system to beat up the bad guy, with this one you have good character developmet and dialogue, and get a history of the Army from WWII through Vietnam - Korea, tank development, army aviation, Green Berets, you name it.This one continues the Lowell saga with a very quick and abrupt ending - it's as if he got tired of writing and said \\"I'm done.\\" You would think a little bit of closure wouldn't be out of order for as much as we've come to know / love / hate some of the characters vs. a few pages at the end."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"The rest of the books in this series are very good. This one ends with loose ends and essentially not much character growth or connection among the characters. Like some of the other reviewers I felt let down and discouraged.

I recommend him to others for the genre. I continue to look for novels of his I have not read."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"The Brotherhood of War Series started out as a three volume set. Those first three books were done with compassion, enough facts to make them believable and then something happened.I however started out by reading the \\"Berets,\\" which was entertaining, especially to someone who has spent time at Camp McCall and has walked Smokebomb hill and visited goat lab. That got me started on the series and I went back to the original three books. It was when I got past those first three that I started to see a change in the writing and the repetition that made the books lose some of their flavor. Like others have pointed out the \\"second last book in the series,\\" the Generals left a lot of unanswered questions and seemed like a rush to completion. Bringing out 3 more books in an already finished series seemed pretty bad as if the author had suddenly climbed onto a gravy train and didn't want to let go. It seemed to cheapen the entire series for me.SpoilerThe \\"Brotherhood\\" mistakes were repeated with the Corp. The difference is that the author this time dragged out the beginning and then abruptly ended it as well. It seems like in all of his series he gives you a character that you can like/hate Craig/Ken/Matt but begins to have them follow the same repeatable cycles until you tire of them.I have rated these books with five stars probably because as a young NCO in the early 70s-80s they seemed more believable. They spoke of familiar places and I wanted my heroes to be like these men. Vietnam poisoned a lot of writers of the era into making statements, Griffin made it fun. It was also fun to match them up to their real life counterparts at Fort Bragg, Benning and other places. Hell I'm sure Geoff Craig was my boss in Grenada. &lt;g>"},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I read this book, the last of it's series, which runs from the early 1960's all to the year 1970, including the full end of Lowell's military career at the rank of full-Colonel following his mission to rescue American POW's from facilities in North Vietnam, and putting his career in total ruin by dating the wife of an American MIA as well. All in all, it's a very good book, especially the epilogue of what happens to the key characters of the book, and the epilogue itself is what made me give this book it's 5th star!"},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I just finished this book. I've read the entire series up to this point in order and I truly enjoyed it. But I'm disappointed in the way this book ended. It was abrupt and left a lot of things unanswered about the lives of these people that I had become so engaged with. This is the first book of the series that had serious need of better copyediting, as well, to the extent that it was disruptive to the experience. The whole thing has a feeling of being rushed and it's disappointing. I have the final books in the series here in my shelf, and I hope that they are what I expect of this writer and this series."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I have read and re-read this series several times.

This book is key in the series as it brings some closure to the tail, and is a good book to set up the following continuation of the story line. I found the book informative and fast paced.

(I have lived in Quarters 1 at Fort Benning and Fort Monroe) this is easily the most accurate and readable series of books about life among the officer class in the United States from the 40's through the 70's. Written in an exciting yet detailed manner, it serves as an accurate history of the United States Army from one who has been there. To me personally, the most exciting part is the history of Army Aviation, from the death of Scotty Laird to the secret wars with the Air Force. Though each book stands on its own, this series is a must read for anyone with an interest in the history of the Army. My only regret is that the series ended. Perhaps one more book - The Cadets? . . . . . ."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"I love all of Griffin's books in his Brotherhood of War series. He has humor, and excitement.

It was a mistake. Maybe because I had just read all the way through the Matt Payne-Philadelphia books, maybe because in 25 years, my tolerance of lousy writing has declined, but now I am left with the feeling of trying to break thru the wall at Mile 21 in a marathon. I want to say I finished the series, but I am gagging on the crappy dialogue, the roughly-1/4 of each book as a \\"copy/paste exercise\\" in describing the character on the page as viewed by any other character in the story, and perhaps the sheer disbelief that people actually are motivated by the thoughts Griffin ascribes to them.Generals Bellmon, Hanrahan, and all the rest are \\"cold, icy, angry\\" and generally two-dimensional; most generals barely register as anything other than \\"name from central casting needed for this set-piece in the story\\". The dialogue generally sucks between characters, most coming off as pompous, imperious stuffed-shirts with some of the most twisted syntax I've had the misfortune to read.Basically, going back over the story again, I am regretting having opened this line of reading. The only benefit to reading this series is that it finished up prior to WEB4 having added his jammy pawprints to the writing process (and getting a mashup like the Badge of Honor seemingly rebooting from 1973 to 1999 between books toward the end of that series).Final/Short review: if you made it this far, you might as well finish the series and then put it back on the shelf; but if this is the first one you pick up, put it back down and just read from The Lieutenants thru The Majors and call it good."},{"Title":"The Generals","review":"If you, like me, read these books 30 years ago, I encourage you to re-read them.

Not only do you get a handsomely presented copy of Hard Times, but articles and criticism about the work in one package.For me Hard Times becomes the indispensable Dickens. The relationship between Sissy Jupe and the Gradgrind children is something that is relevant today as it was 165 years ago. That the Education system can ruin children is absolutely a point that needs to be addressed in modern times. The Gradgrind academy only cares about facts, and only turns out vacuous twits. Only Sissy Jupe comes out of the academy with a head on her shoulders. Young Tom Gradgrind shows the folly of removing morals from the schools. He has no understanding of anything but how to take advantage of any particular situation. What is worse, his Father Old Tom Gradgrind tries to cover for him. How is that not relative to today's world?Besides getting the novel, one also gets the critical articles in the back, which help make sense of the whole thing. I am not saying that Dickens, in any of his works is hard to understand, but I especially like the articles from the time period in which the works were written. For teachers of literature, this book is a must. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I needed this book for a college class.

Ordinarily I like Dickens but now I simply couldn't figure out what each event had to do with each other, nor did I understand the end. However the single segments, especially those with Louisa in them, were interesting. It is even funny reading the beginning of the book when Mr. Gradgrind teaches that imagination is useless and only facts are important. If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"_Hard Times_ is a familiarly sentimental work by Dickens. This is especially the case regarding the character of Sissy Jupe, an overly sweet, innocent young girl who is abandoned by her father. Dickens seems determined to tug at the heart strings with this character.Dickens does an admirable job in covering new ground concerning the factory owners and bankers exploitation of the poor, as well as exploring the beginnings of labor unrest in 1850's England. There is much for the factory laborer to be unhappy with in Cokestown, where the factories belch out dirty, polluted smoke all day long. Dickens combines these issues with his examination of the difficulties inherent in parenting and gives truth to the old adage that how the branch is bent, so grows the tree. Through much grief and contrition years later, school master Thomas Gradgrind learns that a cold, no nonsense approach to bringing up his daughter Louisa and his son, Tom, was wrong. Louisa has a good heart and dotes on her younger brother, but is otherwise very distrustful of humanity and exists in the world suffused in apathy; Tom is simply, as Dickens calls him, \\"a whelp\\", and a dishonest one at that. Louisa marries Josiah Bounderby, a banker who turns his nose up at the factory hands and mocks their aspirations to move up in the world. Bounderby refers to these individuals as trying to put a \\"gold spoon\\" in their mouths. The actions of Bounderby and the Gradgrinds directly lead to tragic consequences for Stephen Blackpool, an honest and courageous loom worker, who merely chooses not to be involved with the townspeople or their labor leader. Another old truth that there is no justice in the world is as real today as it was in Dickens' time."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from &quot;civilized society&quot;. Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"&quot;Death by verbosity&quot; describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I initially lamented the fact that Hard Times was assigned to me in my British lit. class. I had read some of Dickens's melodramas like A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and enjoyed them, but everything I heard about Hard Times said this was nothing like those. This was supposedly just strictly social commentary. My interpretation of that: BORING.But then I read it.Hard Times isn't like Dickens's other novels, but I don't think that it has any less heart than those masterpieces. In fact, Dickens endured himself much further to me with this novel as he has his characters perform Thomas Carlyle's enduring philosophy.The novel follows the Gradgrind family who is raised adhering to FACTS and living in a society which worships the manufacturing machine. As the novel progresses, connections are made and broken, and the characters come to the realization that there is much more to reality than the material facts.Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society (this novel feels really modern), and the underlying philosophy is one which is so needed in our post-modern world. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"\\"Hard Times\\" belongs to the second half of Dickens's writing career, in which his work becomes rather more somber and, by common critical assent, more mature and satisfying. Personally, I prefer his earlier work and his very first novel, \\"Pickwick Papers\\", is to my mind his greatest. Surprisingly, \\"Hard Times\\", despite its title and reputation, contains some brilliant flashes of Dickens humour, especially in the earlier part. The descriptions of Bounderby and Gradgrind, and the early dialogue with the circus folk, are genuinely hilarious.This is Dickens's shortest novel, about a third of the length of each of his previous four. Themes, subplots and characters are introduced without being fully explored. The author was perhaps feeling the constraints of writing in installments for a periodical, although he was well used to doing that. This relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.There are the large dollops of Victorian melodrama and the reliance on unlikely coincidences that mar much of Dickens's work. Also the usual tendency for characters to become caricatures and to have names that are a little too apt (a teacher called Mr. McChoakumchild?).The respected critic F.R. Leavis considered \\"Hard Times\\" to be Dickens's masterpiece and \\"only serious work of art\\". This seems to me wildly wrong, but such an extreme opinion may prompt you to read the book, just so that you can form your own opinion.I read it because I had just finished \\"The Jungle\\" by Upton Sinclair, which deals with the plight of Chicago factory workers, and I wanted to compare the two. Sinclair's book has greater immediacy. It takes you much closer to the suffering of the workers. In the Dickens novel, the mill workers and their plight are distanced; they are relegated to being the background to a family drama, which is what really interests the author. A third, and still greater work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\". I recommend all three. Together, they give real insight into the social conditions that led to the proletarian political and revolutionary movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickens creates a novel that virtually revolutionizes literature of the 1800's. At a time where most writers wrote in a stuffy prose full of unrealities and a jaded outlook, Dickens dares to tell with honesty what he sees through his window.Hard Times has yet a misleading title. It gives one ideas of harshness, depression, poverty, and social decline--although the actual reality of then-London, still not something you would choose to read. However, Hard Times has as much depression and poverty as any of Dickens' other works. It is just in this case that Dickens chooses to remind the world that in the deepest despair there is beauty yet to be seen.Dickens was a strange author. In his supposedly inspiring books, you get an overdose of sadness, and in his depressing books, you find beauty. It is this case with Hard Times.It is a poor, honest man's search for justice in a world where only the rich have merit. It is a girl's search for true love while battling the arranged marriage for money. And lastly, a woman's search for recognition against her favored, yet dishonest brother. It is these searches that at last come together and become fufilled. And, while at the same time telling a captivating story, it comments on the then--and still now--presence of greed and total dishonesty one has to go through for money.The title of this review sums up Hard Times. Its beauty comes from the pure searches for truth, the sorrow comes from the evil the characters most overcome to get there, and the honesty is both the truth with which Dickens portrays life and the the overwhelming truth that these protaganists create.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych. ProfessorGeorgetown University, Johns Hopkins Inst."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \\"fancy\\" and imagination. Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students. Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \\"tangible fact,\\" having nothing to do with affection.The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him. Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements. Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \\"for a novelty,\\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \\"progress\\" at the expense of humanity is clear. His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change. Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge. Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder. Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level. Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times. N Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This is Charles Dickens.Charles. Frikken. Dickens.There's no way that any self-respecting booklover, as I style myself to be, can take a Charles Dicken's novel and tell you that it's &lt;shudder> boring, or even not all that great. Unless the book lover in question happens to be a particularly honest one who doesn't mind the Dicken's squad clicking \\"unhelpful\\" over and over again...Let's proceed.Hard Times begins promisingly, as it slams the education system about as hard as I've ever seen (and almost as hard as it deserves), as teachers Gradgrind and Choakumchild (yeah, I know) try to throttle the imaginations of their charges and fill them instead with sand-dry \\"Facts.\\" But then, Hard Times loses the trail of its narrative, following one of the school kids for a while, then another couple of kids, then another character, then another.... It skips around so often for so long, introducing one character or another (and pausing for social commentary) that it seems as though it might never develop a plot.Near the end, it does take on a plot utilizing all of its developed characters, and the energy of the novel picks up considerably, but less-hearty readers will likely have given up long before then. One of the current \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" for this novel currently states: \\"[The] relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.\\" No, no, no. A million times no! It's not that the novel is awful--it's decent, despite the dismal pacing of the first three quarters, and some of the comedy is gold (Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is precious!)--but this is *not* a good novel for children, most of whom won't have had enough experience with real-life Bounderbys or perspective on formal education to fully enjoy the satire. This is not the novel to use as an introduction to Dickens for just about anyone, let alone a young reader.Unless, of course, you have sympathy with M. Choakumchild's pedagogical philosophy.In the hands of a child, this novel will likely stifle any appreciation for classic literature, Charles Dickens, and perhaps reading, itself, that might otherwise develop. Start with A Christmas Carol--it has ghosts--and then move on to A Tale of Two Cities--all around better book (and it has decapitations!). Hard Times is for mature, well-read individuals who want to see \\"what else Charles Dickens wrote.\\"A decent novel with some genuinely great moments, but on the whole fairly dry. As with medication, a blessing and a boon to mankind, it's best to keep this out of the reach of young children."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"HARD TIMES has its own special place in world literature, even as it does in Dickens's own oeuvre. Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon forgotten.Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular member of the industrial community of \\"Coketown,\\" a man who is so obsessed with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel. They are to \\"discard the word Fancy altogether.\\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy, the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \\"McChoakumchild.\\" In Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature. Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of browbeating others with his pompous false modesty. The fact that he is a factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less endearing. And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in marriage!The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship dollars and cents. In 1854 HARD TIMES showed the triumphalist British industrialists their dark side. It stands today as a treasured statement against cost-benefit ratios and anti-intellectualism in a world where CEOs \\"earn\\" $10 million bonuses the same week 4,000 workers lose their jobs. It will stand tomorrow anywhere people are scorned for showing their feelings, beaten down in body and spirit, or victimized by rank injustice."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This novel, like much of Dickens, is hard to pin down in a concise statement as to what exactly it's about. Dickens is often accused, by his critics, of being a sentimentalist and two-dimensional character scrawler. This judgment, I would submit, is quite correct as far as it goes. But the greatness of Dickens, it seems to me, is that each one of his novels conveys a feeling, envisions a world, that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true of Hard Times.The most common interpretation of the book is that it is anti-utilitarian. This take on the novel is quite true, to an extent, but to say that this stance constitutes all that the book concerns is, in itself, a utilitarian interpretation! It reduces the book to a fictionalised polemic. And the book is surely far more than that!There are always, in Dickens's works, depths opening up amidst the simple plots and the simplified (and whimsically named) characters that bring one to a stop. When Louisa finds out from her brother Tom that Bounderby (the most deliciously named character herein) is set to propose marriage to her, the chapter ends thusly:\\"Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he has spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\\"This passage alone should serve notice that something deeper is going in the world of Coketown. I truly don't think I can proffer to the prospective reader a glimpse of the depths that lie beneath the simplified characters and simplistic narrative structure than by quoting the last words of Stephen Blackpool, addressed to his Muse-like Rachael, as he lies dying, after having been raised from the disused mine opening known locally as Old Hell Shaft:\\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old folk now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' hundreds...When it were in work, it killed wi'out need: when \`tis let alone, it kills wi'out need. See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!\\"Coketown, perhaps, resembles our own world a bit too much for our own comfort and self-satisfaction. Look at the tag on the shirt you are now wearing. It was most likely made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop by a human being, with hopes and dreams much like your own. More importantly, for the significance of this book, gaze out into the world around you where people die, \\"thousands an' hundreds\\" every day, for no particular reason other than that they fell in a sort of shaft or hole: financial, medical, physical.Why is Coketown, why is the world as it is, with no apparent rhyme or reason? Why is it, in short, a muddle? That is the deeper question which Hard Times leaves us mulling: Why must they always exist?"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickens was a great rhetorician, but not a very deep social thinker. _Hard Times_ is the novel in which he tries to tell us that there are a Whole lot O' Things Wrong with Britain in the nineteenth century. You've got people living in wage slavery! You've got educators who can't raise their own children! You've got amoral, rakish aristocrats! You've got unprincipled politicians and businessmen! When Dickens is taking on each of these subjects individually in his other works, he's wonderful; when he sews up his complaints against them into one big bundle and convinces himself that it's a Social Theory, he's a tiresomely shrill satirist and all of his characters turn as flat as paper before one's very eyes.This doesn't, of course, mean that the book isn't worth reading - after all, it's Dickens. There are some very sweet and descriptively rich passages about a traveling circus and although one finds it difficult to give a hoot about any of the characters aside from Mr. Gradgrind (who might have been developed much more richly if Dickens had cut down on the windy deploring a little and worked harder to make him seem like less of a cipher) the plot thunders along at the usual absorbingly breathless pace. But if you haven't read _David Copperfield_ or _A Tale of Two Cities_ yet, then for God's sake don't start out with this relatively second-rate effort."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"In this novel set in industrial revolution era Great Britain, Dickens is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Unlike some of his other social commentary, where he wraps his point in a gripping, twisting, and entertaining plot, Dickens goes right for the jugular in &quot;Hard Times&quot;.In this novel he lashes out against the dehumanization of our children through &quot;education&quot;, as well as the still very real gulf between the well to do and impoverished. Even the names of his characters are none-too-subtle jabs. The local teacher, Professor Gradgrind, seeks not to educate or enlighten, but to hammer home facts and turn his children into automatons. His counterpart in the business arena is Bounderby, a blustering, egomaniacal, and ultimately vacuous man. Their countermeasure is a young orphan girl named Sissy Jupe. She is a lovable character that embodies compassion and humanity, but is very nearly broken by the their overbearing influence.This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book to read, and if you're looking to be entertained in traditional Dickens fashion I strongly reccomend looking elsewhere (i.e. David Copperfield). The novel is relatively straightforward and simple of plot, and his scathing social commentary cannot be missed. The most compelling reason to read &quot;Hard Times&quot; though is the fact that the same mentality criticized here is still very much in existence today, and this makes the novel just as relevant for the 21st century as it was when first penned."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"To be quite honest, I didn't find this book overly entertaining. However, though you may call me old-fashioned, I still believe there is educational value to reading. And the book is educational. For openers, it provides us a picture of the world in which Dickens lived. It isn't a very attractive picture, but it is probably an accurate one. The city of Coketown was dirty; its inhabitants breathed polluted air; they struggled to make ends meet. There were a few exceptions among the upper echelon, like Bounderby who owned a country home to which he could retreat. But for the most part, the citizens of Coketown were trapped in a day-to-day mundane existence that didn't offer many bright spots. There's no way I would want to trade places.The book is also revealing in other ways. We learn of the class structures of Dickens' day. We learn of the silly pretensions and the airs people of the upper class put on. Morality and integrity seem mostly limited to the lower class, particularly the circus. Dickens gives us a picture of education that is dreary, directed at the head and away from the heart. The carrying out of justice seems somewhat elusive. In the words of Stephen Blackpool, \\"its all a muddle.\\" This could be a summary of the times. Things do seem to be pretty messed up.Still, the book has its appeal. I think for me, the best part was the descriptions of the characters. They definitely weren't complex or sophisticated. On the contrary, they were almost too obvious in their representation of the roles they played. They remind me of facades of a building on a movie set. Bounderby is constantly bragging that he \\"came from a ditch.\\" His character reminds me of so many people who thrive on a sense of their own importance. Tom was a whiner--please, spare me the privileged child who is never satisfied and always looking to be bailed out. Louisa needed to get some gumption and stop doing everything according to the book. For Pete's sakes, forget your upbringing and get a life! Sissy was fun; and Rachael was admirable. Stephen Blackpool got quite a bit of ink devoted to him. Had his character had a better command of the English language we might actually have been able to understand what he was saying. Oh, well. The best characters, without a doubt, were Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer. Mrs. Sparsit gets the Oscar for best female in a comedy role; Bitzer for the character everyone loves to hate. The circus people deserve at least a mention; they definitely add some color to the novel.So, no, its not a must-read, in my opinion. But I've definitely read a lot worse. You must take fair warning, though. Nearly everyone I know has to power through at least the first half of the book. Eventually it gains some momentum, and you'll probably want to finish it. Even if you're not crazy about the book, you can still mention you've read something by Charles Dickens. Someone somewhere might actually be impressed."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Pretty much, the beginning and the middle of this book is pretty dull. The thing that really saves it towards the middle. So I would not read this book if you are looking for something gripping or that will really make you eager to find out what is going to happen next. The book is simply put a drama with no positive turning points until the end. The ending of a book is really inportant to me. This book has a good ending , so that raises the from my point of view.The book was kind of hard to follow for me. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that there are too many characters. There is at least twenty. Some of these characters are Louisa, Mr. Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind, Sissy Jupe, and Stephen Blackpool. Stephen Blackpool's story was very sad and really affected my emotions as I read it. I also felt that Sissy Jupe went through a lot but stayed strong through her troubles.The basic storyline is this: Mr. Gradgrind opens a private school that teaches his philosophy: facts only! He is the father of Tom and Louisa. Louisa has been preplanned to marry Mr. Bounderby, a banker that is twice her age. She does not like this.This book also does not teach good morals and the reading level is pretty high. I would say that anyone who reads this book should be at least 15 years old. I pretty much have mixed feelings for this book."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly.

The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote.

The way this story was written I could hardly understand,because I'am not used to reading the older english version.A book like this one would be for someone who can definitly read,and understand almost every form of writing. It's mainly about innocent lives simply being tooken away.This included family, adults, and children,knowing at that time age didn't matter.If you were one of killer's victoms ,most likely you would lose your life.That is what made it so hard for many people to calmly contiue on with thier lives',because they were worried about their safty.Just letting you know, I would not recommend reading this book ,If you're someone like me who dosn't understand the old english version used in this text.This story included characters such as Mr.Marmel,the Welp,Mr.Grandgrind,Hart House, Mrs. Pegler and Rachel.They are all involved in those particular pressures of life in that city.

For the best critique of Dickens, read &quot;Against Nature&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority.

Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, \\"Hard Times\\" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper \\"Household Words.\\" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This book at times was challenging to read due to its drab setting (Victorian England) and heavy (read: depressing) subject matter, but its clear message and singularity of theme helped keep me focused: all work and no play makes Jack (or in this case, the Gradgrind children) a dull boy. All in all, an excellent and convincing criticism of Utilitarianism. The characters were well developed and evoked genuine feeling, although ultimately you either hate or feel sorry for all of them. Poor Louisa was piteous, having bypassed childhood and forgone love to slavishly follow her father's iron rule; while Josiah Bounderby elicited the kind of loathing one has for a sleazy politician, the way he concealed his privileged background in order to appear self-made and humble.Despite being almost 150 years old, this tale wasn't dated one bit, and its lessons are appropriate today along the lines of &quot;stop and smell the roses.&quot; However, its teachings are not of the inspirational sort, and to read this I would suggest being free from distractions (you will need to concentrate to get through some of the slower parts), and keeping some sort of emotional pick-me-up nearby afterwards. Lastly, unlike some reviews I have seen, I thought it was seamless, despite its being published in installments."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Although critics dislike Dickens' novels for their twisted, drawn-out plots and his maddening penchant for creating soap-operas in the midst of otherwise realistic plots, these faults must be considered in light of the genre that Dickens wrote for: the magazine serial. Even if one is not fond of the structure of Hard Times, a closer example of the story as a period piece crafted to satisfy the tawdry tastes of the rag-reading public exposes a masterpiece of suspense and morality. A very important work and worth reading with or without this context."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I think everyone can agree right from the start that \\"Hard Times\\" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work. It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" or \\"Great Expectations.\\" But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife. Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station. Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse. They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool. No good deed goes unpunished in \\"Hard Times,\\" but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.Dickens's shortest novel, \\"Hard Times\\" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters. Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing. At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"It is unfortunate that HARD TIMES by Charles Dickens is not usually read outside the classroom. It is an unforgettable glimpse of an age that did not prize the worth of the individual over a collective society--sort of like today's emphasis on the same. What stamps HARD TIMES as the classic that it is is Dickens' continual focus on the rights of the individual and his championing of anti-child labor laws. In an age that routinely crushed individuals in the grinding gears of a society that was hell-bent on automating the factory system, it was only lone voices like Charles Dickens who, in his novels, cried out to stop the madness. In HARD TIMES, Dickens takes a savagely satirical poke at a then popular system of thought: utilitarianism, a philosophy which saw men and children as interchangeable cogs in a machine that demanded that all facets of life and output be reduced to facts, numbers, and quantifiable data. Thomas Gradgrind opens the novel by insisting that the students in his school be just like Officer Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot; fame: give me the facts, and only the facts. Those who can deliver advance. Those who cannot get routinely squashed flat. Josiah Bounderby is the villain as he represents the ultimate in a selfishness and fact-centeredness way of life. As typical of Dickens, there is a vast assortment of subplots that he manages to tie neatly together by the closing pages. What stamps HARD TIMES as relevant in this or any future age is Dickens' insistance that, regardless of technological advances, the individual will always matter. HARD TIMES says this as well as any other book."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Hard Times feels like a book that Dickens did not polish nearly as much as the many classics associated with his name. It's the story of the unhappy lives of two children of a father who raised them to speak and appreciate only &quot;facts.&quot; Imagination, fantasy, passion, and the like were all forbidden in their household.Their lives are unhappy, as you'd expect. But they also lack much narrative interest. The usual twists and turns of fate that Dickens invests into his characters' lives are mostly absent. As a result the book drags on. Hard Times also lacks the humor found in other Dickens books, his pithy observations of different persona of his time. So, in reading the uninspiring narrative, you find yourself wishing for something, anything of the old Dickensian magic. Alas, it does not show up.If you have other Dickens titles you're set on reading, read them first. You're likely to enjoy them more."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Hard Times is a fantastic account of how social history intemingles with economic and politcal history as Dickens is a noted writer for the politcal atmostphere of Victorian Britain. This book takes a hard shot at Utilitarinism and with good reason. The imagery and description in this book are simply brillant. A definate read if you want a look at how it was in the Victorian Era."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This is a totally honest book of life between the lower and upper class. Having lived in the United Kingdom for more than 4 years, I truly appreciate Dicken's description of the physical environements of Coketown. It has so much resemblance of present day London's buildings, especially with regards to the North and South part of the city from Zone two onwards, except for the trailing serpents of smoke.As to the characters so vividly presented and the conversations that were exchanged between them in the course of the narration, I just enjoy the satire on fat old Bounderby, the game being turned upon the Gradgrinds, I think mainly to shame Mr old Tom Gradgrind for his stiff-necked beliefs in 'hard facts'. The consoling fact is he did learnt his lessons.Poor Mrs Gradgrind. It was a pity that she had to be killed off so soon in the story. If she had been alive till the end, what would she say to her daughter's divorce, her son's connection with the bank robbery and Bounderby big fat lies? Probably nothing but something she would never hear the last of!I don't know much on how to comment with a literature eye, but I think Dickens did write pretty well here. I would not hesitate to read it again but since I still have a lot of other books to peruse, I may just as well skip this second reading till later..."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"While this is certainly one of Dickens' shorter novels, that does not stop me from considering it an exquisite masterpiece. In all honesty &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is full of chilling passages and convincing characters such as Thomas and Louisa Gradgrind. There is not one single dull moment. Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well. But, don't let the thin length of &quot;Hard Times&quot; fool you. It is a masterpiece and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Hard Times was written in 1854 by England's greatest novelist CharlesDickens (1812-1870. It is the shortest of his novels. The novel was originally published as a weekly series in \\"Household Words\\" periodical edited by Dickens. The novel reads quickly telling a story that is still relevant in our own post-industrial 21st century Western Society.The novel is set in fictional Coketown set in the English Midlands. The first scene is set in a classroom where children are being taught by rotelearning. Only FACTS yells Mr. Gradgrind who has raised his two children the feckless Tom and the more impressionable Louisa to eschew the emotions of art and the heart to stick strictly to practical learning.Enter into the town Mr. Sleary's circus. Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a young girl whose father is employed by Sleary to ride horses. He deserts Sissy who is adopted by the Gradgrind family. Sissy befriends the lonely lass Louisa. Louisa is forced into a loveless marriage with the bloviating humbug industrialist Josiah Bounderby. Bounderby has crafted a false story of a difficult childhood while disdaining the love of his mother who lives in the country.We also met the tragic Stephen Blackpool a miner who is wed to an alocholic wife. Stephen is in love with the beautiful and kind Rachael. He will be framed for the robbery of Bounderby's bank which was really robbed by Tom Gradgrind.The novel is divided into three parts covering several years. Many of the characters come to a bad end. The novel attacks industrialism, the state of British education and the necessity for entertainment in the lives of everyone.All of Dickens fictions are worth reading. Hard Times is a good introduction to the second half of his career in which he moves to more serious themes. A Victorian classic which will be enjoyed by the discriminating reader."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickens wrote some diverse plots, that's for certain. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly DOES portray some hard times. Everyone knows \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and I had read and loved \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" years ago. This book is something altogether different.Dickens has a knack for creating memorable characters. I had to read this novel for a British Literature class a year ago, and Bounderby, Sparsit, Blackpool, and the Gradgrinds are permanently ingrained in my mind.This novel would have been more enjoyable had my class been able to read it at a slower pace! Pay careful attention to the characters' development.Also, a word on the Norton editors: I really like the way they organized the additional material at the end of the book. There's even a reading by Darwin. It's all related; I think Dickens would have liked it."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a \\"Uriah Heep\\" or \\"Fagin.\\" Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Hard Times is first and foremost a burning indictment on industrialism and the total reliance on reason without consideration for emotions. It is also a great novel. I didn't get quite the same connection with the characters as in Great Expectations - I can't readily recall their names after a few months - but I know them and can remember vividly the scenes that he painted them in.Again there are several sub plots which drive the point home and wrap the novel up in such a tight and well thought out way that only Dickens could have written this. The main character, for me, is Louisa, raised under conventional wisdom on only dry facts and reason. As such, she is completely unable to cope with real life. She is married to Bounderby, who owns the local bank while her brother, Tom, works for him. Bounderby claims to been raised in the gutter, abandoned by his parents, and to have raised himself up by his bootstraps. Each character has built for themselves a house of cards which are destined to come tumbling down revealing all the flaws, all the lies and the fundamental errors of their thinking. The only person left unscathed is the abandoned circus girl who, like Biddy in Great Expectations, reminds us that the people we overlook may just be the best ones out of the bunch."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I was forced to read Hard Times for my English class. Although I was skeptical at first, this book turned out to be pretty good. Dickens manages to create an engaging story with believable characters. He definately does an excellent job satirizing England during the Industrial Revolution. This book is not perfect, but is clearly a fine work of literature. A word of CAUTION: If you have a hard time reading wordy, descriptive passages in the Victorian writing style, this book is NOT for you! (I generally enjoy novels written during this time period.) A further note: If you are not assigned to read this book and really want to read some good Dickens, I would choose GREAT EXPECTATIONS, which I think is superior by far. Otherwise, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Coketown is \\"the inner-most fortifications of that ugly citadel where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence.\\"Hard Times takes place in 1854, six years after Karl Marx first published his ideas in the Communist Manifesto. Marx revolutionized the way people looked at history. His historical science was a radically new way of looking at human history, our past, our present, and our future. Marxist themes are plentiful in Hard Times, everything from the Bourgeoisie to the Proletariat are represented in this account of the industrial revolution.Dickens provides an excellent portrayal of real-life people faced with hard times amidst an economic boom. This is a touching story, giving names and faces to the people who are creating, being replaced by, and being abused by the industrial revolution. The Communist Manifesto is not complete until you have read Hard Times."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Still not a bad story, but rather more depressing than most of his books, there is very little to make this an enjoyable read, as Dickens usually is. Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I just finished this book, it is the third of Dickens novels that I have read. It is one of his shortest so it was easy to get through reading it in a decent amount of time. I enjoyed the characters he introduced, but I found myself getting a tad bit lost in some of his phraseology trying to figure out what was being said and understand exactly what was going on. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this novel of Dickens, but the one thing I do like about Dickens is you can't breeze through any of his novels without putting some effort into concentrating on what is being said-or else you get lost! This being said, It isn't the most light hearted of his novels, but If you enjoy reading Dickens, you will most likely like reading this one, too, even if it isn't necessarily his best one."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I read this book later than I read novels such as Great Expecatations and David Copperfield, but I don't remember it as well. Hard Times is a fine novel - short, often miserable (but that's the reason why this novel is so important), but with a good message. It's also an effective satire that actually does have its moments of humor as well as pathos (such as when Stephen Blackpool dies). I do recommend it, but as good as a book it is, it'll never be one of my favorite Dickens novels."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"\\"Now what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life...Stick to the Facts, sir!\\" With this opening, Dickens shoves his message down the gullet of the reader of Hard Times which is indicative of the entire story line, characters, and the social message that he is trying to shout out to his audience. The book is an allegorical message in every sense of the word where his descriptions of the character's physical traits bring their personalities to life. Dicken's description of the story's setting, Coketown, and those who live and work there, also illustrates the bleak and dismal attitude surrounding the Victorian Era and the changing social structure of the time.The tale begins in a school, barren of the delightful faces usually evident in children, due to the staunch efforts of Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. M'Choakumchild, the proprietor and schoolmaster of Coketown's school. Their quest is to instill nothing but facts into the children of Coketown \\"until they were full to the brim.\\" They attempt to create an environment in which no child will be allowed flights of fancy or fits of imagination. The fruits of this quest are strongly apparent in Gradgrind's own children, Thomas and Louisa, who are encouraged to learn facts, and not allowed to participate in activities that other youths would see as a necessary part of life. Following their education, the two are given over to the control of Mr. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed, self-made man, proud that he has pulled himself up the \\"corporate ladder\\" and into a better life than he claims to have come from. Louisa becomes Bounderby's wife at the insistence of her father, and Thomas, an employee at Bounderby's bank. The one wild card added into the equation is Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus performer who has abandoned his station in life and his daughter, as well. Gradgrind takes in this pure, young soul in order to prove that his methods can be used to teach respect and proper behavior, even in a girl raised in an environment such as the one in which Sissy has been raised.Along the path, Dickens introduces some of the other residents of Coketwon, including Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking, virtuous man who lives in misery due to bad choices made in his youth. His friend and co-worker, Rachael, is also hardworking and honest, and although there is romantic interest evident, Blackpool's unwise decisions of younger days keep them apart. Also mired in the plot is Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's house keeper, and a truly despicable and pathetic character. And last in the line of detestable characters that Dickens adds is James Harthouse, an upstart from another place whose sole purpose in the novel is to wreak havoc on the lives of the others while remaining absolutely clueless to his part in their misery. The story continues as the characters trod along in their lives with only suspicion that there is another way of life, until Dickens casts his redemption spell in the form of Stephen Blackpool's martyrdom for society and Sissy's powerful moral character that affects Harthouse so strongly that he leaves Coketown.Throughout the tale, Dickens so strongly exerts his opinions and hopes that at times the book left me feeling ambivalent towards almost every charcter introduced. And his use of language, although allowing the tale to be vivid in the mind of the audience, also makes the reader wonder if he wasn't being paid by the word, rather than by the page."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"This is a gem and for those readers out there who are tempted to try Dickens, then, apart from A Christmas Carol, this is the only book by him that can be read in a day (unless you are an insomniac). I have - like many of the other reviewers I am sure - read every one of Dickens' works including the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood. For sheer brilliance, Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Bleak House and in my opinion Little Dorrit. But for something transcending literature - a deep social and political commentary - try Hard Times. Plus you won't grow old trying to finish it as it's about 300 pages (220 in somew versions)."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickens has an incredible energy that, after putting away a few dull contemporary novels, should be immeadiately striking to anyone. And with the wonderfully satirical opening of Hard Times, \\"Now, what I want is, Facts....\\" he continues to begin a book better than anyone. That energy does not dissapate as the novel progresses.Hard Times is set in the industrial but fictional Coketown. Its central point of concern is a certain ultilitarian/Victorian sensibility, a point of view that reduces everthing to rationality. This reaches is most tragic moment when a father must watch her daughter literally crushed by a \\"economical\\" marriage that he encouraged. Rationality also dictates the divisions of labor and class, that become dehumanizing.But while this book is satirical, and does have a social agenda, Hard Times can't be reduced to that agenda. It isn't merely a collection of opinions. There is too much here for that. Characters are shamed, outcast, forced into \\"sensible\\" but unfulfilling lives, and commit crimes while letting others take the fall. Unlike some of our contemporary satires, Hard Times doesn't just mock. There is heart and tragedy too. Further, no one, rich or poor, gets off the hook. Whether its Slackbridge the union leader and a group factory workers, or a wealthy banker, anyone who lacks humanity is shamed. Probably the richest and most aristoratic character, James Harthouse, is judged indifferently. Dickens isn't a partisan.Hard Times is the shortest Dickens novel and its brevity is a double edged sword. While one is not exhausted at its conclusion (As I was with David Copperfield), and there are less story lines to confuse, you a don't know the characters as well as you do with the longer novels, and the cast of characters isn't as wide. Also absent is some of the jolly or quirky characters that are Dickens staples. This accounts for why some call it a dreary novel, though I disagree.This isn't his best, and there will be some moments when you shake your head (why does everyone seem to die with perfect timing?) but Hard Times is still great. When I criticize one of Dickens' novels, I compare his low moments with his high ones, not to other writers. I will continue to read his novels and love their energy and wit."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"If you read Hard Times for the sole purpose of being entertained you will probably be highly disappointed. However, if you understand what was happening during this time period, you will realize that Hard Times is in reality, a long commentary. The Industrial Revolution was starting to show its down side. There was rampant poverty and disease, from the overcrowding of the cities. Children of the poor had to work long hours in unsafe factories rather than go to school. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots was very wide. The middle class was only beginning to be a distinct group.This then was the backdrop of Hard Times. Dickens is making a social and political statement. This is a statement against the mechanizing of society. It starts with Dickens repeated use of the word fact. It is facts that have meaning. Human conventions like feeling, compassion or passion have no meaning or looked down upon as an inconvienent waste of time. If a situation cannot be put down on paper as in an accounting ledger it should not be considered.This is where the conflict of the book comes in. Which helps humanity more compassion or fact. Is Bounderby a better person than Blackpool? Bounderby, who by his own admission was a self-made man. Untrue as this was he said it enough to make it his own reality. Or Blackpool, a weaver with an alcoholic wife, who was in love with another woman. Facts made Bounderby rich, compassion made Blackpool human.Louisa presents another conflict. Louisa was educated only by fact. No wonder or inquisitiveness was ever allowed. She was the perfect robot. Doing what she was told when she was told. Just another piece of the machine, however, the piece broke, emotions came out, and they broke down the wall of fact that Mr. Gradgrind had so carefully constructed. Because the feelings have finally been acknowledged things really break down. She finds that not only has she married the wrong man but also the man she did marry is a buffoon whom she cannot respect nor live with.The reader is left wondering if there is no one who will not be ruined by all the worship to fact. The whelp has certainly been ruined to the point he feels no responsibility to anyone but himself. If a situation can not be used to his advantage then he has no use for it, as a matter of course, he will run when he believes he will have to take responsibility for his own actions.The gypsies have not been ruined by fact. But only because they live outside of society, they do not conform to the rules of society. These are the people who value character over social status. The gypsies do not value Bounderby and Bitzer with all their pomp and egomania. Rather they value Stephen Blackpool and Cecilia whom can show compassion and kindness no matter a person's station in life.Hard Times can be used to look at today's society. Are we, as a society more worried about our computers, cell phones, faxes, and other gadgets than our neighbor's well being? Do we only get involved to help others when there is a personal benefit? Or, are we like the gypsies who can look into the character of the person and not worry about the socio-economic status? While Dickens' wrote Hard Times about 19th century England the moral can easily fit into 21st century America"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens visited Preston during a strike. So, this book is written largely based on his observations. People tend to go from one extreme to the other on this one. They tend to either really like it, or really dislike it. While it lacks the artful improvisation of some of his works like \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"Our Mutual Friend,\\" it is good in a different way. Right away, we meet Thomas Gradgrind who thinks that FACTS are the answers to all the questions in life. While he may seem harsh and brutal, he does have a conscience, and he honestly believes in what he does. We then meet Sissy Jupe and Bounderby. Sissy Jupe is pretty much the opposite of Thomas Gradgrind. She is one who hangs onto sentiment and hope. Bounderby on the other hand is the more dark and extreme version of Gradgrind. (Though it is hard to hate Bounderby because we can see the society that created him.) Through clever wording, Dickens describes the darkness and sadness of the area. Interestingly, the dark Bounderby has one notable redeeming feature. He is good to his housekeeper Mrs. Sparsit. We later meet Stephen Blackpool who has worked 12 years in Bounderby's factory. He is a good honest man who suffers because he can not go along with any extreme. He loves a woman named Rachel, but he is already married. (And of course the marriage is not a happy one.) Stephen then has a dream that foreshadows his fate. One of the most disturbing events of the book then takes place. Under her father's advice, the 20 year old Louisa agrees to marry the 50 year old Bounderby. (Charles Dickens could have hardly known that some time later he would marry the young Ellen Ternan, but we won't go there.) Later, we learn that Slackbridge is stirring up a mutiny in the factory and poor Stephen Blackpool is cast out because he will not join. And even Bounderby will not help poor Stephen. (What a situation!) Louisa (now Mrs. Bounderby) gives Stephen some money to help him, but Tom Jr knows that he can probably use Stephen's slowness to his advantage. James Harthouse starts to grow close to Louisa, and we can see the tension rising. The bank is then robbed, and poor Stephen Blackpool is suspected, but it doesn't take much for us to know who really did it. Interestingly, Mrs. Sparsit (Bounderby's servant) continues to use Louisa's maiden name. Louisa knows that her brother probably robbed the bank, but she can not bring herself to tell. The tension between Bounderby and Louisa begins to increase, and we can guess that the marriage does not have much longer. In a well written chapter Louisa has an emotional breakdown due to her upbringing, and the good in Thomas Gradgrind starts to show. His intentions were good, but he realizes he was wrong. (Thomas Gradgrind is not exactly a Murderstone or a Uriah Heep.) In a rage, Bounderby ships Louisa's stuff back to her father's, and we can see the marriage is over. But there is more to come. Stephen Blackpool is still suspected of robbing the bank, and fleeing did not help the situation. He makes his way back to proclaim his innocence, and he has a fatal accident. Poor Thomas realizes that his son robbed the bank. And in a moment of irony, the circus (that Gradgrind scorned so openly) is hiding his son. There is a brief and tragic reunion, and Thomas Jr is sent out of the country where he can hide in safety. And if it's any small consolation prize to Mr. Gradgrind, Thomas Jr does mend his ways. While the book does not exactly end in utter happiness, the characters do grow in a sense, so it does not end in utter sadness either."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I'm surprised by all the two and three-star reviews appearing on this site. For me, &quot;Hard Times&quot; was enjoyable right from the start and memorable long after. The writing is evocative and fluid, and although it can be easy to get lost due to some of the anachronisms in Dickens' writing, in general the writing is excellent. The characters, while not subtle (it's pretty easy to sum them up in a few words) are all memorable and tug on the heartstrings quite a bit. Sissy, Mr. Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby, Stephen, Tom, and Louisa are great characters (and just because they're easily defined, they are no less human or believable). Finally, the story itself is a bit sobering (as it was intended to be) but it's also very human and shows the possibilities of redemption quite nicely.In short, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is excellent. I'd recommend it to any fan of Dickens or just anybody who likes good literature."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"I love the ending of this novel by Dickens when he says:\\"Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not. Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn cold and grey.\\"This novel is all about what one would think of as a dreary life in a north England mill town (fictitiously) called Coketown. It is named after the seemingly endless plumes of thick coal smoke being emitted from many different mills in this small lifeless town. But true to Dickens style he gives us a delightful set of characters that we can love or hate but who keep us entertained through a quick read of about 300 pages.There is method in the madness, in that Dickens tries to push us in the direction of accepting that fate was not preordained for these folks and they could choose a better life if they so desired. He includes many biblical references and references to the mid 1800 culture to keep it all upbeat and entertaining.I was expecting a more depressing plot to reflect the title \\"Hard Times\\", but in many ways it is good times for some of the characters, and as Dickens says at the end that he can hope for a positive outcome for their lives - the precise details of which he leaves us guessing.Entertaining 5 star read at a bargain price by a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"... of English literature? I read \\"Hard Times\\" -- the 1969 Penguin Classics edition, which I still own and which is still intact -- roughly 40 years ago, in the midst of a Dickens binge, and I'm surprised to find that the humor in it has gotten angrier from aging on my book shelf. The anger has a lot of targets: industrial pollution and ugliness, the smug hypocrisy of the wealthy, the connivance and impotence of lawmakers, the class inequity of the Law, the dysfunctional divorce laws of England, the inaccessibility of education for the poor, the 'utilitarian' social philosophy of the era, the sort of education that crushed a child's creativity under the thumb of intellectual conformity and economic utility. In fact, a lot of the humor of \\"Hard Times\\" is of the bitter, scornful variety -- no less funny for being preachy -- while the tirades of anger are bedecked and bedizened in the drollest caricatures and exaggerations, as if Mr. Pickwick were asked to expound the utopianism of Charles Fourier.But I admit that I had remembered \\"Hard Times\\" inaccurately. I recalled it as being a tale of 'labor agitation' in a mill town, rather like Emile Zola's great protest novel \\"Germinal\\". There is indeed a brief episode of labor protest, scarcely a chapter in the middle of the book, but the narrative focuses far more on the family affairs of the utilitarian philanthropist Gradgrind with his two children and the despicable mill owner Josiah Bounderby, boor, boaster, bully, buffoon. Gradgrind has raised his daughter and son, by the most systematic repression of their imaginations and sympathies, to be paragons of utilitarian values. The son inevitably turns out to be a self-centered scoundrel and the daughter a frigidly dutiful automaton. Gradgrind weds his beautiful young daughter to the far older and dictatorial Bounderby, and plot complications ensue. \\"Hard Times\\" encompasses three tales of woefully failed marriages, a thwarted seduction and hopelessly obstructed romance. There's really only one \\"working man' in the cast of \\"Hard Times\\" - the honest but 'limited' weaver Stephen Blackpool, whose eventual fate provides the pathos readers must have expected in a novel of 1854. The 'introduction' to my ancient Penguin Edition, by David Craig, perceptively challenges Dickens's own inability to assign a well-rounded self-determining 'humanity' to his lower-class characters, for all of his purported sympathy with their plight. Blackpool has the virtues of a victim only, a dumb beast. The circus performers, who appear in the novel at the beginning and who return at the end, are likewise morally admirable but incomplete. Frankly, if one stops too often to think about the reforming zeal of Charles Dickens, one can get frustrated with the man, especially when reading his earlier novels like Hard Times. He was, I fear, as hidebound in his assumptions of social class as anyone in Victorian England; he merely had a warmer heart and a much sharper pen. There's a brisk current of influence from the literary works of Dickens to the political and sociological notions of Progressivism, the Social Gospel, the Temperance Movement, and all the elitist reformers of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.Do not, however, let analysis of any Dickens novel inhibit your pleasure at the vitality and inventiveness of his words! That's another thing I'd forgotten over the years since my first Dickens binge: just how damned well the aptly-named \\"Dickens\\" could write!"},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"A book called \\"Hard Times\\" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading \\"Hard Times\\" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as \\"a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.\\" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or \\"fancy\\") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, \\"Hard Times\\" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique \\"Hard Times\\" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the \`hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"To write an outline of Hard Times or Dickens' work would not be necessary. His writing has withstood the test of time, and is well know. To give encouragement to would-be Dickens' readers and Hard Times readers does seem like time well spent.Hard Times ventures from other Dickens' books in the writing style lending a departure from Dickens' previous descriptive formats. In this particular book, Dickens lends skill, imagination, and panache to English language usage. He breathes life in to the language of the novel, and he remains a master of dramatic setting and story line. When people say, \\"Read good books, it will rub off on you.\\" Hard Times comes first to my mind. Therefore, a reason to read Hard Times would be to improve your own reading and writing.I admit some of the character's lives are depressing. When I looked back upon the entire book, and wondered if Hard Times would differ if set in present day with cell phones, PDAs, the Internet, electricity, airplanes, automobiles, and so many distractions. My guess would be - probably not. Would Louisa Gradgrind's life have taken a different course if she were living in today's world? My guess would be, perhaps, a slight shift on her circumstances, and, again, probably not. Dickens' charms include being able to put his finger on a character type and bring it to life. This is why I'd call certain present day figures, \\"A Mr. Bounderby\\" or \\"A Gradgrind\\". The Whelp or Tom Gradgrind remains alive and kicking; I've met him.My recommendation: Read Hard Times.

It must not be a coincidence then that this is among his shortest novels. I suppose this is why at times, his characters wind up being caricaturesque, and not as complex and real as some of his other very memorable characters. By the same token, some of his subplots do not fit in to the main plot the way they do in most, if not all, of his other works.Dickens is trying to explore and provide us with a picture of the effects of utilitarianism on different types of human characters, and in my opinion he does a good job, but only as far as individuals go. We can see the impact of the post romantic victorian social system on all of the novel's characters, and this makes the book interesting. The downside, however, is that when Dickens tries to extrapolate and paint a picture of the social struggle going on, he falls quite short. He tries to oversimplify too much, and in my opinion, fails at that.The \\"nothing but Facts\\" system psychologically castrates most of the main characters in the book. In one way or another, they all have their share of \\"Hard Times\\", and this can surely be attributed to a dehumanizing system, where people are statistics or simply gears within the machine which represents the newly industrialized world.It is no surprise that there are absolutely no happy people in this novel. This is definitely not one happy book, but overall it's really worth reading. If what you're looking for is a book that easy to read and to understand, and a page-turner, just stay away--read John Grisham instead ;-). If you want to read Dickens, this is more that probably not his best, but it's still good."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Considered by 19th century critics to be one of Dickens' more artistic and literary triumphs, Hard Times can be viewed in present time as a blistering polemic against the rise of industrial society and the dominate philosophy that rose in tandem with the industrial age, utilitarianismIt is well known that Dickens was a chronicler of his times, and his mode of expression, the novel. An intensely emotional individual, Dickens was known to be a power walker, starting in the afternoon, covering miles, to return home just before sunrise. It was during these extensive walks that he witnessed the utter poverty and squalor scattered throughout the streets of London. These walks brought inspiration for many of his novels, particularly, Hard Times.In this novel, Dickens explores the applications of utilitarianism in its highly rational, and in many ways, brutal forms. The novels general theme is that a philosophy that is only concerned with happiness and survival for the majority, will attempt to quash any and all individual thought and effort. Individual ideas, emotion, imagination and creativity must be ruthlessly rejected in order for the majority of people to think alike, work alike and behave alike to attain a status quo of happiness for all. Rationality must prevail because imagination promotes individuality, which is anathema to mob concerns.This polemic against utilitarianism is expressed clearly and persuasively in the practice of education. In the opening chapter for example, \`The One Thing Needful\\", the reader is introduced to this dictatorial emphasis on the rational:\\"Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will be of any service to them.\\" (p. 47)Romanticism was now on the wane and utilitarianism and the rise of rationalism infiltrated every aspect of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics.Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely. Dickens was reporting, and speaking against a potentially destructive sway in society away from basic humanity and the importance of the individual, towards the highly mechanical and rational \`mob' philosophy of Utilitarianism during the Industrial revolution.In our so-called modern times, Dickens message continues to be relevant. Our societies emphasis on rationalism and the exclusion of emotion, can only lead to destruction. A balance must be found."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"A most interesting book, and not the &quot;downer&quot; one might expect from the title. The story begins with the issue of what might happen to children raised in a setting where the non-logical human qualities are repressed. This is blended in with the relationship dynamics of those who own the factories and those who make the factories actually produce something to sell. Further, related issues are added. These various topics are intermingled in a moving story."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Despite the explicit title, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is not so much an ode to poverty and misery as it is a commentary on the increasing impact of industrialization on the fragmentation of society and on the dehumanization of education. The result, as Dickens implies, leads to lives hollowed by the emptiness of work for work's sake and wealth for wealth's sake.The setting is Coketown, a factory town befouled by industrial smog and populated by underpaid and undereducated laborers. The novel's most prominent character is one of the town's richest citizens, Josiah Bounderby, a pompous blowhard who owns a textile mill and a bank and whose conversation usually includes some boastful story about his impoverished childhood and the hard work that led to his present fortune.Bounderby is the commercial projection of Thomas Gradgrind, a local schoolteacher and an extraordinarily pragmatic man who instills in his students and his own children the importance of memorizing facts and figures and the iniquity of indulging in entertaining activities. Gradgrind offers to Bounderby his son, Tom Jr., as an unwilling apprentice, and his daughter, Louisa, as an unwilling bride.On the other end of the town's social scale is Stephen Blackpool, a simple, downcast man who works as a weaver at Bounderby's mill and slogs through life misunderstood and mistreated. When he refuses to join his fellow workers in a labor uprising, he is ostracized; when he criticizes the economic disparity between Bounderby and the workers, he is fired and forced to leave town; when Bounderby's bank is robbed one night, he is suspected as the thief. So halfway through the novel, Dickens grants his reader an interesting, albeit somewhat contrived, plot element to embellish the narrative.If this novel contains a ray of sunshine, it is in Sissy Jupe, a girl abandoned by her father and adopted by Gradgrind, whose oppressive educational method nearly breaks her. However, she grows up with her own intuitive sense of propriety, which she uses as a tool to eject a dishonorable character from the novel. Her strong and independent spirit will allow her to do much better in life than Louisa, who withers away in an unhappy marriage, and Tom Jr., whose boredom renders him vulnerable to temptations.Compared to his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is relatively short and straightforward and has few characters, as though Dickens felt that what he had to say was so important, it had to be said quickly and bluntly. He is less interested in realism than in making a point, and it's really the poetic power of his prose that enables him to get away with the overbearing sentimentality and often ridiculous caricatures that accompany his poignant human truths."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Some critics go so far as to say this is not an important part of Dickens. In my opinion this is a serious error. If anything, this is one of his best creations. The characters are plausible. In addition, the passages are dramatic and chilling. Dickens also fills this work with suspense, powerful images, and dramatic irony. Not one page is wasted. Don't let the thin length of this book fool you. This is a phenomenal masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"As a previous writer said, this is probably not the easiest Dickens novel to read, as it lacks the charm and appeal of the more popular works like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, but it still occupies an important place in Dickens's oeuvre. It is basically an expose of the evils of the unrestrained capitalism of the period, as Dickens portrays the lives of the poor who are held captive, oppressed, and ultimately crushed by it.In this book, although it speaks mostly from the oppressed working class and lower middle class, characters from all walks of society mingle. Although Dickens describes the dismal and oppressive working conditions of the time, the economic realities really take a back seat to the intimate story of the families, and of their trials and tribulations and failures.Fallen, old-family aristocrats like Mrs. Sparsit serve crass, nouveau-riche boors like Mr. Bounderby, whom she despises, and criminals and even circus people have important roles, such as in the case of Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a clown. The characters, however, aren't formulaic stereotypes but are real people who love, hate, make mistakes, fail, and live to regret and apologize for their mistakes.The novel takes place during the second phase in the industrial revolution which led to the development of the power loom. One of the main characters, Stephen Blackpool, is a power loom operator, and the new productivity of this device put many formerly skilled, manual loom operators out of work, further worsening an already bad unemployment situation.Gandgrind, the schoolteacher, is a rationalist representing the 18th century enlightenment ideals, and his philosophy of \\"fact\\" is shown to be a loveless and dispiriting sham. His views are ridiculed by Dickens, and his daughter ultimately rebels. In a sense, the novel is as much about the false and destructive ideals and beliefs of many of the main characters as it is about the economic vicissitudes of the time.Dickens's stories about the conditions in the factories and the lives of the workers were an important influence in changing things for the better. Eventually, England passed laws restricting child labor (to 11 hours a day), redistricting the so-called \\"rotten bourroughs\\" (whose seats in Parliament were sold by the wealthy landowners), and chattel slavery was abolished in the early 1830s, although economic slavery continued to exist in the form that Dickens depicts it in this novel. Laws were passed that didn't limit election to Parliament to landowners, and the stage was set for a fairer representation of the worker's interests.The Chartist labor movement attempted to obtain justice by smashing the looms and machines, but it ultimately failed to achieve its goals. The later labor movement was more successful in calling attention to the plight of the workers and in creating badly needed changes.By the way, an odd piece of trivia on Dickens that I read once. Just as today, back in Dickens's time even otherwise intelligent people believed in all sorts of pseudoscience. One of these was the supposed effects of magnetic fields on biological organisms, which still persists today. It was thought that if one slept with one's body aligned with the earth's magnetic field, that one would reap significant health benefits. When Dickens came to America to go on a speaking tour, the maids who came into his hotel rooms were surprised to find that he had completely rearranged the furniture so he could align the bed north and south with the magnetic field. Dickens kept a pocket compass with him so he could do just that.Unfortunately, there is no basis for such a claim although speculation about the health benefits of magnetic fields persists today. Also unfortunately for Dickens, it's too bad that there were no real positive health effects, otherwise he might have lived longer--his exhausting speaking tour wore him out and he became ill and died soon after returning to England. I've also read that he was paid $100,000 for this tour--an enormous sum of money at the time."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Dickins was a master of satire.

And yes, a thorough Marxist reading is certainly possible. Dickens cared deeply about the world in which he lived and his humanity shines through in every line. This book, and all that Dickens wrote, is worthwhile if only for the beauty of the prose.

This is one of the better audio books I've listened to in a while from the perspective of the narrator doing excellent voice characterizations. Jarvis was able to make each character sound distinct and they each sounded just like I would have imagined. Bounderby was thunderous, Tom Gradgrind sounded like a whelp, and Blackpool sounded meek and humble. It made for an enjoyable listen that made it very easy to follow the characters.I've always been a fan of Dickens and have read most of his books, but this was my first time through \\"Hard Times\\". As with most of Dickens novels, the characters are almost caricatures, but this method does a good job of pointing out human strengths and weaknesses. This is a short novel for Dickens, but still did a good job exploring the impact of what would happen if science is emphasized too much over emotional education.He once again highlighted the problems with class distinctions in English society at that time. I like how his humble characters have more wisdom than those that are rich or of high social position.I highly recommend this audio book as a great way to be introduced to Dicken's \\"Hard Times\\"."},{"Title":"Hard Times (Bantam Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown.

But the story, while shifting focus to the Godson of one of the men arrested, concerns his passion and pursuit of the highly coveted black tulip, a strain of Holland's most popular horticultural export. Cornelius van Baerle, a man of comfortable means, is little concerned with his wealth, or with position; or at all suspicious of the papers left in his care by his Godfather prior to his arrest. M. van Baerle has but one pursuit, one goal, and one dream...to produce a flawless, rare black tulip.Thus his downfall, as an avaricious neighbor,Isaac Boxtel, shares this dream, but for entirely different reasons. While Cornelius van Baerle cares not for the riches and fame associated with growing such a flower, Boxtel covets both and plots to eliminate his competition and abscond with the delicate blossom which will net him one hundred thousand florins, more than enough to live like the King himself.M. van Baerle is, therefore, convicted of treason when Boxtel reveals the existence of the papers of va Baerle's godfather to the authorities, and M. van Baerle finds himself on the wrong side of prison bars.However, the appearance of an unexpected love awakens passions in Cornelius to rival those he feels for the black tulip, and ignites a desire in him to share the possible wealth associated with the flower, simply to assure it's development and care.Thus, the race is on to plant, grow, and deliver the black tulip to the Horticultural Society.Dumas' writing skills are in fine form with this shorter novel, sparing none of the humor, grace, and elegance of other works of his I have indulged in. And while foils are left in scabbards, no plots to overthrow a corrupt Cardinal materialize, and revenge is not sought against the bad-guys...this novel is every bit as exciting.A fine way to experience one of France's most prolific historical authors for the first time, or to further explore his catalogue of works."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"This book is not to be recomended by those who want an exciting swashbuckling tale on a par with Dumas' incomparable musketeer stories. It is to this end that many reviewers and readers of this book leave with an unfriendly opinion of this book. Although it is Dumas' last book, it is in my opinion one of his best. It tells the heartwarming tale of Cornelius van Baerle who lives purely to try and cultivate the rare and wonderous black tulip. However when Cornelius' godfather is asassinated he, without knowing it, enters a dangerous game of cat and mouse with his jealous neighbour (and tulip fancier) Issac Boxtel who has seen Cornelius being given a letter by his godfather. To this end Cornelius is jailed whereupon he falls in love with Rosa, the beautiful daughter of his jailer. Rosa aids Cornelius to cultivate his tulip inside the jail and they eventually succeed only to have it cruely stolen by Boxtel. I wont ruin the ending by telling you what happens, suffice to say I feel that for the first time in his writing career Dumas wrote a &quot;Happy ever after&quot; ending which irritated me to some extent. I do love this book and it earns its place alongside Dumas' great novels, my main reason for loving it so much is its final lines, it is one of the greatest pieces of philosophy I have ever heard, but it is important to read the book to fully understand its meaning, I know it so well that I can reel it off the top of my head thus, &quot; ... he wrote above his door these lines that Grotius had carved on the wall of his prison on the day of his escape: &quot;Sometimes one has suffered enough to have the right never to say: I am too happy&quot;To me these words have a beautiful resonance that is not only lovely to think of but accurate as well, I feel that anyone who reads this book and fails to be moved, if by nothing else by the bathos of the denoument, then they have ultimately failed to appreciate the true beauty and skill of one of the finest novelists to ever pick up a writing implement. This book is a thing of beauty, perhaps the tulip itself is a simple microcosm of the book, to start off it appears to be nothing special, but in the hands of someone who is aware of its true worth it is as priceless as the world itself."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"In &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;, Alexandre Dumas proves again his ability to mix adventure and romance to create an exciting and romantic tale. Although Dumas may have distorted history significantly in this story, the image of late 17th century Holland which he presents is accurate and vivid enough to give the reader a lasting impression of society and culture in this period.The execution of Jann and Cornelius De Witte and the romance between Van Baerle and Rosa are portrayed with such detail that readers are not likely to forget this book. I strongly recommend this tale to any who love adventure, history and romance."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"I would recommend buying this book *now* while it's still free. It would certainly be worth the $1.99 list price, but free is even better.If you've read any of Dumas' other novels you'll probably like this one. It begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence. Writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because I don't want to give too much away but I do want to encourage fans of Dumas' other works, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one.The characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character. Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much.

The beginning of the novel is interesting but a little dense and readers may get discouraged, especially as the sentences are fairly complex. However it gets much easier and flows much quicker when the story picks up with the introduction of Van Baerle and his neighbor. I encourage you to keep reading if you are interested in its following key points:-- The characters are incredibly believable and have developed personalities that are realistically complex.-- The depiction of tragedy, justice, despair are noteworthy.-- The story is rich and flows smoothly.-- It's an interesting look at the past, especially the politics and the references to the tulip-craze of Europe some hundreds of years ago. Even though it has fictional elements it still feels like you're holding a slice of the past in your hand.-- I've always hated romances, but the love in this story is carefully drawn with a subtle touch and depicted with realism. Genuinely entertaining.-- It's depiction of the ways that popular opinion can be swayed and deceived by politics, nationalism, and patriotism is chilling.-- It simultaneously shows us human nobility and human pettiness.When I first picked up this book I didn't expect much. When I finished it I realized how much the impression it made lasts with me."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"This is a wonderful story about the 'tulipmania' of the 1600's and also a staggering look at the violence and chaos of the time. It's central character is young Doctor Cornelius Van Baerle, who is as happy as can be in his own little world of growing tulips and inventing new colors for the flower. He thinks himself void of all enemies, but of course, we know better. There is then an announcement that says that anyone who invents the Black Tulip first, wins a huge monetary award and the recognition the new flower will bring to the winner. This sends all tulips-fanciers everywhere into frantic competiton to see who can grow the Grand Black Tulip. Then, as Cornelius finally perfects his Black Tulip, he is suddenly arrested and sentenced to be executed as an accomplice to the 'traitors' John and Cornelius De Witte. I thought this story was very exciting and though you might think a story that focuses on a flower is strange, if anything, it adds to the charm. There are very interesing characters who are clever and endearing, and whom you care about.

There are no lords and ladies, no swashbuckling heros, no evil cardinals or Miladys -- nothing but a darn good yarn, and a very sweet love story.Dumas is just brilliant (as always) and his dialogue (as always) is among the finest I've ever come across. A very quick, albeit enjoyable, read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"Not everyone could do it. In fact, almost no one else that I could think of, could construct a story about a gardener whose main passion in life is to grow a new variety of tulip, and turn it into a compelling, intrigue-filled, heroic romance. But Dumas does, here.Certainly, Dumas shines in his more famous novels, like The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo, giants of hundreds and hundreds of pages (thousands if you consider the entire Musketeer cycle), repleat with swashbuckling, conspiracy, murder and ladies-fair. It is therefore understandable that some of his audience might be put off by The Black Tulip, which is a scant 200 and some pages, and has its hero in jail for most of the novel, struggling to grow a flower by proxy. But really, the lesson is how great Alexandre Dumas is, because The Black Tulip manages to be just as rewarding (and at times, as thrilling) as his more renowned epics. Also, Dumas here shows some of his versatility and his incredible understanding of humanity, in the lovers conversations between Cornelius and Rosa, and in his rye, good-natured and subtle observations that, really, concentrating on tulip-growing, as opposed to warfare or violence, is a sign of greatness, not of mediocrity.You can't come to The Black Tulip looking for precisely the same things you'd seek in Dumas' other winners, but if you're looking for a wonderful little story, almost perfectly told, you're in the right place. With this tale, Dumas takes his place as my favorite author, of all time."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"Having read two of Dumas' longer novels, I was anxious to read one of his shorter ones.To keep it shorter, there are fewer characters, and therefore the interaction between them is more frequent and intense. The Black Tulip is also a great glimpse into the world of flowers in Holland. Many have heard of the tulip frenzy. This book gives a glimpse of it and what it drove men to do.Also, there is the forbidden romance between two that should really have no contact at all between themselves. Dumas weaves their tale, and their emotional stress in a very believable manner.This is Dumas' most famous novel, and one of his shortest. At 200 or so pages it is a fast read full of intrigue and twists. If you like drama with historical footnotes interwoven, then you will enjoy this book.EJ"},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"I was introduced to Alexandre Dumas' Black Tulip in the 1950s via the Classics Comics adaptation. A few years later, I read an English translation of the novel, which may or may not have been complete. One current paperback edition says with honesty that they have chosen to reprint an abridged translation. But Penguin gives it to us complete, in the translation of Robin Buss.Buss restores passages that others have omitted, such as a two-page description of the city of Haarlem in Chapter 31. Although he tries to give us a complete, authentic text, he does introduce modern colloquialisms. One translation says that Boxtel \\"scolded\\" Rosa's father. Buss's says that \\"he told him off.\\" This may be anachronistic, but it does add to the effect and does not compromise the author's intentions. Unfortunately, I do not have access to the original French text at this time.I usually have to read novels in English, either original or a translation. I seek out complete, unabridged editions.

His greatest work is The Three Musketeers followed closely by The Count of Monte Cristo and countless other works. One of his last great novels is \\"The Black Tulip\\" of 1850. In this short, tense and excciting novel we learn much about Holland, tulips and the power of love.The novel is set in the seventeenth century when Holland was in chaos due to the war between the Republicans and supporters of the House of Orange. The de Wette brothers are executed by a mob of Orangemen. Cornelius the namesake of Cornelius de Wette and his godson is accused of being in league with the De Wette brothers (accused of being in cahoots with the French enemies of the Dutch Republic). He is a naive, intellectual doctor who has no interest in politics preferring, like Voltaire, to tend his garden at home!. Tulipmania was rife in seventeenth century Holland. His next door neighbor an evil man named Boxel is envious of Cornelius' ability to grow prize winning tulips. He turns him over to the authorities claming he is a traitor who received secret letters from the recently murdered De Wette brothers. Cornelius is condemned to death as a traitor to the Dutch Republic.Cornelius has his head placed on the executioner's block but is reprieved at the last minute by William the new ruler of Holland. He is imprisoned quickly falling in love with Rose a young Frisian girl whose father is the notorious jailor Gryphun. He and rose seek to grow a pure black tulip which will, hopefully, win them $100,000in prize money at the great Haarlem flower fair.After a series of adventures the brave Rose wins a pardon for Cornelius. The couple are wed. The evil Boxel diesand all is well. The novel is reminiscent of a fairy tale story where good is rewarded and evil is punished.The Black Tulip is a short novel of 200 pages. It is exciting as we read to see what will develop with Rose and Cornelius as they grow the tulip and fall in love. At one juncture, Rose is angry at Cornelius for loving the tulip more than he does her! This lover's quarrel ends happily as the joyous couple receive the award for their amazing black tulip and triumph over adversity. Rose and Cornelius are both loving characters for whom we care and hope for as the pages are rapidly turned leaving us on the edge of our seats!Alexandre Dumas was a deft author of countless adventures and intriguing political tales which will always be enjoyed for their romanticism, suspense and pure escapism.

I read a novel on Alexandre Dumas called The King of Paris. This novel claims he was often accused of publishing other people's works. He did this just to get them published under the Dumas name. However, this book called The Black Tulip was written by no one other than Dumas. The Dumas' were decendants of French Huguenots as were the DeWitt(e)s. Many persecuted Calvinist families fled France to the low countries (Holland). Dumas' interest in my ancestry compelled him to write a historical novel using true events. It is said that this was not a case where Catholics persecuted the Protestants, but two Calvinist parties in a conflict. The House of Orange fought to remain under monarchy rule while the DeWitts fought to advocate a free republic. It is also said that the man accused of causing this rioting mob, was later paid a royal pension. We DeWitts dropped the e, it was silent anyways. Our reunions claim a common ancestor named Tjerck C. DeWitt was a first cousin to Johan and Cornelious. Tjerck's father was Nicholas and he had a brother Jacob. Jacob was the father of the two brother DeWitts hacked to pieces in August of 1672. Now, the French Philosopher Voltaire used the two brother DeWitts in his writings. Once in explaining a doctorine of Hell. Perhaps Dumas, the ornry cus, was simply trying to outdo Voltaire. Mr. Dumas was a great philosopher, protestant and man to me."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"The sentences in the beginning of the book are very long. So long that you might lose track of what it is that you're reading ;). However, if you look past that and keep reading I'm sure that you'll find that it really does get better. The only bone I have to pick is with the love interest Rosa. She is a rather weak female character if you ask me. She's got the whole swooning thing going on, and while I realize that this book was written a century before a Women's Rights Movement, I'm still annoyed that women's characters were either conniving and murderous or swoony and stupid.

The story revolves around Cornelius who is forced to choose between which is more important to him: his love of tulips; or the love of Rosa, a simple peasant girl who befriended him in prison.That's it.Now, I can easily understand how, due to cultural differences, the cultivation of Tulips might have been a more significant part of seventeenth century life than it is today, but even so, its a pretty bland topic. Yeah, if the only other choice you're presented with is the new John Grisham best-seller and you're faced with a two-hour layover in National Airport, this book will definately hold its own -- but I don't think there's enough plot in the book to maintain a even a low-budget Movie-of-the-Week on TBS."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"I love Dumas.

I could not imagine a black flower. Later I had an opportunity to spend time in Holland and fell in love with tulips. So, when Alexandre Dumas was the selected author for a reading group I chose The Black Tulip since I knew most people would gravitate toward his more well known work. I was sorely disappointed.The Black Tulip contains components that typically I find enthralling. The story begins with the historical event of a lynch mob killing Cornelius and Johan DeWitt for reportedly colluding to have William, the Prince of Orange, assassinated. Cornelius' godson, Cornelius van Braele, is arrested as a conspirator. The evidence against van Braele is given by his jealous next door neighbor who does not want van Braele to succeed in producing a prized black tulip for which a hefty award has been promised by the Horticulture Society of Haarlem.Why did I rank it so low? While it is a real struggle to get past the first four chapters, I prefer the beginning to the rest of the book. I found the majority of the story to be simplistic and superficial with two-dimensional characters. Secondly, there was an abundance of historical inaccuracies. I was not as hard on this book as I usually am with respect to inaccuracies because I understand that research was much more arduous at this time and the translators do a decent job of pointing out the inaccuracies in the notes.

Dumas has an informal, naive style that would never pass muster if used in a novel today, but which I suppose was standard fare in those days. I found it all very charming."},{"Title":"The black tulip (Historical romances)","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Oh its an okay read, but its also very short. Not what I was expecting, especially for the price. As to the book itself, all in all I still liked it. It's a bit boring in places and the adventure is almost null. I love Dumas though, and I am a huge fan of the Count of Monte Cristo. It is my favorite book by him. As an FYI, the followup stories to the Count of Monte Cristo written by the \\"Holy Ghost Writer\\" are also good reads. Even better, they appear to be written in the same general style as Dumas' original. I have read both \\"The Sultan of Monte Cristo\\" (Book II) and \\"That Girl Started Her Own Country\\" (Book III). As for the price, I thought it was a good value for the Kindle Editions.

At the time Browne's book was first published, gold and silver were laughingstock as investments, and so was anyone who bought them. Thirty years later, we're right back to an instant replay of the Seventies. A long war, government printing money with abandon, stocks taking a beating but equity cheerleaders assuring us we won't have a ten- or fifteen-year bear market again. Browne's book is well-written, but you can save youself the money nowadays by just entering the words 'gold bull market' in your favorite Internet search engine. Paper assets go out of fashion every twenty-five to thirty years, and when they do, gold and silver do spectacularly well. That, in a nutshell, is how to profit from the coming devaluation of the U.S. dollar; sell your dollars for gold and silver, then sit tight and wait. Don't bother telling anyone, you'll just be ridiculed first and reviled later. Just like those who cleaned up by following Browne's counterculture advice when this book was on the bestseller lists in the Disco era."},{"Title":"How you can profit from the coming devaluation","review":"I've been a good student, good in Math, the sciences, including economics, and other academic subjects.

Somewhere in this book he says, &quot;The government is the counterfeiter&quot;. I had to think and think for a while about what Harry Browne wrote in this book before I really - I mean REALLY - began to understand what inflation is (and I'm supposed to be intelligent). It's one of those things - you don't know that you don't understand, until you do understand. It's like those weird 3D pictures, you don't see them until you see them, and then WOW!

It is not outdated!! The first half may be more relevant today than ever. If you want a clear understanding of inflation, fractional reserve banking, how money is really created and much more, then this book is for you. It's an easy read, no technical jargon and the author is a great communicator. There are plenty of concrete examples to clarify his major points. The second half of the book suggests how to cope with the financial chaos in the coming years. This is 1970's advice. Some information is still relevant today, some not so much. I found it interesting. Bottom line, it's one of the best explanations of modern day banking available anywhere and it's available at great prices. Even if you only have a modest interest in the topic, do yourself a favor, get the book. Read the first half, you will have a unsettling understanding of modern banking and finances. You may not sleep as well at night but your money decisions will certainly be more informed.

I wasn't so much impressed with the originality of the ideas; however, the organization and simplicity with which the ideas are presented is superb. There are sections on sharing/caring, pretend play, helping, things that go, feelings, creative fun, nature and science. Each activity page includes a list of things you'll need, steps for setting up and participating in the activity and what your child is working on developmentally by doing the activity; extra tips are included on many pages, as well. A helpful list of household things to save (instead of throwing out) for use in play activities is also included in the back of the book. This is a great book, and although we've only tried a few of the many activities so far, my kids and I really like this book."},{"Title":"Mister Rogers' Playtime","review":"I found it quite simplistic.

I grew up in South Baton Rouge, and this is the real deal. I went to school at McKinley Middle and walked from \\"the Bottom'' to my house everday from McKinley High School. The shady characters are everywhere as the book accurately portrays. Jared is the kind of kid who is not going to be a product of his environment. In other words, just because he lives in the ghetto, doesn't mean he has to adopt a ghetto mentality. He's forced to grow up very fast, without the kinds of role models one would hope for a child in his circumstances. But at every turn -- and there are a lot of them -- Jared finds a way to rise above the chaos and make good decisions despite the efforts of others to drag him down with them. This book lives and breathes what it's like to live in this area of the world. No matter how good your intentions, someone will try to take you off course. Good lessons for kids all over. I understand some high school students are reading it and going on tours of \\"the Bottom.'' Every middle-class kid who thinks they have it bad ought to get on the bus and see what this place is like. I think a lot of them will feel instantly grateful for whatever they complain about.

I hope to purchase more in the series."},{"Title":"Individualism and Economic Order","review":"Individualism and Economic Order contains several classic essays. Chapter two (Economics and Knowledge) examines decentralized economic planning by individuals. Plan coordination among individuals requires each to form plans that contain relevant data from the plans of others. We each acquire this data through competition in markets. Every time someone adjusts their plans, others must also change their plans. So, initial plan coordination requires each to fully anticipate the actions of others. Since this is impossible, order will emerge as a result of successive trials by individuals in markets. The price system enables individuals to adjust their plans with each other through time. This is the foundation of Hayek's theories of spontaneous order and social evolution. Hayek was far ahead of his peers in examining expectations formation.Chapter four (The Use of Knowledge in Society) is another classic. Hayek contends that the economic problem is really one how to make use of fragmented and widely dispersed data. As he indicated in chapter two, full knowledge of economic conditions reduces the economic problem to one of pure logic. Markets increase our ability to take advantage of division of labor and capital formation by extending the span of our utilization of resources beyond the span of any individual mind. The price system in markets does this by acting as a communications network. We can then each dispense with the need for conscious control over resources and rely on our own intimate knowledge of local economic conditions, and price information regarding general economic conditions. This proves that decentralized competitive systems will vastly outperform centrally planned systems.Chapter five looks at the process of competition. Data regarding the least cost methods of satisfying consumer demand comes through the process of competition. The notion of competition as an end state, where we have attained perfect resource allocation, overlooks the importance of the actual processes by which market participants actually compete. Competition is a process of forming opinions and spreading information. It informs us regarding which alternatives are best and cheapest. Those who judge actual market outcomes with theoretical models that assume perfect information are putting the cart before the horse. Competition is the only means by which we can each acquire data on general economic conditions. Governmental bureaucrats do not simply know what the final outcomes of competition are supposed to be. This data is particular to the process of competition itself. We should therefore be wary of those who complain that markets do not deliver perfect competition based on perfect information. Markets are our best source on the data in question, albeit an imperfect one.In chapter seven Hayek lays out the arguments that some make in favor of Socialism. Some claim that greater equality in incomes is worth the loss of efficiency that is inherent to Socialism. Others want to maintain some degree of free choice- consumer and occupational choice. Yet others want to restrict even these areas of personal choice. Socialists face a problem in trying to show how socialist planners could plan production in terms of satisfying consumer desires, without market prices. The labor theory of value did not explain actual behavior, but was instead an \\"a search after some illusory substance of value. Since we lack objective measures of the importance of the needs of different individuals, central planners face \\"a task which far exceeds the powers of individual men\\". In chapter eight Hayek points to specific informational problems that Socialist planners face. Of course, he deals with information in earlier chapters. But this chapter leads into the next. Chapter nine deals with proposals to simulate market competition under socialism. Hayek mentions that even if central planners have full knowledge of economic conditions, the calculations concerning the allocation of all resources is too difficult to perform. After dealing with the absurd notion of full information, Hayek turns to three issues. First, Socialists once aimed at overcoming the results of markets. Now they accept the results of market competition as a standard to aim at. Second, an omniscient and omnipresent dictator would also require omnipotence to plan an economy using their omniscience. Even if they had omniscience, the central planners would still have to work through an imperfect bureaucracy. So the notion of omnipotence is absurd. We must look at the actual bureaucratic problems that planners will face. Third, Perhaps, in a world of unchanging data Socialist planners could arrive at efficient prices for the means of production through trial and error. But, with changing data, the plans of the authority will never match the decisions of the 'man on the spot'. Hayek discusses incentive problems and knowledge problems at length, and also mentions the potential for abuse by concentrating power into the hands a few. This is the subject of his book \\"The Road to Serfdom\\".The other chapters are not what I would call classics, but are generally of a high quality. Chapter eleven deals with an aspect of trade cycle theory. Chapter six (Free Enterprise and Competitive Order) deals with the limits of market and government and the influence of ideas. This is not Hayek's best effort in explaining these matters. Chapter one (Individualism, True and False) is much better. It discusses the drive to control individual action based on alleged notions of reason. True individualism requires humility towards the processes by which societal order emerges, not as a result of deliberate planning by any particular individual, but as an unintended consequence of self-serving individual interaction.These are ideas that far too few appreciate. This book is key to understanding the way Hayek thought about social problems in general. The chapters might seem disjointed in the table of contents, but they have much in common. Anyone serious about understanding how society works should read this book, especially if they tend to disagree with the author's pro free market stance. Hayek is one of the worthiest opponents that Socialists face, and this book is one of his best."},{"Title":"Individualism and Economic Order","review":"F.A. Hayek, well-deserved recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, 1976, wrote several other deep books on political economy. This book is about how individuals are better decision-makers when it comes to their own lives, and that a &quot;Committee&quot; of &quot;Planners&quot; cannot possibly do a better job (How can you tell that someone else is happy? What they need? What they want?). It is no accident that countries with relative freedom on economics are more productive and wealthier overall (US/Hong Kong) than countries with little or no economic freedom (India/sub-Sahara Africa) and lots of gov't planning. It can't be mere exploitation or culture, as India has the largest middle-class and a great population of educated people. India has more college-degree persons than the US, yet is significantly poorer. Hayek investigates this. A good book, especially for leftists and right-wing oligarchs. I used to be a commie too, but open your mind and put the rhetoric on hold, just for a moment."},{"Title":"Individualism and Economic Order","review":"own this book, please, if only for the essay &quot;the use of knowledge in society&quot;. in a few short pages, hayek explores how to think about how people use and spread knowledge, and how that affects everyday economic behavior."},{"Title":"Individualism and Economic Order","review":"Hayek was one of the most important economists and social philosophers of the 20th century. This book contains his most important papers (the first five papers of the book, where he starts to build a new social and economic theory), with were perhaps the most important economic articles of the 20th century (yes, I am serious about this claim).Even today, most economists are under equipped to deal with the problems that these papers grabbed and even solved about seven decades ago. Many of the fundamental problems of modern macroeconomics come from a lack of understanding of what Hayek already knew in the 40's, that macroeconomic problems are the result of intertemporal discoordination of production plans with consumption plans. While his paper on the meaning of competition makes the modern take on the theory of competition and industrial organization naive and immature by comparison: Most modern authors simply doesn't understand what economic competition is. Hayek shows what competition is all about and integrates the economics of information with it. As with industrial organization, the modern approach on information, mechanism design and games with imperfect information is inferior and unsatisfactory if compared to Hayek's treatment of these same problems, with he does in this book in a few dozen pages.Hayek goes straight to the point and reveals to the reader what are the real problems of economics and what economics is supposed to do: Explain why individuals, acting in their 'little worlds' (their problem sets, or means/ends frameworks), produce social orders beyond their conscious design. That task was already set by Adam Smith in a crude form more than 200 years ago, Hayek sets the problem in its definitive form. The market is a process of competition between individuals that produces tendencies to integrate the knowledge discovered by millions of minds into a consistent set of action plans, this integration is brought by the price system and it is competition the process that produces the knowledge that the prices transmit.If you wish to know about why Hayek is the most important classical liberal social scientist in the 20th century (well, I would say: THE most important social scientist), you must read this. If you want to know what's really behind the modern libertarian positions, you must be familiar with these papers. If you want to know what Austrian economics really is about, you must read this book.

However, does that necessarily mean it's all that great???It is highly informative and fairly accurate. However, the book is tainted with linguacentric opinions laced here and there that do not help to educate and enlighten students to the inherent equality of all languages and dialects. A pity!..."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"I bought \\"A History of the English Language\\" looking for a dependable history of the English language that could be read by a beginner in Linguistics. In this book I found exactly what I wanted.\\"A History\\" presents English's long, complicated development in a fascinating and accessible way. Although the text is dense and somewhat slow, it is never boring. The writers are clearly very passionate about the subject, and although the book is fifty years old it is well-updated, including a new chapter on African-American English.In fact, few books have taught me more than \\"A History.\\" England's numerous migrations and occupations, by the Romans, the Normans, the Scandinavians, and the French, shaped the language, so I learned much about England's own history. I found the first chapter, about the Indo-European language and its influence, especially edifying. \\"A History\\" also briefs you on the European intellectual movements that influenced English. In explaining English's development, Baugh and Cable acquaint the reader with many linguistic terms and theories.This readable, informative, comprehensive history of English is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"For anyone interested in the English language, and anyone curious about it, I strongly recommend this major book. Of course, get the latest edition, mine is the fifth, that is the 2002 edition.As to the book itself, it's a most complete study of English. It does a wonderful job of explaining the development in history of the language and it willl undoubtedly shed so much light on your understanding of English that it's really worth a peek. That book will make clear most of the strangeness of English; if you ever wondered about \\"irregular\\" verbs--as most non-native do--you will find the answer in this book. And there's more than just English alone, the book also deals with Indo-European and tells a lot about tons of other things that make the whole thing--the development of languages--much clearer to the reader.That is the book most used by universities as far as the history of English is concerned. You don't need to be a specialised linguist to read it, by the way; even though, due to the extreme preciseness of the work, you may not remember most of the details put in there. I'm thinking mostly of historical details and such, but that shouldn't worry you, just know it's very well documented.The book is divided into sections, most of which are chronologically placed, although not all; there's for instance a section about English in America.That's about it for my review of this great book. The best thing you can do is check it for yourself, but I strongly recommend it. Even if you have no specific interest in linguistics and stuff, you'll still get a lot of enjoyement from reading this book, if only because you speak English. It's gonna be a hoot for you I assure. Go for it!"},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"I,like another reviewer, read this book over 20 years ago for a college class when I was a major in Linguistics. I was so enthralled with it, that it still graces my library shelves today. The cultural and social impact which brought change and foreign languages into English was just fascinating and very well written. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago. It was a textbook for a graduate course, The History of the English language, Of course, I cannot make very specific remarks about something that I read so long ago, but I can state that I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was complete, well documented, and utterly fascinating! It enabled me to understand so much more about how people speak and think, how language changes, and how it stays the same."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"Firstly, I own the first edition of this book, and although some of the items have surely changed between that edition and the current edition, most of the information will surely hold true between the versions.On a whim I took this book on vacation to read. I am about half way through the book, but I feel that my comments can be applied to the whole book. I am studying my bachelor's degree in English, and have also taken a language course which focused on the history of the English language. This book compliments my field of study nicely. The book consists of 10 or 12 chapters which focus on broad topics (for instance Middle English, The Norman Conquest, etc). Each chapter is divided further into several subsections, which focus on important events which occured during these periods of history, which played a role in changing how English was written, spoken, perceived, etc. In this way, the book is very organized. If one is short for time, he or she can easily skip around and read the sections of the book which interest him or her. However, the information is also easily read in chronological order, and provides much information on the English language.I only have two problems with this fine book. The first problem is that sometimes expressions will be referenced in French, and no English translations are provided. As a student of English, German and Dutch, these references do not help me at all, as I cannot understand them (I guess some of the English felt this way too, when French was being spoken in the courts of England!) However, this complaint is very minor and hinders my comprehension very little.The larger complaint I have is that this book is sort of boring. The information contained within the book is great, and is more detailed than some other books I have read on the subject. However, because the book does not seem to be geared towards the general public and rather towards the student, the book can be a bit boring at times, even if the information contained is interesting and informative.For a non student or a layman, I suggest that one begins his or her study of the English language by reading \\"The Story of English\\" as this book reads a lot faster and is simpler to understand. When finished with that book, \\"History of the English Language\\" makes a good follow up book, reinforcing the information provided in the first, and also providing more details. Overall, this is a good book which I suggest students and scholars of English read."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"After decades of use in both undergraduate and graduate classes, Baugh's masterwork is still the best introduction to our language for the serious student (or the discerning teacher). Buy it."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"This excellent work, now in its 6th edition, is the standard text for many Australian University students studying what they thought was English, but it has now, at some Universities at least , been converted to a History subject at Masters level.It is such an authoritative work that merely commenting on it seems superfluous: if you really want to understand hos the English language came about, was influenced by he Romans in Britain, and was then subjected to a long series of change brought about as a result of much pillage and plunder by Angles, Saxons, Vikings, Norse as well as the underlying Celtic traditions.With the Norman conquest in 1066 there was wrought another fundamental change and one where the common man spoke a different language from the Norman aristocracy. Indeed, Henry V was the first English king to make use of the rude language that was still forming, that we now call the English language.Bt that language had still several variations to overcome, America, Canada, Australia and India added to the words used and thus influenced the development o the language we have today.The book also sets out some parameters for future change in the language.A fascinating book for any student of the English language to read as well as a well established textbook, this book comes highly recommended, at least by me."},{"Title":"A history of the English language","review":"I was familiar with this book before I bought it as it was a text when I studied English at University many decades ago. Despite the time lapse, the book retains its top ranking in the area in which I am interested. The copy that I purchased was at a very good price; it was delivered long before the promised date, quite an achievement when it has to travel to Australia. The book was in fine order except - and this is a significant disappointment - a few poems that are printed as examples of Middle English dialects, are heavily underlined in places with a dark blue pen. Overall, however, I am very pleased with my purchase."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const D=d(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-8afcbb39"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/28.md","filePath":"quotesmag/28.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/28.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(D)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
